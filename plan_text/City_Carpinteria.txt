Introduction
The Carpinteria General Plan and Local Coastal Plan (hereafter
referred to together as the “General Plan”) is the primary planning
policy document for the city. It represents the community’s
collective vision for preserving and improving the quality of life in
the Carpinteria Valley.
Carpinterians have a strong sense of identity with a rich and colorful
history. The fertile soils of the Carpinteria Valley and its safe and
scenic coastline have provided ideal living conditions for thousands
of years. The relative isolation of Carpinteria has enabled it to
remain one of the last small, rural southern California coastal
communities. It is the community’s desire to maintain its small
beach-town lifestyle while accommodating an appropriate balance of
economic vibrancy.
The goal of the community is:
…to preserve the essential character of our small beach town, its family-oriented
residential neighborhoods, its unique visual and natural resources and its open,
rural surroundings while enhancing recreational, cultural and economic
opportunities for our citizens.
The goal of the community is the heart of the General Plan. The
content of the General Plan is arranged to achieve the community
goal.
CONTENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN
State Planning and Zoning Law requires each city to adopt a
comprehensive, long-term General Plan for the physical
development of a city and any land outside its boundaries which, in
its judgment, bears relation to its planning (i.e., sphere of interest).
The General Plan is required to contain the following seven
elements: Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Conservation, Open
Space, Noise and Safety. The General Plan may combine related
elements, as is the case with the Open Space, Recreation &
Conservation Element. It may also include desired optional
elements, as is the case with the Community Design Element and
Public Facilities & Services Element.
The Carpinteria General Plan elements are summarized as follows:
Land Use. The Land Use Element designates various land uses in
the city and identifies the recommended population density for each
land use category. The Land Use Element also provides an analysis
                                                                                                                                    1

                                                 Community Design. The Community Design Element identifies
                                                 key design characteristics of the community and establishes standards
                                                 and policies to ensure that future development incorporates and
                                                 reinforces those attributes.
                                                 Circulation. The Circulation Element describes the existing
                                                 transportation network and how future transportation needs
                                                 (roadways that support land uses described in the Land Use Element)
                                                 can be accommodated. Provisions for the use of alternative modes
                                                 of transportation, including bicycle and pedestrian circulation plans,
                                                 are also included in the Circulation Element.
                                                 Housing. The City’s Housing Element (adopted in 1995, available
                                                 under separate cover) identifies community-housing needs and
                                                 describes how safe, affordable housing can be provided and
                                                 maintained for city residents. The Housing Element requires State
                                                 review and must be updated every five years.
                                                 Open Space, Recreation & Conservation. This combined
                                                 element describes community open space, recreation and natural
                                                 resources that the city manages or desires to preserve. These
                                                 resources include: natural open space areas, outdoor recreation areas,
                                                 water (groundwater and water courses), habitats, plant and animal
                                                 life, agricultural land, scenic and cultural resources, and management
                                                 of open space for public health and safety.
                                                 Safety. The Safety Element identifies known public safety hazards.
                                                 These include seismic and other geologic hazards, flood hazards, and
                                                 slope stability, as well as soil and fire hazards.
                                                 Noise. The Noise Element describes existing and projected noise
                                                 environments for the city and establishes noise level standards and
                                                 policies to protect residents from exposure to excessive noise.
                                                 Public Facilities & Services. The Public Facilities & Services
                                                 Element identifies various public and private facilities and services
                                                 currently provided to the community and how these relate to future
                                                 needs.
                                                 GENERAL PLAN ORGANIZATION
                                                 The Carpinteria General Plan is organized into eight elements that
                                                 address required and optional topics. Each element includes a
                                                 general discussion, identifies relevant issues, and provides objectives
                                                 and policies to address these issues. Implementation policies are
                                                 identified to provide direction for carrying out each element’s
                                                 objectives.

                                                                                                              Introduction
An objective is a policy articulating a specific future end, condition,
or state related to the public health, safety and welfare toward which
planning and planning implementation is directed. A policy is a
statement that guides decision-making and indicates a clear
commitment of the local legislative body. An implementation policy
is a policy that provides direction for carrying out a related General
Plan/Land Use Plan policy.
All of the General Plan elements are interrelated. Use and
interpretation of the General Plan as a whole (and of each element)
depends on how it applies to various community needs and issues.
Pertinent sections from the California Government Code and the
Coastal Act are provided in the sidebar of each element.
Photographs of related subjects are also included in the sidebar to
provide examples of items described in the text.
An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required to examine the
environmental effects of the proposed plan. The General Plan
incorporates the environmental review within each element instead
of in a separate document. This can be found in each element
(except the Land Use Element) in a shaded box entitled
“Environmental Consequences” located at the end of each section
on element policies. The environmental review and other required
environmental documentation for the Land Use Element can be
found in Appendices attached to the General Plan.
Local Coastal Land Use Plan. This General Plan is designed to be
consistent with the California Coastal Act and provides the Land Use
Plan and related policies for the various implementation programs
such as the zoning ordinance. This Land Use Plan, together with the
implementation programs makeup the City’s Local Coastal Program.
(California Coastal Act of 1976 §§ 30108.6, 30500)
All objectives, policies, implementation policies, and map
language identified within this document are intended to       GP
address Coastal Act issues, unless identified with the
“GP” symbol shown at right. Policies and language identified with
the “GP” symbol are excluded from the Land Use Plan, but are
included in the General Plan.
Public access policies are identified in Appendix I, in accordance with
§13552 (b) of the California Code of Regulations.
GENERAL PLAN PROCESS
The City of Carpinteria is updating its General Plan to better
integrate the documents that govern the City’s planning. These
include:
                                                                                                                           3

City of Carpinteria General Plan and Local Coastal Plan
Introduction
                                                      •   Coastal Plan adopted January 1980 (and subsequent minor
                                                          amendments);
                                                      •   General Plan adopted April 1986 (including Environmental
                                                          Resources Element, Health and Safety Hazards Element,
                                                          Land Use and Community Development Element, and
                                                          Master Environmental Impact Report);
                                                 The General Plan reflects the shared vision of the community’s
                                                 future. In 1996 the City undertook a greater effort to determine the
                                                 community vision through direct input from a cross-section of
                                                 residents representing the interests of all segments of the community.
                                                 The two primary components of public participation in the General
                                                 Plan process included the “visioning process” and direction from the
                                                 General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC).
                                                 The visioning process brought together citizens from various
                                                 disciplines and backgrounds to develop a community vision for their
                                                 future. The visioning process began with a series of community
                                                 workshops in September 1996. Approximately 100 Carpinteria
                                                 Valley residents and business representatives participated in
                                                 preparing the visioning report over the course of the following year.
                                                 The result of this process was the preparation of a report entitled
                                                 “Vision 2020.” On December 8, 1997 the report was presented to
                                                 the city Council.       It included an overall vision statement
                                                 (“Carpinteria in the Year 2020”) and identified planning issues related
                                                 to the General Plan, as well as specific goals and strategies.
                                                 The GPAC included Planning Commissioners, City Council
                                                 members, Planning staff and members of the general public. GPAC
                                                 was appointed by the City Council on January 7, 1997. GPAC
                                                 subcommittees were formed to provide focused guidance regarding
                                                 the individual plan elements. Information from Vision 2020 and
                                                 direction from GPAC were used to formulate the General Plan.
                                                 GPAC members subsequently reviewed the final hearing of the
                                                 General Plan.
                                                 The GPAC meetings were open to the public and conducted
                                                 according to the State Open Meetings Law-Brown Act requirements.
                                                 The public (beyond the representation of the GPAC members
                                                 themselves) provided minimal input during the technical meetings
                                                 held to prepare the General Plan element by element.
                                                 The initial public hearing and environmental review was completed
                                                 in July of 1998. Community-wide workshops and public hearings
                                                 were held during August and September of 1998 to allow for public

Land Use Element
INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element establishes the type and intensity of land uses
and guides growth and development. Environmental impacts
associated with the Land Use Element are found in Appendix B.
The Land Use Element is the heart of the Land Use Plan of the city’s
Local Coastal Program (California Coastal Act of 1976, §30108.5);
however, all other elements of this General Plan are also included as
components of the Land Use Plan for the purposes of the Local                 California Coastal Act §30108.05

         neighborhoods, its unique visual and natural
         resources and its open, rural surroundings while
         enhancing recreational, cultural and economic
         opportunities for our citizens.
The vision for the city includes qualities the community would like to
retain, and aspects that could benefit from change. The city and
surrounding area enjoy a variety of attractive natural resources
including safe, clean beaches, coastal bluffs, a salt marsh, several
creeks, a narrow valley, and a coastal mountain range. The city
includes a small downtown area, a variety of other commercial
developments, businesses and industries that provide a range of jobs
and economic opportunities, and a housing base with a mix of single
family, multi-family and mobile homes.
Through the Vision 2020 public participation process for this
General Plan/Local Coastal Plan update, the community expressed
general satisfaction with the existing land use plan. The city is
approaching its theoretical buildout under the plan, which reflects
established neighborhood, district, corridor and open space patterns
as well as identified coastal resource protection and enhancement
needs.
The community prefers maintaining the city’s character by
encouraging a similar quality for new development and limiting those
uses of greater density and intensity to areas along the main
transportation corridors. The community wishes to encourage
development that is compatible with surrounding land uses and

                                                 portion of the Carpinteria Valley. It is clear that additional
                                                 government intervention is necessary to prevent affordable housing
                                                 from lagging further behind job growth valley-wide.

                                                 of the agricultural and hospitality industries in the Carpinteria Valley. However,
                                                 affordable housing available in the Valley has long been outpaced by the jobs

                                                 5. Boundary Changes
                                                 The California Coastal Act of 1976 and the subsequent certification
                                                 of the city’s Local Coastal Program in 1981 have resulted in a
                                                 significant change in how the city views its existing and future
                                                 boundaries. The State Coastal Zone established through the Coastal
                                                 Act includes all of the city and the unincorporated Carpinteria Valley.
                                                 Historically, the community’s response to growth pressure had been
                                                 to expand. During the 1950s-70s the urbanized area of Carpinteria
                                                 grew largely outward consuming agricultural land.                            From
                                                 incorporation in 1965 until 1981, the Local Agency Formation
                                                 Commission approved more than 20 annexations to the city, many
                                                 involving conversion of agricultural land to uses such as residential

                                                 trends, today it is viewed as a rigid line with few exceptions, set for

                                                 2 The Urban/Rural Boundary is defined as:
                                                 A boundary line shown on a land use map that delineates areas intended for
                                                 urban land use (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, etc.), and areas
                                                 designated for rural land uses, principally agriculture and low density residential.
                                                 Agriculture, open space, recreational activities and related uses are also
                                                 permitted and encouraged throughout the urban area. Limited commercial and
                                                 coastal-dependent industrial uses are permitted within rural areas as necessary.

through the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO)
established in each County. The Santa Barbara LAFCO is required to
approve applications for annexation that are preceded by a plan for
expansion within an identified Sphere of Influence. State Law
(Government Code 56300) calls for the LAFCO to act in a manner
that encourages and provides planned, well-ordered, efficient urban
development patterns while preserving open space lands to the
extent appropriate for the proposal under consideration. The City’s
current Sphere of Influence is very modest, covering just over 8
acres. The urban/rural boundary is also controlled by the State
through the California Coastal Commission. Although similar in its
function to the jurisdictional boundary, the urban/rural line is
intended to support a stable limit on urbanization to protect unique
coastal resources such as agricultural land.
Coastal Policy Issue: Locations where the city will grow in response to existing
and projected demand for new housing should not conflict with coastal resources.
This Land Use Element reflects an approach to future development and growth
that is the most protective of significant coastal resources. The changes from the
existing plan are intended to further concentrate development in close proximity to
urban and employment centers rather than to rely on outward growth and related
conversion of agricultural lands. Parcels have been selected through the land use
planning process (for expansion of city limits or conversion of agricultural land for
urban use) because they can be developed without significant impacts to agriculture
and other coastal resources, such as areas for public open space and access near the
coastline.
LAND USE MAP
The Land Use Map identifies the location of different land uses in
Carpinteria (see Figure LU-1) in 12 categories described below. The
definitions include the density for each residential land use category.
Density refers to the number of residential units normally allowed
per acre. The intensity of development refers to specific land uses,
building mass and placement.                  Implementing ordinances and
regulations such as the Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision
Ordinance generally regulate intensity. Intensity is also addressed in
the Community Design Element.
1. Rural Residential (RR)
     The RR land use category provides locations for single family
     homes adjacent to the urban/rural boundary to function as a
     transition use and to help stabilize that boundary.
     Density: 0.3 to 1.0 du/ac (dwelling units per acre)
                                                                                                                                       9

                                                      The LDR land use category includes locations for low-density
                                                      detached single-family residences in neighborhood settings.
                                                      Density: 0.3 du/ac to 4.6 du/ac.

                                                      Medium-Density Residential (MDR)
                                                      The MDR land use category provides a broad range of small lot
                                                      detached or attached (duplex) single-family and attached multi-
                                                      family residences. Land uses typically include single-family
                                                      homes, mobile homes, apartments, townhouses, and
                                                      condominiums. Density: 4.7 to 20.0 du/ac.
                                                 4. Planned Unit Development (PUD)
                                                      The PUD land use category is intended for areas where careful
                                                      analysis is required prior to development due to the sensitive
                                                      nature of these locations. Specific Plans are required for PUD
                                                      land use designations. The PUD designation is assigned to large,
                                                      undeveloped parcels suitable for a combination of land uses (e.g.,
                                                      residential, recreational, visitor-serving, and commercial and
                                                      convenience establishments). The purpose of this designation is
                                                      to ensure comprehensive planning by requiring that the entire
                                                      parcel be planned and developed as a unit. Use of flexible and
                                                      innovative design concepts is encouraged. Density is determined
                                                      through the Specific Plan process.
                                                 5. General Commercial (GC)
                                                      The GC land use category is characterized by a mixture of retail,
                                                      wholesale, service and office uses, usually located along major
                                                      transportation corridors. This category includes a variety of
                                                      commercial intensities. The Central Business District identifies
                                                      the downtown commercial area. It is characterized by a variety
                                                      of offices, retail businesses, specialty shops, entertainment uses,
                                                      and residential land uses. The City encourages this area to be
                                                      pedestrian-oriented.
                                                 6. General Industrial (GI)
                                                      The GI land use category provides areas for light industrial
                                                      processing, assembly, packaging, wholesale and service-related
                                                      industries.
                                                 7. Coastal Dependent Industrial (CDI)
                                                      The CDI land use category identifies areas for industrial uses that
                                                      are coastal dependent, such as aquaculture and pipeline/gas
                                                      processing facilities in support of offshore oil industries.

 8. Research & Development Industrial (RDI)
     The RDI land use category is characterized by well-designed
     groups of office, research and development and light industrial
     uses. These land uses typically employ a large number of persons,
     and are attractively designed to be compatible with less intense
     uses, such as residential.
 9. Public Facility (PF)
     The PF land use category includes public service facilities
     including police, fire, school, water, utility, sewer or other
     municipal services, and other compatible land uses including
     boys/girls clubs, libraries, churches or other publicly oriented
     uses.
10. Open Space/Recreation (OSR)
     The OSR land use category is intended to provide recreational
     areas (passive or active), including City parks, beaches, golf
     courses and related uses. It also identifies open space areas.
11. Agriculture (A)
     The A land use category identifies areas appropriate for continued
     agricultural production.
12. Transportation Corridor (TC)
     The TC land use category is intended to identify limited access
     State Highways. The character of the highway will include
     landscaping and overpass design that reflects positively on the
     character of the community.
13. Visitor-
     Visitor-serving Commercial (VC)
     The VC land use category is intended to provide for those uses
     that serve visitors to the City. Such uses may also serve local
     residents and include hotels, motels, restaurants, service stations,
     and other retail businesses that meet visitor needs.
 GENERAL PLAN /ZONING C ONSISTENCY
 The City of Carpinteria has the legal responsibility to ensure that the
 General Plan land use designations and City zoning designations are
 consistent. In this way, the City may appropriately amend zoning
 designations in a specific area while still reflecting the intent of the
 General Plan. Table LU-1 provides an easy reference for decision
 makers and the public to determine the zoning designations permitted
 in each General Plan land use category. The intent is to establish
                                                                                                                       13

                                               square miles of tidelands). The Planning Area Boundary outside the
                                               city limits consists of approximately five square miles of land. The
                                               largest commitment of land within the city is to residential use
                                               (approximately 32.3 percent of the total land area). When the
                                               Planning Area is included, the largest commitment of land is to
                                               agricultural use. The complete breakdown of land use within the city

                                               The City’s holding capacity is a function of land suitable for
                                               development, available services such as sewer, water, and schools and
                                               environmental and resource protection constraints. The city is
                                               approaching holding capacity given the availability of land and
                                               constraints to further expansion and development due to resource
                                               protection policies of the Coastal Act. The expected result is that a
                                               greater amount of redevelopment will occur as compared to new
                                               development, and development increasingly will be proposed that
                                               conflicts with resource protection policies of the city or policies
                                               calling for compatibility with existing neighborhoods and commercial
                                               districts.
                                               PLANNING AREA B OUNDARY
                                               Section 65300 of the Government code requires that a city address all
                                               territory within the boundaries of the city as well as “any land outside
                                               its boundaries which in the planning agency’s judgment bears relation
                                               to its planning.” The law allows communities to plan for areas outside
                                               their jurisdiction because certain issues are not confined to political
                                               boundaries. By including an area outside its boundaries in its general
                                               plan study, a city can:
                                               ·     clearly communicate its concerns for the future of lands currently
                                                     under another agency’s jurisdiction,
                                               ·     guide the orderly and efficient extension of services and utilities,
                                               ·     ensure the preservation of open space and resource conservation
                                                     lands, and
                                               ·     establish consistent standards for development in plans of
                                                     adjacent jurisdictions.
                                               The Planning Area Boundary extends beyond the City boundary to
                                               encompass a larger region. Activity in the Planning Area Boundary
                                               affects the environment and economy in Carpinteria. The Planning
                                               Area Boundary is identified by four factors (see Figure LU-2, p. 17):
                                               4 Figures have been calculated by allocating in each residential category a portion
                                               of the total residential buildout potential as listed in the 1995 SBCAG

                                               assumptions were made concerning growth in each residential category based on

·   The boundary extends north to encompass the immediate
    watershed of the Carpinteria Valley. Activities in the watershed
    can impact drainage, water quality and habitat protection.
·   The boundary extends north, east, and west to the first prominent
    ridgelines because development on the surrounding ridgelines
    affects visual resources of Carpinteria.
·   The boundary includes areas in the Carpinteria Valley because
    development in the Valley, whether agricultural intensification, or
    conversion of agriculture to other uses, affects Carpinteria’s
    environment, economy and housing.
·   The boundary extends east and west along the Highway 101
    corridor (from Toro Creek to Bates Road) because development
    occurring along the highway impacts land use demands and
    resources in Carpinteria.
AREA OF INTEREST
The City has also designated the unincorporated portion of the
Planning Area Boundary as the Area of Interest. The use and
development of land within the Area of Interest has the potential to
significantly impact coastal resources in the city and the City’s efforts
to affect local land use patterns and development characteristics.
Because of this, the Area of Interest demands consideration beyond
that afforded by the Planning Area Boundary alone. The Area of
Interest is an area where the City and County have sufficient shared
interest to warrant formal and cooperative land use planning and
development review.         Historical efforts recognizing these shared
interests have been limited primarily to public hearing notices sent by
the County to the city and have been insufficient to gain early
participation at a level sufficient to be effective.
The Area of Interest designation covers the entire unincorporated
Carpinteria Valley within the city’s Planning Area Boundary. From
the viewable Rincon Mountain ridges to the east to Toro Canyon
Road to the west, to the Los Padres National Forest to the north, the
designation serves as the first necessary step toward more formal
agreements regarding the scope and conduct of joint planning
between the City and the County.
SPHERE OF INFLUENCE/URBAN RURAL
BOUNDARY
The City strongly favors a firm urban/rural boundary between the
incorporated area of Carpinteria and the rural areas of Carpinteria
Valley. This is consistent with Coastal Act policies. There are areas
adjacent to the city that merit inclusion in the city because they are
either already developed in urban use or are a logical extension of city
boundaries given the existing pattern of development or need for
public services.
                                                                                                                     17

The proposed Sphere of Influence boundary includes approximately
48.3 acres. Figure LU-3 illustrates that the urban/rural boundary is
proposed to be coterminous with the city’s ultimate jurisdictional
boundary except where indicated.
Each proposed addition to the Sphere of Influence is contiguous to
the existing city urban/rural boundary and has unique characteristics
or circumstances that support inclusion in the city sphere of influence.
The proposed sphere of influence will help provide a clear distinction
between the city and surrounding county because of existing
developed features. Coastal Act policies establish conditions
appropriate for developing urban land uses in agricultural areas in the
coastal zone. The proposed Sphere of Influence meets these criteria.
The Carpinteria Valley Water District (CVWD) currently serves all of
the proposed sphere study areas, and CVWD has an adequate supply
of water resources to serve the proposed Sphere of Influence based
on the proposed land uses. Water lines and connections could readily
be provided or improved depending on site-specific needs, particularly
for fire protection requirements.
Most of the sphere area is already developed. The proposed sphere
area has been assessed to determine the most viable and appropriate
land use designations. Proposed additions to the sphere area and
potential land uses are discussed below.
Proposed Additions to the Sphere of Influence
1. Ellinwood Site
This property of approximately 3.9 acres is located at the west end of
the City, on the east side of Cravens Lane approximately 800 feet
north of Via Real. The City limit is contiguous with the west and
south boundary of the area. Existing use of the property includes two
single-family homes, a barn and several out buildings. Also, many
Coast live oaks are on the property. Adjacent uses include a mobile
home park to the west, a condominium project to the south,
greenhouses to the east and a packinghouse and proposed storm
water retention basin to the north. Partial street improvements front
the property and all utilities are available to the site. The area has
been selected due to it being contiguous to city limits and surrounded
                                                                                                                      19

by either urbanized development or intensive agricultural
development (i.e. packinghouse, greenhouse and retention basin).
Further, the area provides an opportunity to establish a transition
from higher density condominium development to the south to
agricultural uses to the north. This transition area is intended to
support City and Coastal Act policies for stabilizing the urban/rural
boundary and concentrating urbanized development in areas
contiguous to existing neighborhoods.             A Medium Density
Residential (MDR) land use designation is proposed.                This
designation allows for consideration of residential use ranging from
4.7 – 20 du/ac. Development of the area would be constrained by
the need to establish appropriate separation from the existing
packinghouse uses in order to minimize conflicts. The property is
currently designated A-1-R under the County Comprehensive Plan.
2. Santa Monica Gardens Neighborhood
This area of about 20 acres is located generally northwest of the
intersection of Via Real and Santa Monica Road on the west side of
the city. It consists of an existing 69 lot single-family subdivision.
The city limit is contiguous with the south and east boundaries of the
area. All public street access to the subdivision is provided through
the city via Santa Monica Road. Existing use is single-family homes
constructed mid to late 1960s. Adjacent uses include open-field
agriculture to the north and west, retail commercial, motel and
residential uses to the south, and single-family homes to the east.
Complete street improvements and utilities are available to the area.
The area has been selected due to being urbanized and contiguous to
city limits. Further, City and Coastal Act policies encourage a
stabilized urban/rural boundary. These policies are supported
through reorganization that includes all contiguous urbanized areas
with City jurisdiction. A designation of Low-Density Residential
(LDR) has been applied to the area for consistency with the use and
development pattern. The property is designated as an
unincorporated urban area on the County Comprehensive plan and
zoned 7-R-1.
3. East Valley School Site
This seven-acre property consists of two homes on two separate lots
of approximately equal size. The School District has purchased the
property and intends to apply for annexation to the city in
anticipation of developing an elementary school to serve the eastern
portion of the Carpinteria Valley. The site was selected because it is
the only non-agriculturally designated property the District has
identified in the east Valley that is suitable for the proposed school.
The site is a transition property between higher density residential
use to the south and open-field agricultural use to the north. The
                                                                                                                       21

                                             designation is Public Facility (PF).
                                             4. Lomita Lane Neighborhood
                                             This subdivision consists of 15 homes on one- and two-acre lots
                                             totaling approximately 17.5 acres. The area is situated north of the
                                             city industrial park area on a gently sloping hill that provides views
                                             over the east end of the city and the Pacific Ocean. Vehicular access
                                             comes through the city on Via Real. The site was selected based on
                                             its relationship to the city and because the area is practically treated
                                             as a part of the city. The area is designated Res. 1.0 and the proposed

                                             LAND USE OBJECTIVES & POLICIES
                                             Objective LU-1: Establish the basis for orderly, well planned
                                             urban development while protecting coastal resources and
                                             providing for greater access and recreational opportunities
                                             for the public.
                                             Policies:
                                             LU-1a. The policies of the Coastal Act (Public Resources Code
                                             Section 30210 through 30263) are hereby incorporated by reference
                                             (and shall be effective as if included in full herein) as the guiding
                                             policies of the land use plan.
                                             LU-1b. The Land Use Plan amendments approved by the City in
                                             Resolution 4670 (Appendix K) as modified pursuant to the
                                             suggestions of the Coastal Commission, shall not become effective
                                             until the City of Carpinteria formally adopts the suggested
                                             modifications and complies with all of the requirements of Section
                                             13544.5 of the California Code of Regulations and the Coastal
                                             Commission certifies amendments to the Implementation Program
                                             that are adequate to carry out and implement such Land Use Plan
                                             Amendments (as referenced in Appendix J as contained herein). The
                                             remaining Land Use Plan amendments approved in Resolution 4670,
                                             as modified pursuant to the suggestions of the Coastal Commission,
                                             shall be effective once the City of Carpinteria formally adopts and
                                             complies with all of the requirements of Section 13544.5 of the

LU-1d. Ensure that the type, location and intensity of land uses
planned adjacent to any parcel designated open space/recreation or
agriculture (as shown on Figure LU-1) are compatible with these
public resources and will not be detrimental to the resource.
Objective LU-2: Protect the natural environment within and
surrounding Carpinteria.
Policies:
LU-2a. Reduce the density or intensity of a particular parcel if
warranted by conditions such as topography, geologic or flood
hazards, habitat areas or steep slopes. This can be achieved in part
by establishing an environmentally sensitive area overlay district in
the Zoning Ordinance. This overlay district will include maximum
density and parcel size criteria for determining the appropriate
intensity of these areas.
LU-2b. Regulate all development, including agriculture, to avoid
adverse impacts on habitat resources.          Standards for habitat
protection are established in the Open Space, Recreation &
Conservation Element policies.
Objective LU-3: Preserve the small beach town character of
the built environment of Carpinteria, encouraging
compatible revitalization and avoiding sprawl development
at the city’s edge.
Policies:
LU-3a. New development shall occur contiguous to existing
developed areas of the city. Higher density in certain residential
neighborhoods and for residential uses in commercial districts shall
be provided as a means to concentrate development in the urban
core consistent with zoning designations, particularly where
redevelopment of existing structures is proposed.
LU-3b. The Community Design Element shall guide the character
of development, and represent a comprehensive statement of the
community’s visual objectives.
            LU-3c. Work cooperatively with the County to strive to
 GP         achieve a jobs/housing balance in the Carpinteria Valley.
LU-3d. Establish a commercial sector that balances the retail and
service needs of citizens and tourists.
LU-3e. Direct commercial development toward the center of town
and in established commercial nodes. Exceptions include visitor-
                                                                                                                      23

                                             transportation networks, minimize the impacts of vehicles in the
                                             community, and encourage alternative means of transportation.
                                             LU-3i. Ensure the provision of adequate services and resources,
                                             including parking, public transit and recreational facilities, to serve
                                             proposed development.
                                             LU-3j. Ensure that the Zoning Ordinance contains applicable
                                             zoning districts to provide consistent implementation of the Land
                                             Use categories.
                                             LU-3k. Prepare a study for the future reuse of the existing

                                             gas plant and Bluffs Area 0 shall incorporate public access, coastal
                                             recreation and open space/habitat restoration uses to the maximum
                                             extent feasible, and shall at minimum provide for vertical and lateral
                                             public access to and along the Coastal Trail.
                                             LU-3l. Land use designations established on the City’s land use
                                             map that permit a range of residential densities should not be
                                             interpreted to permit development that is incompatible with the
                                             existing development pattern in an area. A density within the
                                             allowable range that is most compatible with the predominant
                                             pattern of development in the area should be used as the guide for
                                             determining the appropriateness of the proposed development.
                                             LU-3m. Where residential use is permitted in commercially
                                             designated areas and a density standard is provided, specific plans or
                                             similar implementation tools should be created to establish
                                             appropriate controls for the intensity of residential use in the district.
                                             LU-3n. Setbacks shall be created between agricultural and urban
                                             uses. The responsibility of providing the buffer shall rest with the
                                             property intensifying its use. The buffer shall be adequate to prevent
                                             impacts to adjacent agricultural production. Such impacts include
                                             increased limitations on the use of chemicals and fertilizers and

increased conflicts between the urban use and the adjacent
agricultural operation.
LU-3o. Approval of any coastal development permit on a parcel
which is designated Public Facilities and is located adjacent to the
City’s Urban/Rural limit line (“development”) shall be contingent
upon the City’s determination that the development is compatible
with any agricultural operations on adjacent property. As a pre-
condition to making such a determination, an operation management
plan for the parcel for which development is proposed shall be
prepared in coordination with the owners and operators of
agricultural operations within 500 feet of the parcel for which
development is proposed, and must be approved by the City. The
operation management plan may be approved only upon the City
making all of the following findings: (a) the agricultural operation is
able to continue without being restricted or constrained by the
existence of the development in a manner that would impact the
viability of the agricultural operations, (b) all use of the parcel subject
to development can be conducted in a manner that protects the
public’s health, safety and general welfare with regard to the
agricultural operation, (c) upon establishment of the use(s) proposed
through the development, the conduct of agricultural operations
existing on parcels within 500 feet of the subject site as of July 1,
2002, and as reflected in the records of the County of Santa Barbara
Agricultural Commissioner’s Office, will not result in mandatory
restrictions on the application of chemical herbicides, insecticides
and fertilizers, that exceed those restrictions in place on July 1, 2002,
and (d) the owner of the property for which development is
proposed has acknowledged that the property may be subject to
inconvenience, discomfort, or adverse effects arising from adjacent
agricultural operations such as dust, smoke, noise, odors, fumes,
insects, and application of chemical herbicides, insecticides and
fertilizers. Further, the owner, operator and any successors and
assigns of agricultural operations within 500 feet of the parcel for
which development is proposed shall be held harmless by the owner
of the property for which development is proposed provided the
agricultural operation is performed in conformity with the operation
of the management plan.
             Objective LU-4: Influence land use decision-
 GP          making, use and development patterns in the
unincorporated Carpinteria Valley to be supportive of the
California Coastal Act and City objectives to preserve unique
coastal resources by establishing open-field agricultural use
as the predominant use in the unincorporated Valley. (See

                                                                                                        Land Use Element
determined appropriate by the City, in response to changing
needs relative to the jobs/housing balance locally and in the
region, and as incentive toward the development of
affordable housing.
Policies:
LU-6a. The City may consider and permit mixed use (i.e.,
residential/commercial or residential/industrial) on parcels
designated on Figure LU-1 for commercial or industrial use. Such
mixed use may be considered if the City has found that either the
allowance would encourage rehabilitation of important existing
housing stock, or the residential use of the subject parcel(s) would
result in the production of affordable housing in the community, and
that mixed use on the site would assist the City in maintaining an
appropriate balance between jobs and housing.                 Mixed-use
development shall not be permitted on parcels designated for
commercial or industrial use unless it is found by the City to be
compatible with existing and anticipated uses in the area surrounding
the site.
LU-6b. The City may consider and permit residential use on a
parcel or parcels not designated for such use under certain
circumstances. Such residential use may be considered on a parcel or
parcels designated for commercial or industrial use if the City has
found that either the allowance would encourage rehabilitation of
important existing housing stock or the residential use of the subject
parcel(s) would result in the production of affordable housing in the
community, and that residential use on the site would assist the City
in maintaining an appropriate balance between jobs and housing.
Residential use shall not be permitted on parcels designated for
commercial or industrial use unless it is found by the City to be
compatible with existing and anticipated uses in the area surrounding
the site. A residential overlay zone district shall be maintained by the
city with the purpose of permitting residential development on a
parcel or parcels otherwise designated on the official land use and
zoning maps of the city for commercial or industrial use.
Implementation of the Residential Overlay zone district shall be
permissive in nature and shall not be construed to restrict use already
allowed in the base zone district. Further, the city shall retain the
authority for determining where implementation of the residential
overlay zone is appropriate. To encourage retention of local
businesses where parcels are already developed for commercial or
industrial use, application of the Residential Overlay shall be
considered only after mixed use development, as allowed through
policy LU-6a above, has been determined by the City to not be
appropriate.
                                                                                                                        27

                                             Implementation Policy 2: When residential development is
                                             proposed on parcels designated for commercial or industrial use, the
                                             residential density shall not exceed the highest residential density
                                             permitted in the city’s land use categories; i.e., 20 units/acre including
                                             any bonus density allowances. The City shall determine the
                                             appropriate residential density for a commercial/industrial-designated
                                             parcel proposed for residential use on all or a portion of the parcel
                                             and shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors:
                                             a. Availability and cost of providing local services and
                                                  infrastructure; e.g., sewer, water, and schools, and transportation
                                                  and parking availability.
                                             b. Unique site characteristics such as size, shape, topography, and
                                                  easements
                                             c. The existence on site or adjacent to the site of Environmentally
                                                  Sensitive Habitat area.
                                             d. The need for protection or enhancement of other coastal
                                                  resources; e.g., viewsheds, coastal access, recreation, visitor-
                                                  serving commercial and other coastal dependent or coastal
                                                  related uses.
                                             When mixed-use development is proposed in a common building,
                                             determination of the allowable density shall include, in addition to
                                             the criteria above, consideration of the intensity of the
                                             commercial/industrial use including characteristics such as parking
                                             demand, vehicle trip generation, noise and vibration, that could affect
                                             compatibility of the residential use with the commercial/industrial
                                             component.
                                             In all cases, commercial or industrial use shall be the primary use of a
                                             site designated for mixed-use development. A commercial or
                                             industrial use of a developed site shall be found by the City to be the
                                             primary use if it is greater in area than the residential component
                                             and/or is situated and designed such that it both appears and
                                             functions as the primary use of the parcel from its primary street

                                             serving commercial shall not be considered for mixed use or
                                             residential use, with the exception that second-story mixed use or
                                             residential use shall be allowed on visitor-serving commercial parcels

The City of Carpinteria is a small beach town in a rural setting. The
city’s coastal setting is framed by the foothills of the Los Padres
National Forest and the Pacific Ocean. The landscape includes
natural coastal terrain and agricultural lands. The city’s edge at the
urban/rural boundary is also a defining characteristic. The physical
characteristics that contribute to Carpinteria’s unique identity and
appearance include:
•    Variety of individual neighborhoods;
                                                                                               New development must respect existing
•    Scale and character of streets and other public spaces;                                   natural resources and open spaces.
•    Scale, character and configuration of buildings;
•    Landscaping that defines and enhances public spaces and private
     development; and
•    Relationship of the built environment to the natural
     environment.
The Community Design Element identifies citywide and specific key
design characteristics of Carpinteria valued by the community. The
Element includes the following major components to address these
issues:
                                                                                               The Downtown is the center                 of

The City is comprised of several distinct and unique neighborhoods
and districts. They are defined and linked by a network of streets
and open spaces. The physical and cultural center of the city is the
downtown commercial district. The Town Map identifies the
following elements of Carpinteria’s community design:
•    Natural and agricultural open spaces
•    Corridors/streets
•    Public open spaces
                                                                                               Houses should face the street with front

  sidewalks than a city-edge residential area where a more rural
  landscape would be appropriate. The design characteristics

COMMUNITY DESIGN SUBAREAS
To ensure that the existing unique qualities of Carpinteria’s
neighborhoods and districts are preserved and enhanced, community
design subareas have been identified. The subareas are delineated on
the Town Map, in Figure CD-1. Since subareas represent unique
characteristics of each area of the city, individual policies and
objectives were developed so that the special design qualities of each
subarea would be preserved in the future.
The following list identifies the individual community design

Subarea 1. Downtown Beach Neighborhood
The Downtown Beach Neighborhood is bounded by the beach on
the south, Linden Avenue and the State Beach Park on the east, the
railroad tracks on the north and the Carpinteria Marsh on the west.
The character of this subarea is principally derived from being
located adjacent to the beach, the park and the salt marsh. The
street pattern in this area provides good linkages to these open
spaces, for both views and access.

Objective CDS1-2: Enhance the pedestrian character of the
neighborhood streets.
Objective CDS1-3: Ensure that the scale and character of
new development is consistent with the existing small-scale
character of the residential neighborhood and that it is
consistent with the neighborhood “small beach town”
image. Discourage new development of large, “boxy”
buildings, with ground floors primarily devoted to garages.                   Garage doors should not dominate

3. Provides appropriate development opportunities for landowners
    within the Carpinteria Bluffs.
For the purposes of this Plan, the Carpinteria Bluffs Sub-
area has been divided into four planning areas: Bluffs
Areas 0, I, II and III. Descriptions of the planned land
uses are in the Land Use Element.
Bluffs Area 0
Bluffs Area 0 includes all parcels of the Carpinteria oil &
gas plant, the City Hall at 5775 Carpinteria Avenue and
the Historical Airport site at 5665 Carpinteria Avenue.
The area consists of approximately 62 acres that are built
out under their approved uses. The future of the Bluffs
0 area hinges upon the disposition of the oil & gas plant that
occupies most of this area. Should the plant be decommissioned, the
area could present opportunities for new uses and development in
support of coastal zone priorities such as visitor-serving and
recreation uses and public access. Important characteristics of the site
include a substantial landscaped open space buffer between the oil &
gas plant and the Arbol Verde residential neighborhood to the west,
remnant windrows that traverse the site north/south and east/west,
and its relation to the coastal bluffs, Tar Pits Park, public access
along the coast and environmentally sensitive habitat areas such as
the Harbor Seal Hauling grounds.
Bluffs Area I
Bluffs Area I extends along the oceanfront from the eastern
boundary of the Venoco Oil processing facility to the western
boundary of the “Seven-Up” building. The existing terrain includes
inter tidal and sub tidal reefs, harbor seal rookery and haulout area,
coastal sage scrub and bluff scrub habitats, and windrows. The
character of Bluffs I is established by its primary land use, the natural
open space of the 53 acre Carpinteria Bluffs Nature Park. All other
parcels included in Bluffs I are planned to be complementary to this
primary use. To the west, the 23.4-acre parcel is intended for uses
and development that are capable of providing a transition between
the oil & gas plant and the passive open space park. To the north
parcels located on either side of Bailard between Carpinteria Avenue
and the freeway are intended for low intensity uses that will not
obstruct views or create other negative impacts (e.g. noise, vibration,
odor, light, glare) to the Park. South of the park along the coastal
bluffs of Carpinteria, activity is intended to be limited so as to not
disturb this unstable landforms or adversely impact its
environmentally sensitive habitat. The land use designations
established in support of this character are shown on Figure LU-1.

                                                 sized buildings, limited signage, and a more “urban” appearance than
                                                 that of Bluff Areas I and III. Although the City intends to retain the
                                                 types of uses currently found in Bluffs Area II, upgrading or removal
                                                 of existing buildings will be needed over time. An open space
                                                 corridor will traverse the center of the site, and will include a riparian
                                                 area with native riparian trees, plants and shrubs. Parcels at the east
                                                 and west ends of the area have unique transition and compatibility
                                                 challenges related to their adjacency to an anticipated visitor-serving
                                                 resort use and the Bluffs Nature Park respectively.
                                                 Bluffs Area III
                                                 Bluffs Area III is the easternmost portion of the Bluffs and extends
                                                 from the eastern boundary of the “Infrared” property to the city’s
                                                 eastern boundary. Because Bluffs Area III has direct access to U.S.
                                                 101 via the State Route 150 interchange, on-site topographic
                                                 variations, and an excellent view that is unobstructed by the railroad,
                                                 it is an ideal site for a visitor-serving resort.
                                                 The planned land uses for this subarea include a hotel with up to 225
                                                 rooms, along with restaurants, a conference center, meeting facilities,
                                                 a banquet facility, health spa and small shops. As identified in the
                                                 Open Space Element, a view-oriented park is proposed, along with
                                                 continuation of the bluff top trail.
                                                 Community Design Policies for the Bluffs
                                                 The scenic quality of Carpinteria and the Carpinteria Bluffs is diverse.
                                                 The city to the west of the Bluffs is dominated by buildings and
                                                 other manmade elements. The coastal and foothill areas to the north
                                                 and east of the Bluffs are characterized by undisturbed natural
                                                 features (e.g., marshes, bluffs, beaches and parks), as well as by
                                                 agriculture. Views of these natural areas vary from short-range to
                                                 long-range and are afforded from public areas, such as streets,
                                                 highways and open space areas, as well as from private residences
                                                 and businesses.
                                                 The most outstanding panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean and the
                                                 Channel Islands are from the Carpinteria Bluffs. A footpath wanders
                                                 along the bluff top from the western portion of the bluffs adjacent to
                                                 the Carpinteria oil & gas plant to the city’s eastern boundary, and
                                                 continues into unincorporated lands, connecting to Rincon Park.

                                                                                                 Community Design Element
From this trail, there are spectacular vista points located at the end of
Bailard Avenue in Bluffs Area I, from the back of business park
properties in Bluffs Area II, and from the high point on Bluffs Area
III. In addition, looking across the freeway, the foothills form an
impressive backdrop to the north.
Despite the adjacent freeway, the overall character of the Bluffs is
one of tranquility. It is the intent of the General Plan/Local Coastal
Plan to preserve the tranquil character of the Carpinteria Bluffs,
while allowing appropriate development to occur. It is also the City’s
intent that development of the Bluffs occurs in a manner that is
consistent with the community’s small town character. To ensure the
preservation of significant visual resources and view corridors, as
well as to achieve the desired character of development for the
Carpinteria Bluffs, implementation of the following policies shall be
required of project applicants.
A. Long- and Short-Range Views
The visual resources of the Carpinteria Bluffs are some of the most
significant in the city consisting of both long (e.g. mountain, foothill,
ocean, horizon) and short (natural open space, beach, windrows,
native grass lands, coastal scrub, coastal bluffs) range views.
Objective CDS6-2: Ensure that development is controlled to
avoid impacts to significant viewsheds, vistas, and view
corridors.
Policies:
CDS6-b. Development on the Bluffs shall not obstruct existing
view corridors of the ocean and bluff top edge. In addition, views of
the ocean and mountains for users of the Carpinteria Bluffs Nature
Park and coastal trail(s), for bluffs area property owners and visitors,
and for passing motorists, shall be maintained.
Implementation Policies
57. New structures shall be low intensity, and reflect the low-rise,
    small-town feel of the surrounding area. New structures shall be
    designed to blend into the site and the rest of the city.
58. All structures, including ancillary structures, shall be
    appropriately placed so as to minimize their obtrusiveness, and to
    maintain existing view corridors. Existing views from Bailard
    Avenue, Carpinteria Avenue, and U.S. 101 to the ocean shall be
    preserved.
59. Development that is located on or adjacent to bluffs, beaches, or
    streams shall be designed and sited to prevent adverse impacts
    on the visual quality of these resources.
                                                                                                                          61

Community Design Element
                                                      • The overall scale and massing of structures shall respect the
                                                        natural setting of the Carpinteria Bluffs and its unique visual
                                                        resources by incorporating designs that minimize bulk and
                                                        mass, follow natural topographic variations, and minimize
                                                        visual intrusion into the bluff edge park and bluff top trail,
                                                        riparian area within Area II, and adjacent beach areas.
                                                      • In addition to the mass and scale of the structure, the total
                                                        square footage of structures shall also be maintained at a size
                                                        that preserves the area’s open character, and is compatible
                                                        with adjacent open space areas.
                                                      • All ancillary structures, including parking lots or structures,
                                                        shall be located as close to the center of the individual
                                                        building area as possible. If such structures must be located
                                                        adjacent to open space or residential areas, landscaping that
                                                        substantially screens the structure from the surrounding uses
                                                        shall be required.
                                                      • Consistent with livability and view preservation for residents,
                                                        selected internal roadways, parking areas, and building sites
                                                        shall be depressed. In implementing this requirement,
                                                        consideration shall be given to the feasibility of draining the
                                                        site and providing appropriate gradients for sewer and storm
                                                        drain lines.
                                                      • To ensure that the view corridors are appropriately framed
                                                        and maintained, all structures shall be subjected to review by
                                                        the City’s Architectural Review Board, which will ensure that
                                                        selected building sites adjacent to the open space areas and
                                                        view corridors have included provision for depressed
                                                        building sites, berming and/or suitable landscaping.
                                                      • Berms, landscaped buffers and islands shall be created
                                                        wherever feasible and determined necessary to enhance open
                                                        space and visual appeal in association with roadways, parking
                                                        lots and building sites.
                                                      • New development is to remain visually subordinate to
                                                        surrounding natural and introduced landscaping. New
                                                        buildings, signs, roads, and other man-made features should
                                                        borrow from naturally established forms, lines, colors, and
                                                        textures, including the forms, lines, colors, and textures
                                                        introduced as part of site landscaping. New buildings, signs,
                                                        roads, and other man-made features should also be at such a
                                                        scale that they contribute to the desired low intensity
                                                        character for the Carpinteria Bluffs.
                                                      • Surface materials on buildings within the Carpinteria Bluffs
                                                        should be textured to blend with the coarseness of
                                                        landscaping and natural vegetation.
                                                      • Permitted development within identified view corridors shall
                                                        be limited to landscaping, roads, underground utilities,
                                                        parking lots (where specifically required by other provisions

         restrooms (where specifically required by other provisions of
         the Carpinteria Bluffs Coastal Access, Recreation, and Open Space
         Master Program), bike racks, benches, picnic tables, and small
         interpretive signs.
    •    The intrusiveness of wall surfaces facing toward the bluff
         edge, the Bluffs Nature Park, riparian area, or identified view
         corridors shall be minimized through the use of single story
         elements, setbacks, roof pitches, and landscaping.
60. New development shall maintain existing topographic variations
    of the Carpinteria Bluffs, such as the ridgeline in Bluffs I and the
    terracing of Bluffs III. Development of Bluffs I should be
    designed to respect the viewshed from the bluff trail looking
    north toward the mountains and from the Bluffs Nature Park
    looking west. Location and design of buildings shall respect the
    topography and follow topographic forms whenever possible,
    visible variations in the ground plane are to be retained, avoiding
    a flat, mass graded appearance. These variations in the ground
    plane are also to be reflected in variations in the roof lines of
    individual buildings.
61. Buildings should not turn their backs completely to the freeway,
    Carpinteria Avenue, or other adjacent street(s). Regardless of
    their orientation, buildings that are visible from the freeway,
    Carpinteria Avenue, the Bluffs Nature Park, Bluffs area trails, or
    bluff top view points, are to be designed to provide the same
    level of architectural detail on elevations visible from these areas
    as on other elevations of the building.
          62. Buildings should be located in a landscaped setting
GP            where the main entrances do not directly abut paved
              parking areas. A minimum five to seven foot wide
    landscape strip should be provided between parking areas and
    buildings.
          63. Parking lots should not be the dominant visual element
GP            on a site. Large expansive paved areas located between
              the street and the buildings are to be avoided in favor of
    smaller multiple lots separated by buildings and landscaping.
64. Parking lots adjacent to and visible from public rights-of-way, the
    Bluffs Nature Park, and bluffs area trails should be screened
    from view through combinations of earth berms, low screen
    walls, changes in elevation, and landscaping.
65. As a part of development project plan submittals for the bluffs,
    tools such as physical or computer models, perspectives, or
    photographs, shall be included in order to demonstrate
    compliance with these measures and more generally the
    protection of Bluffs visual resources.
                                                                                                                           63

                                                 67. The resulting development after clustering is to be consistent
                                                      with the character of the development’s setting and adjacent land

    space areas. Larger buildings require additional setback areas for
    a balance of scale and so as not to impose on neighboring uses.
73. The design plan within each Bluffs area shall include an internally
    coordinated infrastructure system. Project applicant(s) for only a
    portion of a Bluffs Area shall also provide a design plan that
    coordinates (with other applicant(s) of the Bluffs) the
    infrastructure system.        Subsequent development shall be
    consistent with the City-approved design plan.
74. The design plan shall include an overall design theme for the
    project and provide for the “blending” of the urban components
    of the site with the natural surroundings and current existing
    buildings around the site. The design plan shall include the
    following.
    •    Provision of an aesthetic link between the existing
         commercial development already present in the city and new
         development proposed for the Bluffs site. A diversity of
         building styles is permissible, but must utilize styles that are
         already present in the city. Such design guidelines should
         also respect the natural attributes of the site, and give
         consideration to the location of the site (i.e., on a bluff
         adjacent to the ocean).
    •    Architectural style, including materials and colors, should be
         compatible with the site’s natural and landscaped setting.
         The use of colors, textures, materials and forms that will
         attract attention by not relating to other elements in the
         neighborhood is to be avoided. No one structure should
         stand out.
    •    Building forms and elevations should create interesting roof
         silhouettes, strong patterns of light and shadow, and integral
         architectural detail. Box-like structures and flat, monotonous
         facades are to be avoided.
    •    A low-rise setting with strong pedestrian orientation is to be
         provided. Site planning should favor pedestrian traffic by
         providing canopy trees to shade walkways, furnishing
         gathering places, and organizing buildings so that users have
         a continuous pedestrian level experience.
    •    Exposed structural and mechanical elements, unless well
         integrated into the design concept, are unsightly and are to
         be avoided. Outdoor work areas are to be screened from
         view.
    •    The inclusion of gateways that create a visual sense of entry
         into developments is encouraged. The scale and design of
         gateways should be compatible with scale and intensity of
         adjacent development, and should include enriched paving,
         raised medians, signage, landscaping, and other features as
         appropriate.
                                                                                                                          65

                                                 The Carpinteria Bluffs is largely a natural place where varieties of
                                                 coastal scrub, grasslands, and windrows contribute importantly to the

     compatible with the patterns of existing natural vegetation in
     surrounding areas. Revegetation that varies, particularly in form
     or in color, from the visual characteristics of the existing
     surrounding vegetation shall be avoided. In order to prevent
     monotony, landscaping with a variety of heights shall be
     required, although heights should be comparable to existing
     vegetation.
81. All areas adjacent to the railroad right-of-way shall be shielded
     through the use of dense, low-lying landscaping in such a manner
     that they do not obscure ocean or mountain views across the
     track corridor.
82. In the event that the property owners within Bluffs Area I or
     Bluffs Area III are unable to agree upon an integrated plan for
     their respective portions of the Carpinteria Bluffs, an applicant
     may independently apply for a development permit subject to the
     provisions listed in the Carpinteria Bluffs Coastal Access, Recreation,
     and Open Space Master Program for this planning Sub-Area.
83. Development within the Carpinteria Bluffs should fit quietly into
     the area’s natural and introduced landscape, deferring to open
     spaces, existing natural features, and native and sensitive habitats.

Jurisdictional Responsibility
Since both the City and the State administer portions of the
circulation system in the city, these agencies must cooperate to
ensure that the combined system adequately serves both residents of
and those passing through or visiting. In addition, the system
interfaces with the Circulation Element of the County of Santa
Barbara’s Comprehensive Plan.
Dependence on the Automobile

grows within the context of the larger regional economy, travel
demands will increase. As many local streets, particularly those in
commercial or industrial areas, become increasingly loaded to
capacity, total dependence on the automobile will mean increased
congestion. It is according ly considered prudent to facilitate alternate
modes of transportation in order to help reduce travel demands. The
City’s existing and planned bikeway system has and will continue to
become increasingly important as an alternative.
Fiscal Limitation
Circulation and infrastructure needs are typically granted high priority
in municipal capital budgets. Nevertheless, funds are ultimately
limited and there is a long list of competing projects with high levels
of need and community support.
In June, 1990, California voters approved legislation (Proposition
111) which increased funding for the state’s transportation system.
With that there were new requirements for the transportation
planning process that require urbanized counties, such as Santa
Barbara County, to prepare a Congestion Management Program

                                      Environmental Consequences
Policies relating to U.S. 101, State routes and freeway interchanges include cooperation with Caltrans and
the County to improve freeway accessibility; improvement of pedestrian and vehicular overcrossing of
the freeway and creeks while protecting habitat; and cooperation with Caltrans for freeway access,
interchange development and noise reduction.
Implementation of circulation system improvements would have the potential to create noise, air
pollution, traffic, and other temporary construction effects. New overcrossings could also require
stream crossings or other infringements on land conservation areas. Such impacts would depend upon
the locale of specific improvements and would need to be addressed on a case-b y-case basis.
Implementation of standard construction practices and implementation policies for natural habitat areas
in the Open Space, Conservation & Recreation Element would be expected to mitigate impacts
associated with construction activity.

Existing Arterial Streets
Carpinteria Avenue is a two-lane arterial street paralleling the
freeway from the SR 150 interchange on the east, passing through
the central business district to the west edge of the city. Left turn
lanes are provided at several intersections and traffic signals exist at
Linden Avenue and Casitas Pass Road. Carpinteria Avenue is the
only continuous street running through the city on the south side of
the freeway.
Via Real is a two-lane arterial street paralleling the freeway as a
frontage road. There are three discontinuous sections of Via Real,
from SR 150 to Carpinteria Creek, from Casitas Pass Road to
Vallecito Road and from Santa Ynez Avenue west to the city limits.

     these intersection standards.
                                      Environmental Consequences
  Policies relating to streets include consideration of all possible funding sources to meet transportation
  needs, development of a set of standards for street design, review of development proposals for effects
  on circulation, and development of a prioritized Capital Improvement Plan.
  These policies are generally designed to develop plans for improved circulation, monitor traffic
  conditions in the city, and develop appropriate requirements for new development proposals. These
  types of policies would not involve any direct physical changes that would have environmental effects.
  Implementation of specific policies that call for roadway improvements could result in physical
  environmental effects. Construction activity would have the potential to create noise, air pollution,
  traffic, and other temporary effects. Implementation of standard construction practices would be
  expected to mitigate impacts.
TRUCK ROUTES
The purpose of designating truck routes in a Circulation Element is
to assure that truck traffic patterns are compatible with existing and
proposed patterns of land use in the city and that the geometric cross
section of the road and its structural section are constructed
adequately to service heavy and large vehicles. While trucks may
utilize any public street for delivery of goods or services within the
city, in some cases it may be desirable to post truck routes, or to
place other traffic use restrictions on certain streets to discourage
truck traffic where it is found to be incompatible with existing or
planned land use patterns or street improvements.
The City is faced with a number of problem areas with regard to
truck transportation needs. Existing and future patterns of truck
traffic have been identified that conflict with land uses patterns and
street improvements in the city. Truck trips generated from the east
industrial park area conflict with residential uses on Via Real. The
truck-dependent agricultural, commercial and industrial uses in the
                                                                                                                     81

                                                 unincorporated Carpinteria Valley generate truck trips that may be
                                                 incompatible with existing uses and street improvements north of the
                                                 freeway. Furthermore, the planned improvement of the Linden
                                                 Avenue/Highway 101 interchange would create a northbound
                                                 freeway exit at Linden that could encourage truck traffic to travel
                                                 north on Linden from the freeway to Highway 192. The potential
                                                 for noise, vibration, air pollution, odor, damage to residential streets,
                                                 vehicular congestion and unsafe bicycle/pedestrian situations to
                                                 negatively affect the community is substantial.
                                                 The truck route designations are intended to provide for safe and
                                                 effective routes that avoid residential neighborhoods and other
                                                 sensitive uses. Traffic control measures, such as truck routes, can
                                                 help to reduce impacts from truck traffic. For example, traffic noise
                                                 and congestion impacts to residential neighborhoods and other
                                                 sensitive land uses adjacent to Major Arterial Roads can be effectively
                                                 reduced through routing of trucks to avoid such streets. Further,
                                                 truck routes and similar traffic control measures can dissuade large
                                                 trucks from traversing neighborhood streets potentially damaging
                                                 streets and creating public safety hazards.

                                     Environmental Consequences
 The development of truck routes would result in safer and more functional routes needed for truck-
 dependent agriculture, commercial, and industrial uses. Policy C-5a states that the city shall endeavor to
 restrict truck traffic to designated truck routes. This policy would benefit vehicular congestion,
 pedestrian and bicycle safety, and reduced exposure to hazardous loads. Reduced vehicular congestion
 would benefit air quality and circulation. Specified truck routes would also reduce noise impacts for
 sensitive receptors such as residences and schools. The policy would be expected to result in an overall
 beneficial environmental effect for the city.
Railroad
The major coastal railroad route passes through the Carpinteria
Planning Area along its southern edge. Public railroad passenger
service (Amtrak) began in 1997.
A number of issues evolve from the rail line, including:
§    Availability of vehicular/pedestrian crossings that provide safe
     and adequate opportunities for the community’s transportation
     needs, coastal and emergency access.
§    Noise and vibration impacts (see Noise Element).
§    Accidents and hazardous materials releases (see Safety Element).
Objective C-6: Provide adequate safe railroad crossings and
to effectuate community design of buffers that will attenuate
rail-related noise.
Policies
C-6a. Seek funding sources for grade-separated crossings of the rail
line to resolve conflicts with urban linkages, where such structures
are considered feasible. [10-year]
          C-6b. Encourage well-designed barriers, buffers and
GP        acoustically designed construction for noise attenuation in
          new developments.
C-6c. Encourage development of available railroad rights-of -way
for alternative transportation, bicycle, recreation, trail, parking
related, and other appropriate uses.
C-6d. Put programs for developing crossing improvements with the
State Public Utilities Commission and railroad operators into effect.
C-6e.    Encourage additional Amtrak stops.

                                                  Environmental Consequences
      The Union Pacific Railroad passes through the southern portion of the city and creates potential safety
      and noise problems. The City has developed policies to address railroad crossings where urban land use
      conflicts exist, encourage noise attenuation measures, use the railroad right-of-way for multi-purpose
      trails, parking and other appropriate uses, and implement crossing improvements developed with the
      State Public Utilities Commission and Union Pacific Railroad Company.
      Implementation of these policies would generally improve noise conditions, reduce railroad crossing
      hazards, and enhance the development of alternative transportation modes. Implementation of these
      policies may have temporary construction effects; however, standard construction practices would be
      expected to mitigate adverse environmental effects.

The City redeveloped its waterway launch facility at the ocean end of
Ash Avenue to provide a buoyed corridor for the safe launch of light
sail and other small watercraft. This designated launch corridor,
complete with parking facilities, will provide an area where light
water craft may be carried across the beach and put to sea without
conflict with bathers and beach users.
Public Bus System
Carpinteria is served by the Santa Barbara Metropolitan
Transportation District (SBMTD), a public district serving the south
coast of Santa Barbara County. One bus line, Route 20, passes
through the city and is routed along Via Real, then south along Santa
Ynez to and along Carpinteria Avenue to Camino Carreta. It circles
around south of Mark Avenue and returns to Santa Barbara in the
reverse direction. On its route, Bus Line 20 makes more than four
dozen total stops inbound and outbound Monday through Saturday
and about half as many on Sundays.
Bus Line 20 interconnects with the Seaside Shuttle line, local shuttle
service currently providing service between residential
neighborhoods north of Highway 101 and the Downtown and beach
area. The shuttle is electrically powered and runs seven days a week.
Commercial carriers provide bus transportation to and from outlying
areas. The bus depot for commercial carriers is centrally located
downtown. The carrier, Greyhound Bus Lines, is an intercity
operator that provides daily service trips to San Francisco, San Luis
Obispo, and Los Angeles.
The Carpinteria Area Rapid Transit (CART) service provides door-
to-door demand response service to the general public as well as frail,
elderly and handicapped individuals. The City subsidizes a local
private paratransit operator to provide door-to-door service for frail,
elderly, and handicapped persons in the south coast area, in addition
to its fixed route wheel chair accessible services. CART services has
only been available on weekdays for four hours per day, two of
which are used primarily to transport seniors to a nutrition center; it
does not itself offer the community a viable transportation alternative
for work trips.
Objective C-7: Build demand for alternative transportation
use by increasing ease, effectiveness, and social
acceptability, and through foresighted planning.
                                                                                                                     85

INTRODUCTION
Carpinteria has several natural resources that have local, regional, and
statewide significance.      These resources include natural and
developed open space resources and a variety of natural physical
resources. Preservation and conservation of these resources is key to
maintaining the natural qualities of the area that create the
environmental setting and character of the community. Basic to this
goal is providing: clean air, water and soil; adequate protection of
plant and animal habitats; maintenance of visual resources; and
preservation of special resources including beaches, recreation areas,
trails, marshland, creekways and agricultural land.
State law requires that community open space and natural resources

                                                    Management Plan for the Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve, provide
                                                    protection for many important local resources and provide habitat
                                                    for many species of plants and animals including critical habitat for
                                                    seven threatened and endangered species (southern Steelhead,
                                                    Tidewater Goby, western Snowy Plover, southwestern Willow
                                                    Flycatcher, Belding’s Savannah Sparrow, lightfooted Clapper Rail,
                                                    and Saltmarsh Birdsbeak). The ESHAs of Carpinteria include a
                                                    diversity and number of habitats and sp ecies not commonly found in
                                                    urban areas and these areas warrant unique measures to ensure
                                                    adequate protection.
                                                    The ESH overlay designations reflected on the land use plan and
                                                    resource maps are representative of the general location of known
                                                    habitat. All of the resource areas in the community may not be
                                                    known and migration of species or discovery of new habitats would
                                                    result in the need for designation of a new area. A designation on a
                                                    particular parcel identifies the existence of sensitive habitat in an area,
                                                    not the extent of the habitat area. The designations generally follow
                                                    contiguous sections of habitat area such as Carpinteria Creek and
                                                    Carpinteria Salt Marsh. There has not been an attempt to map
                                                    isolated, discontiguous pockets of habitat but these areas are
                                                    acknowledged and proposed for the same protections as larger
                                                    contiguous sections of habitat area. Therefore, the designations of
                                                    the land use plan are not definitive and are to be supplemented with
                                                    subsequent program and project level resource study and mapping.

                                                   OSC-1d. Property including ESHA should be designated with a
                                                   zoning category that allows for the protection of, and access to, the

resources shall be allowed and the resources shall be protected
against any disruption.
OSC-1f. Protect and restore degraded wetlands, butterfly habitat,
native plant communities, and sensitive, rare, threatened or
endangered species habitat on City-owned land to the maximum
extent feasible.
Implementation Policies
1. In addition to the policies and implementation policies herein,
    utilize the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to
    identify and avoid or reduce potential impacts to air and water
    quality, environmentally sensitive habitats, riparian habitats,
    marine plants and animals, and other environmental resources.
2. Form an Open Space and Conservation Advisory Committee to
    provide, at the pleasure of the city Council, recommendations
    concerning preservation and management of local natural
    resources and habitats. [5-year]
3. Prepare and implement habitat preservation programs with
    emphasis on preserving identified Environmentally Sensitive
    Habitat Areas through habitat management and restoration (1-7
    years). The programs shall include at a minimum:
    •    Special requirements for development plans which include
         Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas,
    •    Management practices for protection and restoration of ESH
         areas, and
    •    Recognition of the right to maintain existing legal non-
         conforming development and the ongoing need to protect
         the public health and safety of those residing in such
         development.
    Prior to effectiveness, all programs shall be certified as an
    amendment to the City of Carpinteria Local Coastal Program
    (LCP).
4. The City shall maintain an Environmentally Sensitive Habitat
    Area (ESHA) Overlay district within its zoning ordinance with
    the purpose of protecting and preserving areas in which plant or
    animal life or their habitats are either rare or esp ecially valuable
    because of their special nature or role in the ecosystem and
    which could be easily disturbed or degraded by human activities
    and development. The intent of the zoning district shall be to
    ensure that all development on properties subject to the ESHA
    overlay is designed and carried out in a manner that will provide
    maximum protection to sensitive resources. The overlay area
    shall apply at a minimum to those parcels designated with the
    overlay designation on Figure OSC-1, any parcel identified as
    ESHA either on an official resource map adopted by the city or
                                                                                                                        97

                                                   6.   Any activity proposed within an ESHA, including maintenance
                                                        of property improvements such as weeding and brush clearing,
                                                        tree trimming, and removal of dead or dying plant material
                                                        (“maintenance”), shall not result in the significant disruption of
                                                        habitat values and shall require approval from the City Biologist
                                                        or a determination by the City that the proposed activity is
                                                        consistent with the habitat management plan adopted by the
                                                        City, and certified as an amendment to the City’s LCP, for the
                                                        area. Further, the City shall annually provide notice to the
                                                        owners of property that include ESHA concerning the limits on
                                                        activities in ESHA, the prohibition of any disruption of habitat
                                                        values and the procedure for requesting approval of activities
                                                        potentially affecting an ESHA. Any activities proposed to be
                                                        undertaken within the creek or below the top of bank must first
                                                        be approved by the State Department of Fish and Game. For
                                                        improvements existing prior to adoption of this plan, a
                                                        maintenance program shall be submitted by the property
                                                        owner(s) that describes the scope and nature of maintenance
                                                        activities.   The city shall review the program, make any
                                                        appropriate changes to avoid further disruption of habitat values
                                                        and shall approve the program. Unless maintenance work is
                                                        proposed that is outside the scope of the approved program or a
                                                        State Department of Fish and Game permit is required, no
                                                        further review by the city shall be required; maintenance activities
                                                        beyond those stated in the approved program are prohibited.
                                                   7.   Determine appropriate methods for the preservation of sites that
                                                        include ESHA. These methods may include land purchase, tax
                                                        relief, purchase of development rights, or other methods. Where
                                                        these methods are not feasible, the city should ensure through
                                                        permit review that development does not result in any significant
                                                        disruption of habitat identified on a site or on adjacent sites.
                                                   8.   Regulate all development, including agricultural development,
                                                        adjacent to ESHA, in or adjacent to ocean-fronting parks or
                                                        recreation areas, or contiguous to coastal waters, to prevent
                                                        adverse impacts on habitat resources. Regulatory measures shall
                                                        include, but are not limited to: setbacks, buffer zones, grading
                                                        controls, noise restrictions, lighting restrictions, requirements for
                                                        wildlife permeable fencing, and maintenance and establishment
                                                        of native vegetation.

                                                                          Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element
9. Prior to issuance of a development permit, all projects shall be
     found to be in compliance with all applicable habitat protection
     policies of the General Plan/Local Coastal Plan and
     implementing policies and regulations of the Coastal Access and
     Recreation Program, Carpinteria Bluffs Access Recreation Master
     Open Space Program, and any other implementing plan for these
     policies that has been certified as an amendment to the City’s
     LCP.
10. Provide public education and information services on the
     community’s significant natural resources including the creeks,
     the Carpinteria Salt Marsh, coastal bluff areas, Monarch butterfly
     habitat, etc., to increase community awareness of sensitive
     environmental habitats and their value to Carpinteria.
11. Require City Biologist review and recommendation for all
     development projects that the Community Development
     Department has determined have the potential for impacts on
     ESHA or water quality.
                   Environmental Consequences
  The objective and policies are written to provide protection to
  sensitive open space areas and habitats, to provide comprehensive
  planning for watersheds, support recreational development in a
  manner that will not adversely affect the environment, and
  conserve soils, air and water resources. Implementation policies in
  the element such as utilization of the California Environmental
  Quality Act, a watershed management plan, and a creek
  preservation ordinance would all have positive consequences for
  the environment.
Carpinteria Bluffs
The Carpinteria Bluffs area is approximately 157 acres, located in the
southeast area of town, between the coastline and Highway 101 (see
Figure OSC-1). The Bluffs consist of gently sloping, coastal bluff-top
grasslands, alo ng approximately 6,000 feet of shoreline. The
shoreline has rocky intertidal pools, interspersed with sandy beach
areas. The Carpinteria Bluffs are a prime example of undisturbed
California coastline, and are among the last remaining coastal open
space areas within Santa Barbara County. The Carpinteria Bluffs also
provide important public access to the coast for local residents and
visitors. Portions of the Bluffs are developed and further
development or redevelopment of portions of the Bluffs are
anticipated over time making the establishment of policies to protect
the environment and character of the place of utmost importance.
The Carpinteria Bluffs plant habitat includes native grasslands and
scrub areas predominated by sage and coyote brush. There are
                                                                                                                      99

  Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element
                                                   numerous sensitive habitats and species that occur on the bluff area.
                                                   Sensitive plant habitats include: the Central Coast riparian scrub,
                                                   coastal sage scrub, and coastal bluff scrub. Some of the scrub lands
                                                   on the eastern side of the bluffs have been degraded as a result of
                                                   human activity. The Carpinteria Bluffs and adjacent shoreline also
                                                   host many sensitive animal species, including the white-tailed kite,
                                                   and the harbor seal. The white-tailed kite forages over the open
                                                   spaces of the bluffs, while the harbor seal uses the western end of the
                                                   bluff shoreline as a rookery and haul out area. The harbor seal site is
                                                   one of only four well established rookeries and haul out areas of the
                                                   southern California coast and is also unique for its public
                                                   accessibility.
                                                   The Carpinteria Bluffs Coastal Access, Recreation, and Open Space Master
                                                   Program (prepared by LSA Associates) was adopted in 1995. This
                                                   section includes policies in support of this implementing document.
                                                   Other sections of the Open Space and Conservation Element,
                                                   including the Harbor Seal Hauling Grounds and Trails, also include
                                                   policies in support of that program.
                                                   The Open Space Master Program calls for the protection of coastal sage
                                                   scrub located adjacent to the bluff edge both north and south of the
                                                   railroad tracks. This area is the least degraded and will be set aside in
                                                   the designated open space area. Most of the remaining sections are
                                                   highly degraded or are too small to support a significant wildlife
                                                   population.
                                                   Objective OSC-2: Preserve and restore the natural resources
                                                   of the Carpinteria Bluffs.
                                                   Policies:
                                                   OSC-2a. Maintain the Carpinteria Bluffs Coastal Access, Recreation,
                                                   and Master Open Space Program.
                                                   OSC-2b. Maintain the publicly purchased portion of Bluffs I in
                                                   public open space in perpetuity.
                                                   OSC-2c. Preserve all coastal bluff scrub habitat designated as open
                                                   space with an appropriate buffer.
                                                   OSC-2d. Designate all significant areas of coastal sage and bluff
                                                   scrub habitat as open space.
                                                   OSC-2e. Designate the riparian habitat area as open space with an
                                                   appropriate buffer.
                                                   OSC-2f. Protect significant historical and archaeological resources
                                                   within the Bluffs Area.

                                                                         Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element
OSC-2g. Offset the impacts of private development to existing
opportunities for public access and recreation by requiring that such
development include public access and recreational improvements.
OSC-2h. Preserve public enjoyment of Carpinteria Bluff view sheds
by ensuring that they are not significantly degraded through
development. All development applications shall be required to
provide information adequate to identify existing and future public
views and to demonstrate how the project proposes to avoid
significant disruption of the view sheds identified. The location, size
and density of development on the Bluffs shall be determined in part
by the view sheds identified and what is necessary to protect them.
OSC-2i. Preserve all windrow trees as one part of a contiguous and
naturally preserved open space system across the whole of the
Carpinteria Bluffs. Thinning, pruning and removal of trees shall be
limited to what is necessary to maintain the trees in a healthful
condition and to remove any hazardous condition. When a tree is
approved by the City for removal, it shall be required to be replaced
at a ratio appropriate to ensure infill of any gap created in the
windrow and with a native, locally occurring tree, type and size to be
approved by the City. Replacement trees that fail to survive within
the first five years after planting shall be replaced. Programs for
phased removal and replacement of tamarisk windrows with native
tree windrows are encouraged. Development or other activity
proposed on parcels including windrows shall be set back a minimum
of 10 feet from the drip line of the trees and shall not result in
compacting of soil or other potential damage to the trees’ root
system or water source.
                  Environmental Consequences
  The objective and policies for this area include preservation and
  restoration of coastal sage and bluff scrub, eucalyptus, and
  riparian vegetation. These policies would provide protection for
  the Bluffs area and environmental consequences would be
  positive.
Wetlands
Within the city, the Carpinteria Salt Marsh is the best studied and
defined wetland. Other wetlands historically identified but not
defined include lower Carpinteria Creek and Higgins Spring at Tar
Pits Park. Wetlands are areas of land which may be covered
periodically or permanently with shallow water and include saltwater
marshes, freshwater marshes, open or closed brackish water marshes,
swamps, mudflats, and fens. They are an important part of complex
ecosystems. Wetlands were once thought to be useless land and
                                                                                                                    101

                                                   many were filled and drained including portions of the Salt Marsh in
                                                   Carpinteria. A better understanding of wetlands along with their
                                                   continued decline, has led to local, state and federal regulations aimed
                                                   at the protection of wetlands. The definition of wetland used by the
                                                   City comes from the California Coastal Act (PRC § 30121) and
                                                   defines broadly areas that may be determined to be wetlands and are
                                                   therefore subject to regulation.
                                                   This section describes the Carpinteria Salt Marsh wetland and sets
                                                   out policies and implementation policies for the protection of the
                                                   unique needs of the Marsh as well as wetlands in general.
                                                   Carpinteri a Salt Marsh
                                                   The Carpinteria Salt Marsh is an estuarine ecosystem within a
                                                   developed section of the coastal zone. The marsh is a fertile coastal
                                                   wetland that receives tidal flushing from the ocean and nutrient rich
                                                   freshwater from the Santa Monica and Franklin Creeks. The mixture
                                                   of these waters provides a delicate balance of nutrients that support
                                                   several coastal wetland species. The estuary covers 230 acres and
                                                   supports rich and highly important ecosystem function. The
                                                   estuarine and adjacent palustrine wetlands have been reduced to one-
                                                   half their extent since they were mapped during an 1869 Coastal
                                                   Survey.
                                                   The majority of the ecosystem (120 acres) occurs within the
                                                   University of California’s Natural Reserve System. The Management
                                                   Plan for Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve, University of California
                                                   Santa Barbara, sets out a comprehensive plan for the management of
                                                   the ecosystem. Adjacent to the Reserve to the east is the seven acre
                                                   Carpinteria Salt Marsh Wetland Park; this portion of the Marsh is
                                                   within city limits and is an interpretive park with public access and
                                                   viewing areas. The balance of the Marsh exists on various privately
                                                   held properties.
                                                   The marsh supports many species of plants and animals that occur in
                                                   no other habitat. According to the Management Plan for the
                                                   Carpinteria Salt Marsh, at least two endangered bird species, the
                                                   light-footed Clapper Rail and Belding’s Savannah Sparrow, inhabit
                                                   the marsh along with Salt Marsh Bird’s Beak (cordylanthus
                                                   maritimus), an endangered plant species. At least 190 bird species,
                                                   37 fish species, 11 mammal species, 5 herpetofauna species, and over
                                                   100 invertrebrates species have been observed, collected, or reported
                                                   from Carpinteria Salt Marsh. Historical records show 252 species of
                                                   plants are known to occur at the Marsh and adjacent sand dunes. Of
                                                   those plants, 104 species (45 percent) are native according to the
                                                   Management Plan. Since the Salt Marsh serves as a feeding and
                                                   nesting ground for birds, as well as being home to fish, crustaceans
                                                   and mollusks, public access is restricted to reduce potential harm to
                                                   the habitat.

Objective OSC-3: Preserve and restore wetlands such as the
Carpinteria Salt Marsh.
Policies:
OSC-3a. Wetland delineations shall be based on the definitions
contained in Section 13577 (b) of Title 14 of the California Code of
Regulations.
OSC-3b. The upland limit of a wetland is defined as
             a) the boundary between land with predominantly
                  hydrophytic cover and land with predominantly
                  mesophytic or xerophytic cover;
             b) the boundary between soil that is predominantly
                  hydric and soil that is predominantly non-hydric;

OSC-3c. Development adjacent to the required buffer around
wetlands should not result in adverse impacts including but not
limited to sediment, runoff, chemical and fertilizer contamination,
noise, light pollution and other disturbances.
OSC-3d. Provide additional interpretive and trail opportunities to
appropriate areas of the salt marsh if possible without creating
significant impacts from such improvements.
Implementation Policies
12. Maintain a minimum 100-foot setback/buffer strip in a natural
    condition along the upland limits of all wetlands. No structures
    other than those required to support light recreational, scientific
    and educational uses shall be permitted within the setback, where
    such structures are consistent with all other wetland development
    policies and where all feasible measures have been taken to
    prevent adverse impacts. The minimum setback may be adjusted
    upward to account for site-specific conditions affecting
    avoidance of adverse impacts.
13. Applications for new development within or adjacent to wetlands
    shall include evidence of consultation and preliminary approval
    from the California Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Army
    Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and other
    State and Federal resource management agencies, as applicable.

20. Provide adequate parking to maximize public access to coastal
    recreation areas, including Salt Marsh Nature Park, City Beach,
    Carpinteria State Park, Tar Pits Park, Harbor Seal Overlook, and
    the Carpinteria Bluffs. Consider using revenues from the
    Tidelands Trust Fund to finance such improvements. Parking
    facilities shall be distributed, as feasible, to prevent overcrowding
    and to protect sensitive environmental resources.
                     Environmental Consequences
   Policies and implementation policies for this area include
   restrictions on the location of structures, and limiting activities
   that would harm the coastal resources. Protection of biologically
   important intertidal, submerged reef, and wetland areas would
   help preserve these areas. Policies and implementation policies
   would provide protection for the beaches, tidelands, and subtidal
   reefs, and environmental consequences would be positive. To
   provide long-term regional protection of coastal resources,
   Carpinteria should work with other jurisdictions along the coast.
   Activities along the coast in other areas such as Santa Barbara
   can affect the quality of the coastal environment in Carpinteria.
   Coordinated regional conservation would be advantageous to
   meet Carpinteria’s conservation goals.

                                                   The Harbor Seal Hauling Ground is located in a sandy pocket of
                                                   beach connected by a sandspit to a shelf-like intertidal outcrop east
                                                   of the oil and gas plant pier below a portion of the Carpinteria Bluffs
                                                   (see map, p. 103). In 1990, as many as 315 harbor seals were sighted
                                                   at this location. The seals use this area as a rookery to bear their
                                                   young. Entry into this area is restricted by the Carpinteria Municipal
                                                   Code from December 1 through May 31, since human activity can
                                                   disturb the harbor seal habitat. Harbor seals are under protection of
                                                   the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

                                                   adjacent Carpinteria oil & gas plant pier should be permitted as
                                                   necessary, as long as disturbances to the harbor seal hauling grounds
                                                   are minimized. Such repairs should be limited to the period of June
                                                   1 to November 30 if possible.
                                                   OSC-5b. Permit beach to bluff access at the east and west sides of

                                                                 seals.
                                                            b. Prohibit development and activity that could result in
                                                                 noise, vibration, or other disturbance that could result in
                                                                 the degradation of the seal hauling grounds or discourage
                                                                 its ongoing use.
                                                            c. Providing public education program and informational

         e. Extending the beach buffer to 750 feet on either side of
             the area during pupping season (December 1 through
             May 31) or such greater period as is established by
             Council Resolution.
         f. Maintaining a minimum 30-foot setback from the edge
             of the bluff for trails and gathering areas to reduce the
             visibility of humans and human movement along the
             bluff edge, except for a designated viewing/blind area.
         g. Planting natural vegetation along the bluff edge to form a
             screen or blind, further minimizing the visibility of
             human movement.
23. Plant a screen of native, stiff spined shrubs at the overlook to
    protect the Harbor Seal Hauling Ground from human
    disturbance.
24. Place interpretive signs at approaches to the seal haulout and
    rookery to educate visitors about seal population and to warn
    visitors of seal sensitivity to disturbance.

                  Environmental Consequences
Policies and implementation policies for the Harbor Seal Hauling
Grounds include restrictions on activities in the area including work
at the Chevron pier. Buffer zones around the hauling grounds vary
in distance depending on the time of year; pupping season requires
a greater distance. These policies and implementation policies
would provide protection for the harbor seal haulout grounds, and
environmental consequences would be positive.               Additional
provisions may be appropriate for the molting/summer season.
Creekways & Riparian Habitats
The creeks within the Carpinteria Planning Area include Carpinteria
Creek, Santa Monica Creek, Franklin Creek, Arroyo Paredon,
Garapato Creek, Rincon Creek, Lagunitas Creek and Toro Canyon
Creek. Some of these creeks have been channelized within the city
limits, including Santa Monica and Franklin Creeks to reduce
potential flood hazards. Portions of Carpinteria Creek are linked by
retaining walls and bridge abutments to reduce potential flood
hazards.
The city’s system of creeks provides habitat for plants and animals,
scenic beauty, educational opportunities, passive recreation such as
walking or hiking trails along creek banks. As discussed in the Safety
Element, creeks also provide for flood control.
Carpinteria Creek
Carpinteria Creek is distinct from other creeks within 100 miles
north and south. It is one of only a few perennially flowing streams,
even in drought years. Its lagoon, extending above Sixth Street, is a
rare wetland that harbors an endangered fish, the tidewater goby. Its
watershed is among the largest in the Santa Ynez Mountains drainage
to the sea, and is a candidate for steelhead trout restoration. This
watershed currently supports annual steelhead runs purported to be
among the largest in southern Santa Barbara County. The creek’s
forested banks provide all three of the vegetation habitats -- tall
canopy, midstory, and understory -- that serve a wide variety of
wildlife, particularly birds. More than 200 bird species, including
migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway, have been sighted here, more
than at any other coastal spot between Pismo Beach and Huntington
Beach. Scientists and birders from far away regularly come to
Carpinteria to observe birds that can be found in this distinctive
habitat. An endangered species, the southwest willow flycatcher,
forages at Carpinteria Creek.

Implementation Policies
25. A setback of 50 feet from top of the upper bank of creeks or
    existing edge of riparian vegetation (dripline), whichever is
    further, shall be established and maintained for all development.
    This setback may be increased to account for site-specific
    conditions. The following factors shall be used to determine the
    extent of an increase in setback requirements:
    a. soil type and stability of the stream corridor
    b. how surface water filters into the ground
    c. types and amount of riparian vegetatio n and how such
        vegetation
        contributes to soil stability and habitat value
    d. slopes of the land on either side of the stream
    e. location of the 100 year floodplain boundary, and
    f. consistency with other applicable adopted plans, conditions,
        regulations and/or policies concerning protection of resources.
    Where existing buildings and improvements, conforming as to
    use but nonconforming as to the minimum creek setback
    established herein, are damaged or destroyed by fire, flood,
    earthquake or other natural disaster, such buildings and
    improvements may be reconstructed to the same or lesser size
    and in the same general footprint location, provided that
    reconstruction shall be inaugurated by the submittal of a
    complete construction application within 24 months of the time
    of damage and be diligently carried to completion.
26. Prior to issuance of a development permit, all projects shall
    conform with the applicable habitat protection policies including
    but not limited to the General Plan/Local Coastal Plan, Open
    Space Bluffs Master Program, Creek Preservation Ordinance,
    and the Zoning Ordinance.
27. Prepare and implement a Watershed Management Plan in
    coordination with the County and Carpinteria Valley Water
    District with an emphasis on: erosion control, natural waterway
    restoration and preservation, wildlife habitat restoration,
    including steelhead runs, and water quality. [5-year]
28. Prohibit all development within stream corridors except for the
    improvement of fish and wildlife habitat, development necessary
    for flood control purposes, (where no other method to protect
    existing structures in the floodplain is feasible and where
    protection is necessary for public safety), and bridges and trails
    (where no alternative route/location is feasible and, when
    supports are located within stream corridor setbacks, such
    locations minimize impacts on critical habitat). All development
    shall incorporate the best mitigation measures feasible to
    minimize impact to the greatest extent.

                                                   29. Limit all development within stream corridors, including
                                                        dredging, filling and grading, to activities necessary for the
                                                        construction specified in policy # 28 (see above) and to public
                                                        hiking/biking and equestrian trails. When such activities require
                                                        removal of riparian plant species, revegetation with local native
                                                        riparian plants shall be required. Minor clearing of vegetation
                                                        may be permitted for hiking/biking and equestrian trails.
                                                   30. Prohibit further concrete channelization or other major
                                                        alterations of streams in the city with the exception of natural
                                                        habitat enhancement projects, or when the City finds that such
                                                        action is necessary to protect existing structures and that there
                                                        are no less environmentally damaging alternatives. Where
                                                        alteration is permitted, best feasible mitigation shall be a
                                                        condition of the project.
                                                   31. Develop a water pollution avoidance education program, to
                                                        include distribution of literature on how to minimize point and

                                                        related activities shall minimize water quality impacts, particularly
                                                        due to sediments that are eroded from project sites and are
                                                        conveyed to receiving waters, by implementing the following
                                                        measures:

                                                                           Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element
            •    Provide adequate disposal facilities for solid waste
                 produced during construction and recycle where
                 possible.
33. In order to protect watersheds in the City, all development shall
    minimize water quality impacts, particularly due to storm water
    discharges from existing, new and redeveloped sites by
    implementing the following measures:
    a. Site design BMPs, including but not limited to reducing
        imperviousness, conserving natural areas, minimizing
        clearing and grading and maintaining predevelopment rainfall
        runoff characteristics, shall be considered at the outset of the
        project.
    b. Source control Best Management Practices (BMPs) shall be
        preferred over treatment control BMPs when considering
        ways to reduce polluted runoff from development sites.
        Local site and soil conditions and pollutants of concern shall
        be considered when selecting appropriate BMPs.
    c. Treatment control BMPs, such as bio-swales, vegetated
        retention/detention        basins,    constructed     wetlands,
        stormwater filters, or other areas designated to control
        erosion and filter stormwater pollutants prior to reaching
        creeks and the ocean, shall be implemented where feasible.
    d. Structural BMPs (or suites of BMPs) shall be designed to
        treat, infiltrate or filter the amount of stormwater runoff
        produced by all storms up to and including the 85th
        percentile, 24-hour runoff event for volume-based BMPs,
        and/or the 85th percentile, 1-hour runoff event, with an
        appropriate safety factor (i.e., 2 or greater), for flow-based
        BMPs.
    e. Permits for new development shall be conditioned to require
        ongoing maintenance where maintenance is necessary for
        effective operation of required BMPs. Verification of
        maintenance shall include the permittee’s signed statement
        accepting responsibility for all structural and treatment
        control BMP maintenance until such time as the property is               Artemisia californica
                                                                                 Coastal Sage Brush
        transferred and another party takes responsibility. The City,
        property owners, or homeowners associations, as applicable,
        shall be required to maintain any drainage device to insure it
        functions as designed and intended. All structural BMPs
        shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired when necessary
        prior to September 30th of each year. Owners of these
        devices will be responsible for insuring that they continue to
        function properly and additional inspections should occur
        after storms as needed throughout the rainy season. Repairs,
        modifications, or installation of additional BMPs, as needed,                                    Eriogonum fasciculatum
                                                                                                                   Buckwheat
        should be carried out prior to the next rainy season.
                                                                                                                          115

                                                   Native Plant Communities
                                                   Natural ecological systems composed of native plant species serve
                                                   many essential functions. They serve as wildlife habitats, providing
                                                   nesting sites and feeding resources essential to many animals. When
                                                   native plants are destroyed, introduced species can invade an area
                                                   and preclude the return of native plants and animals. Many
                                                   introduced species do not provide suitable habitat or feeding
                                                   resources for animals. Due to their adaptive abilities, native plants
                                                   tend to require less water than most introduced species, and
 Platanus racemosa                                 contribute to the stabilization of soils on bluffs, hillsides, and
            California Sycamore                    watersheds. In addition, native plants are an integral component of
                                                   the visual landscape that defines the local area. Native plant
                                                   communities include: coastal sage; scrub oaks; chaparral; native oak
                                                   woodland, riparian vegetation and rare plant species, as designated by
                                                   the California Native Plant Society. Oak trees require special
                                                   management, since they are easily harmed by surrounding land uses,
                                                   and grow slowly.

                                                   grading. Plantings shall be of native, drought-tolerant plant species
                                                   consistent with the existing native vegetation on the site. Invasive
                                                   plant species that tend to supplant native species shall be prohibited.
                                                   Implementation Policies
                                                   34. Develop an ordinance for the protection of native oak, walnut,
                                                        sycamore, and other native trees with provisions for the design
                                                        and siting of structures to minimize the impact of grading,
                                                        paving, construction of roads, runoff and erosion on native trees.
                                                        In particular, require that grading and paving not adversely affect
                                                        root zone aeration and stability of native trees. [5-year]

35. Develop an inventory of native plant communities. [10-year]
36. The City shall conduct a city-wide survey to identify important
     trees on both private and public property. Importance of a tree
     may be determined by type, age, location or historical
     significance and shall further establish regulations as necessary
     for the protection of such importance trees. [5-year]
                   Environmental Consequences
  Policies and implementation policies for native plant communities
  include protection of oak trees and requirements to preserve native
  plant communities from development.                Measures include
  restrictions on development in the area of significant native plant
  communities and oak trees. Policies and implementation policies
  would provide protection for the native plant communities and
  environmental consequences would be positive.
Butterfly Habitat
Tagging studies indicate that the Monarch Butterfly (Danaus plexippus)
migrates southward over long distances to escape cold winters. The
Monarchs wintering grounds are areas within a coastal strip
extending from Los Angeles to Monterey. These wintering grounds
are roosting habitats consisting of a circular configuration of tall
trees, usually eucalyptus, which are essential for a mating phase of the
Monarch’s life cycle. Such roosting ground exists within the
Planning Area, in designated sites in Salzgeber Meadow, the
Carpinteria oil and gas plant buffer zone and possibly other locations.
During the fall and winter months, the trees are used by massive
numbers of Monarchs as communal roosts. These winter clusters
represent the most sensitive part of the Monarch’s life cycle. Re-
population of the species depends upon the mating phase that occurs
in these specialized habitats. Little is known about the behavior
patterns and migration routes of the Monarch Butterfly; therefore,
the habitat is of important scientific, educational and general public
interest.
Objective OSC-8: Protect and conserve Monarch butterfly
tree habitat.

                                                     Policies and implementation policies have been developed to
                                                     prevent soil erosion and other disturbances. These measures for
                                                     soil conservation are specific to preventing soil losses that may
                                                     occur during development. The policies and implementation
                                                     policies, to require coverage or erosion control treatment of all
                                                     areas disturbed for urban uses, would prevent erosion problems.
                                                     The policies and implementation policies for soil resources would
                                                     result in a positive environmental effect for soil conservation.
                                                   Water Resources
                                                   Water resources in the Carpinteria Planning Area include the
                                                   Carpinteria Groundwater Basin and its watershed area of eight creeks
                                                   and their tributaries, as well as the Pacific Ocean. Water resources
                                                   provide places for recreation, scenic areas, and provide for
                                                   community water use needs. Creek corridors also support riparian
                                                   habitats and serve as flood control channels for stormwater runoff.
                                                   Conserving water resources and their environments is important to
                                                   sustain riparian ecosystems, to support the community’s existing
                                                   population, and to support future growth and development.
                                                   The Carpinteria Valley Water District is the water purveyor for the
                                                   entire Carpinteria Valley, including the city and Planning Area. It
                                                   encompasses approximately 8,912 acres. It supplies about two thirds
                                                   or 4,500 acre-feet of the 7,000 acre-feet used in the Carpinteria
                                                   Valley. The remaining 2,500 acre-feet are pumped from the
                                                   groundwater basin by private well owners primarily for irrigation
                                                   purposes.
                                                   The CVWD obtains half of its water supplies from District
                                                   groundwater wells, and about half from Lake Cachuma. As of 1998,
                                                   CVWD has the option of ordering State water from northern
                                                   California to supplement its Lake Cachuma water supplies. Water
                                                   from Lake Cachuma is piped through facilities owned by the federal
                                                   government, but operated and maintained by the Cachuma
                                                   Operation and Maintenance Board. This Board is a joint powers
                                                   agency comprised of five member agencies, including CVWD. Water
                                                   supplies within the CVWD are delivered to its customers on demand
                                                   for agricultural, commercial, municipal and industrial water uses.
                                                   The Carpinteria groundwater basin underlies the water district
                                                   boundary, and is approximately 12 square miles, with a capacity of
                                                   170,000 acre-feet, and an estimated safe yield of approximately 5,000
                                                   acre-feet per year. The District adopted a Groundwater Management
                                                   Plan in 1996. The District operates four wells with various
                                                   capacities, and there are many other private wells operated within the
                                                   Planning Area, primarily for agricultural purposes. Water runoff
                                                   from the mountain range provides groundwater basin recharge.

Groundwater quality is generally good, and supply has been relatively
stable. However, concentrations of iron and manganese that exceed
State standards have been detected at a few locations, and the
District has implemented measures to mitigate these problems.
Carpinteria is identified as being a small, coastal community.
Protecting the waters off the coast and along Carpinteria’s coastline
will preserve water quality for recreational uses and marine habitats.
Objective OSC-10. Conserve all water resources, and protect
the quality of water.
Policies:
OSC-10a. Minimize the erosion and contamination of beaches.
Minimize the sedimentation, channelization and contamination of
surface water bodies.
OSC-10b. Continue to support water conservation measures to
provide an adequate supply of water to the community. Water
conservation may measure as low-flow plumbing fixtures and
drought tolerant landscape plans for new development.
OSC-10c. Degradation of the water quality of groundwater basins,
nearby streams or wetlands, or any other waterbody shall not result
from development. Pollutants such as sediments, litter, metals,
nutrients, chemicals, fuels or other petroleum hydrocarbons,
lubricants, raw sewage, organic matter and other harmful waste shall
not be discharged into or alongside any waterbody during or after
construction.
Implementation Policies
46. Work with the Carpinteria Valley Water District to implement
     the Carpinteria Groundwater Management Plan.
47. Work with the Carpinteria Valley Water District to implement
     CVWD’s wellhead protection programs.
48. Provide water conservation public information and educational
     outreach program to encourage residential participation in water
     conservation measures in coordination with CVWD.
49. Monitor surface water runoff to identify waterborne pollutants
     entering the Pacific Ocean. In conjunction with County and
     CVWD, a Watershed Management Plan should be established to
     prevent such contamination from occurring.
50. Require that proposals for development include information
     necessary to determine that an adequate water source exists for
     the project and that water will be provided without jeopardizing
     the availability of water to other parts of the community, i.e., a
                                                                                                                        123

South Central Coast Air Basin
The Carpinteria Planning Area is in a portion of the South Central
Coast Air Basin, under the jurisdiction of the Santa Barbara County
Air Pollution Control District (APCD) and has a fairly dry,
Mediterranean climate. Precipitation generally occurs between
November and April, providing approximately 14 inches of rain
annually.
The Planning Area is subject to the development of air pockets, or
inversion layers during the summer months of May through October.
This inversion layer rests at approximately 1,500 feet, and causes a
buildup of ozone in the air that exceed state and federal standards.
The predominant daytime winds are onshore. Occasionally,
meteorological conditions create offshore or southeasterly winds.
The predominant onshore wind condition helps maintain good air
quality by moving air pollution generated in the region to the east.
Many of the mobile emission sources are a direct result of
automobile emissions from community roadways and from Highway                       Only two sections of the Coastal Act

   (f) With respect to new facilities, all oilfield brines are reinjected into oil-producing zones unless the Division of Oil
   and Gas of the Department of Conservation determines to do so would adversely affect production of the reservoirs
   and unless injection into other subsurface zones will reduce environmental risks. Exceptions to reinjections will be
   granted consistent with the Ocean Waters Discharge Plan of the State Water Resources Control Board and where
   adequate provision is made for the elimination of petroleum odors and water quality problems.
   Where appropriate, monitoring programs to record land surface and near-shore ocean floor movements shall be
   initiated in locations of new large-scale fluid extraction on land or near shore before operations begin and shall
   continue until surface conditions have stabilized. Costs of monitoring and mitigation programs shall be borne by
   liquid and gas extraction operators.
   California Coastal Act §30265.
   The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
   (a) Offshore oil production will increase dramatically in the next 10 years from the current 80,000 barrels per day to
   over 400,000 barrels per day.
   (b) Transportation studies have concluded that pipeline transport of oil is generally both economically feasible and
   environmentally preferable to other forms of crude oil transport.
   (c) Oil companies have proposed to build a pipeline to transport offshore crude oil from central California to southern
   California refineries, and to transport offshore oil to out-of-state refiners.
   (d) California refineries would need to be retrofitted if California offshore crude oil were to be used directly as a
   major feedstock. Refinery modifications may delay achievement of air quality goals in the southern California air
   basin and other regions of the state.
   (e) The County of Santa Barbara has issued an Oil Transportation Plan which assesses the environmental and
   economic differences among various methods for transporting crude oil from offshore California to refineries.
   (f) The Governor should help coordinate decisions concerning the transport and refining of offshore oil in a manner
   which considers state and local studies undertaken to date, which fully addresses the concerns of all affected regions,
   and which promotes the greatest benefits to the people of the state.
   30265.5. (a) The Governor, or the Governor’s designee, shall coordinate activities concerning the transport and refining of offshore oil.
   Coordination efforts shall consider public health risks, the ability to achieve short- and long-term air emission reduction goals, the
   potential for reducing California’s vulnerability and dependence on oil imports, economic development and jobs, and other factors
   deemed important by the Governor, or the Governor’s designee.
   (b) The Governor, or the Governor’s designee, shall work with state and local agencies, and the public, to facilitate the transport and
   refining of offshore oil in a manner which will promote the greatest public health and environmental and economic benefits to the
   people of the state.
   (c) The Governor, or the Governor’s designee, shall consult with any individual or organization having knowledge in this area, including,
   but not limited to, representatives from the following:
   (1) State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission.
   (2) State Air Resources Board.
   (3) California Coastal Commission.
   (4) Department of Fish and Game.
   (5) State Lands Commission.
   (6) Public Utilities Commission.
   (7) Santa Barbara County.
   (8) Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District.

   (14) United States Department of Energy.
   (15) United States Environmental Protection Agency.
   (16) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   (17) United States Coast Guard.
   (d) This act is not intended, and shall not be construed, to decrease, duplicate, or supersede the jurisdiction, authority, or
   responsibilities of any local government, or any state agency or commission, to discharge its responsibilities concerning the
   transportation and refining of oil.

Visual
Visual Resources
Located on a coastal plain between the Santa Barbara Channel and
Santa Ynez Mountains, Carpinteria is afforded unique visual qualities.
Carpinteria is dominated by buildings and other man-made elements.
The surrounding coastal and foothill areas are characterized by
undisturbed natural features (e.g., marshes, bluffs, beaches and
parks), as well as by agriculture. Views of these natural areas vary
from short-range to long-range and are afforded from public areas,
such as streets, highways and open space areas, as well as from
private residences and businesses.
The most outstanding panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean and the
Channel Islands are from the Carpinteria Bluffs. A footpath wanders
along the bluff top from the western portion of the bluffs adjacent to
the Carpinteria oil & gas plant to the city’s eastern boundary, and
continues into unincorporated lands, connecting to Rincon Park as
well as County and Rincon State Beaches. From this trail, there are
spectacular vista points located at the end of Bailard Avenue in
Bluffs Area I, from the back of business park properties in Bluffs
Area II, and from the high point on Bluffs Area III. In addition,
looking across the freeway, the foothills and mountains form an
impressive backdrop to the north.
Preservation of views throughout Carpinteria aids in establishing
community identity and promoting aesthetic appeal by providing
visual access to landforms, urban forms and environments that are
familiar to local residents and unique to the city. Carpinteria’s creeks,
beaches, open spaces, foothills, agricultural lands, urbanized areas,
landscapes and landforms are all potential subjects for scenic views.
Scenic views of agriculturally productive land, particularly in the
foothills, can be seen from a variety of locations.
Objective OSC-13: Preserve Carpinteria’s visual resources.
Policies:
OSC-13a. Preserve broad, unobstructed views from the nearest
public street to the ocean, including but not limited to Linden
Avenue, Bailard Avenue, Carpinteria Avenue, and U.S. Highway 101.
In addition, design and site new development on or adjacent to
bluffs, beaches, streams, or the Salt Marsh to prevent adverse
impacts on these visual resources. New development shall be subject
to all of the following measures
a. Height and siting restrictions to avoid obstruction of existing
    views of visual resources from the nearest public areas.
b. In addition to the bluff setback required for safety, additional
    bluff setbacks may be required for oceanfront structures to
    minimize or avoid impacts on public views from the beach.
                                                                                                                          129

                                                        Blufftop structures shall be set back from the bluff edge
                                                        sufficiently far to ensure that the structure does not infringe on
                                                        views from the beach except in areas where existing structures
                                                        already impact public views from the beach. In such cases, the
                                                        new structure shall not be greater in height than adjacent

                                                        proposed development. Patios, balconies, porches and similar
                                                        appurtenances, shall not encroach beyond a plane created by
                                                        extending a straight line between the nearest corners closest to
                                                        the beach from the existing balconies, porches or similar

OSC-13i. Design all new development to fit the site topography,
soils, geology, hydrology, and other existing conditions and be
oriented so that grading and other site preparation is kept to an
absolute minimum. Preserve all natural landforms, natural drainage
systems, and native vegetation. Require all areas on the site not
suited to development, as evidenced by competent soils, geology and
hydrology investigation and reports remain as open space.
OSC-13j. Establish a “night-sky” ordinance that provides standards
for the reduction of direct and ambient light in the night sky.

                       Environmental Consequences
       The City has developed policies and implementation policies to
       preserve and enhance the visual quality and views within and
       around the City. Several of the policies would require new
       development to be reviewed with respect to potential impacts to
       visual resources. Other policies would promote the protection of
       open space in Carpinteria. The implementation measure would
       amend the Zoning Ordinance to include view protection design
       specifications. Policies and their implementation would work to
       preserve the visual resources with an emphasis on open space
       preservation, therefore environmental consequences would be
       positive.

                                                   The Park and Open Space Standards and Guidelines (1990) of the
                                                   National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) provides
                                                   suggested facility design standards as guidelines that can be adapted
                                                   to local needs. It suggests park standards and a ratio of park space to
                                                   population. The NRPA recognizes that parkland standards and
                                                   needs vary widely for different communities, and that the NRPA
                                                   design standards are recommended only as suggestions. Actual
                                                   facility size and standards should be based on current, survey data
                                                   and parks and recreation needs assessment.                   The NRPA
                                                   recommended design standards suggest approximately five-to-eight

                                                   Important factors affecting Carpinteria’s park needs are the
                                                   population, the demographics of the population, especially age, and
                                                   amount of park space available locally and in the immediate region.

                                                   acres of space per 1000 population. Although below the ideal
                                                   offered by the NRPA, the region’s wealth of other open spaces (e.g.
                                                   beaches and mountains) available to the public offer a more accurate
                                                   perspective of the adequacy of available parks and open space.
                                                   The City’s parks and recreation system functions under the principle
                                                   of providing both active and passive recreation. Active recreation
                                                   areas are typically sited in neighborhood and community parks.
                                                   Passive recreation areas provide protection for Environmentally
                                                   Sensitive Habitat Areas and public educational opportunities about
                                                   the unique coastal resources and often also provide for public access
                                                   to coastal areas. The City’s parks and recreational facilities are
                                                   planned as a network interconnected by a trail system for pedestrians
                                                   and bicycles.
                                                   Coastal resources are a significant open space resource in Carpinteria.
                                                   Coastal access is a protected public right specified in the Coastal Act.
                                                   The Coastal Act protects public access to coastal resources while
                                                   protecting the environmental quality of coastal resources, especially
                                                   sensitive habitats.

Other Open Space / Recreational Facilities
There are additional public or private park and recreation facilities
available to residents within the Carpinteria Planning Area.
Carpinteria State Beach (84.0 acres). State beach and campground,
located along the shoreline of Carpinteria. Includes 262 overnight
campsites, picnic areas, beach area, tidepools, swimming, surfing, and
Chumash Indian interpretive displays.
Lions Park (3.0 acres). Private facility, used by reservation only.
Includes barbecues, tables, volleyball, playground, and horseshoe pit.
Los Padres National Forest. The National Forest surrounds the
Planning Area to the north of the city and provides hiking trails and
camping facilities.
Rincon Beach Park (9.4 acres). County facility located to the
south of Carpinteria, includes shoreline, rocky beach, passive
recreational park, restrooms, parking lot and picnic tables.
Santa Barbara Polo Field (approximately 48 acres). Privately
owned club has riding ring, stables, three polo fields, polo clubhouse,
eight tennis courts, tennis clubhouse, tennis swimming pool, 112
condominiums.
Santa Claus Lane Beach. County beach area, with unofficial
coastal access to public beach use area. No facilities or parking lot.
Toro Canyon Park. County park, including ball fields, picnic
facilities, barbecues, playground areas, and equestrian facilities.
Vacant Properties. There are several properties interspersed
throughout Carpinteria that are zoned for other land uses but that are
currently undeveloped, vacant parcels. In the interim, residents use
these properties as open space areas to walk through, play in, or
simply to enjoy open views of the surrounding area. Vacant parcels
also serve as groundwater recharge areas, where water can seep
through the soil back into the groundwater basin. An example of
such an area is the vacant parcel set aside as a part of the Carpinteria
oil & gas plant for an open space buffer. It is located between the
former marketing terminal site and the Arbol Verde neighborhood in
Bluffs “0”, is bounded by a eucalyptus windrow on the east side and
inhabited by a variety of trees, some that provide Monarch butterfly
habitat.

Schools. Schools provide additional open space and recreational
opportunities for residents. Residents use public school playgrounds
and ball fields during after school hours for recreational purposes.
School playgrounds provide approximately 60 acres of additional
open space area for community residents.
Schools within the Carpinteria Planning Area are administered by the
Carpinteria Unified School District, and include the following
schools (see Figure OSC-2):
     A.   Aliso Elementary School
     B.   Canalino Elementary (and Canalino Early Childhood
          Learning Center and Special Education)
     C. Carpinteria Middle School

During the General Plan visioning process issues were identified to
help prioritize park and recreation needs in the community.
Objective OSC-14. Provide for adequate park and recreation
facilities to meet the needs of the community and visitors.
Policies:
OSC-14a. Increase coastal and recreational access for all segments
of the population, including the disabled and elderly, while protecting
natural resources, particularly environmentally sensitive habitat areas.
OSC-14b. Provide for passive recreation uses of natural open space
areas, such as along creeks and the Bluffs 1 areas, where such uses
would not damage the resources being protected.
OSC-14c. Increase opportunities for ocean recreation programs
including: kayaking, sailing, snorkeling, and scuba diving through the
city Parks and Recreation Department, and by encouraging private
development of these activities.
OSC-14d. In a zone extending approximately 250 feet inland from
the mean high tide line, priority shall be given to coastal dependent
and related recreational activities and support facilities. However,
camping facilities should be set back from the beach and bluffs and
near-shore areas reserved for day use activities. Recreational activities
that are not coastal dependent may be located within this 250-foot
zone if the less desirable coastal dependent support facilities
                                                                                                                         135

(parking, restrooms, etc.) are located inland. In no case shall
facilities, except for required structures (i.e. lifeguard towers,
volleyball nets, etc.) be located directly on the sandy beach.
OSC-14e. Recreational uses on ocean front land, both public and
private, that do not require extensive alteration of the natural
environment shall have priority over uses requiring substantial
alteration.
OSC-14f. No unrelated development shall be permitted in publicly
owned recreational areas except pipelines to serve coastal dependent
industrial uses when no alternative route is feasible.
OSC-14g. In implementing all proposals made in the General
Plan/Land Use Plan for expanding opportunities for coastal access
and recreation, utilize purchase in fee (simple) only after all other less
costly alternatives have been studied and rejected as infeasible.
Other alternatives may include: purchase of easements, recreation
preserve contracts, and mandatory dedication in connection with
development.
OSC-14h. Support habitat preservation by establishing habitat
preserves and open space for passive and active recreation by
developing programs including, but not limited to: transfer of
development rights; conservation easements; land acquisition grants;
partnership agreements between private developers, the City, school
districts, State Park, and the National Forest; overlay performance
zoning; development impact fees for recreational resources and
services; and use fees and fines.
OSC-14i. For new developments between Sandyland Road and City
Beach, the City shall determine the extent to which the land
proposed for development has historically been used by the public
for informal parking and beach access and shall require adequate
provision for continuation of such use.
OSC-14j. For all developments between the first public road and the
ocean, granting of lateral easements to allow for public access along
the shoreline shall be mandatory. In coastal areas, where the bluffs
exceed five feet in height, all dry sandy beach seaward of the base of
the bluff shall be dedicated to the City. In coastal areas where the
bluffs are less than five feet, the area to be dedicated shall be
determined by the City. At a minimum, the dedicated easement shall
be adequate to allow for lateral access during periods of high tide.
OSC-14k. In those areas where it is established that the public
acquired a right of access through use, custom or legislative
authorization, new development shall not interfere with or diminish
such access. This policy shall be interpreted to allow flexibility in
                                                                                                                          137

                                                   OSC-14l. The City shall accept all offers to dedicate public access
                                                   ways, including those already recorded, and shall open them to the
                                                   public as soon as possible. If after five years the OTD has not been
                                                   opened, the City shall make the OTD available to another
                                                   governmental agency or non-profit organization who is willing to
                                                   open it.
                                                   Implementation Policies
                                                   60. Adopt a management plan for parks and open space that
                                                        integrates planning for trails, coastal access and recreation, and
                                                        protectio n of significant biological resources.
                                                   61. Support development of new or expanded park and recreation
                                                        facilities as demand/need dictates. When latent demand for
                                                        parks and recreation facilities is identified, adequate parkland and
                                                        facilities shall be identified and pursued.
                                                   62. Continue to update and collect parkland in-lieu, Quimby, and
                                                        development impact fees to assist the City in acquisition of new
                                                        parkland to maintain the desired level of service. The minimum
                                                        level of service shall be 3 acres per 1000 population. Park impact

                    Environme ntal Consequences
   The City’s policies concerning parks and recreation are intended
   to improve the recreational opportunities in the city. Recreational
   improvements generally require open space and are not intensively
   developed. For these reasons, environmental consequences are
   generally beneficial. The implementation policies for these
   policies specify what would be done to develop recreational
   opportunities for the city.
   The majority of the implementation policies would have beneficial
   environmental effects such as collecting Quimby fees from new
   development.       Implementation policies which discuss the
   development of a trail from Linden Avenue through the State
   Park Dunes and outdoor lighting facilities at the High School
   could have potentially adverse environmental impacts.
   There are two primary environmental concerns regarding the
   implementation measure 58. First during trail construction,
   wildlife, vegetation and the sand dunes may be adversely affected.
   Environmental consequences would vary depending on how
   intensively the trail is developed and its size. For example, use of
   heavy equipment for construction may result in greater impacts
   than a crew with hand tools. Similarly, if the trail is wide, fenced,
   or surfaced, greater impacts may result than if the trail is
   developed as a dirt or sand path with appropriate erosion control
   measures.
   Once a trail is developed, the other environmental concerns are
   related to the ecology of the area. With the introduction of
   people, wildlife patterns and behavior may be adversely impacted.
   Depending on the location of the trail and the species of plants
   and animals in the area, fragmentation of habitat could result, thus
   potentially degrading the overall health of the ecosystem.
Trails & Coastal Access
The City currently has two pedestrian hiking trails located adjacent to
Class I bikeway paths along Carpinteria and Franklin Creeks. There
are additional informal trails used by residents that extend into
Carpinteria Valley and the foothills. These trails do not extend all the
way to the coastline. Routes to the coastline from Carpinteria
Avenue-south are provided primarily via public streets. Public access
to the coast is accommodated by the City and State Beaches, the
Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve, Tar Pits Park and the Carpinteria
Bluffs.
                                                                                                                          139

                                                   provide additional recreation and access opportunities by
                                                   expanding the trail system.
                                                   Policies:
                                                   OSC-15a. The City’s trail system shall be maintained and expanded
                                                   upon based upon Figure C-3, the Trails Map, and, if approved by the

                                                   creekways designated as open space up to the foothills of the         GP
                                                   Santa Ynez mountain range. This should include exploring
                                                   trail development for public use along the Edison easement behind
                                                   Carpinteria High School, ending on the first ridge above the city.
                                                   This should be linked to the old Franklin trail, leading to the ridge up
                                                   to East Camino Cielo. Trail restoration and enhancement of
                                                   easement areas should be pursued to restore the natural beauty along
                                                   these trails by negotiating with property owners, the school district,
                                                   and the National Forest, to redesign trails and adopt protective

                                                   significant direct or indirect adverse impacts on the riparian habitats
                                                   of the creeks or the Carpinteria Salt Marsh.
                                                   Implementation Policies
                                                   69. Prepare and adopt a Trails Master Plan that includes a ranking
                                                        system to identify appropriate locations for new trails and for
                                                        enhancing the existing trail system. The Plan should include
                                                        identifying funding, budgeting, and capital improvement
                                                        resources for trail land acquisition, development and
                                                        maintenance.      The Plan should also identify entities and
                                                        programs where the City could participate in joint partnerships
                                                        with other entities such as the school district, the National
                                                        Forest, County, and private property owners. [5-year]
                                                   70. Continue the development of a coastline trail to extend from
                                                        Carpinteria City Beach to Rincon Beach Park with vertical access
                                                        points placed as frequently as possible to encourage public
                                                        access.
                                                   71. Conduct a feasibility study on a trail running north/south from

                                                        should include analysis of alternative routes, protection of ESH
                                                        areas, and the need for a crossing of the railroad track.

72. Prepare a program (including funding, landscaping, maintenance,
     dedication of easements, etc.) for the development of
     Carpinteria, Santa Monica and Franklin Creek trails. [10-year]
73. As a part of the development of the trail system, minimize the
     number of formal rail crossings for pedestrians and improve
     their safety through crossing controls or other improvements
     such as fencing and landscaping. Seek joint funding for such
     improvements from state and federal agencies and the railroad.
                   Environmental Consequences
The City’s objective for trails is to maintain and expand the existing
trail system. Trails are typically of low environmental impact if used
for passive recreation and constructed with erosion control measures.
The City’s policies outline areas where trail development should take
place and what characteristics should be included into plans. Policy
OSC-15b and implementation policies 58 and 59 are specific about
the development of a trail along the coastline. This trail would have
the potential to disrupt the ecology of sensitive areas in the vicinity
of the trail.      As described above in Parks and Recreation,
construction effects of a trail and the introduction of people in an
ecosystem have the potential to degrade the characteristics of that
ecosystem. Disruptions to the behavior and processes of flora and
fauna and problems such as erosion can have negative environmental
consequences. One implementation measure for trails calls for the
preparation of a Master Plan for Trails. This Master Plan should
include an environmental review to identify potentially negative
environmental effects.
Sand dunes could be adversely affected if the trail impedes the
morphology of the sand dune system by limiting sand replenishment,
altering wind patterns within the dune area, or displacing sand dunes.
Fencing and boardwalks with permanent foundations could result in
these types of effects.
Use of boardwalks linked by rope or wire that can be easily moved
would mitigate these types of effects. It should be noted that while
there is a potential for these types of effects, objectives, policies, and
implementation policies of the Open Space and Conservation
Element, specifically for Beaches, Tidelands, and Subtidal Reefs and
other subsequent environmental review would prevent or mitigate
these types of effects.

                                                          potentially adverse environmental effects. Nighttime lighting could
                                                          affect the adjacent neighborhood or residences with views of the
                                                          fields. Light and glare from outdoor lighting can be minimized by
                                                          the use of hoods on the lamps to reduce spill of light into the sky

                                                          increase noise and potentially affect residences in the vicinity of the
                                                          school. Noise could be expected from traffic and loud voices or
                                                          possibly loud speakers. Noise would likely be intermittent in nature
                                                          and would not extend late into the evening. The potential impacts
                                                          of lighting for the High School should be considered by the City
                                                          and possibly included as part of the noise ordinance.
                                                          Other implementation policies that could indirectly result in adverse
                                                          environmental effects include studying the feasibility of developing
                                                          a golf course in the Planning Area. Golf courses use water,
                                                          pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers to maintain the quality of the
                                                          course. Water use should be analyzed for its impact to water
                                                          resources and supplies of the city.           Use of chemicals for
                                                          maintenance of the greens can have adverse environmental impacts
                                                          to water quality and other flora and fauna that are exposed to these
                                                          types of chemicals. If a plan is developed for a golf course, it
                                                          should be consistent with other objectives in the Open Space and
                                                          Conservation Element and any other plans, such as a watershed
                                                          plan. It should be noted that the implementation measure only calls
                                                          for a feasibility study. This environmental review is intended to
                                                          identify potential effects that may be considered during the
                                                          feasibility study or other subsequent environmental review.

                                                   There are several historically significant locations in the Carpinteria
                                                   Planning Area. For instance, it was discovered in 1929 during
                                                   archaeological investigations, that the Carpinteria Marsh Area was
                                                   once inhabited by Native American cultures,
                                                        ...beginning with the Oak Grove peoples, and concluding with the
                                                        Chumash Indians, who occupied the marsh from about 500 A.D.
                                                        until the mid-19th century. (California Coastal Resource Guide,
                                                        pg. 256.)
                                                   There are also large tarry asphalt deposits beneath the beach and cliff
                                                   area east of Carpinteria Creek. The Chumash Indians used the tar to
                                                   seal their canoes and cooking utensils. The City has established four
                                                   historical landmarks within their boundaries, and the State has
                                                   established one State Historical Landmark. These include:

                                                   Wardholme To rrey Pine, Carpinteria City Landmark #1, located
                                                   at: 5160 Carpinteria Avenue.
                                                   Heath Ranch Park and Adobe, Carpinteria City Landmark #2,
                                                   located on Eucalyptus Street. This site was designated as a City
                                                   Landmark in 1975. It was discovered in the early 1970s during the
                                                   development of a new housing project. The adobe, now a ruin, is the
                                                   last adobe in the Carpinteria Valley. It was previously included as
                                                   part of the Heath residence, a Victorian-era home, in 1881

                                                   parkway between 7th and 8th Streets, at the corner of Linden
                                                   Avenue and 7th Street. The Palms were planted prior to 1912, and
                                                   were incorporated into the development of the Palms Hotel. The
                                                   palm trees were designated by the City as a City Landmark in 1977.
                                                   Portola Sycamore Tree, Carpinteria City Landmark #5, located

Objective OSC-16: Preserve Carpinteria’s cultural resources.
Policy:
OSC-16a. Carefully review any development that may disturb
important archaeological or historically valuable sites.
Implementation Policies
74. Explore all available measures, including purchase, tax relief,
     purchase of development rights, etc. to avoid development on
     important archaeological sites. Where these measures are not
     feasible and development will adversely affect identified
     archaeological or paleontological resources, require adequate
     mitigation.
75. Prohibit activities, other than development, which could damage
     or destroy archaeological sites, including off-road vehicle use and
     unauthorized collecting of artifacts.
76. Review all proposals for development in or adjacent to cultural
     resource areas for their potential to impact the resource. Give
     special consideration to development of facilities that enhance
     the cooperation, enjoyment or maintenance of these areas.
77. Prior to the city granting a development permit, all
     archaeological sites (or areas near known archeological sites that
     have been determined though Phase 1 investigation to potentially
     include cultural or paleontolgical resources) must undergo a
     subsurface test to determine the integrity and significance of the
     site. Through the project environmental review process, the
     disposition and/or preservation of any archaeological sites
     deemed to have significance as a result of the subsurface testing
     shall be determined. Preservation of cultural/paleontological
     resource sites through avoidance shall be preferred, however,
     other methods of disposition may be approved through the
     environmental review process as identified in the city’s
     Guidelines for the Implementation of CEQA.
78. A qualified archaeologist and Native American observer
     (acceptable to the city) shall be retained to monitor grading
     activities on identified archeological sites and in the vicinity of
     identified archaeological resources. If cultural artifacts or similar
     material of potential cultural or paleontological importance, are
     uncovered during grading or other excavation the following shall
     occur:
     a. The monitor or archaeologist shall halt the grading or
          excavation and notify the City.
                                                                                                                           145

                                                        b. A qualified archaeologist shall prepare a report assessing the
                                                            significance of the find and recommending any actions to be

                                                            for grading to resume.
                                                        c. The removal of cultural artifacts or other materials shall only
                                                            occur after preparation of the report and in conformance

                                                     The policies and implementation policies regarding historical
                                                     resources in Carpinteria are intended to preserve archaeological and
                                                     historical resources. Policies and implementation policies to
                                                     preserve historical resources focus on deterring loss of these
                                                     resources to development and strategies for preservation. These
                                                     measures would have a positive environmental consequence.

                                                   Debris and mud flows often occur after periods of precipitation,
                                                   when water-soaked soil and rock are destabilized by the weight of the
                                                   water. Often compounding the added weight is erosion of the base
                                                   of a hill slope. Once the slope becomes destabilized, the water, soil,
                                                   and mud mass is driven downhill by gravity. Areas susceptible to
                                                   debris and mud flows correspond to the areas with a high potential

                                                   Rock falls are usually triggered by seismically induced ground shaking
                                                   or by erosional destabilization of a hill slope. Areas prone to rock

Policies:
S-2a. Areas identified on Figure S-2 as High Landslide Potential
shall either be designated in an open space zoning category or the
potential for landslide will be mitigated through avoiding disturbance
of the slope area of the site subject to landslide potential.
S-2b. Building improvements and other development including any
irrigated landscape areas shall be setback sufficiently to protect the
development and all associated improvements from bluff failure and
bluff retreat over a 100-year term.
Implementation Policies
5. Geotechnical investigations shall be performed in areas of high
     landslide or seacliff (bluff) retreat potential that are proposed to
     be developed. Calculations shall be performed for areas
     identified as being prone to landslides to evaluate the factor(s) of
     safety for existing and proposed slopes in their naturally-
     occurring state, and during a maximum credible earthquake along
     the nearest fault. Further, said investigation shall include a
     determination of the minimum setback for proposed structures
     and other improvements to be maintained outside of the area
     subject to bluff retreat over a 100 year term. In the area
     identified as Carpinteria Bluffs subject to potential seacliff retreat
     on Figure S-2, existing railroad improvements and cut slopes
     shall not be expanded or altered. Maintenance or protection
     proposed for existing slopes shall be reviewed through the
     coastal development permit process.              Slope stabilization
     techniques (e.g. seawalls and similar structures) shall be
     prohibited unless necessary to protect existing structure(s) in
     danger of erosion, and when no less environmentally damaging
     alternative is feasible.
6. Geotechnical investigations shall be performed on hillside
     properties proposed to be developed. Hillside properties
     proposed to be developed within or below areas of high rock fall
     potential should be evaluated for rock fall hazards. Calculations
     shall be performed for areas identified to be prone to mud flows,
     debris flows, and/or rock falls to evaluate the necessity for mud
     flow, debris flow, and/or rock fall diversion walls and/or
     structures, and for the safety of future inhabitants.

                                                   Soil Settlement
                                                   Settlement is the downward movement of soil or of structures it
                                                   supports, resulting from a reduction in the voids in the underlying
                                                   strata. Areas with high soil settlement potential are shown on Figure

                                                   Subsidence
                                                   Subsidence is the reduction in volume of a material resulting from an
                                                   increase in the density of a material. It is generally related to the
                                                   withdrawal of fluids such as water, oil, or gas from the subsurface.
                                                   The potential for subsidence in the city is considered minimal, as no
                                                   recognized subsidence has occurred within the planning area due to
                                                   either groundwater or oil extraction.
                                                   Hydrocompaction
                                                   Hydrocompaction occurs in relatively loose, open textured soils
                                                   above the groundwater table. No areas of hydrocompaction have
                                                   been identified in the planning area.
                                                   Objective S-3: Minimize the potential risks and reduce the
                                                   loss of property and the economic and social dislocations
                                                   resulting from expansive soils, soil settlement, subsidence,

                                                   Flooding Potential
                                                   Flooding in the Carpinteria planning area is generally produced by
                                                   winter storms occurring between December and March. Several
                                                   local streams that discharge into the Pacific Ocean cross through the
                                                   planning area, including Carpinteria Creek, Santa Monica Creek,
                                                   Franklin Creek, Arroyo Paredo, and Toro Canyon Creek. The
                                                   Carpinteria, Santa Monica, and Franklin Creeks have been
                                                   channelized by the Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water
                                                   Conservation District, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
                                                   U.S. Soil Conservation Service. The Santa Barbara County Flood
                                                   Control Engineer has determined that lands above 250 feet elevation
                                                   in the Carpinteria area would be free from flood hazard in the area of
                                                   the channelized creeks.
                                                   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
                                                   established National Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), which
                                                   designate flood zones for the Carpinteria planning area. The maps
                                                   were last updated for Carpinteria and adjacent areas in September of
                                                   1985. Areas within the 100-year flood zone include:

property.
Flood hazard zones in the planning area are shown on Figure S-4.
Objective S-4: Minimize the potential risks and reduce the
loss of life, property and the economic and social
dislocations resulting from flooding.
Policies:
S-4a. All new development proposed in the 100-year floodplain
must adhere to the County of Santa Barbara Floodplain Management
Ordinance, Chapter 15-A of the County Code.
S-4b. The development of critical facilities within the 100-year
floodplain should be discouraged.
S-4c. Setbacks from flood control channels, as determined by the
Santa Barbara County Flood Control District, will be required to
allow access to maintain and enable proper operation of the
channels.
S-4d. The City should conduct a floodplain study for the west end
of the planning area and confer with FEMA in an attempt to update
the 100- and 500-year flood zones in that area.
S-4e. The City shall establish setback guidelines for land use
planning purposes along natural creek, river, or stream floodplains,
and identify and pursue opportunities to eliminate existing concrete
channels and/or banking from creeks, rivers, or streams.
Implementation Policies
10. Compliance with the City’s Floodplain Management Measures
    will be required prior to issuance of building permits for any type
    of individual development project proposed in the 100-year
    floodplain.
11. All subdivision projects proposed in the 100-year floodplain
    must be reviewed by the Santa Barbara County Flood Control
    District prior to the issuance of grading and/or building permits.
12. The City should initiate a floodplain study for the west end of
    the planning area, specifically the Beach neighborhood, in order
    to determine whether the base flood elevations determined by
    FEMA is accurate.

                                                   Wildland and Urban Fires
                                                   Fire prevention and suppression services are provided in Carpinteria
                                                   by the Carpinteria-Summerland Fire Protection District, which also
                                                   has mutual aid agreements with the Ventura County and Santa
                                                   Barbara County Fire Departments. If the resources of these
                                                   departments/agencies are depleted, assistance can also be obtained
                                                   through various state agencies, (Office of Emergency Services, the
                                                   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the State Fire Marshall,
                                                   and the Department of Fish and Game) and federal agencies (U.S.
                                                   Forest Service, the National Park Service and Bureau of Land
                                                   Management, and the Department of Defense).
                                                   Urban fires are defined as those fires occurring within the city limits.
                                                   They are usually residential, commercial, or industrial in nature, and
                                                   are usually fought by the Carpinteria-Summerland Fire Protection
                                                   District. Wildland, or brush, fires are defined as those fires occurring
                                                   in undeveloped areas commonly covered by heavy vegetation,
                                                   typically in the hills and canyons. The Santa Barbara County Fire
                                                   Department generally responds to wildland fires outside the urban
                                                   limit zone defined by the Carpinteria-Summerland Fire Protection
                                                   District. Fire hazard zones in the planning area are shown on Figure
                                                   S-5.
                                                   Peakload Water Requirements
                                                   Peak load water supply standards ensure that sufficient water flow is
                                                   available to fight fires. The minimum fire flow required is
                                                   determined by the type of building construction, proximity to other
                                                   structures, fire walls, and fire protection devices, as specified by the
                                                   latest version of the Uniform Fire Code.
                                                   Evacuation Routes
                                                   The Carpinteria-Summerland Fire Protection District, in conjunction
                                                   with the County of Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department, is ultimately
                                                   responsible for coordinating evacuation necessitated by an
                                                   emergency. The main evacuation route from the Carpinteria
                                                   planning area is U.S. Highway 101. A secondary evacuation route is
                                                   the Union Pacific Railroad, which parallels U.S. Highway 101.
                                                   However, the use of the railroad for evacuation would be dependent
                                                   upon the availability of rail cars for transportation.

                                                   16. Applicants for new development projects in Carpinteria must
                                                        verify that the water purveyor can provide the required volume
                                                        of water to satisfy the peakload water requirements for the
                                                        project.
                                                   17. Prior to construction of new developments, applicants must
                                                        submit plans to the Carpinteria-Summerland Fire Protection

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Large Industrial Facilities
Two large industrial facilities and two Carpinteria Valley Water
District water treatment plants are located in the planning area.
These include the Carpinteria Oil & Gas Plant, the Carpinteria
Sanitary District Wastewater Treatment Plant, and the water
treatment sites located at 4810 Foothill Road on the Carpinteria High
School property and at El Carro Lane and Namouna Street on the El
Carro Park property. These facilities may store and/or use
flammable hazardous materials/waste, highly toxic and corrosive
materials/waste, as well as acutely hazardous materials/waste. A risk
assessment performed for the Carpinteria Oil and Gas facility
indicates that four types of ha zards were possible from the facility:
radiant heat from a fire; a flammable gas cloud moving off the
Venoco facility; a blast strong enough to rupture eardrums; and a
blast strong enough to cause major glass damage. The approximate
locations of the large industrial facilities/sites are shown on Figure S-
6.
Acutely Hazardous Materials
Twenty-one facilities in the planning area have been identified as
handling acutely hazardous materials. Table S-3 in Appendix E for
this Safety Element lists the facilities. The approximate locations of
the facilities that handle acutely hazardous materials are shown on
Figure S-6.
Pesticides
The State Department of Agriculture identifies 132 facilities in the
planning area that handle pesticides (see Table S-4 in Appendix E).
Crude Oil
Crude oil activities have occurred onshore, and continue to exist
offshore in the Carpinteria area.            The State Department of
Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources
(CDOG) governs crude oil and natural gas activities within
California. Maps showing the locations of active, abandoned and idle
oil or natural gas wells and facilities are available through the CDOG.
Transportation Corridors
U.S. Highway 101 is the major vehicular transportation corridor
through the Carpinteria planning area. Trucks hauling hazardous
materials travel along Highway 101 northward and southward. The
Union Pacific Railroad is another transportation corridor in the
planning area. Freighter rail cars are known to carry hazardous
materials through the city. Specifically, jet fuel is transported from
                                                                                                                         163

                                                   large industrial facilities, at facilities handling acutely
                                                   hazardous materials, and along transportation corridors.
                                                   Policies:
                                                   S-6a. The City should maintain lists of facilities in the planning area
                                                   that involve the use, storage, and/or transportation of hazardous
                                                   materials.

   GP             land use and urban development adjacent to active
                  agricultural fields within the planning area. The City,
            through the State Department of Agriculture, will identify active
            agricultural fields of particular concern as those handling acutely
            hazardous pesticides.
        25. No structures will be constructed over active or abandoned oil
            wells unless the oil well(s) have been abandoned or reabandoned
            per the California Department of Oil, Gas and Geothermal
            Resources (CDOG) procedures, and under the CDOG’s

             26. Train speeds through Carpinteria should be maintained at
   GP             levels that serve to minimize the potential for derailed train
                  cars to leave the railroad right of way as a result of an
            accident.
                                        Environmental Consequences
The Safety Element is intended, through adoption of its policies and implementation policies, to reduce
death, injuries, property damage and economic and social dislocation from natural and man made hazards.
Hazards including seismic, slope-stability, soil, flood, fire, hazardous materials have policies and
implementation policies developed to prevent or reduce the risk of such hazards. Specific requirements and
recommendations for design criteria and planning are included in the policies and implementation policies of
the element. Policies and implementation policies would not directly require development of projects that                       165
would negatively affect the environment, such as construction of a seawall or stream channelization.
Consequently, these policies and implementation policies would have a beneficial effect on the City.

                                                   1. The City will use the land use/noise compatibility matrix shown
                                                        on Figure N-3 to determine the appropriateness of land uses

                                                        proposed in an area where noise exceeds the “normally
                                                        acceptable” level shown on Figure N-3.

                                                        (Title 25 California Administrative Code) to ensure an acceptable
                                                        interior noise level of 45 CNEL in habitable rooms.
                                                   4. The City will consider the use of alternative paving material and
                                                        “traffic calming” devices that reduce traffic noise (See the
                                                        Circulation Element for examples of traffic calming devices).

                                                   6. The City will designate truck routes, limiting trucking through
                                                        residential areas.
                                                  Environmental Consequences
      The Noise Element is intended to reduce noise impacts and prevent noise impacts from future noise
      sources. Many of the policies and implementation policies developed for transportation related noise
      intend to plan noise compatible land uses together and minimize noise from roads, railroads, industrial,
      and agricultural sources. These policies would generally have an overall beneficial effect on the City by
      reducing noise.
      Implementation of some noise mitigation measures, such as earthen berms or wood or concrete noise
      barriers, may result in aesthetic/community design impacts depending on how and where they are
      implemented. This would be a concern in developing noise mitigation along State Highway 101 where
      they would be highly visible from the Highway. Designs for noise mitigating barriers would need to be
      compatible with the Community Design Element. It should be noted that building of barriers would be
      the least desirable noise mitigation of those described in the Noise Element. Acoustical treatment of
      buildings and site layout, including setbacks and other buffers, are likely to be more aesthetically
      compatible with the City. Other noise mitigation measures, such as traffic calming road design or
      development of bike paths to encourage alternative transportation, may result in environmental impacts
      primarily due to construction of these measures. Construction may result in temporary noise, air, and
      traffic impacts.
                                                   OTHER NOISE SOURCES, INCLUDING
                                                   STATIONARY SOURCES
                                                   Industrial and Agricultural Noise
                                                   Noise generated by industrial plant operations, heavy equipment, and
                                                   truck traffic can affect adjacent residential areas and other sensitive
                                                   land uses.       Greenhouse operations and movement of farm
                                                   equipment and packing operations are also sources of noise likely to
                                                   continue in the future.
                                                   Future industrial and greenhouse development in the city would
                                                   generally be located away from existing and planned residential and
                                                   other sensitive uses that would be incompatible with industry.

The matrix below provides guidelines for determining whether or not ambient noise levels are compatible
with certain types of land uses. In conjunction with the noise levels shown on Figures N-1 and N-2, it can
be used to determine whether new development proposed in Carpinteria is within an acceptable noise
environment for the proposed use.

                                                   Therefore, future noise associated with industrial and greenhouse
                                                   activities would be expected primarily from sources such as truck
                                                   traffic serving industrial operations.
                                                   Objective N-4: Minimize noise spillover from industrial
                                                   operations into adjacent residential neighborhoods and other
                                                   sensitive uses.
                                                   Policies:
                                                   N-4a. The City will require that automobile and truck access to
                                                   industrial and commercial properties adjacent to residential areas be
                                                   located at the maximum practical distance from the residential area.
                                                   N-4b. The City will limit the use of motorized landscaping
                                                   equipment, parking lot sweepers, or other high-noise equipment on
                                                   commercial properties if their activity will result in noise that
                                                   adversely affects residential areas.
                                                   N-4c. The City will require that the hours of truck deliveries to
                                                   industrial and commercial properties adjacent to residential uses be
                                                   limited unless there is no feasible alternative or there are overriding
                                                   transportation benefits by scheduling deliveries at another hour.
                                                   N-4d. The City will work with the agricultural industry and County
                                                   government to address conflicts on a case-by-case basis and develop
                                                   noise mitigation as practicable.
                                                   Nuisance Noise
                                                   The City occasionally receives complaints about individual sources of
                                                   noise, including loud parties, events and high school football games.
                                                   Construction activity is also a source of occasional temporary
                                                   nuisance noise throughout the city. These and other such nuisance
                                                   noises are common to cities and can be addressed on a case-by-case
                                                   basis.
                                                   Objective N-5: The City will minimize the effects of
                                                   nuisance noise effects on sensitive land uses.
                                                   Policies:
                                                   N-5a. The City will address nuisance noise on a case-by-case basis
                                                   and develop appropriate mitigation measures such as scheduling of
                                                   events or activities during hours when effects would be minimal.
                                                   N-5b. The City will require that construction activities adjacent to
                                                   sensitive noise receptors be limited as necessary to prevent adverse
                                                   noise impacts.

                                                                                                            Noise Element
N-5c. The City will require that construction activities employ
techniques that minimize the noise impacts on adjacent uses.
Implementation Policies
Implementation policies 1-3 for objective N-3 also apply to
stationary and nuisance noise sources. In addition, the following
measures will be implemented:
7. The City will establish a noise ordinance in order to be more
     effective in controlling noise from stationary and nuisance noise
     sources, including construction activity.
8. All new equipment purchased by the City will meet noise
     performance standards consistent with the best available noise
     reduction technology.
                                      Environmental Consequences
 These policies are intended to have a positive affect on noise impacts to sensitive receptors. Policies
 such as N4a, to distance the access points for industrial and commercial land uses away from residential
 uses and policy N4d, to address agricultural noise issues on a case-by-case basis would have a beneficial
 effect on sensitive land uses by minimizing noise impacts.
 Implementation policies N7 and N8 would establish a noise ordinance and require that new City
 equipment would meet noise reduction performance standards. These measures would have positive
 environmental consequences by contributing to the overall reduction in noise for the city.
Noise Evaluation and Mitigation
The following decision tree (Figure N-4) provides a general
methodology to be followed in the evaluation of potential noise
problems associated with new development in the Carpinteria
Planning Area.
When mitigation must be applied to new development to ensure an
acceptable noise environment, the following approaches shall be
considered. First preference shall be given to approach (a). Second
preference will be given to approach (b). Approach (c) will be used
only if neither (a) nor (b) will achieve desired noise conditions.
a. Site layout, including setbacks, open space separation and
     shielding of noise sensitive uses with non-noise-sensitive uses
     (see the Community Design Element for examples).
b. Acoustical treatment of buildings (see the Community Design
     Element for examples).

SANITARY S EWER S ERVICES
Wastewater collection and treatment services are managed by the
Carpinteria Sanitary District (CSD). This community-wide service
agency has the obligation of operating and maintaining this system for
the transmission, treatment and disposal of sewage generated within
this area. CSD is also responsible for providing treatment to the level
necessary to meet various discharge requirements set by the Regional
Water Quality Control Board and other state and federal agencies.
Currently, service is provided to areas both within and outside the

                                                 POLICE PROTECTION
                                                 Police services within the incorporated City of Carpinteria are
                                                 provided by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department. Within
                                                 the State Park police protection is jointly provided by the Santa
                                                 Barbara County Sheriff’s Department and State Park rangers.
                                                 Previously, the City’s police protection services were provided by the
                                                 Carpinteria Police Department.         During that time, the police
                                                 department received approximately 550 phone calls per month, of
                                                 which 180 were written into reports. Carpinteria police records reflect
                                                 an average of 65 arrests per month, not including 12 drunk driving
                                                 arrests. Records also indicate 250 parking and moving vehicle
                                                 citations and 10 auto accidents per month. In general, crime rates are
                                                 highest for burglary and assault, and lowest for rape, murder or
                                                 robberies. Burglaries in homes are typically higher during the daytime,
                                                 and in businesses during the evening hours. Drunk driving and traffic
                                                 violations are more frequent during the night hours. The police

                                                 FIRE PROTECTION
                                                 Under the Fire Protection Law of 1961, the Carpinteria Planning Area
                                                 is serviced by the Carpinteria-Summerland Fire Protection District.
                                                 This District covers 40 square miles along the Pacific Ocean. The
                                                 District is bordered on the east by the Santa Barbara-Ventura county
                                                 line, and to the west by Montecito. This District provides Carpinteria
                                                 with an adequate amount of manpower and facilities to service the city
                                                 in the event of a fire or emergency. There are currently two fire
                                                 stations that service the city: one within the city (on Walnut Avenue)
                                                 and one in Summerland, just west of the city.
                                                 Current response times range from three minutes (inner city) to five
                                                 minutes (city periphery). All firemen (full-time and reserves) have

within the Carpinteria Fire Stationhouse, providing paramedic and
“life essential” services to the city.
Ventura County Engine #25 is available to Carpinteria for first alarm
calls through an automatic aid agreement. Through the South Coast
Mutual Aid Response agreement, the City may request the assistance
of up to 10 fire engines from the Montecito Fire Protection District
(to the north). These trucks include a ladder truck, otherwise not
available through the District; response times vary from 20 to 30
minutes.
The City has an adequate number and spacing of fire hydrants at
present. Hydrants are located in two pressure zones: one south of
Sandyland Avenue from Carpinteria City Hall to the County of Santa
Barbara, and the second throughout the remainder of the city.
SCHOOLS
Schools within the Carpinteria Planning Area are administered by the
Carpinteria Unified School District, which includes Aliso Elementary
School, Canalino Elementary (which also includes Canalino Early
Childhood Learning Center and Special Education), Carpinteria High
School, Carpinteria Junior High School, Main Elementary School and
Summerland Elementary School.
LIBRARY SERVICE
The Carpinteria Library is located at 5141 Carpinteria Avenue in
Carpinteria and provides service for the city. The library is part of the
city of Santa Barbara Central Branch Library District and has been in
its present location for 64 years (rebuilt after fire).
SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
Solid waste produced in the city of Carpinteria is collected by E.J.
Harrison and Sons, Inc., located in Ventura. E.J. Harrison and Sons,
Inc. provides solid waste collection and disposal for all residential,
commercial and industrial areas in the city. Once collected, the solid
waste is transported to the Gold Coast Material Recovery Facility and
the residual is ultimately deposited in the Simi Valley landfill, 26 miles
south of the transfer station.

LOCAL PLANNING ISSUES
Domestic Water Service Issues
Issues related to water service in the Carpinteria Planning Area
include:
§    Water is a limited resource; therefore, wise allocation of this
     resource must be made to development uses.
§    Empirical data on historic use, available resources, potential new
     sources and other base data are not always available.
§    A cooperative program to develop a database monitoring water
     resources for the Carpinteria Valley is needed.
Police Protection Issues
Issues related to the provision of police services in the Planning Area
relate to City protection during the tourist season.
§    Though the County Sheriff’s Department staffs personnel
     generally at a rate of two officers per 1,000 population, the
     summer seasona l tourists are not added into the resident
     population figures; yet, the department must provide services year-
     round. As the city grows, the department will be faced with
     increasing staff needs to respond to the increasing resident
     population. There is a need to find solutions for the expected
     increases in the seasonal tourist population.
Fire Protection Issues
Issues related to potential City growth as identified by the Carpinteria-
Summerland Fire Protection District are listed below:
§    The City needs to ensure that water pressure and water availability
     are provided in adequate amounts for all new development.
§    As the fire district grows, it will need to provide increased
     manpower in order to serve effectively.
School Issues
§    The existing school system is accommodating students through
     the use of temporary classrooms. Additional students will
     continue to overburden the permanent school facilities.
§    If student enrollment increases, new facilities will be required.
Objective PF-1: To ensure the provision of adequate water
supplies by minimizing consumption and investigating new
sources either in existing supply or outside existing sources.

                                                                                         Public Facilities & Services Element
 Objective PF-6: To ensure that new development is
 adequately served by utilities and does not impact existing
 service areas in the community.
 PF-6a. The ultimate responsibility to ensure that the facilities
 (including systemwide improvements) needed to support the project
 are available at the time that they are needed shall be that of the
 sponsor or development projects.
 PF-6b. Development projects shall not result in a quantifiable
 reduction in the level of public services provided to existing
 development, nor shall new development increase the cost of public
 services provided to existing development.
 PF-6c. Development projects within Carpinteria shall be required to:
 1. construct and/or pay for the new on-site capital improvements
      that are required to support the project;
 2. ensure that all new off-site capital improvements that are required
      by the project are available prior to certificate of occupancy;
 3. be phased so as to ensure that the capital facilities that will be used
      by the new development are available prior to certificates of
      occupancy;
 4. ensure that, in the event that public services or off-site capital
      facilities are impacted prior to development, the level of service
      provided to existing development will not be further impacted by
      the new development; and
 5. provide for the provision of public services, and shall not increase
      the cost of public services provided to existing development.
         PF-6d. In cases where the City and/or special district requires
GP       capital facilities needed by development to be oversized,
         extended, or otherwise built over and above the minimum
 necessary to serve the development and the cost of such
 improvements is greater than the project’s fair share of those facilities,
 at the city’s discretion, a reimbursement agreement may be established
 with the developer to allow him to recoup the cost of providing
 capital facilities beyond the need directly created by his project from
 subsequent new development.
         PF-6e. Where the City determines that a development project
GP       could have a negative effect on municipal income, preparation
         of a fiscal impact analysis will be required of the applicant(s).
 In addition, the City will require that the development project provide
 appropriate mitigation for any identified net costs to the city. To
 determine the true costs and revenue to be generated by a proposed
 development, a “case study” rather than an “average cost/revenue”
 approach shall be taken. When a fiscal impact study is required, the
 report shall present the following information:
                                                                                                                            187

Public Facilities & Services Element
                                                 1. Projected revenues to be generated annually over a 20 year period,
                                                      plus cumulative totals;
                                                 2. The annual cost of providing public services and maintaining
                                                      capital improvements over a 20 year period, plus cumulative totals;
                                                      and
                                                 3. A capital improvement/public services financing program
                                                      defining how the development will pay for needed capital
                                                      improvements and how any annual net losses that might be
                                                      identified in the report will be financed by the development.
                                                Environmental Consequences
 Policies regarding public facilities are developed to address allocation, infrastructure and demand for
 services essential to the operation of the city. Policies concerning water and sewer services focus on
 allocation, planning and monitoring, and conservation. For instance, water policy calls for equitable and
 effective allocation of water (P-1b), reclamation and groundwater recharge (P-1c), and a water resources
 information database (PF-1d), among other policies that would encourage positive environmental effects.
 These policies would not create any direct negative environmental consequences.
 With respect to police and fire services, policies are developed to ensure that adequate police and fire
 services are provided. Polices such as PF-3a, to monitor police and fire department needs, and PF-3e, that
 requires new developments to demonstrate adequate fire and police services, are anticipated to have a
 positive effect on the City by monitoring demand.
 School related policies are developed to provide the City with adequate educational facilities. Policies such
 as PF-4a, to resolve service demands cooperatively with developers, and, PF-4b, to encourage school
 district input to new development proposals, would act to benefit the school services.
 The Public Facilities Element of the General Plan requires that facilities be extended and improved. Once
 the policy is implemented, development of public facilities, such as new school buildings, installations of
 pipes and other infrastructure, there is a potential to negatively affect the environment. Negative
 environmental effects from development of public facilities may result in noise, air pollution, traffic, and
 temporary construction effects. Development of new pipelines for water and sewer could potentially
 require creek crossings or other infringements on land conservation areas.

General Plan & Local Coastal Plan Final EIR
       Summary of Proposed Alternatives and Mitigation Measures
The General Plan & Local Coastal Plan represents the community’s collective visioning for preserving
and improving the quality of life in the Carpinteria Valley. A successful General Plan update requires
public input and consideration and review of public concerns. The City has made every effort to allow
public comment and provide a dialogue between City staff and the public. Private citizens, local
companies, non-profit organizations and local public agencies presented many ideas and suggestions
throughout the General Plan update process. This section summarizes the ideas, proposals and
suggestions considered by the City.
1.      Sphere of Influence and Housing Element Consistency.
Preparing for future growth was one               of   the   key     planning       concerns        in   the     General
Plan & Local Coastal Plan update (“Update”).
According to the most recent Regional Housing Needs Assessment report, the City needed to provide an
additional 644 housing units between 1992 and 1997. Although the Housing Element was not part of
the Update, the City used the Update process to identify possible residential development sites. To this
end, the City studied seven potential expansion areas and considered several rezones within the City.
The City reviewed 12 sites identified in the current Housing Element as potential new housing sites,
some of which require expansion of the City’s sphere of influence. Since 1992, five of the twelve sites
have been developed for a total of 152 units, with an additional 122 units pending before the California
Coastal Commission. Although some of the seven remaining sites are still available for residential
development, they are not sufficient to meet the 644 unit objective set out in the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment report.
Loss of agricultural land was the primary concern related to expanding the City’s sphere of influence.
The majority of study areas are currently in agricultural use or are zoned for agriculture. Several
members of the public opposed conversion of agricultural land to urban uses.
In an effort to provide additional housing and, at the same time, preserve the City’s agricultural
resources, the Update proposes a compromise position. The proposed Update calls for a very limited
expansion of the City’s sphere of influence, increases residential density within the existing City limits,
and permits limited residential development in some commercial and industrial areas. As a result, the
Update mitigates potential project impacts by establishing long-term policies that call for more efficient
use of existing land within the City’s urbanized area.
                                                                                                         Appendix A-3

Appendix A: Program Environmental Impact Report Summary - January 2000
2.         Land Use Changes.
As part of the Update, the City revised its land use map to ensure consistency between current land uses
and zoning designations. The Update proposes the redesignation of 15 sites. The Highway 101 freeway
corridor and the Union Pacific Railroad corridor are the largest areas to be redesignated. The freeway,
which previously had no designation, has been designated as a Transportation Corridor in order to
provide policies for future development of the freeway in a manner consistent with the City’s General
Plan. The railroad corridor, which was previously not designated in most areas, has been designated to
be consistent with adjacent land uses. Similar to the freeway corridor, the Update proposes to designate
the railroad corridor at this time so that any future use is consistent with the City’s General Plan and
Local Coastal Plan policies. The Update redesignates several other sites in an effort to cure minor
inconsistencies between current land use designations and zoning.
3.         Conversion of Agricultural Land
The Update considered the conversion of agricultural land to urban uses so the City can meet its
mandated housing allocation. The Update reviewed several different conversion proposals. The City
Council and Planning Commission received numerous public comments on this subject. Many citizens
and local agricultural organizations opposed the large-scale conversion of farm land. The City’s original
proposal included an aggressive expansion of the City’s urban limits north to Foothill Road. After
extensive public debate and consideration of public comment, the City selected a less intrusive
alternative. The proposed alternative greatly reduces the expansion area and provides housing
opportunities within the existing City limits. While the alternative does call for the conversion of some
agricultural lands (approximately 34 acres) it is a substantial reduction from the original proposal. The
reduced conversion area, coupled with the new residential development standards within the City’s
existing urban boundaries, allows the City to meet its state-mandated housing allocation while preserving
the majority of its agricultural resources.
4.         Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Setbacks
The City’s current Local Coastal Plan includes policies and regulations intended to preserve
Environmentally Sensitive Habitat (ESH). While these policies and regulations are adequate, the Update
provided the City an opportunity to reevaluate the effectiveness of these policies and regulations. ESH
protection is of great local concern. The Carpinteria community has always taken great pride in its
natural resources, including the Carpinteria Creek and Carpinteria Salt Marsh. As a result, many citizens,
citizen groups, and property owners provided the City with proposed revisions to the EHS setback
policy. The current ESH policy calls for 20-foot setbacks with the ability to adjust the setback
depending on any unique site conditions. The majority of proposals called for an increase in the setback
and clarification of the existing setback policy. The City considered several alternatives that addressed
the size of the setback, as well as exceptions to the setback requirements.
The City ultimately selected an alternative that substantially increases the setback and clarifies the
standard of review. The Update proposes a 50-foot setback from ESH, which can only be reduced
under limited circumstances. The City selected these changes in an effort to protect its natural resources
while respecting the fact that the majority of ESH occurs within the City’s urban setting. The proposed
ESH policy will ensure the long-term protection of ESH while respecting the rights of property owners
located within ESH and ESH setbacks.

5.      Circulation Element
Future freeway construction and intercity truck traffic received considerable public comment during the
Update process. Citizens voiced concerns about future interchange construction along Highway 101 and
truck traffic through residential neighborhoods. Since Highway 101 divides the City, any future
construction is of great concern. The Update provides a clear standard of review to determine the
potential impacts future projects may have to existing intersections. In addition, the Update clarifies
Level of Service Standards and provides valuable information for the design of future highway
improvements.
In response to public concern regarding truck traffic compatibility, the Update proposes a truck route
policy. Traffic safety and compatibility on residential roads, narrow two lane streets and other areas
throughout the City that are incompatible with truck traffic were of primary concern. The City also
considered the ability of local businesses to ship and receive goods with ease and efficiency. The City
believes the Update proposal balances safety concerns and commercial interests. The proposed truck
route policy protects residential neighborhoods, while providing safe and efficient routes through the
City.
6.      Community Design
Carpinteria is a small beachside community with unique neighborhoods, districts, and street corridors.
Carpinteria’s citizens made it clear throughout the Update process that they wish to preserve the City’s
charm and character. Based on public comment and its own review of the General Plan, the City
determined that the City’s current policies do not completely reflect the community’s vision for the City.
In response, the Update proposes a new community design element. The City believes that a new
element is an appropriate way to promote the City’s orderly growth. The policies, objectives and
implementation policies contained in the new Community Design Element reflect the public comments
received during the Update.

This section summarizes the characteristics of the proposed project, the environmental impacts, mitigation
measures, and long-term impacts of development.
PROJECT SYNOPSIS
Project Description
The project is an update of the City of Carpinteria’s General Plan and Local Coastal Plan. The
project management of its resources. document is a combined General Plan and Local Coastal
Plan (“the Plan”) that has been developed pursuant to California Law (Government Code
Sections 65300, et seq., and Public Resources Code 30000 et seq., respectively). The procedure
followed for the preparation of the combined Plan was based upon the State of California
General Plan Guidelines and Title 14, Division 5.5 of the California Code of Regulations,
Sections 13506 through 13514. The Plan includes all required elements of a general plan with the
exception of the housing element, which is not being updated as a part of this project. The
mandatory elements that are a part of the Plan include Land Use, Circulation, Open Space,
Conservation, Noise and Safety. The Plan also includes Community Design, Recreation, and
Public Facilities and Services elements. The Plan includes policies and implementation policies
that serve as the City's Land Use Plan for the implementation of the policies of Chapter 3 of the
California Coastal Act of 1976 concerning coastal resources, hazard areas, coastal access and
priority uses. The Plan includes a map of proposed urban boundaries and planned land uses as
well as Goals, Objectives, Policies and Implementation policies that will serve to govern the
growth of the City and the
The location and extent of the project area is illustrated on page 17 of the Plan. The Plan area
includes all of the incorporated City limits of the Carpinteria as well as surrounding areas of the
unincorporated Carpinteria Valley.
ALTERNATIVES
Three alternatives to the proposed project were selected for consideration. The alternatives include:
No Project Alternative (No Build). Under this alternative, no additional development would occur in the
City or planning area. This no new development alternative would have no impact, either adverse or
beneficial, upon environmental conditions in the Carpinteria Planning Area. Assuming that all issue areas are
of equal importance, this alternative would be considered environmentally superior to the proposed project.
However, prohibiting further development may have the potential to increase development pressure outside
the City’s Sphere of Influence.
No Project (Current General Plan). This alternative considers adopting no General Plan Update, but
allowing buildout under the current General Plan. Because the land use pattern of the Draft General Plan
Update is identical to that of the current General Plan, the only difference in overall buildout would be the
Appendix A-6

                                                                            City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan

elimination of the seven sphere of influence study areas. By eliminating the proposed sphere study areas, this
alternative would eliminate the project’s significant and unavoidable impact to prime farmland. Reducing
overall buildout as compared to the Draft General Plan Update would also incrementally reduce impacts in
issue areas where impacts are primarily a result of population growth. On the other hand, land use
compatibility and aesthetic impacts would be slightly greater under this alternative.
Reduced Study Area I. This alternative considers adoption of the Draft Land Use Element and other
General Plan elements without sphere study areas 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which are in agricultural production. The
primary purpose of this alternative is to address the impact to agriculture that could occur as under the
proposed project. This alternative would eliminate the significant unavoidable impact to farmland in the
sphere expansion areas, although conversion of the 32-acre Creekwood site could still occur. The overall
reduction in development potential would also incrementally reduce impacts in other issue areas. Land use
compatibility and aesthetic impacts would be similar to those of the proposed project, although the farmland
preservation may be considered an additional aesthetic benefit.
Reduced Study Area II. This alternative considers adoption of the Land Use Element and other General
Plan elements that emerged as the preferred alternative following the release of the Draft EIR for public
review. Since this alternative has emerged as the preferred alternative, its impacts are summarized along with
those of the original proposal in Table A-1. There are three primary areas of difference between this
alternative and the project alternative studied in the Draft General Plan/Local Coastal Plan and EIR:
         a. This alternative, as compared to the original proposal studied in the Draft EIR, avoids to the
              greatest degree feasible the potential impacts to agriculture that would result from the possible
              expansion of the City’s sphere of influence. As such, this alternative would eliminate sphere
              study areas 3, 4, 5 and 7 and portions of 1 and 6. This would avoid the significant impact
              identified in the EIR relating to conversion of the sphere expansion areas, although conversion
              of four sites that are either in agricultural use or proposed to be designated for other use than
              Agriculture, (the 32-acre Creekwood site, 15 acre Whitney site, the 3.8 acre Cravens Lane site,
              and the seven acre East Valley school site) could still occur. Although agricultural impacts would
              be less than under the original proposal, this loss of agricultural land would be an unavoidably
              significant impact of this alternative. The overall reduction in development potential would
              incrementally reduce impacts in other issue areas as well and would not create any additional
              significant impacts beyond those identified for the original proposal. Land use compatibility and
              aesthetic impacts would be similar to those of the originally proposed project, although the
              preservation of more farmland may be considered an additional aesthetic benefit.
         b. This alternative includes new land use policies that allow for expanded housing opportunties in
              areas designated for commercial and industrial use (See Objective LU-6, Policies LU-6a and LU-
              6b and the associated Implementation Measure). The result of these policies is projected to add
              the potential for 212 units to the City’s buildout projection under the existing Land Use Element.
         c. The alternative selected also differs from the project alternative in that it includes changes to
              existing land use designations. Sixteen sites in total are proposed to be redesignated. The
              purpose of most of the changes is to ensure consistency with the City’s zoning map. The
              following is a list of the parcels proposed for change along with a description of the change in
              designation:

SUMMARY OF IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Table A-1 identifies the environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures of the original proposal that
was the subject of the Draft EIR and the Reduced Study Area II alternative that emerged as the preferred
alternative during the public review process for the General Plan/Local Coastal Plan. Impacts are categorized by
classes. Class I Impacts are defined as significant and unavoidable adverse effects that require a statement of
overriding considerations to be issued per Section 15093 of the State CEQA Guidelines if the project is approved.
Class II impacts are significant adverse impacts that can be feasibly mitigated to less than significant levels and
require findings to be made under Section 15091 of the State CEQA Guidelines. Class III impacts are considered
less than significant impacts, and Class IV are beneficial impacts. Impacts are identified by class in Table A-1.
Please note that there are no Class II, significant but mitigable impacts listed. This is because all of the policies
recommended in the Draft EIR to mitigate potentially significant impacts have been incorporated into the
current version of the General Plan. With inclusion of these policies in the General Plan itself, all of the Class II
impacts identified in the Draft EIR have been reduced to Class III impacts. The only significant impact
associated with either the original proposal or the Reduced Study Area II alternative (which, as discussed above,
has emerged as the preferred alternative) is the Class I, unavoidably significant impact relating to agricultural land
conversion. The Mitigation Monitoring Program has been included in Appendix B.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
This appendix is the Environmental Assessment portion of the program environmental impact report
(EIR) that examines the environmental effects of the proposed update to the GENERAL PLAN and
LOCAL COASTAL PLAN of the City of Carpinteria General Plan. The document has been prepared
in accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the State
and Local CEQA Guidelines. 5 According to Section 15168(a) of the State CEQA Guidelines, a program EIR
should be prepared on a series of actions that can be characterized as one large project. A general plan
update is the type of project for which the use of program EIRs is specifically intended.
Section 15166 of the State CEQA Guidelines states that the requirements for preparing an EIR on a local
general plan, element, or amendment thereof will be satisfied by using the general plan as the EIR with
no separate EIR document if:
     •   The general plan addresses all the points required to be in an EIR by Article 9 of the Guidelines; and
     •   The document contains a special section or cover sheet identifying where the general plan document addresses each of
         the points required.
To this end, this proposed Draft General Plan Update includes all of the environmental analysis required
under CEQA and no separate EIR has been prepared., The environmental analysis of each of the Draft
General Plan elements is contained in this appendix and within the text of the elements themselves.
Within the individual Elements, other than the Land Use Element, a part of the environmental analysis
that discusses the potential for the element policies and implementation policies to have environmental
consequences is found in gray shaded boxes entitled “Environmental Consequences.” All of the
elements other than Land Use are specifically intended to avoid environmental effects associated with
land development that could be accommodated under the Draft Land Use Element. Therefore, rather
than creating environmental impacts, the other General Plan elements primarily serve to alleviate
potential environmental impacts.
The Draft Land Use Element, on the other hand, has a somewhat different role in that it specifically
allows for development within the City’s planning area. Consequently, unlike the other General Plan
elements, it facilitates development rather than placing restrictions on development to minimize
environmental or other effects. The effects of buildout under the Draft Land Use Element are therefore
analyzed in greater detail in this appendix and summarized within the text of the Draft Land Use
Element itself.
The City of Carpinteria is the lead agency for the proposed General Plan Update. Because the City is
within the Coastal Zone, the California Coastal Commission is a responsible agency for the project.
5 The City of Carpinteria has adopted an Environmental Thresholds Manual for the “environmental review of project
proposals.” The manual is dated and is primarily applicable to specific development projects, as opposed to a General
Plan update. It is recommended that the manual be updated with current information, and new thresholds as identified
in the General Plan update. The manual is referenced herein where applicable.
                                                                                                                Appendix B - 1

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
Since the public circulation of the Draft EIR, the community has engaged in substantial dialogue about
the Draft General Plan and the various alternative plans. As a result of this additional discussion, a
number of minor text changes to the General Plan were made and a revised Land Use Plan emerged as
the preferred Plan. It was determined that none of the text changes from the Draft Plan studied in the
Draft EIR would create additional significant environmental effects. To the contrary, the text changes
were generally intended to provide for greater protection of environmental resources. Similarly, the
Land Use Plan that emerged through the planning process reduces environmental effects as compared to
the plan studied in the Draft EIR by eliminating several areas from the proposed Sphere of Influence for
the City, thus avoiding the possibility of conversion of those areas from agricultural to urban uses. The
specific changes associated with that alternative (Reduced Study Area II) are discussed in Section 5.4.
2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The text of the Draft Land Use Element is included in the Draft General Plan. In summary, the Draft
Land Use Element allows for possible buildout within the existing City limits, as well as in seven study
areas adjacent to, but outside the current City limits. The proposed land use designations for the entire
City are shown on Figure LU-1 of the Draft Land Use Element, while the seven possible study areas are
shown on Figure LU-3 of the Draft Land Use Element (attached). Maximum possible buildout under
the proposed land use designations is shown in Table 1 below.

Section 15130 of the State CEQA Guidelines requires that EIRs address cumulative impacts using a list of
past, present, and reasonably anticipated future projects or a summary of projections contained in a
general plan or related planning document. Because the proposed project is a General Plan Update,
impacts associated with buildout under the proposed General Plan Update represent the cumulative
scenario; therefore, no separate discussion of cumulative impacts is necessary.
3.0 IMPACT ANALYSIS
3.1 GEOLOGIC PROCESSES
Setting
Current geologic conditions in the Carpinteria Planning Area are discussed in the Draft Safety Element
and associated Technical Appendix. Potential geologic hazards present in portions of the planning area
include fault rupture, ground shaking, liquefaction, landsliding, soil expansiveness, and tsunami
inundation.
Appendix B - 2
                                                                        City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                         Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Topography/Landforms. Construction that could occur in the future in accordance with the Draft Plan
may require excavation and grading. Such activities could change the topographic relief in some portions
of the City, and could also result in compaction, displacement, and other disruption of the soil.
Development could result in localized wind or water erosion of soils, or contribute to adverse impacts
from additional permeability and runoff.
Various General Plan policies would determine the appropriate intensities of development for different
parts of the planning area to avoid substantial topographical alteration. Individual projects will be
reviewed for specific impacts and appropriate mitigation measures. The Open Space, Recreation and
Conservation Element includes a number of policies to minimize aesthetic effects and hazards relating to
grading. These include the following:
    OSC-13g. Require new development to protect scenic resources by utilizing natural landforms and
                 vegetation for screening structures, access roads, building foundations, and cut and fill
                 slopes in project design which otherwise complies with visual resources protection
                 policies.
    OSC-13h. Plans for development shall minimize cut and fill operations. Plans requiring excessive
                 cutting and filling may be denied if it is determined that the development could be
                 carried out with less alteration to the natural terrain.
    OSC-13i. Design all new development to fit the site topography, soils, geology, hydrology, and
                 other existing conditions and be oriented so that grading and other site preparation is
                 kept to an absolute minimum. Preserve all natural landforms and native vegetation, such
                 as trees. Require all areas on the site not suited to development as evidenced by
                 competent soils, geology and hydrology investigation and reports remain as open space.
Implementation of these Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element policies is anticipated to fully
mitigate impacts relating to changes in topography. No additional mitigation is required.
Seismic, Geologic, and Soil Hazards. None of the faults that traverse the Carpinteria Planning Area are
considered active (see text of the Draft Safety Element). However, the inferred locations of both the
Rincon Creek and Carpinteria Faults pass through the City, as shown on Figure S-1 of the Safety
Element. The Rincon Creek Fault crosses the northern portion of Study area 7. Therefore, future
development in this area would potentially be subject to hazards relating to surface rupture in the event
of an earthquake on the Rincon Creek Fault.
Ground shaking on the order of 0.4 g to 0.6 g has a 10% probability to occur in the Carpinteria Planning
Area within the next 50 years. Shaking of this order would result from an earthquake between
magnitudes 6.5 and 7.0 along a fault within five miles of the planning area (California Division of Mines
and Geology, 1996).
Other potential geologic hazards include liquefaction, tsunami inundation, and landsliding/rock fall. The
locations of risk from each of these hazards are shown on Figure S-2 of the Draft Safety Element. High
potential for seismically induced liquefaction is present throughout much of the planning area, including
portions of five of the seven possible Sphere of Influence study areas. Much of the western part of the
City is within the potential limit of tsunami inundation, which is estimated to be at least to 40 feet above
sea level. Areas of relatively high landslide, and rock fall potential are primarily located in the northern
                                                                                                         Appendix B - 3
City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
portion of the planning area, outside areas of current or planned urban development. However, much of
proposed study area 7 is within an area of high rock fall potential.
Potential soil hazards in the planning area include expansiveness and settlement. Areas with high
potential for expansiveness are located in the western portion of the planning area and include parts of
the Beaches, Downtown, Concha Loma, and Santa Monica/Canalino/El Carro land use districts (see
Figure S-3 of the Draft Safety Element). Part or all of study areas 1, 2, and 3 also have high soil
expansiveness potential. Areas with high potential for soil settlement include the eastern portion of the
City, as well as in the mountainous northern portion of the planning area (see Figure S-3 of the Draft
Safety Element). All of study area 5 and a portion of study areas 6 and 7 have high soil settlement
potential.
The policies of the Safety Element include measures to reduce death, injuries, property damage, and the
economic and social dislocation resulting from natural and man-made hazards. These include the
following:
•     Policy S1a requires that seismic design criteria for habitable building structures be determined based
      on the maximum ground acceleration anticipated at the project site utilizing the maxim um credible
      earthquake calculated for area faults, as well as the distance from the building site to each fault.
•     Policy S1b establishes the tsunami risk limit, utilizing a contour elevation of 40 feet above sea level
      when planning coastal installations and developments.
•     Policy S1c requires that new developments in areas identified as having high liquefaction potential
      follow structural engineering foundation design parameters outlined in the Uniform Building Code
      or obtained through a structural engineering study.
      • Policy S2a requires that areas currently identified as landslide terrain be designated open space
           or that landslide potential be mitigated through current engineering design.
      • Policy S2b requires setbacks from the bases of slopes for habitable structures in future
           development projects.
      • Policy S3a prohibits the development of areas identified as having high ground subsidence until
           a study of the Carpinteria Groundwater Basin is performed to identify the storage capacity, safe
           yield, and current usage of groundwater.
      • Policy S3b requires that all new development comply with the Uniform Building Code, local
           City building ordinances, and geotechnical recommendations relating to construction in areas
           identified as having high potential for soil settlement.
Implementation of these policies would be expected to reduce seismic hazards to acceptable levels.
3.2 AIR QUALITY
Setting
The physical and regulatory air quality setting of the City of Carpinteria and the County of Santa Barbara
are described in detail in the 1994 Clean Air Plan (CAP), which is incorporated by reference. The 1994
Clean Air Plan is available for review at local libraries, Carpinteria City Hall, and at the Santa Barbara
County Air Pollution Control District at 26 Castilian Drive B-23, Goleta, California. The following is a
brief summary of the information in that document and other pertinent materials.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is the federal agency designated to
administer air quality regulation, while the Air Resources Board (ARB) is the state equivalent in the
Appendix B - 4

                                                                         City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                          Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
California Environmental Protection Agency. Local control in air quality management is provided by the
ARB through county-level Air Pollution Control Districts (APCDs). The ARB has established the air
quality standards and is responsible for control of mobile emission sources, while the local APCDs are
responsible for enforcing standards and regulating stationary sources. Carpinteria is located in the South
Central Coast Air Basin under the jurisdiction of the Santa Barbara County APCD.
The nearest air monitoring station to the project site is located on Gobernador Canyon Road, about 1
mile northeast of the site. This station measures ozone and nitrogen dioxide, with additional air
pollutant monitoring reflective of the general area conducted in Santa Barbara (W. Carrillo Street). Table
2 summarizes the annual air quality data for 1994 through 1996 for the local airshed.
The primary pollutant of concern in Carpinteria is ozone, a secondary pollutant that is not produced
directly, but rather is formed by a reaction between NOx and reactive organic gases (ROG) in the
presence of sunlight. Reductions in ozone concentrations are dependent on reducing the amount of
these precursors. The major sources of ozone precursor emissions in Santa Barbara County are motor
vehicles, the petroleum industry, and solvent usage (paint, consumer products, and certain industrial
processes).
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Because the proposed project is an update of the Carpinteria General Plan rather than a specific
development project, the 25 pounds per day significance thresholds adopted by the Santa Barbara
County APCD for individual projects do not apply. Rather, the impact of the General Plan Update is
considered significant if buildout under the plan would be inconsistent with the land use and population
forecasts contained in the CAP. The Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG)
provides these forecasts.

As shown in Table 1 in Section 3.0, Project Description, the Draft Land Use Element would accommodate
up to 734 new dwelling units at full buildout. Based upon the current citywide average of 2.85 residents
per unit (California Department of Finance, 1997), this would translate to a population increase of 2,091.
When added to the current population of 14,618 (California Department of Finance, 1997), the citywide
population at buildout would be 16,709. This is within the SBCAG projected population of 17,559 in
                                                                                                          Appendix B - 5

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
the year 2015 (SBCAG, 1994). Therefore, the Draft Land Use Element is considered consistent with
CAP population projections.
The Draft Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element includes objectives, policies and
implementation policies that address air quality concerns. These include the following:
      •    Objective OSC-11 states that Carpinteria will conduct its planning and administrative activities
           so as to maintain the best possible air quality.
      •    Policies OSC-11a through OSC-11e discourage development that would adversely affect air
           quality, promote the reduction of motor vehicle traffic and associated emissions, promote the
           use of solar heating and energy efficient building design, encourage implementation of local Air
           Quality Attainment Plan control measures, and encourage agricultural users to minimize air
           pollutant emissions.
      •    Implementation policies 47 and 48 call for the incorporation of relevant policies and strategies
           of the Santa Barbara County CAP and cooperation in regional air quality plans, programs, and
           enforcement measures.
The Draft Circulation Element also includes a range of objectives and policies designed to encourage the
use of alternative modes of transportation. Implementation of these policies would be expected to
reduce motor vehicle travel in favor of walking and bicycling, thereby reducing overall emissions
associated with motor vehicle use. These include the following:
      •    Objective C-7 calls for the City to increase the use, effectiveness, and social acceptability of
           alternative modes of transportation. Specific policies would require the implementation of
           transportation system management plans by major employers (C-7a), development of pedestrian
           accessibility between residential areas, schools, parks, and shopping areas (C-7b), improvement
           of streets and other facilities to improve mobility for the aged and handicapped (C-7c and C-7d),
           provision of continuous sidewalks (C-7e), increased funding for alternative transportation
           programs (C-7f), and creation of a citywide campaign to promote alternative transportation (C-
           7g).
      •    Objective C-8 calls for the development of bicycle systems and pedestrian facilities. Specific
           policies would require improvements to bicycle lanes and paths (C-8a, C-8b, C-8c, C-8d, C-8g,
           C-8h, C-8i, and C-8m), improvements to other bicycle facilities (C-8l, C-8p, C-8q, C-8r),
           education programs on bicycling (C-8e, C-8j, and C-8k), improvements to pedestrian facilities
           (C-8f), and development of additional funding sources for bicycle infrastructure (C-8n).
      •    Objective C-9 calls for the promotion of public transit use. A number of specific policies are
           directed at improving service and increasing transit ridership. Refer to the Draft Circulation
           Element for specific policies.
The Community Design Element also includes a number of principles and policies that encourage the
use of alternative transportation modes. These include the following:
      •    Objective CD-4 states that neighborhood streets, pedestrian paths, and bicycle paths should be
           planned as a system of fully connected and interesting routes that should discourage high-speed
           vehicular traffic for the safety and enjoyment of residents and pedestrians.
      •    Policies CD-8f states that the existing network of lanes, trails, and pedestrian ways should be
           preserved, reinforced, and extended.

The Community Design Element also contains numerous policies relating to improving the
pedestrian/bicycle network in individual communities within the City. See the Community Design
Element for specific policies.
Implementation of recommended General Plan policies as they relate to future development projects in
Carpinteria would be expected to reduce air emissions associated with buildout under the Plan to within
or below Santa Barbara County APCD projections.
3.3 WATER
Setting
Surface Water/Flooding . Information on flood conditions in the Carpinteria Planning Area is presented
in the Safety Element and associated background report. Flooding in the planning area is generally
produced by winter storms occurring between the months of December and March. Several local
streams that discharge into the Pacific Ocean cross through the planning area. These include Carpinteria
Creek, Santa Monica Creek, Franklin Creek, Arroyo Paredon, and Toro Canyon Creek. The Carpinteria,
Santa Monica, and Franklin Creeks have been channelized by the Santa Barbara County Flood Control
and Water Conservation District, the U.S. Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Soil Conservation Service.
The Santa Barbara County Flood Control Engineer has determined that lands above 250 feet elevation in
the Carpinteria area would be free from flood hazard in the area of the channelized creeks.
Groundwater. The Carpinteria groundwater basin underlies the planning area. Its capacity is 170,000
acre-feet, while the safe annual yield from the basin is about 5,000 acre-feet. Groundwater quality is
relatively good, although high concentrations of iron and manganese have been found in a few locations.
Groundwater is further discussed in the Draft Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Surface Water/Flooding. Portions of the planning area that are subject to flood hazards are shown on
Figure S-4 of the Draft Safety Element. Areas located within the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) 100-year flood zone include:
•    Areas adjacent to Santa Monica, Franklin, and Carpinteria Creeks;
•    The northwest corner of the City; along Highway 101 between Franklin and Carpinteria Creeks;
•    Areas along the Pacific Ocean coastline; and
•    The area east of the El Estero Marshland, west of Linden Avenue and south of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
Development in these areas would be subject to flood inundation during a 100-year storm event. In
addition, further development in the planning area would be expected to increase community-wide
impervious surface area, thereby increasing overall runoff into area creeks during major storms. This
could increase flood potential in other parts of the planning area.
Study area 5, on the east side of the City, drains into a pipe along Via Real that empties to
Carpinteria Creek. Study area 7, also on the east side of the City, drains indirectly to Carpinteria
Creek, primarily along driveways and small drainage ditches to Bailard Avenue and then to Via
Real.
The City’s Drainage Master Plan indicates that the Via Real storm drain may need to be extended farther
east on Via Real to Poplar Street if development in this area of the City increases. If these study areas
                                                                                                            Appendix B - 7

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
are developed, drainage facilities may need to be further extended. The extent of new drainage facilities
will depend on the intensity of future development.
Study area 2, on the west side of the City, drains through a channel on the southeast portion of the area
and into a culvert that runs though the under Via Real and Highway 101. This drainage system has
experienced some culvert plugging from silt. Improvements for this drainage system to alleviate
drainage problems are planned for 1998.
The Draft Safety Element contains several policies to mitigate flood hazards in the planning area. These
include the following:
•     Policy S4a requires that all new development proposed in the 100-year flood zone must adhere to
      the County of Santa Barbara Flood Plain Management Ordinance, Chapter 15-A of the County
      Code.
      • Policy S4b discourages development of critical facilities within the 100-year flood zone.
•     Policy S4c requires setbacks from flood control channels, as determined by the Santa Barbara
      County Flood Control District, to allow access to maintain and enable proper operation of the
      channels.
•     Policy S4d requires that the City conduct a flood plain study for the west end of the planning area
      and confer with FEMA in an attempt to update the 100- and 500-year flood zones in that area.
•     Policy S4e requires the City to establish a policy preventing further channelization and/or banking
      of other creeks, rivers, or streams within the planning area. The policy should include setback
      guidelines for land use planning purposes along natural creek, river, or stream flood plains, and
      descriptions of opportunities to eliminate existing concrete channels and/or banking from creeks,
      rivers, or streams.
•     Policy S4f recommends development of programs to respond to the need to protect existing and
      future private property improvements from winter ocean wave action.
Groundwater. Buildout under the Draft Plan would increase community-wide water demand by an
estimated 600 acre-feet per year. This increased demand would have the potential to adversely affect
local groundwater supplies, depending upon the source of water to serve new development. The Draft
Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element has one policy to minimize the effects of increased
water demand on local groundwater supplies:
      •    Policy OSC-10b states that the City should continue to support water conservation measures.
Implementation of the subordinate measures would be expected to mitigate impacts to the Carpinteria
groundwater basin. No significant impacts to groundwater are anticipated as a result of implementation
of the General Plan.
3.4        BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES (FLORA)
Setting
As described in the General Plan Open Space, Recreation and Conservation Element, the Carpinteria
area has a wide variety of habitats, including El Estero salt marsh, tidal zones, dunes, riparian habitat, and
native plant communities. Many of these habitats are located on or near the coast. Several streams flow
south from the mountains through the planning area to the Pacific Ocean. These include Carpinteria
Creek, Santa Monica Creek, Franklin Creek, Arroyo Paredo Creek, Rincon Creek, Garapato Creek, and
Appendix B - 8

                                                                        City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                         Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
Toro Canyon Creek. Many of the creeks in the City, including Franklin Creek and Santa Monica Creek,
are channelized for flood control purposes.
Vegetation. The Carpinteria area supports mainly chaparral vegetation types, especially on the dry hills
to the north of the City. The dominant chaparral community is coastal sage scrub, which includes Black
sage (Salvia mellifera), Coyote Brush (Baccgaris pilularis), and Lemonadeberry (Rus intergrifloia).
Several tree species are present within the stream corridors that cross the City. The dominant species
include the California Bay (Umbellularia californica), willows (Salix, spp.) big leaf maples (Acre macrophyllum),
western sycamore (Plantanus racemosa), and coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia).
The understory of riparian areas consists of a mix of native and invasive exotic plants. Native dominant
understory plants include wild blackberry (Rubus ursinus), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), mugwort
(Artemisia douglasiana), elderberry (Sambucus maxicanum), willow smartweed (Persicaria lapathifolium), and
nettle (Urtica holosericea). Non-native plants include bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), cocklebur (Xanthium
strumarium), giant reed (Arundo donax), and noxious castor bean (Ricinus communis).
Habitats found on the coast of Carpinteria include intertidal zones, marshes, and coastal bluff
communities. The intertidal zones support various types of algae and seaweeds.
The El Estero Marsh is an important habitat located west of the City. The 230-acre marsh supports
freshwater species including willows alkali bulrushes, and cattails and saltwater species of pickleweed,
saltgrass, saltbush, alkali heath, sea bite, and the endangered Salt Marsh Bird’s Beak (Cordylanthus
maritimus).
The Carpinteria Bluffs area encompasses about 157 acres located southeast of the City. Bluff area
habitat contains native grassland, and scrub communities, including the Central Coast riparian scrub,
coastal sage scrub, and coastal bluff scrub.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Development that could occur within the current City limits under the Draft Plan would primarily
consist of infill residential, commercial, and light industrial development in already urbanized areas. Such
development would not be expected to adversely affect important biological habitats or plant species.
Further, infrastructure improvements, including roads and bridges, that are planned for in the Draft Plan
do not have the potential to adversely affect important biological habitats when developed subject to the
policies and implementation policies established for such development.
The proposed study areas, located along the northern edges of the Carpinteria City limits, are primarily in
agriculture or developed with greenhouses. Such uses have limited the value of these areas as natural
habitat. Vegetation in these areas is typically controlled through manual removal and herbicides to
reduce the loss of crops and nursery plants.
Study areas 2 and 3 are, however, near or adjacent to stream corridors (see Figure S-4), while the
northern edge of area 7 has a small area with oak trees. Area 2 is located west of Santa Monica Creek
and area 3 is located between Santa Monica Creek and Franklin Creek. Area 2 is currently in residential
land use, and would not be expected to change; area 3 is primarily developed with greenhouse
agriculture; and area 7 is currently an orchard. Potential impacts in each of these areas are discussed
below.
                                                                                                         Appendix B - 9

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
Study areas 2 and 3. Development of agricultural land into residential land uses can increase
      impervious surface and result in greater runoff that can carry sediment and degrade stream
      water quality. These effects can negatively affect vegetation within stream corridors, as well
      as the marshes and coastal habitats into which the streams empty.
Because both Santa Monica and Franklin Creeks are completely channelized from Foothill
Road to El Estero Marsh, neither has biological value. Both streams do, however, empty into
the 230-acre El Estero Marsh, a State designated Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Area
(ESHA). As discussed in the Draft Open Space, Recreation and Conservation Element, the
marsh provides important habitat to a variety of plant and animals. The marsh ecology could
potentially be affected by increased sedimentation and polluted runoff from study areas 2 or 3.
Of particular concern for El Estero marsh is the Salt Marsh Bird’s Beak, an endangered plant
species.
The following Draft Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element policy is specifically
intended to mitigate potential impacts relating to urban runoff:
•     Policy OSC-6d requires public or private development to locate development outside creek
      corridors, established by creek setbacks, except when a location is necessary for protection
      of public health and safety or the location is necessary for infrastructure.
In addition, several other Draft Open Space, Recreation and Conservation Element policies
would restore stream corridors (Policies OSC 6a – OSC 6f), protect the El Estero Marsh (Policies
OSC 3a- OSC 3b), and provide protection within ESHAs (Policies OSC-1a and OSC-1b). These
policies would mitigate effects of development, restore creek corridors, develop new standards
for development in riparian and watershed areas, and preserve El Estero Marsh.
Implementation of proposed policies would be expected to mitigate the impact of urban runoff
in El Estero Marsh.
Study Area 7. Study area 7 includes small groves of oak trees near existing homes and along the north
edge of the Study area. These oak trees could be damaged or lost if this area is developed for more
intensive purposes. The Draft Open Space, Recreation and Conservation Element indicates that oak
trees require special management since they are easily harmed by surrounding land uses. Encroaching
development and over-watering that results from landscape irrigation could harm the roots of oaks.
The Draft Open Space, Recreation and Conservation Element includes specific policies to protect oak
trees. These include the following:
      •    Policy OSC-7a states that oak trees, because they are particularly sensitive to environmental
           conditions, should be protected.
•     Policy OSC-7b states that when sites are graded or developed, areas with significant amounts of
      native vegetation should be preserved.
The element also states that an oak tree ordinance should be developed that would include provisions for the design and siting of
structures to minimize the impact of grading and other development. With implementation of these policies, impacts to oak trees
would be avoided.

3.5      BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES (FAUNA)
Setting
The coastal areas of Carpinteria contain a variety of habitats, including intertidal zones,
riparian, marshes, coastal bluffs, and coastal chaparral communities. The intertidal zones
support a range of species, including of barnacles (Balanus glandula) , limpets (Colusella
digitalis) mussles (Mytilus californianus), and various types of anemones and sea stars.
The Carpinteria coast is also home to the harbor seal hauling grounds at the base of the
Carpinteria Bluffs. The white-tail kite also uses the open spaces of the bluff’s grasslands and
scrub to forage. The coastal waters, wetland and streams are important to a variety of fish
species, including the endangered Steelhead Trout (Oncorrhynchus mykiss), which uses the
upper portions of Carpinteria Creek, and the Tidewater Goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi), which
uses the El Estero Marsh. Off shore, the Carpinteria Reef is the most diverse habitat south of
point Arguello. The reef includes many fish species, including opaleye and halfmoon and the
Elysia and Tigripus invertebrate species.
Stream corridors in Carpinteria are habitat for a number of bird species, including various
warblers, the chat, willow flycatcher, cuckoo, and swift. The Monarch Butterfly uses the coastal
areas of Carpinteria as wintering grounds and can be found in large number s in trees in
Salzgeber Meadow near Carpinteria Creek and in the Chevron buffer zone, also known as Arbol
Verde. The winter clusters of the butterflies represent the most sensitive period of the
Monarch’s life cycle.
In addition to those discussed above, several species of particular importance occur in the
planning area, as listed in Table 3.

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Future development within the current City limits would primarily consist of infill development
in already urbanized areas. Such development would not be expected to significantly affect
biological habitats.
As discussed in Section 3.4, Flora, study areas 2 and 3 are located near or adjacent to stream
corridors that empty into El Estero Marsh, a State designated ESHA. The marsh, which is
important habitat to a variety of animal species, could potentially be affected by increased
sedimentation and polluted runoff from study areas 2 or 3.
Of particular concern for El Estero marsh is the tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi), a
Federal and State designated Endangered fish. Increased sedimentation from development is
potentially detrimental to the shallow tidewater goby breeding beds. In addition to the goby,
two endangered bird species, the light-footed clapper rail (Rallus longirostris levipes) and
Belding’s savanna sparrow (Passerculua sandwichensis beldingi), inhabit the marsh.
The Draft Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element includes several policies
specifically intended to mitigate biological habitat impacts relating to urban runoff. These are
Appendix B - 12

                                                                  City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                   Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
discussed in Section 5.4, Flora. With implementation of these policies, no significant impacts to
local fauna are anticipated.
3.6 NOISE
Setting
Noise level (or volume) is generally measured in decibels (dB) using the A-weighted sound
pressure level (dBA). The sound pressure level is measured on a logarithmic scale with the 0 dB
level based on the lowest detectable sound pressure level that people can perceive (an audible
sound that is not zero sound pressure level). A doubling of sound energy is equivalent to an
increase of 3 dB. Because of the nature of the human ear, a sound must be about 10 dB greater
than the reference sound to be judged as twice as loud. In general, a 3 dB change in community
noise levels is noticeable, while 1-2 dB changes are generally not perceived. Typical ambient
sounds range from 30 dBA (very quiet) to about 85 dBA (very loud). Typical exterior ambient
noise levels away from obvious noise sources are about 50 to 55 dBA.
There are many rating scales for noise, the most widely-used being the Day-Night Average
Level (Ldn) and Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). Both methods aggregate noise
levels over a 24-hour period, accounting for the annoying effects of sound, particularly at night.
In general, interior sound levels exceeding 45 dBA CNEL are considered intrusive. Typical
building construction materials filter out about 20 dBA. Based on the Draft Noise Element,
exterior sound levels up to 70 dBA CNEL are conditionally acceptable for housing, lodging, or
meeting facilities, provided adequate building design and construction materials are used to
reduce interior noise levels. The Environmental Thresholds Manual sets this level at 65. The
conditionally acceptable exterior noise level for commercial and office buildings is 77 dBA
CNEL.
The primary source of noise affecting the City is traffic using U.S. Highway 101. The Union Pacific
Railroad corridor carries freight and passenger trains that also produce substantial noise. Other less
prominent noise sources within the City include the use of equipment associated with agricultural or
industrial uses. See the Draft Noise Element for more information regarding the existing noise
environment in the City.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Buildout under the Draft Plan would increase ambient noise levels in Carpinteria, both in the short-term
(construction noise) and long-term (traffic noise). Additional commercial and industrial development
could include truck loading and warehouse areas, both of which could contribute to overall noise
increases in the planning area.
Roadway and Railroad Traffic Noise. Figure N-2 of the Draft Noise Element shows projected noise
contours in the planning area upon full buildout of the Draft Plan. These projections are based on
anticipated traffic increases, which in turn are based on the ultimate land use pattern of the City and
surrounding communities. The projected noise contours are generally similar to the existing noise
contours, with noise levels in excess of 70 dBA CNEL experienced only near U.S Highway 101 and the
Union Pacific rail line. Future residential development within the 55 dBA CNEL contour, which
encompasses much of the planning area, would have the potential to be exposed to noise exceeding
“normally acceptable” levels.
                                                                                                 Appendix B - 13

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
The Draft Noise Element includes a number of policies to minimize the impacts of traffic noise on
nearby land uses. These include the following:
      •    Policy N-1a states that the City will plan noise-compatible land uses or design developments
           with noise attenuation features near U.S. Highway 101.
      •    Policies N-1b and N-2b encourages the City’s cooperation with public and private
           transportation agencies (Caltrans, railroad operators) to ensure that appropriate noise mitigation
           measures are installed along U.S. Highway 101 and the rail line. Such measures could include
           berms and other noise barriers as appropriate.
      •    Policies N-1c and N-3c encourage cooperation with transit providers to increase their services,
           with the goal of reducing the automobile trips that generate noise.
      •    Policy N-3a encourages site planning and traffic control measures that reduce speeds, which in
           turn would reduce traffic-generated noise.
      •    Implementation policies 1 through 6 further refine the above policies by outlining the
           procedures necessary to ensure less than significant noise levels on a project-by-project basis.
           For example, these measures establish Figure N-3 of the Draft Noise Element as the basis for
           noise thresholds in the City. These measures also require enforcement of California Noise
           Insulation Standards to ensure acceptable indoor noise levels. Other measures suggest physical
           alterations to roadways and traffic patterns to reduce noise, including alternative paving materials
           and “traffic calming” devices that slow auto speeds. Another measure requires the City to
           establish truck routes that avoid residential areas.
The Noise Element also includes a “decision tree” that outlines the procedure for evaluating individual
projects, and their potential exposure to significant noise sources. If it is determined that excessive noise
levels could adversely affect a new development, non-structural measures (such as setbacks) are
identified as the preferred method of mitigation. If this approach would be inadequate, acoustical
treatment of buildings would be the secondary option. Only as a last resort should berms or structural
noise barriers be considered.
Implementation of these Draft Noise Element policies is anticipated to reduce impacts to resulting from
roadway and rail noise to a less than significant level. No additional mitigation is required.
Stationary Source Noise. Noise generated by industrial plant operations, loading docks and truck traffic
can affect adjacent residential and other sensitive land uses. Farm equipment and agricultural packing
operations can have a similar effect.
Future industrial and agricultural development in the City would generally be located away from existing
and planned noise-sensitive land uses. Consequently, only truck traffic associated with such uses is
anticipated to create potential noise impacts.
The Draft Noise Element includes a number of policies to minimize the impacts of industrial and
agricultural noise on nearby land uses. These include:
      •    Policy N-4a requires that truck access to non-residential operations be oriented away from
           noise-sensitive land uses.
      •    Policy N-4b discourages the use of motorized landscaping and cleaning equipment on
           commercial properties to avoid impacts to nearby residential uses.
      •    Policy N-4c discourages nighttime truck deliveries for commercial and industrial operations
           near residential land uses.
Appendix B - 14

                                                                     City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                      Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
     •   Policy N-4d encourages the City’s cooperation with the agricultural industry to minimize noise
         impacts from farm operations.
     •   Implementation Policy 6 requires the City establish designated truck routes to avoid impacts to
         residential neighborhoods.
Implementation of these Draft Noise Element policies is anticipated to reduce impacts to resulting from
stationary source noise to a less than significant level. No additional mitigation is required.
Nuisance Noise. The City occasionally receives complaints about individual noise sources, including
loud parties, events and high school football games. Construction activity is also a source of occasional
temporary nuisance noise throughout the City. These noise sources are most effectively addressed on a
case-by-case basis.
The Draft Noise Element includes a number of policies to minimize the impacts of nuisance noise on
nearby land uses. These include the following:
     •   Policy N-5a encourages scheduling of outdoor events at times that will minimize noise impacts
         to nearby residents.
     •   Policy N-5b requires that construction activity be timed to minimize impacts to nearby noise-
         sensitive land uses.
     •   Policy N-5c requires that construction activities use equipment and techniques that minimize
         noise generation. To that end, implementation measure Nh requires that all new equipment
         purchased by the City meets noise performance standards consistent with the best available
         technology.
     •   Implementation Policy 7 requires the City establish a noise ordinance to better address the
         issues described in the Noise Element.
Implementation of these Noise Element policies is anticipated to reduce impacts to resulting from
stationary source noise to a less than significant level. No additional mitigation is required.
3.7 LIGHT AND GLARE
Setting
Typical sources of light and glare include street lights, lighted parking lots, and lighted signs on
commercial structures. The football stadium at Carpinteria High School is another primary source of
light while games are in progress. At this time, no existing sources are perceived as a substantial nuisance
or safety hazard to nearby residents or motorists. See the Draft Community Design Element for more
information regarding this topic.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Buildout under the Draft Plan would increase nighttime ambient lighting and daytime glare
potential throughout the City. Increased lighting could come from streetlights, parking lot
lights, and signs on building establishments. Increased glare could come from building
materials, roofing materials and windows reflecting sunlight.
Several policies within the Draft Community Design Element and Draft Land Use Element encourage
site planning and lighting techniques that would indirectly minimize the potential for light and glare
impacts. Such methods include setbacks, building orientation, separation of incompatible land uses, use
                                                                                                    Appendix B - 15

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
of low intensity lighting, and orientation and design of lighting to avoid spillover onto adjacent
properties. The Draft Community Design Element also encourages the use of street trees and non-
reflective building materials, both of which would reduce glare impacts.
3.8 LAND USE
Setting
Current Land Use. The current land use pattern in Carpinteria is described in the Draft Land Use
Element. The area south of U.S. 101 consists of a mix of uses, including commercial retail development,
residential development of varying densities, and two areas of industrial development. The area north of
U.S. 101 is almost exclusively residential in character. The only exceptions are two small commercial
pockets in the west end of the City and an industrial area at the City’s east end.
In general, land use compatibility conflicts are minimal throughout the community. The most significant
existing sources of compatibility problems are noise associated with traffic on U.S. 101 and the interface
between residential areas and greenhouses/agriculture north of the freeway.
Farmland Classification. In Santa Barbara County, the U.S. Soil Conservation Service Important
Farmlands Inventory (IFI) system is used to inventory lands considered to have agricultural value. This
system classifies land based upon the productive capabilities of the land, rather than the mere presence of
ideal soil conditions. Land is divided into several categories of diminishing agricultural importance.
The areas considered to have the highest agricultural potential are classified as Prime or of
Statewide Importance. Prime farmland includes areas with irrigated soils (Class I and II) at least
40 inches deep, a water holding capacity of at least 4 inches, and with the capability of producing
sustainable high yield crops. Farmland of Statewide Importance is land other than Prime that has
a good combination of physical and chemical characteristics, but without minimum soil depth and
water holding capacity requirements.
Other productive farmlands are classified as Unique, or of Local Importance. Unique farmland is land
other than prime or statewide importance that supports high value food and fiber crops. Farmland of
Local Importance includes dry farming and other non-irrigated lands. Lands that have lesser agricultural
potential are classified as "Grazing", "Urban" or "Other." The latter classification includes areas that are
generally unsuitable for agriculture because of geographic or reg ulatory constraints.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Land Use Designation Changes. The Draft Land Use Element does not propose any land use
designation changes and would therefore continue the current land use pattern throughout most of the
City. Although conflicts would be minimal, the proposed land use plan would accommodate additional
residential development near U.S. 101, as well as adjacent to greenhouses and agricultural land at the
City’s northern fringe. Noise could be a concern for residences in either of these locations, while safety
concerns may exist in new residential development near agricultural land due to the use of pesticides and
other agricultural chemicals.
The Draft Noise Element contains several policies and implementation policies that address noise from
U.S. 101 through the use of site planning, use of sound attenuating building materials, and, if necessary,
noise barriers (see Section 3.6, Noise). In addition, the Draft Open Space, Recreation & Conservation
Element includes a number of policies that address potential noise and safety conflicts between
Appendix B - 16

                                                                         City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                          Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
agricultural and urban uses, as discussed below. Implementation of these policies would be expected to
mitigate any compatibility impacts relating to noise or safety.
With respect to agricultural conversion, the 32-acre Creekwood property that is within the existing City
limits could be converted to a residential use under this alternative. The Creekwood site is considered
Prime farmland and no mitigation is available to offset the loss of such farmland. Therefore, conversion
of this agricultural site is considered an unavoidably significant impact of the project.
Study Areas. Six of the seven planned study areas (areas 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) are currently occupied by
agricultural land. Areas 1, 4, and 7 are primarily orchards, area 3 is primarily in greenhouses, while Area
5 is primarily in row crops. Combined, these areas make up about 184 acres of agricultural land.
Therefore, future annexation and conversion of these areas to urban use would result in a net loss of
agricultural productivity in the Carpinteria Valley. In accordance with the State CEQA Guidelines, the
conversion of prime agricultural lands to urban use is considered a significant impact of buildout under
the Draft Land Use Element.
It is anticipated that all of the study areas, if converted to urban use at some point in the future, would
be developed with residential uses. In the case of study area 3, the conversion of greenhouses to
residential use may red uce compatibility conflicts with adjacent residential uses. The introduction of new
residential development adjacent to farmland in areas 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 would be at very low densities that
would create a transition/buffer between more intensive residential and agricultural uses, thus reducing
potential conflicts and helping to stabilize the urban-rural boundary.
The Draft Land Use Element includes policies to minimize impacts to agriculture, as well as to minimize
compatibility conflicts between urban and agricultural uses. These include recognizing the economic and
aesthetic importance of agriculture, continue the recognition of agriculture as a priority for water
allocation, and require buffering of agriculture from residential uses..
The Draft Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element also contains several policies and
implementation policies relating to the preservation of agricultural land. These include the following:
     •   Policy OSC-9a calls for maintenance of a greenbelt of agricultural land surrounding the City to
         clearly define the urban growth boundary.
     •   Policy OSC-9b calls for the maintenance of Williamson Act contracts to help protect
         agricultural activities.
     •   Policies OSC-9d, OSC-9e, OSC-9f, OSC-9h, and OSC-9i encourage the conservation of
         agricultural production, call for avoiding the conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural
         uses, and discourage further greenhouse development.
     •   Policy OSC-9g encourages locating central transfer areas, warehousing, and shipping facilities in
         locatio ns that avoid land use conflicts in agricultural areas.
     •   Implementation Policy 34 calls for the City to work with Santa Barbara County to develop a
         formal agricultural property protection agreement.
     •   Implementation Policy 36 calls for reduction of compatibility conflicts between agricultural
         and urban uses through various techniques, including development of buffer zones between
         agricultural and urban areas.
     •   Implementation Policy 38 encourages management of agricultural lands in a manner consistent
         with applicable Coastal Act policies.
                                                                                                        Appendix B - 17

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
Implementation of the policies of the Land Use and Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Elements
would minimize the potential for future impacts to agriculture in the Carpinteria Valley. Nevertheless,
the conversion of prime agricultural land that could occur in study areas 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and on the
Creekwood site would constitute a significant and unavoidable impact of buildout under the Draft Land
Use Element.
3.9 NATURAL RESOURCES
Setting
Oil is the only mineral resource known to be present in substantial quantities within the Carpinteria
Planning Area. Oil extraction activities in the planning area consist of offshore drilling and extraction
platforms, onshore oil storage facilities, a crew boat base, a product transportation terminal, and a natural
gas processing plant.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Infill development that would be accommodated under the Draft Land Use Element would not be
expected to affect the operation of any oil extraction, storage, or processing activities in the City.
Because no oil extraction, storage, or processing activities are located of the possible study areas,
buildout of these areas would not affect oil resources.
No mitigation measures are required.
3.10 RISK OF UPSET
Setting
The Draft Safety Element provides information on potential risks to public safety from hazardous
materials. Two large industrial facilities, the Chevron Oil Company Processing facility and the City of
Carpinteria Wastewater Treatment Plant, are currently present in the planning area. In addition, 21
planning area facilities have been identified as handling acutely hazardous materials, while 132 facilities
handle pesticides regulated by the State Department of Agriculture. The locations of major industrial
facilities within the planning area are shown on Figure S-6 of the Draft Safety Element.
U.S. Highway 101 and the railroad are the main corridors through Carpinteria. Freighter rail cars are
known to carry hazardous materials through the City. Crude oil and natural gas pipelines are present in
the southeastern portion of the Planning Area.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Development that would be accommodated under the Draft Plan would have the potential to increase
risks associated with hazardous material use and transport in two ways. First, buildout of the community
as allowed under the Draft Land Use Element would increase the citywide population by about 12%.
Thus, there would be an overall increase in potential exposure to hazards associated with existing
facilities. Second, although the Draft Land Use Element is not anticipated to accommodate new large
industrial facilities, the general increase in commercial and light industrial activity in the community
would incrementally increase the use of potentially hazardous materials. Therefore, the overall potential
for accidental spills would be expected to increase to some degree.
The following policies, as outlined in the Draft Safety Element, are specifically intended to address risks
relating to hazardous materials use, storage and transportation:
Appendix B - 18
                                                                    City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                     Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
    •    Policy S6a recommends maintenance and upgrade of policies concerning the use, storage, and
         transportation of hazardous materials within the City Planning Area.
    •    Policy S6b states that the City policies concerning hazardous materials should reflect the County
         of Santa Barbara and the State Regional Water Quality Control Board policies and requirements.
    •    Policy S6c states that the City should consider the presence of large industrial facilities, facilities
         that handle acutely hazardous materials or pesticides, and railroad and utilities right-of-ways in
         land use planning.
Implementation of these policies would reduce risks associated with hazardous materials use to
acceptable levels. No significant impacts are anticipated. Potential risks associated with specific facilities
involving the use of hazardous materials that are proposed in the community in the future would be
subject to separate environmental review.
3.11 POPULATION
Setting
The City’s current population is about 14,600 (California Department of Finance, 1997). Since 1992, the
population has increased by about 500, a relatively slow 0.7 percent average annual growth rate. See the
Draft Housing Element for more information regarding population and related housing issues.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Buildout under the Draft Land Use Element would result in an estimated population increase of
about 2,900 people. This represents an increase of about 12% over the current City population of
14,618. Although population growth would not in itself create physical effects to the environment, it
could result in secondary impacts. First, such growth could affect the attainment of regional air
quality goals. It could also result in additional land use compatibility conflicts and increased traffic
congestion. Additional population growth could also result in increased demand for public
services and utilities.
Section 3.2, Air Quality, discusses potential impacts related to the attainment of regional air quality
plans. Land use and traffic issues are discussed in Sections 3.8 and 3.13, respectively. The
provision of public services and public utilities are discussed in Sections 3.14 and 3.16, respectively.
Policies described in those sections would address impacts related to population growth. Section
4.1, Growth-Inducing Impacts, further discusses the growth-inducing implications of extending
infrastructure and providing increased levels of public services.
No mitigation measures are required beyond the policies included in the above-referenced sections
of the EIR and relevant General Plan elements.
3.12 HOUSING
Setting
The City of Carpinteria currently has approximately 5,583 housing units, about evenly divided between
single-family and multi-family dwellings (State Department of Finance, 1997). The current vacancy rate of
9.24% is the highest of any city in the County, possibly due to the high number of seasonally occupied
vacation homes in the City. Very little new housing development has taken place in recent years. Since
                                                                                                   Appendix B - 19

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
1992, only 64 new homes have been constructed, an average of about 13 per year since that time (State
Department of Finance, 1997).
Based on current zoning, there is sufficient vacant land for an estimated additional 297 units. Based on
recent growth rates, full buildout of this area would not occur in the immediate future.
Based on the SBCAG Regional Housing Needs Assessment, the City will need to provide 644 dwelling units
to serve various income levels between 1992 and 1999. Because only 64 units have been constructed since
1992, an additional 580 dwelling units would be necessary to reach this regional goal. The Draft Housing
Element contains additional information regarding the City’s regional fair share allocation to meet affordable
housing goals.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Growth that could be accommodated under the Draft Land Use Element would increase demand for
housing in the City. Based on the anticipated land use pattern within the proposed sphere study areas, as
well as infill potential within the City limits, an estimated 734 dwelling units could be accommodated. The
Draft Housing Element includes targets for the City’s fair share allocation to provide adequate housing to
address forecasted regional growth. Under guidelines set forth by SBCAG, an additional 580 dwelling units
would be required by 1999 to meet regional goals. At this time, there is not adequate residentially designated
land available to meet this goal. Only about 297 homes could be constructed under current zoning.
Buildout under the Draft Land Use Element would address this shortfall by allowing adequate residentially
designated land.
It should be recognized that even though adequate residentially designated land would be made available
under the Draft Land Use Element, there is no guarantee that regional goals will be met. Market demand
and local growth control initiatives could keep development at lower levels than anticipated under the
SBCAG Regional Growth Forecast. Based on recent slow growth patterns in the City, it is probable that such
goals will not be met.
The City’s existing Housing Element (1995, pages VI-5 through VI-6) has policies related to the provision of
adequate housing stock including:
      •    Require that the City’s General Plan and zoning ordinance provide adequate land to meet the
           City’s housing need through 1999, including appropriate sites for very low, low, moderate and
           above moderate income levels.
      •    Require that a variety of housing types be constructed.
      •    Ensure that new housing is appropriately located with respect to public and private facilities,
           such as schools, and that City services are adequate to meet the City’s regional fair share
           allocation.
Implementation of these Existing Housing Element (1995) policies is anticipated to reduce impacts
related to providing an adequate and serviceable housing stock to a less than significant level. No
additional mitigation is required.
The Existing Housing Element (1995) also addresses affordability, including several goals and policies to
ensure housing is available or a variety of income levels. Additional goals are included to address other
objectives, such as the needs of the disabled, the use of energy-conserving materials in housing construction.
Environmental review contained within the Housing Element evaluates the effects of such policies, which in
Appendix B - 20

                                                                    City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                     Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
general are intended to lessen potential environmental impacts. No additional mitigation measures are
required.
3.13 TRANSPORTATION/CIRCULATION
Setting
Automobiles are the primary form of transportation for most types of trips in Carpinteria, although the
City’s bikeway system has become increasingly important as an alternative. The City’s circulation system
is described in detail in the Draft Circulation Element. U.S. 101 is the only freeway in the City, serving
as the principal intercity highway. Traffic flow is generally good on the six-lane portion at the eastern
edge of the City, but degrades during peak traffic periods on the four-lane portion through the City.
Other important regional roads include State Routes 150, 192, and 224. Important arterial roadways
providing local access include Carpinteria Avenue, Linden Avenue, Casitas Pass Road, and Mark
Avenue. Although most arterials in the City operate acceptably, several of the freeway interchanges have
been cited as having confusing and inefficient designs that cause poor operation during peak traffic
periods.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Full buildout under the Draft Land Use Element would increase the City’s population by an estimated
12%. This increase, in combination with cumulative increases in traffic associated with regional growth,
would result in an overall increase in traffic levels throughout the City. Most affected by general
increases in traffic associated with buildout within the existing City limits would be U.S. 101 and major
arterials that accommodate through traffic.
Buildout of the proposed sphere study areas would affect traffic operations, particularly in the northern
portion of the City. Specific roads that could experience substantial traffic increases as a result of
buildout of the proposed study areas include the following:
    •         Craven Lane and El Carro Lane would be expected to receive additional traffic as a result of
          buildout of area 1.
•   Santa Ynez Avenue, Foothill Road, and Linden Road would be expected to receive additional traffic
    as a result of buildout of area 3.
•   Foothill Road, Linden Road, and Casitas Pass Road would be expected to receive additional traffic as
    a result of buildout of area 4.
•   Via Real, Bailard Avenue, and Casitas Pass Road would be expected to receive traffic from buildout
    of area 5 (several environmental documents prepared for the City have identified the need for
    improvements to the Bailard Avenue overcrossing at U.S. 101).
•   Via Real, Bailard Avenue, Mark Avenue, and State Highway 150 would be expected to receive traffic
    from buildout of area 7.
Both the City’s Master Facility Plan (July 1993) and the Draft Circulation Element include numerous
plans and policies to address current and projected future traffic problems in the City. The Master
Facility Plan includes the reconfiguration and reconstruction of the Bailard Avenue-U.S. 101 interchange,
the Casitas Pass Road/U.S. 101 interchange, the Linden Avenue/U.S. 101 interchange, and the Highway
150/U.S. 101 interchange. Draft Circulation Element policies designed to improve citywide traffic
circulation include the following:
                                                                                                   Appendix B - 21

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
      •    Policies C-1a, C-1b, C-1c, and C-1d state that the City will work with the County and Caltrans
           to improve freeway overcrossings and to resolve freeway access and interchange problems.
      •    Policy C-3a through C-3l provides for a variety of mechanisms to improve and monitor traffic
           flow throughout the City.
The Element also includes numerous policies to encourage the use of alternative transportation modes
by improving bicycle, pedestrian, and public transit facilities and service. See the Circulation Element for
a complete listing of policies relating to alternative modes.
Implementation of the Draft Circulation Element policies, in combination with the specific interchange
improvements contained in the City’s Master Facility Plan, would be expected to mitigate the traffic
impacts of future development in the City. Development of specific road improvements to mitigate the
impacts of future development proposals would not be appropriate at this time. Specific improvements
will need to be developed as needed in conjunction with future development plans.
3.13 PUBLIC FACILITIES & SERVICES
Setting
This section analyzes impacts to police protection, fire protection, schools, libraries, and medical
services.
Police Protection. The County Sheriffs Department provides police services in the City of Carpinteria.
The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department serves unincorporated areas. These agencies operate
independently within their respective service areas.
The department generally receives about 550 phone calls each month, of which about 180 are written
into reports. Records indicate about 65 arrests each month. In general, crime rates are highest for
burglary and assault, with relatively lower rates for more violent crimes.
The police department actively participates in several community-oriented programs, including
Neighborhood Watch, school training of youngsters, and merchant training to help local businesses
avoid becoming crime victims.
Fire Protection. The Carpinteria-Summerland Fire Protection District provides service to the greater
Carpinteria area. The District is bordered on the east by the Santa Barbara-Ventura County line, and on
the west by the community of Montecito. The District currently provides the City with an adequate
amount of manpower and facilities in the event of an emergency. There are two fire stations that serve
the City: one within Carpinteria (on Walnut Avenue), and the other in Summerland, just west of the City.
Current response times range from three to five minutes. All firemen (full-time and reserves) have
EMT-1 training. Though no full-time paramedics are staffed within the District, a private medical
service, Mobile Life Services, operates from within the Carpinteria Fire Station, providing paramedic and
“life essential” services to the City.
Ventura County Engine #25 is available to Carpinteria for first alarm calls through an automatic aid
agreement. Through the South Coast Mutual Aid response agreement, the City may request the
assistance of up to 10 fire engines from the neighboring Montecito Fire Protection District. These
trucks include a ladder truck, a piece of equipment not otherwise available through the District.
Response times from the Montecito Fire Protection District range from 20 to 30 minutes.

                                                                                  City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                                   Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
Schools. The Carpinteria Unified School District administers public schools in the planning area. The
District’s facilities include one high school (Carpinteria High School), one middle school (Carpinteria
Middle School), and four elementary schools (Aliso, Canalino, Main and Summerland). Canalino
Elementary School also includes the Canalino Early Childhood Learning Center and Special Education
facility.
The District is currently undertaking plans to reorganize its facilities. Two new schools will be
constructed, one in Summerland, the other in Carpinteria. The new Summerland school would replace
the existing elementary school in that community, and would be located on a larger parcel of land to
facilitate expansion. The new school in Carpinteria would replace Main Elementary School. The
existing Main Elementary School is located adjacent to Carpinteria Middle School, and would provide
additional space as an expansion of the middle school, integrated into that facility. That facility would
house the 6th grade students of Carpinteria Middle School. All elementary schools would become grade
K-5, a change from the current grade K-2 (Canalino) and 3-5 (Aliso, Main) configuration within the
southern part of the district. Summerland Elementary School would remain grade K-5.
Table 4 shows the current enrollment and capacity of schools within the District. As indicated, each
school in the CUSD is currently overenrolled. Portable classrooms are currently used throughout the
district to address existing overenrollment.
Library Service. The Carpinteria Library is located at 5141 Carpinteria Avenue. The library is part of the
City of Santa Barbara Central Branch Library District and has been in its present location since 1933.
Based on input from library staff, the facility is too small to handle current demands, and has inadequate
parking for patrons (O’Reilly, 1997). There are no immediate plans for expansion, although there is
some potential on-site to increase the size of the building, which seats about 33. Funding is currently
provided primarily by Santa Barbara County, with a small amount from the City of Carpinteria.

     1997. Capacity figures are as of 1996.
Parks and Recreation. Carpinteria currently has 11 parks totaling approximately 42.3 acres within its
boundaries. The largest of these are oriented toward the ocean, and include the Carpinteria City Beach
(6.0 acres) and the beachfront bluff area (8.79 acres) (see page OSC-29 of the Draft Open Space,
Recreation and Conservation Element for a complete listing of these facilities). This acreage does not
include Carpinteria State Beach, which is an 84-acre regional facility serving the City. City residents also
use Lions Park, but this privately owned 3-acre facility is located in an unincorporated portion of the
County.
                                                                                                                 Appendix B - 23

In addition to formal parkland, there are many other recreational facilities that serve the City’s residents.
These include other nearby beaches, golf courses, school fields, and the Los Padres National Forest.
Page OSC-30 of the Draft Open Space, Recreation and Conservation Element provides a complete
listing.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Police Protection. Growth that could be accommodated under the Draft Land Use Element would
increase demand for police protection services. Potential buildout could accommodate a population
increase of about 1,700, a 12% over the current population of 14,600. Based on the Department
standard of 1 officer per 500 population, demand for about additional six officers would be anticipated.
The following Draft Public Facilities & Services Element policies address impacts regarding police
protection.
      •    Policy PF-3a encourages the City to monitor relevant statistics and enforcement criteria to
           assure adequate police services.
      •    Policy PF-3b requires the City to evaluate potential programs that can resolve seasonal tourist-
           related police service demands.
      •    Policy PF-3e requires that developers demonstrate that their proposals are within adequate
           response times to law enforcement.
      Implementation of these policies is anticipated to reduce impacts related to providing police
      protection services to a less than significant level. Implementation of Policy PF-3a should account
      for the increased demand anticipated upon buildout of the Draft Land Use Element, to ensure that
      adequate funding sources are identified to meet this demand. No additional mitigation is required.
Fire Protection. Growth under the General Plan would result in increased demand for fire protection
services. Although there are currently no adopted manpower standards for the City, it is anticipated that
new development would require additional personnel and equipment to maintain the current level of
service. Other issues of concern include the need to provide adequate water pressure and availability to
effectively fight fires. In addition, there is inadequate equipment to fight fires in buildings greater than
three stories in height.
The following Draft Public Facilities & Services and Safety Elements policies address impacts regarding
fire protection.
      •    Policy PF-3c requires the City to cooperate with the fire district to assess the needs of the
           district.
      •    Policy PF-3d requires the City to improve communication with the district by initiating
           development review procedures that involve the district at the earliest possible time.
      •    Policy PF-3e requires that developers demonstrate that their proposals are within adequate
           response times to fire stations.
      •    Policies S-5a and S-5b require all new structures meet applicable ordinances and codes.
      •    Policy S-5c ensures that roads are designed to accommodate emergency vehicles per County
           requirements.
      •    Policy S-5d requires the City to cooperate with the fire district to ensure enforcement of
           applicable fire codes.
Appendix B - 24

                                                                                           City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                                            Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
Implementation of these policies is anticipated to reduce impacts related to providing fire protection
services to a less than significant level. Implementation of Policy PF-3c should account for the increased
demand anticipated upon buildout of the Draft Land Use Element, to ensure that adequate funding
sources are identified to meet this demand. No additional mitigation is required.
Schools. New development that would be accommodated under the Draft Land Use Element would
increase enrollment at the already overenrolled CUSD. Based on standard student generation rates,
about 889 new students would be generated upon buildout of the Draft Land Use Element. Table 5
shows the projected enrollment in the district. Assuming that no additional schools are built, enrollment
will continue to exceed capacity.

                      per new residence.
The following Draft Public Facilities & Services Element policies would address potential impacts to
schools caused by new development:
     •   Policy PF-4a requires cooperative efforts between the City and school district to resolve
         demands for educational services.
     •   Policy PF-4b encourages school district input to new development proposals.
     •   Policy PF-4c requires the City to cooperate with Carpinteria USD to ensure sufficient capacity
         for increases in student population caused by future development projects.
Implementation of these policies is anticipated to reduce impacts related to providing educational
services. Implementation of Policies PF-4a and 4c should account for the increased demand anticipated
upon buildout of the Draft Land Use Element, to ensure that adequate funding sources are identified to
meet this demand.
Under recent court decisions, school districts can require additional mitigation beyond the required
development fees ($1.84 per square foot), if necessary, to mitigate physical project impacts to schools,
provided that the General Plan includes language that additional fees would be necessary (the “Mira
Rule”). It is presumed that local school districts would enforce applicable fees as appropriate, which
would mitigate impacts to school capacity associated with Draft Land Use Element buildout.
Library Service. Buildout under the Draft Land Use Element would increase demand for library services
within the City. The existing facility is inadequate to meet current demands, which would call for a
7,300-square foot building based on a standard planning ratio of 0.5 square feet of library per capita.
With a projected buildout population estimated at 16,328, the library should be about 8,200 square feet
to adequately handle demand.
                                                                                                                           Appendix B - 25

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
The Draft Public Facilities & Services Element includes the following policy to address impacts to
libraries:
      •    Policy PF-5a encourages the City to maintain adequate library service for the citizens of
           Carpinteria.
Implementation of this policy is anticipated to reduce impacts related to providing library services. The
inclusion of a policy (see discussion under School impacts) to establish a comprehensive fee system to
include libraries would ensure that library space remains adequate.
Parks and Recreation. Full buildout under the Draft Land Use Element would increase demand for
parks and recreational facilities in the City. Existing City parks and recreation facilities provide a ratio of
park lands to population of 2.89 acres per 1,000 people (the State Beach and Lions Park are not included
in this calculation). New development would increase demand for these facilities.
The Draft Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element includes several policies to address this
impact:
      •    Policy OSC-14a requires improved public access to coastal recreational areas.
      •    Policy OSC-14b provides for passive recreation uses of natural open space areas, provided
           natural resources are not damaged.
      •    Policy OSC-14c encourages increasing ocean-oriented recreational opportunities.
      •    Policies OSC-14d and 14e encourage recreational opportunities along coastal areas, including
           the beach.
      •    Policies OSC-14g and 14h describe potential funding sources for recreational opportunities,
           and programs to enhance existing recreation.
      •    Policies OSC-15a, 15b and 15c encourage the development of trail facilities throughout the
           City, as well as the enhancement of existing trails.
      •    Implementation policies 52 through 65 provide for the development of new recreational
           facilities, parks and trails throughout the City, and identify funding sources for these facilities.
Implementation of these policies and measures would ensure the provision of recreational facilities as
the City builds out. No additional measures would be required.
3.15 ENERGY
Setting
Southern California Edison provides electrical power to the City while the Southern California Gas
Company provides natural gas service. The City currently has adequate supplies of both electricity and
natural gas and is anticipated to have adequate supplies for future development.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Additional development that would be accommodated under the Draft Land Use Element would
increase citywide energy demand but would not be expected to require the development of new sources
of energy or use energy in a wasteful manner. New homes and other future developments are expected
to incorporate energy efficient designs, in accordance with Title 24 of the California Administrative
Code. No significant impacts to energy resources are anticipated.
Appendix B - 26

                                                                      City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                       Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
With implementation of policies in the General Plan, energy demand would be reduced to the degree
feasible. No significant impacts are anticipated.
3.16 UTILITIES
Setting
Power and Natural Gas. Southern California Edison provides electricity for the City. SCE anticipates
that it will be able to provide power to the expansion of the City over the next 20 years.
The Southern California Gas Company, through a franchise agreement with the City, provides natural
gas. Three major gas lines pass through Carpinteria for supply to Santa Barbara north to Paso Robles.
Communications Systems. General Telephone Electric provides phone service for the City of
Carpinteria. Several different companies provide long distance phone service. As the City expands,
GTE will respond to the new demand. A majority of the phone lines in the City are underground and
current City policy requires undergrounding of all new lines.
Water. The Carpinteria Valley Water District (CVWD) provides the domestic water supply for the City.
Water is a limited resource in Santa Barbara County and the City has a water allocation program to
address this issue. The system incrementally issues annual allocations of water by land use category on a
quarterly basis for approved development. Water is distributed throughout the City by a line and storage
system. The City’s current water delivery system is considered adequate (Becker, 1998).
The CVWD has a supply of about 2,813 acre-feet of water per year for the Carpinteria Planning Area
from Lake Cachuma. The District also operates three wells that draw from the Carpinteria groundwater
basin, which ha s a safe yield of about 5,000 acre-feet per year. In addition, about 2,000 acre-feet per year
have been allocated to the City from the State Water Project. This allocation has not yet been used by
the City and is currently being held as a reserve supply (Hamilton, 1998).
Sanitary Sewer Service. The Carpinteria Sanitation District (CSC) manages wastewater collection and
treatment services in the City. In this capacity, the CSC is responsible for maintenance of the collection
system and treatment plant, as well as disposal of treated wastewater. Sewage generated in the City is
conveyed through district lines to the treatment facility located at 5300 Sixth Street.
The treatment plant was recently upgraded and has a current permitted capacity of 2.0 million gallons per
day (mgd). The plant treats about 1.5 mgd of sewage; therefore, there is currently about 0.5 mgd of
excess capacity. Based upon a generation rate of 285 gallons per day of sewage per residence (Meiko,
1998), the excess capacity would be enough to serve about 1,750 single-family homes.
Storm Water Drainage. Several creeks cross through the planning area and discharge into the Pacific
Ocean. These include Carpinteria Creek, Santa Monica Creek, Franklin Creek, Arroyo Paredo, and Toro
Canyon Creek. These drainages constitute the backbone of the City’s storm drain system. The Santa
Barbara County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, the U.S Army Corps of Engineers, and
the U.S Soil Conservation Service have channelized the Carpinteria, Santa Monica, and Franklin Creeks.
The City currently experiences some areas of localized flooding during large storms. These include the
north end of Craven’s Lane and the area east of the El Estero Marshland, west of Linden Avenue and
south of the Union Pacific Railroad (Fry, 1998).
                                                                                                     Appendix B - 27

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
           Solid Waste. Solid waste disposal service for the City is provided through a contract with E. J.
Harrison and Sons, Inc. Solid waste generated in Carpinteria is collected by E. J. Harrison and Sons, Inc. It
is then taken to the Gold Coast transfer station, and finally disposed of at the Toland Road Landfill in
Ventura County per an agreement with the Ventura County Board of Supervisors.
Toland Road landfill is operated by the Ventura Regional Sanitation District (VRSD) and is expected to be in
operation until 2027, when it reaches it will reach its volume limit. The landfill receives between 900 to 1,500
tons of solid waste daily. When the landfill reaches its 1,500 tons per day limit, solid waste is taken to either
the Simi Valley Landfill or the Chiquita. Canyon Landfill located near the Ventura County/ Los Angeles
County line east of Piru. The District has a 50 tons per day limit on waste coming in from Carpinteria.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Power and Natural Gas. Development that would be accommodated under the Draft Land Use
Element would increase demand for electrical power by about 12%. SCE indicates that it can meet this
level of demand. Infill development within the existing City limit would receive electrical service from
existing power lines. All possible study areas are immediately adjacent to areas that already have service;
therefore, required extensions of service would be minimal. No significant impacts to electrical power
service are anticipated.
At buildout under the Draft Land Use Element, citywide natural gas demand would increase by about
20% over current demand. SCG indicates that it expects to be able to meet this level of demand
(Peterson, 1998). Future infill development could be served by existing natural gas lines. Possible study
areas could be served with minor extensions of existing lines. No impact to natural gas service would be
anticipated.
No mitigation measures would be required.
Communications Systems. Buildout under the Draft Land Use Element would increase citywide demand
for communication service. However, any new development could be connected to the existing phone
system without significant alterations to the system or interruptions to service (Hermann, 1998). No
impact to communications would be anticipated.
No mitigation measures would be required.                            Table 6: Water Supply and Demand at

                                                                    City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                     Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
of water available to the City. However, an uncommitted water surplus estimated at 1,899 acre-feet per
year is expected to remain at buildout. Therefore, water supplies are considered adequate to serve the
level of development that would be accommodated under the Draft Land Use Element.
It should also be noted that conversion of study areas 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 to urban use would
reduce agricultural water demand in the Carpinteria Valley. Therefore, the overall increase in
water demand presented in Table 5 likely overstates the actual net increase in demand.
The Draft Open Space, Recreation and Conservation and Public Facilities & Services Elements include
policies that would minimize impacts to water supply:
    •    Policy OCS-10b encourages improvements in water quality and conservation for the
         community water supply.
    •    Policies PF1a through PF1f encourage a range of ideas for conserving water, including
         reclamation, groundwater recharge, monitoring of water resources, and update of water
         regulations and codes.
    •    Policy PF5k states that the City will require proposed developments to demonstrate that
         adequate water supply and water systems are or will be available to serve the project site.
Implementation of these water supply policies would be anticipated to mitigate possible impacts to water
supply. No additional mitigation is required.
Sanitary Sewer Service. Full buildout under the Draft Land Use Element would add an estimated 734
residences. This amount of new development would generate an estimated 209,190 gallons per day
(0.209 mgd) of sewage, which is within the available capacity of 0.5 mgd. Therefore, upgrades to the
City’s wastewater treatment plant are not expected to be necessary in the future as the City approaches
buildout.
The Draft Public Facilities & Services Element includes several policies to mitigate potential impacts to
the sanitary sewer system, including:
    •    Policies PF2a states that the City will monitor capacity of to sewer plant to assure adequate
         service.
    •    Policy PF2b states that the City will coordinate the evaluation of new development with the
         CSD.
    •    Policy PF5k requires that developers demonstrate the adequacy of sewer facilities to meet the
         needs of planned development.
With implementation of these policies, the City would be able to plan for possible sewer system
upgrades as needed. Therefore, impacts to the local sewer system are not anticipated.
Storm Water Drainage. Infill development within the existing City limits may incrementally increase
surface runoff to local drainages; however, because the city is largely built out, no significant increase in
runoff is anticipated. Any incremental increases associated with individual development projects would
be addressed on a case-by-case basis.
Development in the study areas may also increase impervious surface area, thereby resulting in greater
runoff during storms. The amount of runoff and extent of impact to the City’s storm water drainage
system from development in study areas would depend upon the type and size of future developments.
                                                                                                   Appendix B - 29

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
Conversion of agricultural lands in study areas 3 and 6 are the largest areas and would have the greatest
potential for significant increases in runoff. Runoff from these areas would affect Santa Monica,
Franklin, and Carpinteria Creeks. Santa Monica and Franklin Creeks currently experience some localized
flooding.
The City and Santa Barbara County Flood Control District currently plan four drainage improvements in
the City, primarily to improve drainage on the west side of the City for the Franklin Creek and Santa
Monica Creek drainage areas. These improvements will take place over the next few years and would be
expected to alleviate current drainage problems.
Both the Draft Open Space, Recreation and Conservation Element and the Draft Safety Element include
policies designed to mitigate potential impacts relating to storm drainage:
      •    Policies S4a, S4b, S4c, and S4d require adherence to the County flood plain ordinance,
           discourage development within flood plains, encourage setbacks from channels, and encourage
           flood plain studies to update flood zones.
      •    Policy S4e discourages further channelization or banking of creeks in the planning area, requires
           the City to establish setback guidelines, and encourages the identification and pursuit of
           opportunities to remove existing concrete channels.
      •    Policy OSC-5b encourages protection and restoration of creeks where it would not interfere
           with good flood control practices.
      •    Policies OSC-5c and OSC-5d state that creeks should only be altered if no other solution is
           available and require setbacks from creeks.
These policies would contribute to mitigation of impacts associated with increased runoff, as well as secondary impacts to biological
resources associated with channelization of creeks for flood control.
Implementation of the policies contained in the Draft Safety and Open Space, Recreation and
Conservation Elements would be expected to mitigate impacts to the local drainage system.
Solid Waste. Based upon a rate of three pounds of solid waste generated per person per day, buildout of
the Draft Land Use Element would be expected to generate an additional 1,145 tons of solid waste
annually, or about 3.1 additional tons on a daily basis. The Toland Road Landfill has adequate capacity
to accommodate such an increase. In addition, the Public Facilities Element includes policies (PF-2(c)
through PF-2(e)) designed to minimize solid waste generation and provide for additional solid waste
disposal facilities in the event when capacity no longer remains at the Toland Road Landfill. Therefore,
impacts relating to solid waste disposal are not considered significant.
3.17 HUMAN HEALTH
Setting
Existing facilities involving the use of hazardous materials are described in the Draft Safety Element and
in Section 3.10, Risk of Upset.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impacts relating to the use, storage, and transport of hazardous materials are discussed in Section 3.10,
Risk of Upset. A number of Draft Safety Element policies pertaining to hazardous material safety are
described in that section. With implementation of those policies, no significant risks to human health are
anticipated.

3.18 AESTHETICS
Setting
Carpinteria is a small beach town in a rural setting. The City’s coastal setting is framed by the foothills of
the Santa Ynez Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, and includes natural coastal terrain and agricultural
lands. The City itself is composed of several distinct and unique neighborhoods and districts that are
defined by a well-connected network of streets and open spaces. The physical center of the City is the
downtown district by the beach, around which the neighborhoods and other districts are arrayed. A
complete discussion of these districts and neighborhoods can be found in the Draft Community Design
Element.
U.S. Highway 101 is the major public viewing corridor traversing the City. The highway affords
excellent views of the mountains and ocean, as well as views of the agricultural land that surrounds the
City itself. Foothill Road (State Route 192) runs north of, and parallel to, the freeway. Its elevated
location at the base of the foothills allows for excellent ocean views to the south, across the City. Within
the core of the City, Linden Avenue is the primary north-south roadway from which views of the
downtown, ocean, and hillsides are possible. Carpinteria Avenue is a major east-west roadway from
which motorists and pedestrians can view the surrounding natural and built environment.
Several areas within the City are particularly noteworthy for their high visual quality. The Carpinteria
Bluffs include substantial undeveloped area, much of which supports natural coastal sage and other
sensitive habitats. As one of the primary access areas to the beach, the Bluffs are particularly sensitive
visually.
The Downtown/Old Town subarea is the heart of the City, containing most of the civic and commercial
functions, as well as several vital residential neighborhoods. This area is bounded by U.S. Highway 101
on the north, the railroad tracks on the south and southwest, and Carpinteria Creek on the east. The
Downtown/Old Town subarea has the interconnected street network structure of a true town and a
variety of distinctive building types fronting onto traditional, pedestrian-oriented streets.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Sensitive Viewing Corridors. Buildout under the Draft Land Use Element would accommodate new
development, particularly within several proposed Sphere of Influence study areas that are currently
either developed with greenhouses (area 3) or agriculture (areas 1, 4, 5, and 6). Study areas 5 and 6 are
highly visible from the freeway, which is a sensitive viewing corridor. Development within these areas
could therefore result in visual impacts. Development in study areas 3 and 4 would be highly visible
from Foothill Road, another sensitive public viewing corridor. In these areas, development could
potentially block or alter the ocean views from Foothill Road.
Infill development in portions of the City could also affect public viewing corridors. Urbanized
development within the Carpinteria Bluffs would be visible from the freeway, the Union Pacific rail line,
and along portions of the beachfront below the bluffs. Development in this area could alter views from
these locations. At several locations just north of U.S. Highway 101, additional multi-family residential
and industrial development would be highly visible from the freeway. In particular, the areas east of
Carpinteria Creek and the far western edge of the City could experience such development.
The following Draft Land Use Element, Community Design Element, and Circulation Element policies
address potential impacts relating to viewing corridors:
                                                                                                     Appendix B - 31

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
      •    Policy CD-8e ensures that major north-south streets be designed to preserve views of the
           ocean and hills to the north.
Implementation of this policy, in addition to the general principles underlying these elements, would
minimize impacts to viewing corridors. No significant impacts are anticipated.
Urban Design. In the absence of appropriate urban design criteria, development that could be
accommodated under the Draft Land Use Element has the potential to be insensitive to the need for
high quality architectural design, landscaping, and public art. It could also result in visually intrusive
features, such as inappropriate signs.
The Draft Community Design Element is specifically intended to address such impacts, and nearly all of
its policies are intended to guide high quality architecture, site design, and landscape and hardscape
elements. The policies within the Community Design Element address the specific design needs of the
various neighborhoods and districts of the City, as well as public spaces and streets. Building
orientation, heights, and materials are specified, and intended to ensure compatibility with neighboring
land uses while enhancing the visual quality of the City. See the Draft Community Design Element for
the complete text of these policies, which are broad and comprehensive in scope. No additional
mitigation measures are required for urban design impacts.
Community Character. New development that could be accommodated under the Draft Land Use
Element would incrementally alter the small town character of the City to a more urban environment.
However, most of the new development anticipated under the element would either be infill or limited
expansion into the areas immediately north of the freeway and adjacent to existing developed areas. In
such cases, the expansion would be visually consistent with existing development, and would not
fundamentally alter the small town character of the City.
The Draft Community Design Element specifically addresses such issues. Generally speaking, all of the
policies of that element collectively contribute to mitigating this potential impact. However, several
specific policies within the both the Draft Land Use Element and Draft Community Design Element
directly address potential impacts to the character of the City. In general, the policies require logical,
sustainable development that preserves the essential elements of the City and provides its character,
including the architecture, coastal orientation, open space amenities, and distinct physical setting. See the
Land Use and Community Design Elements for a complete listing of relevant policies.
These policies adequately address potential impacts to the City’s small town character. No additional
mitigation measures are necessary.

                                                                                        Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
3.19 CULTURAL RESOURCES
Setting
A number of historical properties are found in Carpinteria. The City has established four historical
landmarks, while the State of California has established one landmark. These landmarks, described in
detail in the Draft Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element, include:
•    Wardholme Torrey Pine, Carpinteria City Landmark #1
•    Heath Ranch Park and Adobe, Carpinteria City Landmark #2
•    Site of Original Library, Carpinteria City Landmark #3
•    Palm Trees, Carpinteria City Landmark #4
•    La Carpinteria, California State Landmark #535
Archaeological resources are present in the City as well. According to a records search conducted by the
California Archaeological Inventory Information Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
25 archaeological surveys have been conducted in the City, revealing 20 archaeological sites.
Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Development that would be accommodated under the Draft Land Use Element would not be expected
to directly affect any of the identified historic resources in the City. Future development throughout the
City would have the potential to affect both identified and as yet unidentified archaeological resources.
However, the Draft Land Use Element includes a policy several implementation policies specifically
intended to ensure that important resources are not affected by future development. These include the
following:
     •    Policy OSC-16a discourages development on important archaeological or historically valuable
          sites.
     •    Implementation policies 66-70 provide several specific measures to avoid impacts to
          important archaeological sites, including investigation prior to grading activity, review of
          development proposals, and possible purchase of important sites.
     These measures would generally be expected to avoid impacts to cultural resources.
                                                                                                      Appendix B - 33

4.0 LONG-TERM IMPACTS
This section includes the CEQA-required discussions of growth inducing impacts, significant irreversible
environmental changes, and ways in which the project may have short-term benefits to the detriment of
long-term productivity. Although the primary focus of these discussions is on buildout of the Draft
Land Use Element, the analysis considers the overall effects of the entire General Plan Update.
4.1 GROWTH INDUCING IMPACTS
The Draft Land Use Element would accommodate up to 734 new residences throughout the City. It is
the specific purpose of the draft plan to accommodate orderly economic and population growth in
Carpinteria. Consequently, plan adoption could indirectly induce both population and economic growth
in the City, although the level of growth would depend upon a variety of factors, including the local
economy and associated demand for housing in the area.
Five of the six areas proposed for expansions of the City’s sphere of influence are currently either
farmland or greenhouses but could be developed with residential uses under the Draft Land Use
Element. Therefore, plan adoption could induce growth in these areas. As discussed in Section 3.8,
Land Use, conversion of prime farmland in areas 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 would be considered a significant and
unavoidable impact of the proposed project. On the other hand, by including several policies to limit
further encroachment into agricultural areas (see the Draft Open Space, Recreation & Conservation
Element), the draft plan would limit future growth in outlying agricultural areas of the Carpinteria Valley
and associated loss of farmland.
4.2 SIGNIFICANT IRREVERSIBLE CHANGES
Policies contained within the Draft General Plan would generally mitigate impacts associated with
development that would be accommodated under the Draft Land Use Element. As envisioned in the
plan, the community would retain its small beach town character while accommodating limited
population growth and encouraging viable economic development. In a general sense, adoption of the
draft plan would not be expected to significantly alter the character or environment of the Carpinteria
Valley.
Buildout in accordance with the plan would, however, irreversibly increase the consumption of non-
renewable resources such as oil and natural gas. Possible expansions of the City’s sphere of influence
and subsequent annexation would also irreversibly convert up to about 90 acres of farmland to urban
uses, a portion of which is designated as prime farmland. As discussed in Section 3.8, Land Use, this
conversion is considered a significant and unavoidable impact of the proposed project. It should be
recognized, however, that numerous Draft General Plan policies would discourage further annexation or
conversion of farmland to urban use (see the Draft Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element).
4.3 SHORT-
         SHORT-TERM USES VS. LON G-TERM PRODUCTIVITY
The Draft General Plan is specifically intended to provide for the planned and orderly development of
the City in order to ensure its long-term productivity. The policies contained in the plan are designed to
provide for growth that will allow continued economic prosperity while preserving the overall character
of the Carpinteria Valley. Therefore, project implementation would serve to benefit the long-term
productivity and sustainability of the community.

                                                                                         Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
5.0 ALTERNATIVES
As required by Section 15126(d) of the State CEQA Guidelines, this EIR examines a range of reasonable
alternatives to the proposed project. Alternatives examined include the CEQA-required “no build”
alternative, buildout under the current Land Use Element, and two reduced Sphere of Influence study
area alternatives, one of which emerged as the preferred General Plan over the course of the planning
and environmental review process (see Section 5.4 for a discussion of this alternative).
5.1 NO PROJECT (NO BUILD)
Under this alternative, no additional development would occur in the City or planning area.
Consequently, none of the development that would be accommodated under the Draft Land Use
Element would occur and none of the policies contained in any of the General Plan elements would be
implemented.
Because this alternative would involve no new development, it would have no impact, either adverse or
beneficial, upon environmental conditions in the Carpinteria Planning Area. Therefore, the significant
and unavoidable impact to agriculture that would occur in study areas 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 under the Draft
Land Use Element would not occur, nor would the mitigable impacts related to biological and cultural
resources, transportation, air quality, noise, utilities, public services, geology, and hazards. Conversely,
none of the aesthetic improvements that could occur through implementation of the Community Design
Element would occur under this alternative. Similarly, neither the planned improvements to the City’s
circulation system planned as part of the Draft Circulation Element nor the recreational improvements
proposed as part of the Draft Open Space, Recreation & Conservation Element would occur.
Assuming that all issue areas are of equal importance, this alternative would be considered
environmentally superior to the proposed project. Nevertheless, it must be recognized, that, with the
exception of impacts to agriculture, all impacts associated with buildout of the Draft Land Use Element
can be mitigated. Failure to adopt the General Plan Update would preclude any of the public
improvements proposed in the update. It should also be recognized that prohibiting any further
development in the City may have the potential to increase development pressure outside the City’s
Sphere of Influence. Development in such areas rather than within the City limits would conflict with
both current City and County of Santa Barbara land use policy.
5.2 NO PROJECT (CURRENT GENERAL PLAN)
This alternative would considers adopting no General Plan Update, but allowing buildout under the
current General Plan. Because the land use pattern of the Draft General Plan Update is identical to that
of the current General Plan, the only difference in overall buildout would be the elimination of the six
sphere of influence study areas. This would reduce overall residential buildout by about 303 units as
compared to the Draft General Plan Update, which represents a 51 percent reduction in additional
residential development potential.
By eliminating the proposed study areas, this alternative would eliminate the significant and unavoidable
impact to prime farmland associated with possible conversion of areas 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 to urban uses. In
addition, reducing overall buildout as compared to the Draft General Plan Update would incrementally
reduce impacts in issue areas where impacts are primarily a result of population growth. These include
public services (police, fire, schools, libraries), utilities (water, sewer, storm drains), traffic, and traffic-
related air quality and noise. Although the proposed project’s impacts in each of these areas could be
mitigated, this alternative’s impact would be incrementally lower. It should also be noted that the
current City Circulation Element includes several planned roadways north of U.S. 101 that would be
eliminated under the Draft Circulation Element Update. The elimination of these roadways may funnel
                                                                                                       Appendix B - 35

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
more traffic onto existing roadways in the future (notably, Casitas Pass Road), thereby increasing traffic
congestion on the existing circulation system. In addition, the reduction in overall population growth
could incrementally reduce impacts relating to geologic, fire, and risk of upset hazards. Again, although
project impacts could be mitigated, this alternative’s potential impact in each of these areas is considered
slightly lower.
Impacts in the areas of land use compatibility and aesthetics would, however, be considered slightly
greater under this alternative. If the City continues to implement the current General Plan, none of the
urban design policies recommended in the Draft Community Design Element would be adopted.
Therefore, the beneficial land use and aesthetic effects associated with implementation of the design
concepts included in the Draft General Plan Update would not be realized. In addition, because study
area 3 would not be converted from greenhouse use to urban development under this alternative,
ongoing compatibility issues between existing greenhouse operations and adjacent residences would
continue. This is considered a potentially significant and unavoidable land use conflict of this alternative.
5.3 REDUCED STUDY AREA I
This alternative considers adoption of the Draft Land Use Element without sphere study areas 1, 4, 5, 6
and 7. All other General Plan elements would be identical to those contained in the Draft General Plan.
Removal of the five study areas would reduce citywide residential development potential by about 216
units, a 36% reduction as compared to residential development potential under the proposed project.
The primary purpose of this alternative is to address the impact to agriculture that could occur as a result
of conversion of agricultural lands outside the current City limits to urban uses.
By removing study areas 1, 4, 5 6 and 7 from the proposed sphere of influence, this alternative would
eliminate the significant and unavoidable impact relating to the conversion of prime farmland to urban
uses in these areas. Nevertheless, the 32-acre Creekwood property that is within the existing City limits
could be converted to non-agricultural uses under this alternative. Because the Creekwood site is
considered Prime farmland and no mitigation is available to offset the loss of such farmland, conversion
of this agricultural site is considered an unavoidably significant impact of this alternative.
The overall reduction in development potential would incrementally reduce impacts in such issue areas
as public services, utilities, traffic, air quality, noise, and geologic and risk of upset hazards. Land use
compatibility and aesthetic impacts would be similar to those of the proposed project, although the
preservation of additional farmland as compared to the proposed project may be considered an
additional aesthetic benefit.
5.4 REDUCED STUDY AREA II
This alternative considers adoption of the revised Land Use Element without sphere study areas 3, and
4, and portions of 6 and 7. Study area 5 was determined to already be a part of the City’s Sphere of
Influence. The revised Annexation proposal includes four separate areas that illustrated on Figure LU-3
(page 19) of the land use element. This alternative also includes policy guidance for expanding
allowances for residential uses in non-residentially designated areas. The plan calls for use of the
Residential Overlay zone over certain parcels designated for industrial or commercial uses that would
permit residential-only use to be developed. The plan also establishes policy that would permit mixed-
use development in the industrial and commercial land use/zoning categories of the city. Both of these
new allowances are aimed at increasing housing growth opportunities in the largely built-out community
in locations that would have the dual benefit of reducing job generation and therefore housing demand.
This scenario represents key components of General Plan/Local Coastal Plan that has emerged as the
preferred alternative following public review of the Draft General Plan and EIR that strikes a balance
Appendix B - 36

                                                                        City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
                                                                                         Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
between the City’s built environment, protection of coastal resources, and improving the areas
jobs/housing balance. The alternative represents a shift in focus from a reliance on speculative future
annexations as a means to accommodate new growth to encouraging more realistic housing growth
through infill, densification, and mixed-use projects. The new policies discussed above that increase
housing growth opportunities in built areas of the community would accommodate an estimated 212
additional infill units. Overall, this alternative would accommodate up to an estimated 432 residential
units over the buildout of the existing City land use plan.
By removing much of study area from consideration for inclusion in the City’s Sphere of Influence, this
alternative would eliminate the significant and unavoidable impact relating to the conversion of prime
farmland within these areas to urban uses. Nevertheless, three other sites that are currently either in
agricultural use or are designated for such use under County or City land use plans, including the 32-acre
Creekwood site, would continue to create an unavoidably significant impact based on the Reduced Study
Area II alternative.
The overall reduction in development potential would incrementally reduce impacts in such issue areas
as public services, utilities, traffic, air quality, noise, and geologic and risk of upset hazards. Land use
compatibility and aesthetic impacts would be similar to those of the proposed project, although the
preservation of additional farmland as compared to the proposed project may be considered an
additional aesthetic benefit. Inclusion of the residential overlay in certain industrial and commercial
districts would have the potential to create additional compatibility conflicts in these areas; however,
appropriate siting and design of residential structures would minimize such conflicts. Although this
alternative represents a reduction in overall housing growth potential, because the City has so small a
potential for growth under any realistic build-out scenario, the reduction is not expected to have a
measurable effect on the areas housing prices due to a limitation on the supply of housing. In any case,
the potential economic effect of the land use plan would not be considered a significant environmental
impact under CEQA.
6.0 MITIGATION M ONITORING PROGRAM
6.1 Responsibility. The Policies and Implementation policies of the General Plan are monitored by the
Department of Community Development through annual review with the Planning Commission and
City Council in an Annual Report. The Annual Report is also mandated by State law to be sent to the
State Department of Housing and Community Development. The Department implements the policies
and implementation policies of the Plan primarily in two ways.
6.2 Program Implementation. Policies of the Plan in some cases call for the creation of new programs
to carry out the policies of the Plan. The Plan includes time frames for implementation of such
programs that range from 2-15 years. The Department reviews these policies annually with the City’s
Planning Commission and City Council and determines whether they will be included in the City’s
Annual Work Program and to which Department the work will be assigned for follow through.
6.3 Project Implementation. Policies and Implementation policies also include guidance and standards
for the physical development of the City. The Plan includes both direction for regulations to be
implemented and specific standards that are to be used in conjunction with other City development
regulations as the standard of review for development projects. The Department of Community
Development, Planning Division, conducts project review including the preparation of the requisite
environmental clearance documentation. Through these processes the policies and standards of the
                                                                                                       Appendix B - 37

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix B: Final EIR - April 2001
General Plan/Local Coastal Plan are implemented. Both the Planning Commission and City Council
review their effectiveness annually as a part of the City’s General Plan Annual Report.

Summary: The City of Carpinteria will be the Lead Agency and will prepare an
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the project identified below. We request your
agency’s input as to the scope and content of environmental information that is
germane to your agency’s statutory responsibilities in connection with the proposed
project. The EIR is intended to serve as an information document to inform decision-
makers and the general public of the environmental consequences of the proposed
action.
Your input is important because your agency may need to use the EIR when

Project Title:        City of Carpinteria General Plan and Local Coastal Plan Update
                                                                                            Appendix C - 1

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix C: Notice of Preparation
Project Location:                 City of Carpinteria, Santa Barbara County, California
Project Description: The proposed project is an update of the City of Carpinteria’s
General Plan and Local Coastal Plan. The General Plan addresses the community’s
vision for development during the planning horizon, identified as the year 2020. The
General Plan includes a map of proposed urban boundaries and planned land uses. It
also contains goals, objectives and policies that will govern the growth of the City of
Carpinteria and the management of its resources. The General Plan update includes
extensive revisions of the seven mandated elements and the creation of two optional
elements as follows: Land Use, Community Design, Circulation, Open Space &
Conservation, Housing, Noise, Safety, and Public Facilities. The Housing Element was
recently adopted, and will be not undergo substantive changes. It will, however, be
reformatted to be consistent with the other proposed elements.
An important feature of the General Plan is that accommodates several future
annexations to the City. The six annexation areas are all north of U.S. Highway 101, on
the northern edge of the City, and encompass a total of 48.3 acres. The annexations
would be adjacent to the City’s Canalino/Santa Monica, El Carro to Carpinteria Creek,
and East of Creek land use districts. The intent of including the proposed annexations
is to make land available for future growth.
In addition to allowing buildout of the annexation areas, the General Plan allows for
buildout of vacant and under-developed lands within the City limits. Policies
contained in the General Plan are directed at improving the livability of existing
neighborhoods and supporting local planning efforts to improve the community.

4.      Project Description:
The proposed project is an update of the City of Carpinteria’s General Plan and Local
Coastal Plan. The General Plan addresses the community’s vision for development during
the planning horizon, identified as the year 2020. The Plan includes a map of proposed
urban boundaries and planned land uses, as well as goals, objectives and policies that will
govern the growth of the City of Carpinteria and the management of its resources. The
General Plan update includes revisions to all seven mandated elements, including Land
Use, Circulation, Conservation, Open Space, Noise, Safety, and Housing. It also includes
a new Community Design Element.
The General Plan would accommodate several annexations to the City (see Figure 1).
The six annexation areas are all north of U.S. Highway 101, on the northern edge of the
City, and encompass a total of 48.3 acres. The intent of including the proposed
annexations is to recognize areas that already serve as extensions of the City and to allow
logical growth in areas contiguous to the existing City limit.
In addition to allowing buildout of the annexation areas, the General Plan allows for
buildout of vacant and under-developed lands within the City limits. Policies contained in
the General Plan are directed at improving the livability of existing neighborhoods and
supporting local planning efforts to improve the community.
The following table provides an indication of the new development buildout potential of the
General Plan Update.

Geologic Processes Impact Section Notes
1a, 1b, 1,c, 1d, 1e, 1f, 1g: Potentially Significant. Implementation of the General Plan could
result in some changes in topography in the planning area. It could also result in development
of some areas that are subject to unstable earth conditions or other seismic hazards.
Excavation and grading activities have the potential to modify unique physical features and
increase wind or water erosion. If development occurs near creek areas, changes in siltation
or erosion may occur due to changes in runoff patterns. Site-specific grading studies, soil
reports, hydrology studies, and geology reports will be required prior to construction to
determine potential impacts.
Impacts related to geologic hazards will be evaluated in the EIR.

Water Impact Section Notes
3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f, 3g, 3h, 3i: Potentially Significant. The development of previously
undeveloped areas could cause changes in drainage patterns and surface runoff.
Development could also alter the course of flood waters. Runoff could also alter the water
quality of the receiving water body. The expected growth in population could increase
groundwater withdrawals and reduce the quantity of local groundwater supplies. Increases
in private uses of groundwater could potentially reduce the amount of water otherwise

Impact Section Notes:
10a, 10b: Potentially Significant. Proposed development could result in an increase in the
number of trucks carrying hazardous materials, including oil and chemicals, although such
increases are related more to the overall increase in development intensity, rather than any
specific land use. Increased traffic and new development could alter existing emergency
response plans in place by the City.
The potential to introduce hazardous materials and affect emergency response plans will be
evaluated in the EIR.
                                                                                                Appendix C-11

Impact Section Notes:
16a-f: Potentially Significant. The growth anticipated under the General Plan may result in the
need for additional public utility facilities. While potential impacts are possible for all utilities,
the development of substantial new infrastructure is generally associated with water,
wastewater, and solid waste utilities. The specific impact to those utilities is not yet known.
Impacts to water, wastewater and solid waste infrastructure will be evaluated in the EIR.
The EIR will evaluate impacts to water, wastewater and solid waste facilities that serve the
planning area.

Impact Section Notes:
17b: Potentially Significant. Development under the proposed General Plan has the potential
to expose new residents to health hazards, including contaminated soils or groundwater
associated with past development. Development near rail corridors could expose people and
property to hazards associated with spills from rolling stock using the corridor. The degree of
impact would be a function of the location of new development. The Safety Element of the
General Plan addresses potential impacts, and includes mitigation for new development
accommodated under the Land Use Element.
17a: Insignificant. The provisions of the General Plan would not create any health hazards or
potential health hazards.

Impact Section Notes:
Potentially Significant. Development under the General Plan would alter the current built
environment. Policies contained in the Community Design Element would be expected to
address aesthetic impacts. Nevertheless, new development could be visually intrusive,
depending on its location and size.

Impact Section Notes:
19a, 19b: Potentially Significant. Much of the area slated for development has not yet been
surveyed for cultural resources. Consequently, development under the General Plan could
impact known or unknown archaeological resources. In addition, development could affect
existing historic resources, depending on the location and intensity of development. Such
impacts would also depend on whether new development would include alteration of existing
historic resources.
19c, 19d: Insignificant. As a General Plan, the proposed project guides future land
development, but does not specify the precise type and location of development. Such
development, if constructed in accordance with local applicable ordinances, would not affect
unique cultural or ethnic values, nor would it impact religious uses in place within the City.
The EIR will address potential impacts to archaeological and historic resources that could
occur within the planning area.

IV.      ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINATION
         On the basis of this initial evaluation:
         I find that the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant
         effect on the environment, and a NEGATIVE DECLARATION will
         be prepared.
         I find that although the proposed project could have a significant
         effect on the environment, there will not be a significant effect in
         this case because the mitigation measures described on an
         attached sheet have been added to the project. A NEGATIVE
         DECLARATION WILL BE PREPARED.*
         I find the project may have a significant effect on the environment.
         With additional information (studies) relating to certain impacts, it
         may be possible to find that there will not be significant impacts in
         this because mitigation measures can be added to the project.
         Without said information (studies) and mitigation measures, the
         project may have a significant effect on the environment and an
         environmental impact report will be required.
X        find the proposed project WILL have a significant effect on the
         environment, and an ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is
         required.

Seismically-
Seismically-Induced Hazards
Fault Surface Rupture and Ground Shaking
The locations of the faults within the planning area are shown on Figure S-1. Appendix C of Fault-
Rupture Hazard Zones in California, Special Publication 42 by the CDMG (Hart, 1994), provides
guidelines for evaluating the hazard of surface fault rupture at a site. According to the guidelines, certain
geologic investigative methods are more helpful than others in locating faults and evaluating the timing
of activity.
Generally, the more recent the faulting the greater the probability for future faulting. Faults with a
known historic activity during the last 200 years have a greater probability for future activity than faults
classified as Holocene (activity within the last 11,000 years). The development of a new fault or
reactivation of a long-inactive fault is relatively uncommon, and in general is not a concern in planning
site development.
More detailed investigations should be made for hospitals, high-rise buildings, and other critical or
sensitive structures, than for low-occupancy structures. Geologic methods utilized to locate existing
faults and evaluate the timing of their activity include:
     •   Direct Field Observation
         1. Observing geologic units faulted in a trench or road cut and identifying their ages
         2. Observing fault-related geomorphic (topographic) features
         3. Mapping, both on and beyond the site, geologic and soil units, geologic structures,
             geomorphic features, springs, and deformation of manmade structures due to fault creep
         4. Detailed and direct observation of trenches and other excavations which permits
             observation of continuously exposed geologic units, soils and structures
         5. Drilling borings and excavating test pits to permit collection of data on geologic units and
             groundwater at specific locations
     •   Review of Available Information
         1. Observing fault-related geomorphic features, vegetation, soil contrasts, and other lineaments
             of possible fault origin on aerial photographs or on remotely obtained images
         2. Reviewing published and unpublished literature and records concerning geologic units,
             faults, ground-water barriers, and other factors
     •   Other Methods
         1.  Geophysical investigations
         2.  Aerial reconnaissance
         3.  Geodetic and strain measurements
         4.  Radiometric analysis
                                                                                                        Appendix E-1

Appendix E: Safety Element - Technical Background Information
Liquefaction
Lateral spread is the movement of blocks of ground as a result of liquefaction in a subsurface layer.
During liquefaction of a subsurface layer of sediment into a fluid mass, gravity can cause the mass to
flow down slope. Examples of this include movement into a cut slope such as a river channel, irrigation
channel, or a storm drain. Lateral spread typically occurs on gentle slopes ranging from 0.3 degrees to 3
degrees. Ground movement of several feet to tens of feet is possible. Lateral spread is particularly
destructive for pipelines, utilities, bridge piers, and other structures having shallow foundations.
Ground oscillation may take place where liquefaction occurs at depth and where the ground slope is too
gentle for lateral spreading. When deeper zones liquefy, overlying sediments that are not liquefied can
decouple and differentially move. Manifestations of ground oscillation include a ground wave, ground
settlement, and opening and closing of fissures.
Flow failure occurs when blocks of ground are decoupled from underlying sediment and move
downslope. Flow failures occur on slopes greater than 3 degrees. These blocks can be quite large, from
tens of feet to several miles in length and width. Underwater flow failures can also generate tsunamis.
Flow failures constitute the greatest hazard produced by liquefaction.
Loss of bearing strength can occur under a structure when the underlying soil liquefies.                                              Large
movement in the soil column is possible, allowing for structures to settle, tip, or float upwards.
Silty sand deposits have the greatest potential for liquefaction. Gravelly sand or deposits containing less
than 15 percent clay are less likely to liquefy, and bouldery and cobbly gravels or deposits containing
more than 15 percent clay are not known to liquefy (Tinsley, et al., 1985).
Depth to groundwater influences the susceptibility for liquefaction. Where groundwater is within 10 feet
from ground surface, the susceptibility is very high. For groundwater between 10 and 40 feet, the
susceptibility is high. For groundwater at 40 to 50 feet below grade, the susceptibility is low, and for
groundwater deeper than 50 feet, the susceptibility is very low.
The magnitude and duration of ground shaking also has an influence on the susceptibility of liquefaction.
The larger the magnitude of an earthquake, the greater the distance at which liquefaction is observed.
Similarly, the longer the duration of shaking, the greater the distance at which liquefaction is observed.

(Dibblee, 1986, 1987), and the topographic maps for the Carpinteria and White Ledge Peak Quadrangles
(USGS, 1988), areas within the city of Carpinteria and the surrounding planning area that fall into a high
hazard category for landslides due to seismically-induced ground shaking are shown on Figure S-1.
Mud Flows, Rock Falls, and Seacliff Retreat
In general, the areas most susceptible to debris and mudflows correspond to the areas with a high
potential for earthquake-induced landslides as shown on Figure S-1. The areas most susceptible to rock
falls and seacliff retreat are also shown on Figure S-1.
Soil Hazards
Expansive Soils
Soils with a high clay content, and a moderate to high shrink-swell potential, can be derived from
weathering and erosion of many different rock types. The chemical breakdown of certain minerals
through the weathering process can produce a clay soil in an area underlain with bedrock. In the
planning area zones of soil with a high shrink-swell potential, as described in the Soil Survey of Santa
Barbara County (Edwards, et al., 1970), generally correspond with mapped outcrops of claystone,
siltstone, and shale as mapped by Dibblee (1986 and 1987). The areas of potentially highly expansive soil
are shown on Figure S-2. Large-scale expansive soil problems should not be an issue in the study area
provided that adequate soils and foundation studies are performed prior to construction and that UBC
guidelines are followed.
Soil Settlement
Natural soils that are potentially susceptible to settlement can be found in the Carpinteria planning area.
The areas with high potential for settlement are shown on Figure S-2.
                                                                                                                Appendix E-3
City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix E: Safety Element - Technical Background Information
Settlement hazards can occur in areas with permeable alluvial deposits, where fill is improperly placed,
and in areas where construction occurs across a cut/fill boundary. Areas of poorly consolidated
sediments should be engineered to support the weight of a structure that is to be built on the site. In
areas of fill, the fill should be compacted to adequately support the proposed development, and
structures should not be placed partially on cut and partially on fill unless specifically designed by civil
and structural engineers. Large-scale settlement problems should not be an issue in the study area
provided that adequate soils and foundation studies are performed prior to construction and that UBC
guidelines are followed.
Subsidence
The extraction of groundwater from an aquifer beneath an alluvial valley can result in subsidence, or
settlement, of the alluvial soils. The factors which influence the potential occurrence and severity of
alluvial soil settlement due to groundwater withdrawal include: degrees of groundwater confinement;
thickness of aquifer systems; individual and total thickness of fine-grained beds; compressibility of the
fine-grained layers; probable future depth of wells; and probable future decline in groundwater levels.
Oil extraction sometimes also results in overlying soil settlement or differential subsidence. The
Carpinteria area has not had significant subsidence problems due to oil extraction, primarily because oil
operations are predominantly offshore.
As yet, no recognized subsidence has occurred within the study area due to either groundwater or oil
extraction. Accordingly, the potential for subsidence in the study area is considered to be minimal. If
present, these hazards would be predominantly manifested in areas of unconsolidated alluvium within
the current city boundaries, and to the north and west of the city.
Flood Hazards
Development within the city of Carpinteria is primarily on a low-lying alluvial area with a sandy shoreline
fronting onto the Santa Barbara Channel within the Pacific Ocean. The watershed is defined by the
Santa Ynez Mountains to the north. Several streams cross through the Carpinteria area and drain into
the Pacific Ocean: Carpinteria Creek; Franklin Creek; Santa Monica Creek; Arroyo Paredon; and Toro
Canyon Creek.
Flood hazard areas of the city of Carpinteria are subject to periodic inundation which can result in
destruction of property, loss of life, health and safety hazards, and disruption of commerce and
governmental services. Encroachment onto floodplains, such as artificial fills and structures, reduces the
capacity of the floodplain and increases the height of flood water upstream of the obstructions.
Floodplain management involves the balancing of economic gain associated with land development
within the floodplain against the increased flood hazard.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) establishes base flood heights for 100-year and
500-year flood zones. The 100-year flood zone is defined as the area that could be inundated by the
flood which has a one percent probability of occurring in any given year. The 500-year flood is defined
as the flood with a 0.2 percent probability of occurring in any given year.
Figure S-3 illustrates areas of the city that could be inundated by the 100- and 500-year flood.
Carpinteria, Santa Monica, and Franklin Creeks have been improved by the Santa Barbara County Flood
Control and Water Conservation District, the U.S. Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Soil Conservation
Service. According to the Santa Barbara County Flood Control Engineer, lands above 250 feet elevation

                                                               Appendix E: Safety Element - Technical Background Information
within the city limits of Carpinteria should be free from flood hazard. The most problematic drainage
area is the low-lying coastal area near the El Estero marsh.
Major development in or near the El Estero marsh should not be considered without resolution of the
flood and/or drainage problems. Future land development near Arroyo Paredon or Toro Canyon Creek
will need to consider the flooding potential and possible improvements needed along these creeks.
Flood Control and Prevention
Flood hazards may be alleviated through a variety of measures, some corrective and some preventive.
Corrective measures include warning and relief programs, flood-proofing of existing structures, and the
construction of flood control works. Preventive measures include public acquisition of floodplain lands,
public information programs, development policies and regulations.
Flood control prevention is the responsibility of the Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water
Conservation District. The District has the authority to maintain and construct flood control facilities
on all major channels.
On the Federal level, the regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is
administered by the Federal Insurance Administration (a component of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency), require that communities adopt land use restrictions for the 100-year floodplain in
order to qualify for Federally-subsidized flood insurance. The program requires that residential
structures be elevated above the level of the 100-year flood and that other types of structures be
floodproof. The NFIP was established by Congress with the passage of the National Flood Insurance
Act of 1968. The NFIP was broadened and modified with the passage of the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973 and other legislative measures.
Fire Hazards
Wildland Fires
The principal effects of brush fires include loss of vegetative ground cover, increased erosion, loss of
building structures, loss of utilities, and loss of life. Loss of the vegetative ground cover can result in
damage to valuable recreational and open space areas. However, many of the plant and animal
associations in the natural communities have adapted themselves to a fire-climax cycle, and will naturally
generate themselves through fire. Hence, they generally are not permanently affected.
Loss of vegetative cover results in secondary erosional impacts, especially in steeply sloped hillside areas.
When a slope is burned over by a fire of intense heat, a chemical reaction in the soil takes place which
makes it less porous. As the rains of winter come, rain water runs off and causes mudslides and
mudflows. Properties not affected directly by the fire may be damaged or destroyed by the effects of
increased runoff due to brush fire.
The loss of man-made improvements in the brush covered areas constitute most of the dollar loss from
fires. Losses along this line include homes, barns and sheds, utility lines and facilities. The loss of
valuable watershed area combined with the actual suppression costs also are major determinants of the
total dollar costs of any fire. The potential for loss of life is the most dangerous aspect of brush fires.
Occasionally, trapped residents are injured or killed when there is no warning of the impending disaster,
or when they simply refuse to evacuate their homes in the face of the fire. However, the largest loss of
life occurs to the professional fire fighters who are killed while fighting brush fires, which have a highly
unpredictable nature, or in other accidents during the support operations necessary to suppress the fire.
                                                                                                         Appendix E-5
City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix E: Safety Element - Technical Background Information
As the populations of California cities continue to grow, more and more people are encroaching into
what firefighters call the urban/wildland interface, the perimeter of urban areas adjacent to wildlands.
According to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) statistics, since 1980 more
than 5,000 structures have been damaged in wildland fires, triple the amount of damage that occurred in
the previous 15-year period. Some of the more recent devastating examples of this phenomenon
include:
          Santa Barbara: Painted Cave Fire of June 1990, which swept across almost 5,000 acres of coastal
          hillsides, destroying more than 600 houses.
          Oakland/Berkeley: 1991 Fire covering over 1,600 acres, decimated entire neighborhoods, killing
          25 people, destroying 2,900 homes, and leaving more than $1.5 billion in property damage.
          Malibu to Laguna Beach: A series of fires in the fall of 1993, which killed three people and
          destroyed over 1,000 homes.
Many homes in the Carpinteria planning area, predominantly those north of Foothill Road, are located
along the urban/wildland interface. Figure S-4 presents the fire hazard areas. The level of hazard is
based largely upon the type of ground cover, the slope of the ground, and the ability of fire crews and
engines to access the area.
Fire Hazard Reduction
Experienced firefighters believe they can no longer protect homes and lives as well as they did in the past
with fuel loading causing such catastrophic fires (Gilmer, 1994). It is up to the homeowners living on
the urban/wildland interface to establish defensible space. Defensible space describes a band of
managed vegetation around a home that stops the movement of fire by denying fuel. Natural vegetation
plays an important role in erosion control. The goal is to obtain a balance between fire hazard reduction
and erosion control. Defensible space also provides a place where fire fighters can do their jobs without
unnecessary risk to themselves. According to the CDF, as many as 80 percent of the homes lost to
wildfires in the past could have been saved if the owners had followed a few simple fire safe practices.
Some of these fire safe practices include:
     •    Use of fire resistant landscaping. Fire resistant plants are those with low growth habit (generally less than 18
          inches in height), low fuel volume, and high moisture content. Such plants offer far less fuel than upright woody
          shrubs.
     •    Irrigation and maintenance of landscaping. A fire resistant plant will lose this quality if allowed to dry out.
          Maintenance insures the effectiveness of the fire resistant landscape by retaining proper spacing between plants and
          removing dead/dry vegetation.
     •    Use of fire-retardant roofs. Untreated wood shake roofs provide fuel for an advancing fire. Class A roofs provide
          the most protection. These include: clay tile, concrete tile, fibrous cement shake, metal tile, and fiberglass
          composition shingles.
The Carpinteria-Summerland Fire Protection District has adopted the County of Santa Barbara Fire
Department’s Fire Hazard Reduction Program, as well as initiated the following City ordinances related
to fire reduction:
     1. Within the urban limit zone, all facilities larger than a single-family residence must be equipped with fire
          sprinklers.
     2. Outside of the urban limit zone all facilities, including single-family residences, must be equipped with fire
          sprinklers.

    3. Smoke detectors must be present in all building structures.
    4. The Fire Protection District must have access to all roof areas.
    5. All roofing must be constructed of fire retardant materials.
Peakload Water Requirements
According to the Carpinteria Valley Water District, the Carpinteria Groundwater Basin has a storage
capacity and safe yield large enough to supply water, during peakload water requirements, for the current
population and new development.
In addition, the majority of the wells currently used for groundwater supply are located in the city limits.
In addition, the groundwater from these wells is pumped to the city’s main distribution system, and
directly to residents in the downtown area. The groundwater from the other wells is pumped into the
South Coast Conduit and eventually to the Carpinteria Reservoir. The Carpinteria Reservoir water is a
back-up supply of groundwater which is only used as needed, and is fed through pipelines to the city by
gravity flow.
The Carpinteria Valley Water District owns the fire hydrants in the city, but the hydrants are used as
needed by the Carpinteria-Summerland Fire Protection District. The Carpinteria Valley Water District
and Carpinteria-Summerland Fire Protection District work in conjunction to evaluate the need for water
reservoirs on properties where other sources of water are not available for fire fighting purposes.

supplied by neighborhood parks. Community parks are larger in scale than neighborhood parks but smaller
than regional parks.
Commute-shed. The area from which people do or might commute from their homes to a specific
workplace destination, given specific assumptions about maximum travel time or distance.

counties that include urbanized areas, to adopt and annually update a Congestion Management Plan.
Congregate Care. Apartment housing, usually for seniors, in a group setting that includes independent
living and sleeping accommodations in conjunction with shared dining and recreational facilities. (See
“Community Care Facility.”)
Conservation. The management of natural resources to prevent waste, destruction, or neglect. The state
mandates that a Conservation Element be included in the general plan.
Consistent. Free from variation or contradiction. Programs in the General Plan are to be consistent, not
contradictory or preferential. State law requires consistency between a general plan and implementation
policies such as the zoning ordinance.
Convenience Goods. Retail items generally necessary or desirable for everyday living, usually purchased at a
convenient nearby location. Because these goods cost relatively little compared to income, they are often
purchased without comparison shopping.
Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs). A term used to describe restrictive limitations which
may be placed on property and its use, and which usually are made a condition of holding title or lease.
Critical Facility. Facilities housing or serving many people which are necessary in the event of an

Appendix F: Glossary of Planning Terms
Dedication. The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for public use, and the acceptance of
land for such use by the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the public function for which it will be
used. Dedications for roads, parks, school sites, or other public uses often are made conditions for approval
of a development by a city.
Dedication, In lieu of. Cash payments which may be required of an owner or developer as a substitute for a
dedication of land, usually calculated in dollars per lot, and referred to as in lieu fees or in lieu contributions.
Defensible Space. (1) In fire fighting and prevention, a 30-foot area of non-combustible surfaces separating
urban and wildland areas. (2) In urban areas, open spaces, entry points, and pathways configured to provide
maximum opportunities to rightful users and/or residents to defend themselves against intruders and criminal
activity.
Density, Residential. The number of permanent residential dwelling units per acre of land. Densities
specified in the General Plan may be expressed in units per gross acre or per net developable acre. (See
“Acres, Gross,” and “Developable Acres, Net.”)
Density Bonus. The allocation of development rights that allow a parcel to accommodate additional square
footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the parcel is zoned, usually in exchange
for the provision or preservation of an amenity at the same site or at another location. Under California law,
a housing development that provides 20 percent of its units for lower income households, or 10 percent of its
units for very low-income households, or 50 percent of its units for seniors, is entitled to a density bonus.
(See “Development Rights, Transfer of.”)
Density, Employment. A measure of the number of employed persons per specific area (for example,
employees/acre).
Density Transfer. A way of retaining open space by concentrating densities-usually in compact areas
adjacent to existing urbanization and utilities-while leaving unchanged historic, sensitive, or hazardous areas.
In some jurisdictions, for example, developers can buy development rights of properties targeted for public
open space and transfer the additional density to the base number of units permitted in the zone in which
they propose to develop.
Design Review; Design Control. The comprehensive evaluation of a development and its impact on
neighboring properties and the community as a whole, from the standpoint of site and landscape design,
architecture, materials, colors, lighting, and signs, in accordance with a set of adopted criteria and standards.
“Design Control” requires that certain specific things be done and that other things not be done. Design
Control language is most often found within a zoning ordinance. “Design Review” usually refers to a system
set up outside of the zoning ordinance, whereby projects are reviewed against certain standards and criteria by
a specially established design review board or committee. (See “Architectural Control.”)
Destination Retail. Retail businesses that generate a special purpose trip and which do not necessarily
benefit from a high-volume pedestrian location.
Detention Dam/Basin/Pond. Dams may be classified according to the broad function they serve, such as
storage, diversion, or detention. Detention dams are constructed to retard flood runoff and minimize the
effect of sudden floods. Detention dams fall into two main types. In one type, the water is temporarily
stored, and released through an outlet structure at a rate which will not exceed the carrying capacity of the
channel downstream. Often, the basins are planted with grass and used for open space or recreation in
periods of dry weather. In the other type, most often called a Retention Pond, the water is held as long as
possible and may or may not allow for the controlled release of water. In some cases, the water is allowed to
seep into the permeable banks or gravel strata in the foundation. This latter type is sometimes called a
Water-Spreading Dam or Dike because its main purpose is to recharge the undergroundwater supply.
Detention dams are also constructed to trap sediment. These are often called Debris Dams.

hazards to, and without disruption of, or significant impact on, natural resource areas.
Developer. An individual who or business which prepares raw land for the construction of buildings or
causes to be built physical building space for use primarily by others, and in which the preparation of the land
or the creation of the building space is in itself a business and is not incidental to another business or activity.
Development. On land, in or under water, the placement or erection of any solid material or structure;
discharge or disposal of any dredged material or of any gaseous, liquid, solid or thermal waste; grading,
removing, dredging, mining or extraction of any materials; change in the density or intensity of use of land,
including, but not limited to, subdivision pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act (commencing with Section
66410 of the Government Code) and any other division of land, including lot splits, except where the land
division is brought about in connection with the purchase of such land by a public agency for public
recreational use; change in the intensity of use of water, or access thereto; construction, reconstruction,
demolition, or alteration of the size of any structure, including any facility of any private, public, or municipal
utility; and the removal or harvesting of major vegetation other than for agricultural purposes, kelp
harvesting, and timber operations which are in accordance with a timber harvesting plan submitted pursuant
to the provisions of the Z’berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973 (commencing with Section 4511).
Development Fee. (See “Impact Fee.”)
Development Rights. The right to develop land by a land owner who maintains fee-simple ownership over
the land or by a party other than the owner who has obtained the rights to develop. Such rights usually are
expressed in terms of density allowed under existing zoning. For example, one development right may equal
one unit of housing or may equal a specific number of square feet of gross floor area in one or more specified
zone districts. (See “Interest, Fee” and “Interest, Less-than-fee,” and “Development Rights, Transfer of
[TDR].”)
Development Rights, Transfer of (TDR). Also known as “Transfer of Development Credits,” a program
which can relocate potential development from areas where proposed land use or environmental impacts are
considered undesirable (the “donor” site) to another (“receiver”) site chosen on the basis of its ability to
accommodate additional units of development beyond that for which it was zoned, with minimal
environmental, social, and aesthetic impacts. (See “Development Rights.”)
Discourage, v. To advise or persuade to refrain from.
Discretionary Decision. As used in CEQA, an action taken by a governmental agency which calls for the
exercise of judgment in deciding whether to approve and/or how to carry out a project.

two families living independently of each other.
Dwelling Unit. A room or group of rooms (including sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation facilities, but
not more than one kitchen), which constitutes an independent housekeeping unit, occupied or intended for
occupancy by one household on a long-term basis.
Easement. Usually the right to use property owned by another for specific purposes or to gain access to
another property. For example, utility companies often have easements on the private property of individuals
to be able to install and maintain utility facilities.
                                                                                                             Appendix F-7

Appendix F: Glossary of Planning Terms
Easement, Conservation. A tool for acquiring open space with less than full-fee purchase, whereby a
public agency buys only certain specific rights from the land owner. These may be positive rights (providing
the public with the opportunity to hunt, fish, hike, or ride over the land), or they may be restrictive rights
(limiting the uses to which the land owner may devote the land in the future.)
Easement, Scenic. A tool that allows a public agency to use an owner’s land for scenic enhancement, such
as roadside landscaping or vista preservation.
Elderly Housing. Typically one- and two-bedroom apartments or condominiums designed to meet the

restricted to occupancy by them. (See “Congregate Care.”)
Emergency Shelter. A facility which provides immediate and short-term housing and supplemental services
for the homeless. Shelters come in many sizes, but an optimum size is considered to be 20 to 40 beds.

used by government agents and bodies to justify action taken by the entity.
Fire Hazard Zone. An area where, due to slope, fuel, weather, or other fire-related conditions, the potential
loss of life and property from a fire necessitates special fire protection measures and planning before
development occurs.

springs.
Groundwater Recharge. The natural process of infiltration and percolation of rainwater from land areas or
streams through permeable soils into water-holding rocks which provide underground storage (“aquifers”).
Growth Management. The use by a community of a wide range of techniques in combination to determine

Home Occupation. A commercial activity conducted solely by the occupants of a particular dwelling unit in
a manner incidental to residential occupancy.
Homeless. Persons and families who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. Includes those
staying in temporary or emergency shelters or who are accommodated with friends or others with the
understanding that shelter is being provided as a last resort. California Housing Element law, Section
65583(c)(1) requires all cities and counties to address the housing needs of the homeless. (See “Emergency
Shelter” and “Transitional Housing.”)
Hotel. A facility in which guest rooms or suites are offered to the general public for lodging with or without
meals and for compensation, and where no provision is made for cooking in any individual guest room or
suite.
Household. All those persons—related or unrelated—who occupy a single housing unit. (See “Family.”)
Householder. The head of a household.
Households, Number of. The count of all year-round housing units occupied by one or more persons. The
concept of household is important because the formation of new households generates the demand for
housing. Each new household formed creates the need for one additional housing unit or requires that one
existing housing unit be shared by two households. Thus, household formation can continue to take place
even without an increase in population, thereby increasing the demand for housing.
Housing and Community Development Department of the State of California (HCD). The State
agency that has principal responsibility for assessing, planning for, and assisting communities to meet the
needs of low- and moderate-income households.
Housing Element. Article 10.6 of the California Government Code requires each city and county to
prepare and maintain a current Housing Element as part of the community’s General Plan in order to attain a
statewide goal of providing “decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family.”
Under State law, Housing Elements must be updated every five years.
Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of (HUD). A cabinet-level department of the
federal government which administers housing and community development programs.
Housing Unit. The place of permanent or customary abode of a person or family. A housing unit may be a
single-family dwelling, a multi-family dwelling, a condominium, a modular home, a mobile home, a
cooperative, or any other residential unit considered real property under State law. A housing unit has, at
least, cooking facilities, a bathroom, and a place to sleep. It also is a dwelling that cannot be moved without
substantial damage or unreasonable cost. (See “Dwelling Unit,” “Family,” and “Household.”)
Impact. The effect of any direct man-made actions or indirect repercussions of man-made actions on
existing physical, social, or economic conditions.
Impact Fee. A fee, also called a development fee, levied on the developer of a project by a city, county, or
other public agency as compensation for otherwise-unmitigated impacts the project will produce. California
Government Code Section 66000 et seq. specifies that development fees shall not exceed the estimated
reasonable cost of providing the service for which the fee is charged. To lawfully impose a development fee,
the public agency must verify its method of calculation and document proper restrictions on use of the fund.
Implementation. Actions, procedures, programs, or techniques that carry out policies.
                                                                                                              Appendix F-11

exported (sold) to other regions. The money thus brought into the local economy is used to purchase locally-
provided goods and services as well as items that are not available locally and which must be imported from
other regions. Other, less traditional examples of basic industry are tourism, higher education, and retirement
activities that also bring new money into a region.
Industry, Non-basic. The segment of economic activity that is supported by the circulation of dollars
within a region. Examples are the wholesale, retail, and service functions that supply goods and services to
local sources of demand such as businesses, public agencies, and households.

in the General Plan.
Land Use Classification. A system for classifying and designating the appropriate use of properties.
Land Use Element. A required element of the General Plan which uses text and maps to designate the
future use or reuse of land within a given jurisdiction’s planning area. The land use element serves as a guide
to the structuring of zoning and subdivision controls, urban renewal and capital improvements programs, and
to official decisions regarding the distribution and intensity of development and the location of public
facilities and open space.
Land Use Regulation. A term encompassing the regulation of land in general and often used to mean those
regulations incorporated in the General Plan, as distinct from zoning regulations (which are more specific).
L dn Day-Night Average Sound Level. The A-weighted average sound level for a given area (measured in
decibels) during a 24-hour period with a 10 dB weighting applied to night-time sound levels. The Ldn is
approximately numerically equal to the CNEL for most environmental settings.
L eq The energy equivalent level, defined as the average sound level on the basis of sound energy (or sound
pressure squared). The Leq is a “dosage” type measure and is the basis for the descriptors used in current
standards, such as the 24-hour CNEL used by the State of California.
Level of Service (LOS). (1) A scale that measures the amount of traffic a roadway may be capable of
handling on a roadway or at the intersection of roadways. Levels range from A to F, with A representing the
highest level of service, as follows:
     Level of Service A - Indicates a relatively free flow of traffic, with little or no limitation on vehicle
     movement or speed.
     Level of Service B - Describes a steady flow of traffic, with only slight delays in vehicle movement and
     speed. All queues clear in a single signal cycle.
     Level of Service C - Denotes a reasonably steady, high-volume flow of traffic, with some limitations on
     movement and speed, and occasional backups on critical approaches.
     Level of Service D - Denotes the level where traffic nears an unstable flow. Intersections still function,
     but short queues develop and cars may have to wait through one cycle during short peaks.
     Level of Service E - Describes traffic characterized by slow movement and frequent (although
     momentary) stoppages. This type of congestion is considered severe, but is not uncommon at peak traffic
     hours, with frequent stopping, long-standing queues, and blocked intersections.
     Level of Service F - Describes unsatisfactory stop-and-go traffic characterized by “traffic jams” and
     stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at signalized intersections usually have to wait through one or more
     signal changes, and “upstream” intersections may be blocked by the long queues.
(2) Some communities in California are developing standards for levels of service relating to municipal
functions such as police, fire, and library service. These standards are incorporated in the General Plan or in
separate “Level of Service Plans.”

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix F: Glossary of Planning Terms
Neighborhood Unit. According to one widely-accepted concept of planning, the neighborhood unit should
be the basic building block of the city. It is based on the elementary school, with other community facilities
located at its center and arterial streets at its perimeter. The distance from the school to the perimeter should
be a comfortable walking distance for a school-age child; there would be no through traffic uses. Limited
industrial or commercial would occur on the perimeter where arterials intersect. This was the model for
American suburban development after World War II.
Noise. Any sound which is undesirable because it interferes with speech and hearing, or is intense enough to
damage hearing, or is otherwise annoying. Noise, simply, is “unwanted sound.”
Noise Attenuation. Reduction of the level of a noise source using a substance, material, or surface, such as
earth berms and/or solid concrete walls.
Noise Contour. A line connecting points of equal noise level as measured on the same scale. Noise levels
greater than the 60 Ldn contour (measured in dBA) require noise attenuation in residential development.
Non-attainment. The condition of not achieving a desired or required level of performance. Frequently
used in reference to air quality.
Non-conforming Use. A use which was valid when brought into existence, but by subsequent regulation
becomes no longer conforming. “Non-conforming use” is a generic term and includes (1) non-conforming
structures (by virtue of size, type of construction, location on land, or proximity to other structures), (2) non-
conforming use of a conforming building, (3) non-conforming use of a non-conforming building, and (4)
non-conforming use of land. Thus, any use lawfully existing on any piece of property that is inconsistent with
a new or amended General Plan, and that in turn is a violation of a zoning ordinance amendment
subsequently adopted in conformance with the General Plan, will be a non-conforming use. Typically, non-
conforming uses are permitted to continue for a designated period of time, subject to certain restrictions.
Objective. A specific statement of desired future condition toward which the City will expend effort in the
context of striving to achieve a broader goal. An objective should be achievable and, where possible, should
be measurable and time-specific. The State Government Code (Section 65302) requires that general plans
spell out the “objectives,” principles, standards, and proposals of the general plan. “The addition of 100 units
of affordable housing by 1995” is an example of an objective.

Outdoor Recreation Use. A privately or publicly owned or operated use providing facilities for outdoor
recreation activities.
Overlay. A land use designation on the Land Use Map, or a zoning designation on a zoning map, which
modifies the basic underlying designation in some specific manner.

smaller, and require less room, than a standard automobile. A standard parking space, when perpendicular to
a driveway or aisle, is usually 8.5 feet wide by 18 feet long.
Parks. Open space lands whose primary purpose is recreation. (See “Open Space Land,” “Community
Park,” and “Neighborhood Park.”)
Parkway. An expressway or freeway designed for non-commercial traffic only; usually located within a strip
of landscaped park or natural vegetation.

operation rather than on particular type of use. Performance standards provide specific criteria limiting noise,
air pollution, emissions, odors, vibration, dust, dirt, glare, heat, fire hazards, wastes, traffic impacts, and visual
impact of a use.
Planned Community. A large-scale development whose essential features are a definable boundary; a
consistent, but not necessarily uniform, character; overall control during the development process by a single
development entity; private ownership of recreation amenities; and enforcement of covenants, conditions,
and restrictions by a master community association.

enters receiving waters, such as a sewer outfall, a smokestack, or an industrial waste pipe.
Poverty Level. As used by the U.S. Census, families and unrelated individuals are classified as being above
or below the poverty level based on a poverty index which provides a range of income cutoffs or “poverty
thresholds” varying by size of family, number of children, and age of householder. The income cutoffs are
updated each year to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index.

Topography. Configuration of a surface, including its relief and the position of natural and man-made
features.
Tourism. The business of providing services for persons traveling for pleasure, tourism contributes to the
vitality of the community by providing revenue to local business. Tourism can be measured through changes
in the transient occupancy tax, or restaurant sales.
Townhouse; Townhome. A one-family dwelling in a row of at least three such units in which each unit has
its own front and rear access to the outside, no unit is located over another unit, and each unit is separated
from any other unit by one or more common and fire-resistant walls. Townhouses usually have separate
utilities; however, in some condominium situations, common areas are serviced by utilities purchased by a
homeowners association on behalf of all townhouse members of the association. (See “Condominium.”)
Traffic Model. A mathematical representation of traffic movement within an area or region based on
observed relationships between the kind and intensity of development in specific areas. Many traffic models
operate on the theory that trips are produced by persons living in residential areas and are attracted by various
non-residential land uses. (See “Trip.”)
Transit. The conveyance of persons or goods from one place to another by means of a local, public
transportation system.
Transit-dependent. Refers to persons unable to operate automobiles or other motorized vehicles, or those

elderly, the poor, and those with prior violations in motor vehicle laws.
Transit, Public. A system of regularly-scheduled buses and/or trains available to the public on a fee-per-
ride basis. Also called “Mass Transit.”
Transitional Housing. Shelter provided to the homeless for an extended period, often as long as 18
months, and generally integrated with other social services and counseling programs to assist in the transition
to self-sufficiency through the acquisition of a stable income and permanent housing. (See “Homeless” and
“Emergency Shelter.”)
Transportation Demand Management (TDM). A strategy for reducing demand on the road system by
reducing the number of vehicles using the roadways and/or increasing the number of persons per vehicle.
TDM attempts to reduce the number of persons who drive alone on the roadway during the commute period
and to increase the number in carpools, vanpools, buses and trains, walking, and biking. TDM can be an
element of TSM (see below).
Transportation Systems Management (TSM). A comprehensive strategy developed to address the
problems caused by additional development, increasing trips, and a shortfall in transportation capacity.
Transportation Systems Management focuses on more efficiently utilizing existing highway and transit
systems rather than expanding them. TSM measures are characterized by their low cost and quick
implementation time frame, such as computerized traffic signals, metered freeway ramps, and one-way
streets.
Trees, Heritage. Trees planted by a group of citizens or by the City in commemoration of an event or in
memory of a person figuring significantly in history.
Trees, Landmark. Trees whose size, visual impact, or association with a historically significant structure or
event have led the City to designate them as landmarks.
Trees, Street. Trees strategically planted—usually in parkway strips, medians, or along streets—to enhance
the visual quality of a street.
Trip. A one-way journey that proceeds from an origin to a destination via a single mode of transportation;
the smallest unit of movement considered in transportation studies. Each trip has one “production end,” (or
origin—often from home, but not always), and one “attraction end,” (destination). (See “Traffic Model.”)
                                                                                                         Appendix F-23

City of Carpinteria General Plan & Local Coastal Plan
Appendix F: Glossary of Planning Terms
Trip Generation. The dynamics that account for people making trips in automobiles or by means of public
transportation. Trip generation is the basis for estimating the level of use for a transportation system and the
impact of additional development or transportation facilities on an existing, local transportation system. Trip
generations of households are correlated with destinations that attract household members for specific
purposes.
Truck Route. A path of circulation required for all vehicles exceeding set weight or axle limits, a truck route
follows major arterials through commercial or industrial areas and avoids sensitive areas.
Undevelopable. Specific areas where topographic, geologic, and/or surficial soil conditions indicate a
significant danger to future occupants and a liability to the city are designated as “undevelopable” by the City.

to whole cities. Urban design is concerned with the location, mass, and design of various urban components
and combines elements of urban planning, architecture, and landscape architecture.
Urban/Rural Boundary. A boundary line shown on the land use plan map which delineates areas intended
for urban land uses; i.e. residential, commercial, industrial, etc., and areas designated for rural land uses,
principally agricultural and low -density residential. Areas contiguous to the boundary provide a
transition/buffer between urban and rural and the potentially incompatible characteristics of each.
Urban Open Space. The absence of buildings or development, usually in well-defined volumes, within an
urban environment.
Urban Sprawl. Haphazard growth or outward extension of a city resulting from uncontrolled or poorly
managed development.
Use. The purpose for which a lot or structure is or may be leased, occupied, maintained, arranged, designed,
intended, constructed, erected, moved, altered, and/or enlarged in accordance with the City’s zoning
ordinance and General Plan land use designations.
Use, Non-conforming. (See “Non-conforming Use.”)
Use Permit. The discretionary and conditional review of an activity or function or operation on a site or in a
building or facility.
Utility Corridors. Rights-of-way or easements for utility lines on either publicly or privately owned property.
(See “Right-of-way” or “Easement.”)
Vacant. Lands or buildings which are not actively used for any purpose.
Variance. A departure from any provision of the zoning requirements for a specific parcel, except use,
without changing the zoning ordinance or the underlying zoning of the parcel. A variance usually is granted
only upon demonstration of hardship based on the peculiarity of the property in relation to other properties
in the same zone district.
Vehicle-Miles Travelled (VMT). A key measure of overall street and highway use. Reducing VMT is often
a major objective in efforts to reduce vehicular congestion and achieve regional air quality goals.
Very Low-income Household. A household with an annual income usually no greater than 50 percent of
the area median family income adjusted by household size, as determined by a survey of incomes conducted
by a city or a county, or in the absence of such a survey, based on the latest available eligibility limits

Volume-to-Capacity Ratio. A measure of the operating capacity of a roadway or intersection, in terms of
the number of vehicles passing through, divided by the number of vehicles that theoretically could pass
through when the roadway or intersection is operating at its designed capacity. Abbreviated as “v/c.” At a
v/c ratio of 1.0, the roadway or intersection is operating at capacity. If the ratio is less than 1.0, the traffic
facility has additional capacity. Although ratios slightly greater than 1.0 are possible, it is more likely that the
peak hour will elongate into a “peak period.” (See “Peak Hour” and “Level of Service.”)
Warehousing Use. A use engaged in storage, wholesale, and distribution of manufactured products,
supplies, and equipment, excluding bulk storage of materials which are inflammable or explosive or which
present hazards or conditions commonly recognized as offensive.
Wastewater Irrigation. The process by which wastewater that has undergone primary treatment is used to
irrigate land.

Wildlife Refuge. An area maintained in a natural state for the preservation of both animal and plant life.
Workplace Use. The combination of a variety of businesses, from office to research and development to
light industry to warehousing, located in structures built with open floor plans, so as to leave most interior
improvements to the tenants to design to their needs. (See also “Industrial Park.”)
Zero Lot Line. A detached single family unit distinguished by the location of one exterior wall on a side
property line.
Zone, Combining. A special purpose zone which is superimposed over the regular zoning map. Combining
zones are used for a variety of purposes, such as airport compatibility, floodplain or wetlands protection,
historic designation, or special parking regulations. Also called “overlay zone.”
Zone, Interim. A zoning designation that temporarily reduces or freezes allowable development in an area
until a permanent classification can be fixed; generally assigned during General Plan preparation to provide a
basis for permanent zoning.
Zone, Study. (See “ Zone, Interim.”)
Zone, Traffic. In a mathematical traffic model the area to be studied is divided into zones, with each zone
treated as producing and attracting trips. The production of trips by a zone is based on the number of trips
to or from work or shopping, or other trips produced per dwelling unit.
                                                                                                           Appendix F-25

and development standards are uniform.
Zoning, Exclusionary. Development regulations which result in the exclusion of low- and moderate-
income and/or minority families from a community.
Zoning, Incentive. The awarding of bonus credits to a development in the form of allowing more intensive
use of land if public benefits-such as preservation of greater than the minimum required open space,
provision for low- and moderate-income housing, or plans for public plazas and courts at ground level-are
included in a project.
Zoning, Inclusionary. Regulations which increase housing choice by providing the opportunity to
construct more diverse and economical housing to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income families.
Often such regulations require a minimum percentage of housing for low- and moderate-income households
in new housing developments and in conversions of apartments to condominiums.
Zoning Map. Government Code Section 65851 permits a legislative body to divide a county, a city, or
portions thereof, into zones of the number, shape, and area it deems best suited to carry out the purposes of
the zoning ordinance. These zones are delineated on a map or maps, called the Zoning Map.

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element                                                      I Introduction
I.       INTRODUCTION
A.       Purpose of the Housing Element
Housing Elements were first mandated as part of local general plans in 1967. The Housing
Element describes the City’s needs, goals, policies, objectives and programs regarding the
preservation, improvement and development of housing. It provides an indication of community
housing needs in terms of affordability, availability, adequacy, and accessibility. The Element sets
forth a strategy to address housing needs and identifies a range of specific housing programs to
meet identified needs.
The Housing Element is an official municipal response to a growing awareness of the need to
provide housing for all economic segments of the community, as well as a legal requirement for
all California jurisdictions. It provides Carpinteria with the opportunity to plan for the existing and
future housing needs in the community. This Element has been prepared in compliance with the
2015-2023 planning cycle for cities within the Santa Barbara County Association of Governments
(SBCAG) region. It identifies strategies and programs that focus on: 1) providing diverse housing
sites and opportunities; 2) conserving and improving the existing affordable housing stock;
3) removing governmental and other constraints to housing development; and 4) promoting equal
housing opportunities.
While jurisdictions must review and revise all elements of their general plans on a regular basis to
ensure that they remain up to date, state law was amended in 2008 (Senate Bill 375) to require
housing elements be reviewed and updated on an eight-year cycle in coordination with every
other update to the Regional Transportation Plan. The process of updating housing elements is
initiated by the state through the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) process. The
planning period for this Housing Element runs from February 15, 2015 to February 15, 2023.
B.       Scope and Content of the Housing Element
The California Legislature recognizes the role of local general plans and particularly Housing
Elements in implementing statewide housing goals to provide decent and adequate housing for
all economic segments of the community. The specific requirements regarding the scope and
content of housing elements, along with where they are addressed in this document, are as
follows:
       •     An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends
             (Technical Report, Chapter I)
       •     An evaluation of land, financial and administrative resources available to address the
             City’s housing goals (Technical Report, Chapter II)
       •     A review of potential constraints, both governmental and non-governmental, to
             meeting Carpinteria’s housing needs (Technical Report, Chapter III)
       •     The Housing Policy Plan for addressing the City’s identified housing needs, including
             housing goals, policies and programs (Chapter II of this document)
       •     An evaluation of the appropriateness and effectiveness of previous policies and
             programs in achieving the City’s objectives, and the progress in implementing
             Housing Element programs (Technical Report, Appendix A)
                                                    1                                 November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element                                                   I Introduction
      •      A parcel-specific inventory of vacant and underutilized land (Technical Report,
             Appendix B)
      •      A description of the public participation process during the preparation and adoption
             of the Housing Element (Technical Report, Appendix C)
C.      Public Participation
Public participation is an important component of the planning process, and this update to the
Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties numerous opportunities to
be involved in the preparation of the element. Public notices of all meetings and hearings were
published in the local newspaper in advance of each meeting, as well as posted on the City’s
website. The draft Housing Element was made available for review at City Hall and posted on the
City’s website prior to public meetings. Notice of the document’s availability was also circulated to
housing advocates and organizations representing the interests of lower-income persons and
special needs groups, including People’s Self-Help Housing, Habitat for Humanity, the Housing
Trust Fund of Santa Barbara County and the Housing Authorities of both the City and county of
Santa Barbara. After receiving comments on the draft Housing Element from the State Housing
and Community Development Department (HCD), a proposed final Housing Element will be
prepared and made available for public review prior to adoption by the City Council.
Appendix C provides a listing of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this
Housing Element update, identification of persons and organizations that were invited to
participate, and a summary of issues raised during the process.
D.      Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
The Housing Element must be consistent with other elements of the General Plan. The Housing
Element has been prepared within the context of the other General Plan elements and is
consistent with the policies and proposals set forth therein. The Housing Element is closely
related to development policies contained in the Land Use Element, which establishes the
location, type and intensity of land uses throughout the city. The Land Use Element determines
the number and type of housing units that can be constructed in the various land use districts.
Areas designated for commercial and industrial uses create employment opportunities, which in
turn, create demand for housing. The Circulation Element establishes the location and scale of
streets, highways and other transportation routes that provide access to residential
neighborhoods. Because of the requirement for consistency among the various General Plan
elements, any proposed amendment to one element will be evaluated against the other elements
to ensure that no conflicts occur. If necessary to maintain internal consistency, amendments to
other elements of the General Plan will be processed concurrently with future Housing Element
amendments.
SB 1087 of 2005 requires cities to provide their Housing Elements to local water and sewer
providers, and also requires that these agencies provide priority hookups for developments with
lower-income housing.

Programs
1.    Second Units
Second units represent an important source of affordable housing in cities with high housing
costs. Since second units can be accommodated on developed sites at no additional land cost,
they represent an excellent option for addressing the needs of seniors, university students,
household employees, local service workers and extended family members. In order to facilitate
development of additional second units, the City will implement the following actions:
      a.    Post information regarding second unit opportunities at City Hall and on the website.
      b.    Review second unit regulations to determine whether standards could be modified to
            increase the potential for additional second units without causing adverse impacts on
            surrounding properties.
      c.    Offer incentives such as fast-track processing and reduced processing fees when
            second units are deed-restricted for low- or moderate-income persons.
      Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
      Funding Sources: General Fund; Housing Trust Fund; other governmental agencies; grant
      funds
      Objective & Timeframe: Zoning Code update in 2015; 12 additional second units during the
      planning period
2.    Energy Conservation
The City adopted a Sustainability Policy in 2014 to address energy conservation goals and
implementing measures that increase energy conservation and efficiency.
The City uses its website to provide information to educate residents, businesses and visitors on
actions they can take to conserve energy.
The City will implement the following General Plan energy utilization and conservation policies:
      To ensure the efficient utilization of energy resources, design measures shall be
      incorporated into project design that allow for development projects to exceed the minimum
      energy requirements of the City’s Uniform Codes, as follows:
      a.    Building orientation shall be designed to maximize natural lighting, passive solar
            heating, and cooling;
      b.    Landscaping shall be designed to maximize the use of native drought tolerant species
            and deciduous trees to shade buildings in summer and allow for passive solar heating
            in winter;
      c.    Energy efficient street lighting shall be used, with consideration of safety, visual
            impacts, and impacts to wildlife and sensitive habitat;
      d.    Design of parking facilities shall take into consideration the layout of entrances and
            exits so as to avoid concentrations of cars or excessive idling.
      e.    Alternatively fueled vehicles are to be used in construction and as fleet vehicles, if
            feasible and available.
                                                   4                                November 10, 2014

      Objective & Timeframe: Reduce residential energy use throughout the planning period
3.    No Net Loss
The City will monitor project approvals and comply with the no net loss requirements of
Government Code §65863. No zoning amendment or project approval shall reduce the residential
density or allow development of any parcel at a lower residential density than assumed in the
Housing Element land inventory unless the City makes written findings in accordance with
§65863(b).

PROGRAM CATEGORY #2
ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADEQUATE HOUSING TO MEET THE NEEDS
OF EXTREMELY-LOW-, VERY-LOW-, LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME
HOUSEHOLDS
Goals
      •      Attain a housing supply that meets a variety of housing needs.
      •      Attain a housing supply that meets the needs of extremely-low-, very-low-, low- and
             moderate-income households.
      •      Attain a housing supply that meets the needs of special population groups.
Policies
      •      Infill Development: Promote infill housing development through land use policies and
             by deferring or reducing development impact fees where the City wants to encourage
             infill development.
      •      Second Units: Promote the development of second units consistent with the State
             law and the City’s second unit ordinance.
      •      Suitable Housing Unit Sizes: Provide for a range in the number of bedrooms in
             assisted housing developments so as to help meet the needs of various household
             types and special needs populations.
                                                  5                                November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element                                             II Housing Policy Plan
       •     Downtown Mixed Use: Encourage studio and one bedroom units above commercial
             uses in the downtown district to reduce parking needs and facilitate affordability.
       •     Rental Assistance: Continue participation in the County of Santa Barbara Housing
             Authority’s Section 8 program as the primary means to address the City’s rental
             assistance needs. Allocate HOME funds and In lieu Fees to state and federally
             assisted housing that provides rent restricted units in existing and/or new residential
             developments.
       •     Acquisition and Rehabilitation of Rental Housing: Work with non-profit sponsors to
             acquire and rehabilitate rental housing units in order to maintain long-term affordability
             of the units. This will include, but not be limited, to: (a) technical support needed to
             obtain funding commitments from county, state and/or federal programs; (b)
             assistance in permit processing; (c) possible deferral, reduction or waiver of City fees;
             and (d) contribution of City housing funds, if available.
       •     Critical Workforce Housing: Implement “set-aside” policies for critical workforce
             occupations. New housing developed through the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance,
             current and future Development Agreements and other appropriate Housing Element
             programs should set aside a percentage of the units for households employed in
             critical workforce occupations. Examples of critical workforce occupations are law
             enforcement, firefighters, nurses, teachers and local government.
       •     Farm Employee and Supportive Housing: Allocate in lieu fees for predevelopment
             activities, including state and/or federal funding applications, to support the sponsors
             of farm employee housing and supportive housing for special needs populations.
       •     Shelter for the Homeless: Support countywide programs to provide for a continuum of
             care for the homeless including emergency shelter, transitional housing, supportive
             housing and permanent housing. Allocate CDBG funds to agencies assisting
             homeless persons and families to meet shelter and non-shelter needs.
Programs
4.    Section 8 Rental Assistance
The Section 8 Rental Assistance Program meets multiple housing needs. It helps to reduce the
number of households that are cost burdened, that is households spending more than they can
afford on housing costs. The program also helps to reduce overcrowding as some of the assisted
families shared housing with two or three households prior to receiving rental assistance.
Additionally, this program helps to meet special housing needs such as the needs of elderly and
disabled persons.
The Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara administers the Section 8 Housing Choice
Voucher Program within the City of Carpinteria. The City of Santa Barbara Housing Authority also
provides Section 8 vouchers in Carpinteria. This program assists very-low-income families, the
elderly and the disabled to afford decent, safe and sanitary housing in the private market. Since
housing assistance is provided on behalf of the family or individual, participants are able to find
their own housing, including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments.
In general, a family's income may not exceed the very-low-income limit (50% of the median
income) for Santa Barbara County. By law, the Housing Authority must provide 75% of its
vouchers to extremely-low-income households whose incomes do not exceed 30% of the County
median income.
                                                    6                                  November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element                                          II Housing Policy Plan
Under the provisions of the Voucher Program, the tenant pays approximately 30% of his/her
income towards rent and the Housing Authority pays the balance of the rent to the property owner
who participates in the program on a voluntary basis.
As of 2014, 74 Carpinteria households were being assisted by the Section 8 rental assistance
program through the County Housing Authority. In addition, 95 households received Section 8
vouchers through the City of Santa Barbara Housing Authority.
      Responsible Agency: Community Development Department; Housing Authority of the
      County of Santa Barbara; City of Santa Barbara Housing Authority
      Funding Sources: HUD; Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara; City of Santa
      Barbara Housing Authority
      Objective & Timeframe: 169 Section 8 certificates during the planning period
5.    Affordable Rental Housing
There are a variety of federal and state housing programs; however, most of these programs
award funds on a competitive basis. The City’s housing funds alone are not enough to complete
projects of the size that would meet the community’s housing needs. Consequently, the City
partners with nonprofit organizations in order to leverage its housing funds and obtain enough
financing to rehabilitate existing housing and produce new affordable housing units.
This program also follows past practices of the City in helping nonprofit organizations to complete
new construction and rehabilitation projects. Through the Affordable Rental Housing Program, the
City will continue to work with nonprofit housing groups that are interested in the development
and/or rehabilitation of housing under the provisions of federal and state housing programs. The
following projects are expected to be assisted during the 2015-2023 planning period; other
projects will be assisted as opportunities arise:
      Chapel Court Apartments Expansion                32 housing units
      Casas de las Flores Apartments                   43 housing units
The City’s involvement and assistance to nonprofit housing developers will include, but not be
limited to: provision of demographic and background data; assistance in the preparation of
funding applications; letters of support to lenders; assistance at neighborhood and community
meetings; provision of regulatory concessions and incentives; fast-track permit processing; and
fee deferrals and/or waivers.
More specifically, the City will commit to the following actions:
      •      Fifty percent reduction of Development Impact Fees
      •      Deferral and/or waiver of City planning fees
      •      Reduction in the number of parking spaces required
      •      Modifications to development standards
      •      Provision of surplus property at no cost
      •      Provide funding support through the City’s Housing Trust Fund for soft costs
      •      Support in the funding application process for low-income housing tax credits and
             other housing grant programs.

       Objective & Timeframe: 43 lower-income rental units during the planning period
6.     Inclusionary Housing
The City of Carpinteria has adopted an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance to encourage the
development and availability of affordable housing in the above-moderate-income category in an
effort to provide housing for middle income and critical workforce households that cannot afford
the cost of housing in Carpinteria, and to ensure that the private sector, as well as the public
sector, contributes to and participates in providing adequate housing for all economic segments
of Carpinteria.
Residential developments of five or more units involving a subdivision map for the purpose of
creating individual ownership units or parcels must construct 12% of the units at a price
affordable to households earning 121% of the area median income (AMI).
The City will continue to provide incentives for developers to facilitate inclusionary requirements.
A developer may request and the City may approve one incentive to facilitate the construction of
inclusionary units if the developer can demonstrate that the modification is necessary to provide
for affordable housing cost.
Incentives for condominium multi-family development may include one or more of the following:
       •     Allow an encroachment into the required side yard setback up to three feet from the
             property line, provided any structure on the adjacent parcel is set back a minimum of
             five feet from the side property line;
       •     Allow a modification to the requirement for covered parking spaces;
       •     Allow building coverage to exceed Zoning Code standards;
       •     Allow a modification to requirements for separation between structures on the same
             site or parcel;
       •     Allow a modification of private or common open space requirements, not to exceed 25
             percent less than the required amount; or
       •     Allow a modification to any other development standard that is mutually agreed to by
             the City and the developer that can be demonstrated as necessary to provide for
             affordable housing.
Incentives for single-family development may include one or more of the following:
       •     Allow an encroachment into the required side yard setback up to three feet from the
             property line, provided any structure on the adjacent parcel is set back a minimum of
             five feet from the side property line;
       •     Allow building coverage to exceed Zoning Code standards;
       •     Allow tandem parking in garages;
       •     Allow a modification to the minimum lot size requirement; or
       •     Allow a modification to any other development standard that is mutually agreed to by
             the City and the applicant that can be demonstrated as necessary to provide for
             affordable housing cost.
If it is determined that the construction of the affordable units is infeasible, the inclusionary
ordinance provides for an in lieu fee option. However, no one has requested to pay an in lieu fee
                                                    8                                November 10, 2014

since adoption of the program in 2004. The ordinance does not allow the affordable housing to be
provided off-site.
Any in lieu fees collected are deposited into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. The fund is used
exclusively for the provision of affordable housing and for reasonable costs associated with the
development, maintenance and oversight of affordable housing in the City. The fund includes in
lieu fees as well as other funds available to the City for exclusive use for the provision of
affordable housing. Currently, the trust fund has approximately $465,000 available.
      Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
      Funding Sources: General Fund; Affordable Housing Trust Fund
      Objective & Timeframe: Ten inclusionary affordable units during the planning period
7.    Density Bonus
Under state law, developments that provide affordable housing may be entitled to a density bonus
of up to 35 percent. A density bonus is also allowed in exchange for land donation or provision of
a child care facility. The City will continue to implement the density bonus ordinance consistent
with State law.
      Responsible agency: Community Development Department
      Funding sources: General Fund; Affordable Housing Trust Fund
      Objective & Timeframe: Continue to provide density bonus and other incentives to
      qualifying developments throughout the planning period
8.    Facilitate Lot Consolidation
The City will continue to play an active role in facilitating lot consolidation, particularly as it relates
to parcels listed in the sites inventory. For example, the City will work with nonprofit developers
and/or private landowners of small sites to identify and consolidate parcels to facilitate the
development of housing affordable to lower-income households. The lot consolidation program
will be discussed with developers during the preliminary or conceptual review process. Lot
consolidation requests will be processed ministerially. lncentives offered for lot consolidation
include allowing for higher densities when small parcels are consolidated, flexibility in
development standards and expedited processing.
      Responsible agency: Community Development Department
      Funding sources: General Fund
      Objective & Timeframe: Encourage consolidation of small lots throughout the planning
      period

Programs
9.    Regulatory Concessions and Incentives
Concessions and incentives are granted on a “targeted” income basis to facilitate the
preservation or development of housing affordable to very-low- and low-income households. This
program will continue the City’s practice of providing regulatory concessions and incentives as a
means of facilitating and encouraging affordable housing. These practices include:
      •      Providing relief from the covered parking and parking space requirements in order to
             facilitate the development and rehabilitation of affordable housing.
      •      Encouraging studio and one bedroom units above commercial uses in the downtown
             district to reduce parking needs and facilitate affordability.
      •      Reducing Development Impact Fees for projects that provide 100% affordable units.
      •      Other incentives that may be requested pursuant to state density bonus law.

Programs
12.   Conservation of Mobile Home Parks
Two actions will be implemented during the planning period to conserve the City’s mobile home
parks. These actions will contribute to conserving affordable housing for lower-income
households.
      a)    Mobile Home Park Zoning: The City will retain the mobile home park zoning on the
            seven existing parks. According to the Zoning Code:
            The purpose of the MHP district is to provide areas for mobile homes on
            nonpermanent foundations (i.e., mobile home parks) in recognition of the fact that
            such development offers opportunities for affordable rental housing. The intent is to
            ensure a safe and attractive residential environment by promoting high standards of
            site planning, architecture, and landscape design for mobile home parks.
                                                   12                                  November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element                                             II Housing Policy Plan
            The uses permitted subject to development plan approval in the MHP district are:
                      •  Mobile home park;
                      •  Recreational facilities for the use of the residents of the park;
                      •  Uses, structures and buildings customarily incidental and subordinate to
                         the uses permitted in this district.
            The MHP designations will be maintained throughout the planning period.
      b)    Mobile Home Rent Stabilization Program. The City will continue implementation of the
            Mobile Home Park Rental Stabilization ordinance. In accordance with Section
            5.69.040 of the Zoning Code, the maximum rent to be charged is set at 75% of the
            ratio of change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI.). Each year, the City calculates the
            rent schedules for each mobile home park using this formula. The rent schedule then
            becomes the maximum rent for each mobile home space. The rent stabilization
            program will be implemented throughout the planning period.
      Mobile home park preservation is also facilitated through the Condominium Conversion
      Ordinance (see Program 13).
      Responsible Agency: Community Development Department and City Manager’s Office
      Funding Sources: General Fund
      Objective & Timeframe: Facilitate preservation of mobile home parks and moderate rental
      rates throughout the planning period
13.   Condominium Conversion Ordinance
The purpose of the Condominium Conversion Ordinance “…is to establish criteria for the
conversion of existing multiple unit rental housing to condominiums, community apartments and
stock cooperatives.” A reason cited for the ordinance is that “…the existing rental housing stock
needs to be preserved.” However, the ordinance does point out that the conversion of rental units
“…is a potential means of providing homeownership opportunities for households who cannot
afford a detached single-family home.”
Applications for conversion are not accepted unless the rental vacancy rate exceeds 5%.
Applications also are not accepted when the converted units represent 15% or more of the
apartment rental housing supply.
      Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
      Funding Sources: General Fund
      Objective & Timeframe: Facilitate preservation of existing apartment units throughout the
      planning period
14.   Inspection on Sale
The City will continue to implement Ordinance No. 476, which requires an Inspection on Sale
Report of residential property, meaning single-family and multi-family residences, including
apartment houses. Residential property does not include condominiums in complexes of four or
more units and mobile homes. The Report includes information on:
                                                   13                                  November 10, 2014

      Funding Sources: General Fund; fees
      Objective & Timeframe: Facilitate preservation of existing housing units throughout the
      planning period
15.   Rental Housing Inspection
To ensure maintenance of rental properties in R-1 zones, the City conducts inspections of rented
single-family homes; each rental dwelling is inspected every three years. The scope of the
program includes single-family homes that are rented and where the landowner does not live at
the property. The Code Compliance Division implements this program to preserve neighborhoods
and avoid the potential for decline that can occur when absentee landlords neglect general
maintenance or defer necessary repairs or improvements to single-family homes. Under this
program, rented single-family homes are inspected for code violations and general maintenance
and upkeep.
      Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
      Funding Sources: General Fund; fees
      Objective & Timeframe: Facilitate preservation of existing single-family rental housing units
      throughout the planning period
16.   Housing Code Compliance
The City has adopted ordinances to create and maintain a healthy, safe and beautiful
environment in which to live, work and play. Code Compliance Officers and the Building Inspector
investigate, document and enforce the Carpinteria Municipal Code, the California Building Codes,
Health and Safety Codes and various state laws on public and private property regarding but not
limited to:
      •      Building without permits
      •      Substandard housing
      •      Public nuisance and blighted property
      •      Zoning violations such as garage conversions
For homeowners who need financial assistance to correct violations, Code Compliance Officers
refer them to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or other sources of funding
assistance (see Programs 19 and 20).

      Objective & Timeframe: Facilitate preservation of the existing housing stock throughout the
      planning period
17.   Single-Family Housing Rehabilitation
The USDA is an important funding resource for housing preservation. Carpinteria’s very-low-
income homeowners are eligible to apply for USDA Rural Housing Repair and Rehabilitation
Program loans of up to $20,000 to repair, improve or modernize their dwellings to remove health
and safety hazards. The loan term is 20 years and the interest rate is 1%. Grants of up to $7,500
are available to homeowners who are 62 years of age or older and who cannot repay a loan. A
loan/grant combination for up to $27,500 can be made if the applicant can repay a part of the
loan. The City will implement the following measures in support of this program:
      •      Coordinate with the USDA.
      •      Inform the public of the program through the City Newsletter, website and brochures
             available at the public counters.
      •      Assist homeowners in completing the application for grant or loan assistance.
      Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
      Funding Sources: General Fund; USDA and other funding sources as available
      Objective & Timeframe: Rehabilitation of two units occupied by extremely-low-income
      owner households and three units occupied by very-low-income owner households during
      the planning period
18.   Multi-Family Housing Rehabilitation
The City will continue to seek grant funds such as CDBG to facilitate the rehabilitation of multi-
family housing in need of repair. Funding is allocated on an annual basis.
      Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
      Funding Sources: General Fund; CDBG and other funding sources as available
      Objective & Timeframe: Rehabilitation of two extremely-low-income units, one very-low-
      income unit, and six low-income units during the planning period
PROGRAM CATEGORY #5
PROMOTE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL PERSONS
Goals
      •      Attain a housing market with “fair housing choice,” meaning the ability of persons of
             similar income levels regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability
             and familial status to have available to them the same housing choices.

Policies
      •      Promote Fair Housing: Promote fair housing opportunities through the City’s
             participation in the County’s Community Development Block Grant Program.
      •      Information and Referral: Promote fair housing through the provision of information
             and referral services to residents who need help on fair housing issues. This includes
             referring local residents who want to file a housing discrimination complaint to the
             appropriate local, county, state or federal agency, depending on the nature of the
             complaint.
      •      Fair Housing Information: Implement activities to broaden resident knowledge of fair
             housing law.
Programs
19.   Fair Housing Information and Referral
The City will continue to provide fair housing information to residents and implement a referral
program for discrimination complaints as a means of promoting equal housing opportunities.
When the City receives a discrimination complaint, the City will refer the complainant to the
appropriate agency, depending on the particular problem. If the complaint involves housing that
has been assisted by the County Housing Authority, then the complaint will be referred to the
Director of Housing Management at the County Housing Authority. If the complaint involves
general housing in the City, then it will be referred to the State Fair Employment and Housing
Department. If the complaint involves FHA federally assisted farm employee housing, it will be
referred to the Farmers Home Administration. If the complaint involves other federally assisted
housing, then it will be referred to the Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Department.
By assisting in referrals for complaints to the appropriate agencies, Carpinteria can facilitate fair
disposition of discrimination complaints in the City. When fair housing related needs are
expressed by City residents, the City staff also can refer them to the following local agencies:
      Rental Housing Mediation Task Force
      630 Garden Street, Second Floor
      Santa Barbara, CA 93101
      805.564.5420
      This Task Force resolves disputes offering mediation as an alternative to the formal judicial
      system between landlords, tenants, roommates and neighbors. The primary purpose of the
      program is to provide these services for the resolution of rental housing disputes.
      Mediations are conducted in English and Spanish by staff and two mediators. Currently,
      there are 15 volunteer mediators to facilitate these disputes. The City of Carpinteria has
      supported this group by contributing funds from the Socio-Economic Monitoring Program
      (SEMP) over the past three years. Prior to that, the program had received support from the
      CDBG funds through the Human Services Grant Program. City funding was increased from
      $8,000 to $8,720 for the current fiscal year (2014/15). This program is well used based on
      statistics provided by the City of Santa Barbara.

      benefits, civil rights and legal employment issues.
Bilingual flyers regarding fair housing laws and the agencies/organizations that are available to
handle discrimination complaints will be published and distributed. Through this program, both
Spanish- and English-speaking residents will be made aware of important fair housing issues, as
well as their options if they feel they are victims of housing discrimination.
Fair housing information will be disseminated at the following locations: City Hall lobby,
Carpinteria Valley Chamber of Commerce, Carpinteria Public Library and Carpinteria Senior
Center. In addition, the City’s Newsletter will periodically publish announcements on the
availability of fair housing information. The City will make information available on its website and
provide links to additional resources such as the following:

20.   Workforce Homebuyer Down Payment Loans
The Workforce Homebuyer Down Payment Loan Program is sponsored by the City of Carpinteria,
in collaboration with the Housing Trust Fund of Santa Barbara County (HTF), to expand
homeownership opportunities in Carpinteria. The program helps to bridge the homeownership
affordability gap for workforce homebuyers by providing 30-year deferred payment loans up to
$75,000 per household to assist low- to upper-moderate-income households in purchasing a
home in the City. Funds can be used for down payment and closing costs for households earning
up to 200% of the Area Median Income (AMI), adjusted for household size. The down payment
loans have no current interest or principal payments, are structured with shared appreciation and
are repaid upon sale or refinancing of the home or at the end of the 30-year loan term. Funding
for the program has been provided through the City of Carpinteria. The program removes
financial barriers to the dream of homeownership by lowering home acquisition and carrying
costs. The program enables qualified families to purchase a home that provides a stable
residence that strengthens the family, the neighborhood and community.

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                               I Housing Needs Assessment
I.    HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This chapter examines general population and household characteristics and trends, such as
age, race and ethnicity, employment, household composition and size, household income, and
special needs. Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g., number of units and type,
tenure, age and condition, costs) are also addressed. Finally, the City’s projected housing growth
needs based on the 2014-2022 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) are examined.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent available data from the U.S. Census,
the California Department of Finance (DOF), the California Employment Development
Department (EDD), the Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG) and other
relevant sources. Supplemental data were obtained through field surveys and from the California
Department of Finance.
A. Population Characteristics
      1.    Population Growth Trends
Between 2000 and 2014 Carpinteria’s population declined by 752 persons, which is attributable to
a small decrease in average household size from 2.82 to 2.74 persons per household. This is in
contrast with Santa Barbara County, which grew by more than 8% between 2000 and 2014 (see
Table I-1).

      2.    Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age groups
have different housing needs based on lifestyles, family types, income levels, and housing
preference. Table I-2 and Figure I-1 provide a comparison of the city and county population by
age group as reported in the 2010 Census. This table shows that the age distribution of the city’s
population is older than Santa Barbara County as a whole, with Carpinteria’s population having a
median age of 39.5 years compared to 33.6 years for the county as a whole. An aging population
has implications regarding the type and size of future housing needs, as well as accessibility (see
also the discussion of the elderly on page I-16).

California Department of Finance population projections by age group for the 2010-2060 period
are illustrated in Figure I-2. Senior citizens are expected to be the fastest-growing age group over
the next 50 years, with the 65+ group representing almost two-thirds of the total population
increase. By contrast, the working-age adult population (25-64) is expected to comprise less than
one-third of population growth.
The Constraints section of this report describes how the City’s land use plans and zoning
regulations accommodate the housing needs of senior citizens.

       3.   Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of the city differs from the county in that a higher proportion of
city residents are Hispanic/Latino. Approximately 51% of city residents are non-Hispanic white,
contrasted with 57% for the county as a whole. Asians, with 2% of the population, represent the
city’s largest non-Hispanic minority group (Table I-3).

B. Household Characteristics
       1.   Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing needed in a
city. The Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing unit, which may
include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated
persons sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as dormitories, retirement or
convalescent homes, or other group living situations are included in population totals, but are not
considered households.
                                                                      I-7                                   November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                             I Housing Needs Assessment
Carpinteria had 4,759 households as reported in the 2010 Census. Table I-4 provides a
comparison of households by type for the city and Santa Barbara County as a whole. Family
households in 2010 comprised approximately 66% of all households in the city, slightly more than
the 65% for the county as a whole. Single persons represented about one-quarter of all
households in both the city and the county. The city’s average household size is slightly lower
than the county as a whole (2.74 persons per household city vs. 2.86 persons per household
county). Nearly one-third of all households reported children under 18 living at home and 29% of
households included a senior.

       2.     Housing Tenure and Vacancy
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market. Communities
strive to have an adequate supply of units available both for rent and for sale in order to
accommodate a range of households with varying incomes, family sizes and composition, and
lifestyles. Table I-5 provides a comparison of the number of owner-occupied and renter-occupied
units in the city in 2010 as compared to the county as a whole. This table reveals that about 43%
of all housing units were owner-occupied in the city compared to 49% in the county. About 44% of
units in both the city and the county were renter-occupied. The vacancy rate in Carpinteria was
about 12% with 7% of units held for seasonal or occasional use, significantly higher than for the
county as a whole. This is not unusual for some coastal and mountain communities in California.
It should be noted that these vacancy statistics were collected in 2010 during the recession. More
recent data1 indicate that vacancy rates have dropped since then, and rental vacancy rates in
large apartment projects in the South Coast area were reported to be less than 1% in October
2013.

      3.    Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The U.S.
Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than one person
per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding when there are more
than 1.5 residents per room. Overcrowded households are usually a reflection of the lack of
affordable housing (see Section D.3 starting on page I-13 below for a detailed definition of
“affordable” housing). Table I-6 summarizes recent overcrowding data for the city and county as
reported by the Census Bureau.

Recent Census estimates show that about 2% of owner-occupied units and 16% of renter-
occupied units were overcrowded in Carpinteria compared to about 4% of owner-occupied units
and about 14% of renter-occupied units in the county as a whole.
                                                                   I-9                                        November 10, 2014

         4.     Household Income
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community – the ability of
residents to afford housing is directly related to household income. According to recent Census
estimates, the median household income in Carpinteria was about $70,000 compared to about
$63,000 countywide.
                                                             Table I-7

         5.     Overpayment
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of gross
household income. Table I-8 displays recent Census estimates for overpayment by tenure.
According to recent Census data, approximately 40% of all renter households and 36% of all
owner households in Carpinteria were overpaying for housing. Overpayment is most common
among moderate-income and extremely-low-income (ELI) households, with over 70% of owners
and over 90% of renters overpaying.
Although homeowners enjoy interest and property tax deductions and other benefits that help to
compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to defer maintenance
or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For lower-income renters, severe
cost burden can require families to double up, resulting in overcrowding and related problems.

C. Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs
available in each employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and size of
housing residents can afford.

D. Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the community’s housing stock and
helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the number and type of
housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure, vacancy, housing costs,
affordability, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to conversion to market-rate. A
housing unit is defined by the Census Bureau as a house, apartment, mobile home, or group of
rooms, occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate
living quarters.
       1.       Housing Type and Growth Trends
As of 2014, about 40% of the city’s housing stock was comprised of single-family detached units,
while multi-family units comprised 37% of the total. By comparison, the countywide housing stock
had a higher percentage of single-family detached homes. Table I-10 provides a breakdown of
the housing stock by type for the city compared to the county as a whole. This table shows that
the city’s housing stock contains a significantly higher proportion of higher-density attached
housing as compared to the county.

       2.    Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior to 1978
before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed may have interior or exterior
building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built before 1970 are the most
likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in deteriorated condition. Lead-based
paint becomes hazardous to children under age six and to pregnant women when it peels off
walls or is pulverized by windows and doors opening and closing.
Table I-11 shows the age distribution of the housing stock in Carpinteria compared to the county
as a whole as reported in recent Census data. More than 70% of the city’s housing stock was
built prior to 1980 and therefore may be in need of some repair.

Due to the city’s relatively high housing values, market forces would be expected to encourage
more private maintenance, rehabilitation and lead paint remediation, as compared to lower-
income communities. The 2011 Housing Element estimated that approximately 800 housing units
were in need of some type of rehabilitation and approximately 60 units were so deteriorated as to
require replacement. Based on the observations of City Building and Code Compliance staff,
there has not been a substantial change to housing conditions, although as the economy
continues to recover there appears to be an increasing amount of private housing renovation
occurring.

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                                        I Housing Needs Assessment
As described in the Housing Action Plan, the City is continuing its efforts to identify, preserve,
maintain and rehabilitate existing housing.
       3.       Housing Cost
a.      Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on the area
(i.e., county) median income (“AMI”):
                 •         Extremely-Low (30% or less of AMI)
                 •         Very-Low (31-50% of AMI)
                 •         Low (51-80% of AMI)
                 •         Moderate (81-120% of AMI)
                 •         Above-Moderate (over 120% of AMI)
In addition to these categories, the City has identified a “workforce” income category of 120-200%
AMI in recognition of the high housing costs in the South Coast area.
Housing affordability is based on the relationship between household income and housing
expenses. According to HUD and the California Department of Housing and Community
Development, housing is considered “affordable” if the monthly payment is no more than 30% of
a household’s gross income. In some areas, these income limits may be increased to adjust for
high housing costs.
Table I-12 shows 2014 affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for
housing in Santa Barbara County by income category. Based on state-adopted standards and a
family of four, the maximum affordable monthly rent for extremely-low-income households is
$598, while the maximum affordable rent for very-low-income households is $995. The maximum
affordable rent for low-income households is $1593, while the maximum for moderate-income
households is $2,199.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage interest
rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments, homeowner
association fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the maximum home purchase
prices by income category shown in Table I-12 have been estimated based on typical conditions.
                                                                   Table I-12

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                       I Housing Needs Assessment
b.     For-Sale Housing
Housing sales price statistics reported by DataQuick Information Systems for calendar year
20132 showed median sales prices of $728,000 for single-family homes and $426,000 for
condominiums in Carpinteria. Based on the estimated affordable purchase prices shown in Table
I-12, it is unlikely that many market rate homes or condominiums would be affordable to lower- or
moderate-income residents. These data illustrate the fact that in beach communities, very large
public subsidies are generally required to reduce sales prices to a level that is affordable to low-
and moderate-income buyers. At a median condo price of $426,000, there is a “gap” of almost
$100,000 between the market price and the maximum price a moderate-income household can
afford to pay for a home. For low-income households, this gap is about $200,000.
c.     Rental Housing
An internet rental survey conducted in June 2014 found asking rents of $1,100 to $4,000 per
month for one bedroom units and $2,100+ for two-bedroom units. As would be expected in a
desirable beach community in Southern California, when market rents are compared to the
amounts households can afford to pay (Table I-12, page I-13), it is clear that very-low- and
extremely-low-income households have a very difficult time finding housing without overpaying.
At a rent of $2,100 per month, the gap between market rent and affordable rent at the very-low-
income level is about $1,100 per month, while the gap at the extremely-low-income level is about
$1,500 per month.
E.     Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to special
circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and income, family
characteristics, disability or other conditions. As a result, some residents may experience a higher
prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding or other housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with disabilities, the
elderly, large households, female-headed households with children, homeless people and farm
workers. This section contains a discussion of the housing needs facing each of these groups.
       1.    Persons with Disabilities
Recent Census data reported that approximately 108 people in Carpinteria between the 18 and
64 years of age, or 2.6% of the working age population, reported a disability that affected their
ability to live independently (Table I-13). Of those aged 65 and over, reported disabilities are
much more prevalent. Approximately 385 seniors reported an ambulatory difficulty (24%) while
about 19% reported a difficulty with living independently. Housing opportunities for persons with
disabilities can be maximized through housing assistance programs and providing universal
design features such as widened doorways, ramps, lowered countertops, single-level units and
ground floor units. The City also encourages development of assisted living and supportive
housing facilities through its zoning regulations (see further discussion in the Constraints section
of this report).

Developmentally Disabled
As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an
individual that:
             •    Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and
                  physical impairments;
             •    Is manifested before the individual attains age 18;
             •    Is likely to continue indefinitely;
             •    Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following
                  areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c)
                  learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or
                  g) economic self-sufficiency;
             •    Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
                  interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports or other forms of
                  assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned
                  and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S. Administration on
Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the population that can be
                                                              I-15                                        November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                                 I Housing Needs Assessment
defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many developmentally disabled persons can
live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled
individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely
affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical
therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living
situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based
services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families
through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two
community-based facilities. Carpinteria is served by the Tri-Counties Regional Center3 (TCRC)
which is based in Santa Barbara. As of 2014, TCRC served approximately 11,500 clients and had
280 staff persons, with 117 clients living in Carpinteria. Any resident who has a developmental
disability that originated before age 18 is eligible for services. Services are offered to people with
developmental disabilities based on Individual Program Plans and may include: Adult day
programs; advocacy; assessment/consultation; behavior management programs; diagnosis and
evaluation; independent living services; infant development programs; information and referrals;
mobility training; prenatal diagnosis; residential care; respite care; physical and occupational
therapy; transportation; consumer, family vendor training; and vocational training. TCRC also
coordinates the state-mandated Early Start program which provides services for children under
age three who have or are at substantial risk of having a developmental disability.
      2.      Elderly
According to recent Census data, about 32% of owner households and 13% of renter households
in Carpinteria were headed by someone age 65 or older (Table I-14). Many elderly persons are
dependent on fixed incomes and/or have a disability. Elderly homeowners may be physically
unable to maintain their homes or cope with living alone. The housing needs of this group can be
addressed through smaller units, second units on lots with existing homes, shared living
arrangements, congregate housing and housing assistance programs.

Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as those with
five or more members. About 63% of owners and 55% of renters reported only one or two
members. Only about 7% of owner households and about 10% of renter households reported five

Carpinteria with four or more bedrooms is expected to be much less than for smaller units.

      4.     Female-Headed Households
Recent Census data reported that approximately 10% of owner households and 21% of renter
households in Carpinteria were headed by a female (Table I-16). While female-headed
households represent a small portion of households, they may have significant difficulties finding
affordable housing, particularly in expensive coastal areas.

      5.     Farm Workers
According to the Santa Barbara County Agricultural Commissioner, agriculture directly contributes
$1.8 billion to the county economy and provides approximately 16,000 jobs4. Farm worker
households are considered as a special needs group due to the lower incomes typically earned
by these households. Migrant workers, and their places of residence, are generally located in
close proximity to agricultural areas providing employment.
As shown previously in the discussion of employment (Table I-9), it is estimated that there are
451 Carpinteria residents employed in agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining jobs.
No data is available for city residents employed as farmworkers.

      6.      Homeless Persons
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines the term “homeless” as
the state of a person who lacks a fixed, regular and adequate night-time residence, or a person
who has a primary night time residency that is:
              •     A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide
                    temporary living accommodations;
              •     An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be
                    institutionalized; or
              •     A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular
                    sleeping accommodation for human beings. 5
Although there are myriad causes of homelessness, among the most common are:
              •     Substance abuse and alcohol
              •     Domestic violence
              •     Mental illness
Since 2003, all Continuum of Care Communities (those receiving Federal Grant Funds serving
the homeless) have been required to report the number of people who are homeless at a
particular point in time. Surveys are required every other year. The most recent Point in Time
(PIT) homeless survey in Santa Barbara County was conducted by the Central Coast Coalition on
Homelessness (C3H) on January 22-23, 2013.
At the direction of staff from C3H, approximately 650 volunteers were deployed to physically
count the homeless population in Santa Barbara County during the two-day PIT event, and also
administer the Vulnerability Index Survey for which respondents self-reported information. The
total 2013 PIT homeless count was 1,466 persons compared to a total of 1,536 recorded in the
2011 PIT survey (Table I-17). The PIT survey reported 10 homeless persons in the Carpinteria
area, a reduction from 15 persons counted in 2011.

There are a number of facilities and programs that address homelessness on a regional basis in
the southern Santa Barbara County area. Most of these are based in the City of Santa Barbara,
but many provide services to homeless people from Carpinteria (Table I-18).

F.      Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
As part of the Housing Element update, state law requires jurisdictions to identify assisted units
that are at risk of conversion to market rate housing during the 10-year period 2015-2025. Table
I-19 summarizes assisted affordable units in Carpinteria. As seen in this table, there are five
developments with 131 deed-restricted units in the City, and none of these is at risk of conversion
to market rate status during the next 10 years.

G. Low- and Moderate-Income Housing in the Coastal Zone
The entire City of Carpinteria is within the Coastal Zone. California Government Code §65590 et
seq. prohibits conversion or demolition of existing residential dwelling units occupied by low- or
moderate-income persons or families unless provision has been made for the replacement in the
same city or county of those dwelling units with units for persons and families of low- or
moderate-income (excludes structures with fewer than three units, or fewer than 10 units for
projects with more than one structure, among other exclusions). §65590(d) further requires new
housing development in the Coastal Zone to provide housing units for persons and families of
low- or moderate-income, or if not feasible, to provide such units at another location within the
same city or county, within the Coastal Zone or within three miles thereof. As shown in Table I-20,
more than 800 units have been approved in the city since 1982 and none were required to be
deed-restricted for low- and moderate-income households (the City’s Inclusionary policy only
requires “workforce” housing in the above-moderate category. Several affordable projects have
been constructed in the city, however, through the efforts of non-profit builders. Approximately 23
units occupied by low- or moderate-income households have been demolished in the Coastal
Zone and 21 units have been replaced.

H. Future Housing Needs
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to plan for
anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the anticipated need for housing within each jurisdiction
in Santa Barbara County for the projection period6 January 1, 2014 to September 30, 2022.
Communities then determine how they will address this need through the process of updating the
housing elements of their general plans.
The RHNA for the fifth housing element cycle was adopted by the Santa Barbara County
Association of Governments (SBCAG) in August 2013. The future need for housing is determined
primarily by the forecasted growth in households in a community. Each new household, created
by a child moving out of a parent's home, by a family moving to a community for employment,
and so forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The housing need for new households is then
adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy to promote housing choice and mobility. An
adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost due to demolition, natural
disaster or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these factors – household growth,

   Under state law, the “projection period” is the timeframe for determining regional housing need, while the “planning
   period” is the eight-year period between the due date for one housing element update and the due date for the next
   housing element update. The “fifth cycle” planning period for jurisdictions in Santa Barbara County runs from

vacancy need and replacement need – determines the construction need for a community. Total
housing need is then distributed among four income categories on the basis of the county’s
income distribution, with adjustments to avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households
in any community.
The new housing need allocated to the City of Carpinteria for the 2015-2023 planning period is
163 units, distributed by income category as shown in Table I-21. Pursuant to Government Code
§65583(a)(1) it is assumed that the need for extremely-low-income households is half of the very-
low-income need.

II. RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
A. Land Resources
Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an “inventory
of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for
redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to
these sites.” A detailed analysis of vacant land and potential redevelopment opportunities has
been prepared and is described in Appendix B. The results of this analysis are summarized in
Table II-1 below. The table shows that the city’s land inventory exceeds the RHNA allocation for
this planning period.
As discussed in Appendix B, the requirement to demonstrate availability of lower-income sites is
met through zoning that allows redevelopment of underutilized sites at densities greater than 20
units/acre. In 2004 state law was amended to establish 20 units/acre as the density deemed
appropriate to accommodate housing for lower-income households in suburban cities like
Carpinteria [Government Code §65583.2(c)(3)(B)]. The land inventory analysis in Appendix B
contains an estimate of the realistic capacity of potential sites for residential development with
zoning to accommodate the City’s assigned RHNA allocation for all income levels.

      Notes:
      1. Reflects excess lower-income sites
A discussion of public facilities and infrastructure needed to serve future development is
contained in Section III.B, Non-Governmental Constraints. There are currently no known service
limitations that would preclude the level of development described in the RHNA, although
developers will be required to pay fees or construct public improvements prior to or concurrent
with development.
B. Financial and Administrative Resources
       Section 8 Rental Assistance. The County of Santa Barbara Housing Authority reports
       that 74 Carpinteria residents receive monthly rental assistance from the Section 8 Voucher
       Program, and the City of Santa Barbara Housing Authority reports 95 Carpinteria residents
       with Section 8 vouchers, for a total of 169 vouchers currently (June 2014) being used in
       Carpinteria. Under this program, a tenant has a “contract” rent with the landlord. The tenant
       is responsible for a rent payment based on his/her income, usually 30%, and the Housing
       Authority makes a monthly “housing assistance payment” to the landlord.
                                                            II-1                                  November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                   II Resources and Opportunities
      CDBG and HOME Funds. The City receives both CDBG and HOME funds from the
      County through a fair share formula. The following projects received CDBG and HOME
      funding reservations from the City’s allocation during the prior planning period (these
      projects also received subsidy funds from other sources):
                  Dahlia Court Expansion Project        33 affordable units    $950,627
                  Chapel Court Rehabilitation           28 affordable units     $50,000
                  Casas de las Flores                   43 affordable units    $150,000
      United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Funds. The USDA is an important
      housing resource. Carpinteria’s very-low-income homeowners are eligible to apply for loans
      of up to $20,000 to repair, improve or modernize their dwellings to remove health and safety
      hazards. The loan term is 20 years and the interest rate is 1%. Grants of up to $7,500 are
      available to homeowners who are 62 years of age or older and who cannot repay a loan. A
      loan/grant combination for up to $27,500 can be made if the applicant can repay a part of
      the loan. The program is known as the Rural Housing Repair and Rehabilitation Program.
      The USDA also is a funding source for the preservation of the 28-unit Chapel Court housing
      complex. Chapel Court is owned by the Chapel Court Housing Corporation. The project has
      a conditional approval for a $526,000 loan from the USDA which must be matched by other
      funds. Peoples’ Self-Help Housing Corporation, acting as managing agent, has also applied
      for a Joe Serna, Jr. Farmworker Grant for the project site.
      Another USDA program is the Rural Rental Housing Guaranteed Loan Program (Section
      538). This program is intended to fund construction, acquisition or rehabilitation of rural
      multi-family housing for low-income occupants. Residents of the completed housing facility
      must be very-low- to moderate-income households; or elderly, handicapped or disabled
      persons with income not in excess of 115% of the median income of the county.
      A third USDA program is the Rural Rental Housing Program (Section 515). Rural Rental
      Housing Loans are direct, competitive mortgage loans made to provide affordable multi-
      family rental housing for very-low-, low-, and moderate-income families; the elderly; and
      persons with disabilities. This is primarily a direct mortgage program, but its funds may also
      be used to buy and improve land and to provide necessary facilities such as water and
      waste disposal systems.
      In new Section 515 projects, 95% of tenants must have very-low incomes. In existing
      projects, 75% of new tenants must have very-low incomes. Loans are for up to 50 years at
      an effective 1% interest rate. A current rate is used for the promissory note but thereafter is
      used only to determine maximum rent payments.
      Local Housing Trust Fund. In lieu fees collected as part of the Inclusionary Housing
      Program are deposited into an affordable housing trust fund. The fund is used exclusively
      for the provision of affordable housing and for reasonable costs associated with the
      development, maintenance and oversight of the affordable housing. The fund includes in
      lieu fees as well as other funds available to the City for exclusive use for the provision of
      affordable housing. Currently, the trust fund has approximately $465,000 available to
      support affordable housing.
      Low Income Housing Tax Credits - The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)
      Program was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to provide an alternate method of
      funding low- and moderate-income housing. Each state receives a tax credit, based upon
      population, toward funding housing that meets program guidelines. The tax credits are then
      used to leverage private capital into new construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of
      affordable housing. Limitations on projects funded under the LIHTC program include
                                                   II-2                               November 10, 2014

       minimum requirements that a certain percentage of units remain rent-restricted, based upon
       median income.
       Mortgage Credit Certificates – The MCC Program, which is administered by the Housing
       Authority of Santa Barbara County, is a means of providing financial assistance to first-time
       homebuyers by allowing those homebuyers to take a specified percentage of annual
       mortgage interest payments as a tax credit against their federal personal income tax. The
       MCCs are used for the purchase of new or existing housing located within participating
       jurisdictions in Santa Barbara County. The MCCs are available to eligible homebuyers on a
       first-come, first-serve basis.
       State Housing Funds – The voters of California have approved bond measures including
       Proposition 46, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2002 ($1.86 billion)
       and Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006 ($2.6
       billion) to provide funding assistance for affordable and special needs housing. A variety of
       programs are funded by these bonds, including programs targeting both owner-occupied
       and rental housing. These programs are administered by the California Department of
       Housing and Community Development (HCD), although these funds have nearly been
       exhausted. The FY 2014-15 state budget includes new sources of funding for affordable
       and supportive housing, including allocations from state “cap and trade” revenues.
       Housing Trust Fund (HTF) of Santa Barbara County – The HTF 7 is a non-profit financing
       initiative whose mission is to expand affordable housing opportunities for low- to middle-
       income residents and workers in Santa Barbara County. HTF’s primary program is a $5.5
       million Revolving Loan Fund that provides direct low-cost financing to facilitate rental and
       home ownership housing production throughout the county. The Workforce Homebuyer
       Program, launched in May 2012, provides down payment assistance to help low- to
       moderate-income households purchase a home in the community where they work,
       enabling a stable residence that strengthens the family and neighborhood. In partnership,
       the City and the Housing Trust Fund of Santa Barbara County operate a “Workforce
       Homebuyer Down Payment Loan Program” that helps to bridge the homeownership
       affordability gap for workforce homebuyers by providing 30-year deferred payment loans up
       to $75,000 per household to assist low to upper moderate income households in purchasing
       a home in the City. Funds can be used for down payment and closing costs for households
       earn up to 200% of the Area Median Income (AMI), adjusted for household size. The loans
       have no current interest or principal payments, are structured with shared appreciation, and
       are repaid upon sale or refinancing of the home or at the end of the loan term. Funding for
       the program has been provided through the City of Carpinteria.
C. Energy Conservation and Sustainable Housing Development
In 2006, the State Legislature passed Assembly Bill (AB) 32, The Global Warming Solutions Act
of 2006, which requires the State of California to reduce greenhouse gas (GhG) emissions to
1990 levels no later than 2020. Passenger vehicles account for 31 percent of the state’s total
emissions. In 1990, greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and light trucks were 108
million metric tons, but by 2004 these emissions had increased to 135 million metric tons.
Senate Bill (SB) 375, passed in 2008, builds on the existing regional transportation planning
process, which is overseen by local officials with land use responsibilities, to connect the
reduction of GhG emissions from cars and light trucks to land use and transportation policy. SB

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                   II Resources and Opportunities
375 asserts that, “Without improved land use and transportation policy, California will not be able
to achieve the goals of AB 32.”
SB 375 has three goals: (1) to use the regional transportation planning process to help achieve
AB 32 goals; (2) to use California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) streamlining as an incentive
to encourage residential projects that help achieve AB 32 goals to reduce GhG emissions; and
(3) to coordinate the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) process with the regional
transportation planning process. SB 375 requires consistency between the Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP) and the RHNA, which is accomplished by using a common growth
forecast in both of these policy documents.
In 2013 the Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG) adopted both an RTP
and a RHNA, and local governments cooperate in the implementation of SB 375 by adopting
housing elements that facilitate new housing development in a manner consistent with the growth
forecast and RHNA.
Energy Conservation Opportunities
As residential energy costs rise, increasing utility bills can adversely affect housing affordability.
State of California Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings were
established in 1978 in response to a legislative mandate to reduce California's energy
consumption. The standards are codified in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations and are
updated periodically to allow consideration and possible incorporation of new energy efficiency
technologies and methods. California's building efficiency standards (along with those for energy
efficient appliances) have saved more than $56 billion in electricity and natural gas costs since
1978. It is estimated the standards will save an additional $23 billion by 2013. 8
Title 24 sets forth mandatory energy standards and requires the adoption of an “energy budget”
for all new residential buildings and additions to residential buildings. Separate requirements are
adopted for “low-rise” residential construction (i.e., no more than three stories) and non-
residential buildings, which includes hotels, motels and multi-family residential buildings with four
or more habitable stories. The standards specify energy saving design for lighting, walls, ceilings
and floor installations, as well as heating and cooling equipment and systems, gas cooling
devices, conservation standards and the use of non-depleting energy sources, such as solar
energy or wind power. The home building industry must comply with these standards while
localities are responsible for enforcing the energy conservation regulations through the plan
check and building inspection processes.
State policy requires all new residential buildings to be “net zero energy” by 2020. On May 31,
2012, the California Energy Commission (CEC) adopted new energy efficiency standards for both
residential and commercial buildings. The new Building Energy Efficiency Standards are 25
percent more efficient than previous standards for residential construction and 30 percent better
for nonresidential construction.
Some of the recent changes to residential standards include:
              •      Solar-ready roofs to allow homeowners to add solar photovoltaic panels at a
                     future date;
              •      More efficient windows to allow increased sunlight, while decreasing heat gain;

             •     Insulated hot water pipes to save water and energy and reduce the time it takes
                   to deliver hot water;
             •     Whole house fans to cool homes and attics with evening air, reducing the need
                   for air conditioning load; and
             •     Air conditioner installation verification to ensure efficient operation.
City Efforts to Encourage Energy Conservation
Energy conservation is an important consideration as the City evaluates housing development
proposals. One of the requirements of a Development Plan submittal is:
             A statement of energy and water conservation measures and/or devices
             incorporated into the construction and occupancy phases of the
             development.
Recently approved developments have promoted energy conservation in the design of both
housing and office components through the following techniques:
             •     Low E-glass;
             •     Higher R-valued insulation;
             •     Solar tubes and ceiling fans;
             •     Solar assisted water systems with tankless water heaters;
             •     Energy efficient lights and appliances;
             •     Natural light;
             •     Solar screens;
             •     Efficient lighting that exceeds Title 24 standards and utilizes natural light;
             •     An innovative water harvesting/bio-filtration/storage/reuse system that also
                   provides storm water retention and uses a solar powered pump to send water to
                   a restored water tower for landscape irrigation;
             •     Use of permeable paving blocks for drives and walks;
             •     Buildings designed with sustainable materials selected for durability and non-
                   toxic maintenance, i.e.: Fly-ash concrete, FSC certified lumber; fiber cement
                   siding, recycled steel roofing, formaldehyde-free insulation, sheathing and
                   cabinets;
             •     Passive solar heating with thermal storage, natural lighting and natural
                   ventilation designed to minimize fossil energy use would be incorporated within
                   all residential structures;
             •     Building integrated solar electric photovoltaic systems for all units;
             •     Energy Star appliances, heating system, water heaters, vent fans and light
                   fixtures;
             •     Extra water-conserving toilets with dual flush along with low flow fixtures and
                   instant flow water heaters;
             •     Units and Buildings that qualify as “Energy Star Homes” under the U.S.

III. CONSTRAINTS
A. Governmental Constraints
While local land use plans and regulations are developed to protect people and structures from
hazards or nuisances or to protect important environmental or community values, these
regulations can also affect the price and availability of housing and, in particular, the provision of
affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and required
contributions to infrastructure, permit processing procedures and various other issues may
present constraints to the maintenance, development and improvement of housing.
      1.    Land Use Plans and Regulations
a.    General Plan and Zoning Designations
Table III-1 shows the four major residential land use categories designated in the City’s General
Plan Land Use Element. Densities range from a low of 0.3 dwelling units per acre up to 20
dwelling units per acre.
The City’s Zoning Code allows residential uses in eight zone districts:
             •    R-1 – Single Family
             •    PRD – Planned Residential Development
             •    PUD – Planned Unit Development
             •    MHS/PUD – Mobile/Modular Home Subdivision/Planned Unit Development

home housing is permitted at a density of about eight dwellings per acre. The PRD Zone allows
up to 20 dwelling units per acre. Residential densities affect housing cost and affordability. While
higher densities can reduce per unit land costs, in coastal areas it is extremely difficult to produce
new affordable housing without significant financial subsidies. State law allows the use of
“default” density standards deemed by the state legislature to be suitable for lower-income
housing. The City’s assigned default density under state law for lower-income households is 20
units per acre. The PRD and PUD zoning districts allow densities of 20 units per acre and
therefore are deemed to be suitable for the development of lower-income housing.
Lot Coverage
Building coverage, according to the zoning regulations, means the amount of land that may be
covered by buildings, usually measured as a percentage of the lot area. However, pools, spas
and patios are not included within the meaning of a building. Table III-3 identifies the lot coverage
standards for each residential zone. Housing development in the PRD-20 Zone, the City’s highest
density zone, can satisfy the lot coverage standard and attain the maximum number of housing
units.
Height Limits
Building height means the vertical distance from the average finish grade of the lot covered by the
building to the highest points of the coping of a flat roof or to the height of the highest gable of a
pitch or hip roof. Table B-2 identifies the maximum height limits for each residential zone. All
existing affordable housing developments have been developed below the maximum height limit.
Housing developments in the PRD-20 zone, the City’s highest density zone, can satisfy the height
limits and attain the maximum number of housing units. In addition, three-story development is
possible within the 30-foot height limit.
Lot Size Requirements
Table B-2 shows the lot size requirements for the different residential zones. Single-family
housing is permitted on a variety of lot sizes. Mobile home parks and subdivisions require a
minimum of 10 acres. This minimum lot size enables mobile home parks to have at least 80
spaces. The PRD zone requires a minimum lot size of 7,000 square feet for newly created lots.
However, existing lots smaller than 7,000 square feet can still develop at a minimum of 2,180
square feet per dwelling unit in the PRD-20 Zone.
Unit Size Requirements
The City does not have regulations that require minimum or maximum housing unit sizes by
housing type or zone, except for single room occupancy (SRO) units. The City encourages “…
studio and one bedroom units above commercial uses in the downtown district to reduce parking
needs and facilitate affordability.”

Floor area ratio (FAR) is defined by the zoning regulations as the total floor area of enclosed
buildings on a lot divided by the net area of the site expressed in a percent form. This definition
excludes pools, spas and patios. Table B-2 identifies the floor area ratios for each residential

zone, the City’s highest density zone, can satisfy the setback requirements and attain the
maximum number of housing units.
Open Space Requirements
Open space, according to the zoning regulations, means private open space that includes, but is
not limited, to patios, decks and yards for the private use of the residents of individual units. Table
B-2 identifies the open space requirements for each residential zone. Housing development in the
PRD-20 zone, the City’s highest density zone, can satisfy open space requirements and attain
the maximum number of housing units.
Growth Controls/Urban Growth Boundaries
The City has no growth controls or limitations that establish ceilings on the number of new
housing units that can be approved annually. The City’s General Plan/Local Coastal Land Use
Plan guides growth and development within the City and identifies a Sphere of Influence
boundary that includes an estimated 8.35 acres. Each area included in the Sphere of Influence is
contiguous to the existing City urban/rural boundary and has unique characteristics or
circumstances that support inclusion in the City sphere of influence.
Special Needs Housing
Under state law, persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities, persons
with disabilities, farm workers, persons needing emergency shelter, transitional or supportive
housing, and single room occupancy (SRO) units. The City’s regulations regarding these housing
types are discussed below.
             •      Housing for Persons with Disabilities
                   Residential Care Facilities. Health and Safety Code §§1267.8, 1566.3, and
                   1568.08 require local governments to treat licensed group homes and residential
                   care facilities with six or fewer residents no differently than other single-family
                   residential uses. “Six or fewer persons” does not include the operator, the
                   operator’s family or persons employed as staff. Local agencies must allow these
                   licensed care facilities in any area zoned for residential use, and may not require
                   licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons to obtain conditional
                   use permits or variances that are not required of other family dwellings. The
                   City’s zoning regulations are consistent with these provisions of state law. Large
                   residential care facilities for seven or more persons are conditionally permitted in
                   any zone.
                                                     III-5                            November 10, 2014

                  Reasonable Accommodation. Cities are required to adopt procedures for
                  processing requests for “reasonable accommodation” in the application of
                  building or zoning regulations to reduce barriers for persons with disabilities.
                  Chapter 14.61 of the Zoning Code includes reasonable accommodation
                  procedures pursuant to state law.
                  Definition of “Family”. The Zoning Code defines “Family” as “one or more
                  persons living together as a single nonprofit housekeeping unit and sharing
                  common living, sleeping, cooking and eating facilities. Members of a family need
                  not be related but are distinguished from a group occupying a boarding or
                  lodging house, hotel, club or similar dwelling for group uses.” This definition is
                  consistent with state law.
                  Maximum concentration and site planning requirements. Separation of certain
                  types of licensed care homes is regulated by the State. Except for foster homes
                  and elderly care, licenses issued by the California Department of Social Services
                  (CDSS) must be a minimum of 300 feet from any other licensed home (as
                  measured from the outside walls of the house – Health and Safety Code
                  §1520.5). If a home is closer than 300 feet, an exemption must be granted by
                  the City, otherwise the license in denied. This 300-foot separation restriction
                  does not apply to licenses issued by the State Department of Alcohol and Drugs
                  for rehabilitation homes. CDSS must submit any application for a facility covered
                  by the law to the city where the facility will be located. The City may request that
                  the license be denied based on the overconcentration or an existing facility (or
                  within 1,000 feet of a congregate living health facility) unless the City approves
                  the application. Even if there is adequate separation between the facilities, a city
                  or county may ask that the license be denied based on over-concentration.
                  These separation requirements apply only to facilities with the same type of
                  license. For instance, a community care facility would not violate the separation
                  requirements even if located next to a drug and alcohol treatment facility.
                  The City complies with fair housing laws as they relate to spacing and
                  separation requirements. The City has not adopted a standard different from or
                  more stringent than those imposed by state law.
             •     Farmworker Housing
                  Under the state Employee Housing Act, farmworker housing for up to six
                  employees must be treated as a single-family residential use and permitted
                  subject to the same regulations and standards as apply to other residential uses
                  in the same zone.
                  Additionally, farmworker housing in a zone where agriculture is permitted is
                  considered an agricultural activity when consisting of no more than 36 beds in
                  group quarters or 12 units or spaces designed for use by separate households
                  and must be treated as other agricultural activities in the same zone consistent
                  with the Employee Housing Act. The Zoning Code allows farmworker housing
                  consistent with these provisions of state law.
             •     Emergency Shelters
                  Emergency shelters are facilities that provide a safe alternative to acute
                  homelessness either in a shelter facility, or through the use of motel vouchers.
                  Emergency shelter is short-term, usually for 30 days or less. State law (Senate
                                                  III-6                               November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                                III Constraints
                  Bill 2 of 2007) requires that unless adequate shelter facilities are available to
                  meet a jurisdiction’s needs, emergency shelters must be allowed by-right (i.e.,
                  without discretionary review such as a conditional use permit) in at least one
                  zoning district, but may include specific development standards.
                  The Zoning Code allows emergency shelters by-right in the Industrial/Research
                  Park (M-RP) zoning district (Figure III-1) in conformance with SB 2. This district
                  encompasses approximately 146 acres and has vacant sites or buildings that
                  could accommodate year-round emergency shelters sufficient to meet the City’s
                  estimated homeless population of 10 persons based on the latest Point-in-Time
                  survey. The M-RP district provides close proximity to transit and other services
                  used by homeless persons.
                  Development standards for emergency shelters include those applicable to all
                  uses in the M-RP zone plus the following:
                         • Maximum Occupancy of 25 persons (higher occupancy facilities may be
                               considered through a Conditional Use Permit)
                         • Vehicle and Bicycle Parking. One vehicle parking space per five beds,
                               plus one space for each employee on duty. One bicycle parking
                               space per five beds
                         • Waiting intake area large enough to accommodate regular occupancy.
                         • The facility may provide amenities such as: commercial kitchen,
                               recreation room, support services, laundry services and storage
                               areas
                         • Length of stay no more than six months in any 12-month period
                         •A    written management plan including provisions for staffing,
                               management, security, outdoor uses, temporary storage, site
                               maintenance, service amenities and transportation
                         • Lighting for security and safety
                         • Minimum separation of 300 feet from any other emergency shelter
                  These standards are objective and do not pose an unreasonable constraint to
                  establishment of emergency shelters.
             •     Transitional and Supportive Housing
                  Transitional and supportive housing are longer-term types of housing, up to two
                  years or more. Residents are typically required to participate in a structured
                  program to work toward established goals so that they can move on to
                  permanent housing. Supportive housing residents are often provided with an
                  array of supportive services to assist them in daily activities. Under SB 2,
                  transitional and supportive housing are deemed to be residential uses subject
                  only to the same requirements and standards that apply to other residential uses
                  of the same type in the same zone. The Zoning Code allows transitional and
                  supportive housing in conformance with state law.

             •     Single Room Occupancy
                  Single room occupancy (SRO) facilities are small studio-type units that typically
                  rent in the very-low- or extremely-low-income category. California Health and
                  Safety Code §17958.1 allows jurisdictions to permit efficiency units with a
                  minimum floor area of 150 square feet and partial kitchen or bathroom facilities
                  for occupancy by no more than two persons. SROs are conditionally permitted in
                  the Planned Residential Development (PRD) zone subject to the following
                  development standards:
                        • Minimum size of 150 square feet and maximum size of 400 square feet
                        • Occupancy limited to a maximum of two persons per unit
                        • A SRO unit is not required to but may contain partial or full bathroom
                               facilities. A partial bathroom facility shall have at least a toilet and
                               sink; a full facility shall have a toilet, sink and bathtub, shower or
                               bathtub/shower combination. If a full bathroom facility is not provided,
                               common bathroom facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
                               California Building Code for congregate residences with at least one
                               full bathroom per floor.
                        • A SRO unit is not required to but may contain partial or full kitchen
                               facilities. A full kitchen includes a sink, a refrigerator and a stove,
                               range top or oven. A partial kitchen is missing at least one of these
                               appliances. If a full kitchen is not provided, common kitchen facilities
                               shall be provided with at least one full kitchen per floor.
                        • One closet per person, telephone hookups and cable or satellite TV
                               hookups
                        • If laundry facilities are not provided in each unit, common laundry
                               facilities shall be provided, with one washer and one dryer on the
                               premises for every 10 units
                        • Elevators shall be required for SRO buildings of two or more stories
                        • Onsite management
                        • Off-street parking at the rate of 0.5 space per unit, plus one space for
                               each employee on duty
                  These standards do not pose an unreasonable constraint on development of
                  SRO facilities.
b.    Off-Street Parking Requirements
Chapter 14.54 of the Zoning Code requires the provision of parking for residential uses as
follows:
              Single-family detached dwellings: two covered parking spaces per dwelling within a
               garage.
             •     Multiple-family dwellings (including two-family duplexes):
                  (1)   For each single bedroom or efficiency dwelling unit designed and intended
                        to accommodate not more than two persons: one covered space per unit,
                        either in a carport or a garage;
                                                     III-9                             November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                                 III Constraints
                  (2)   Two or more bedroom dwellings: a minimum of one covered parking
                        space per unit plus one parking space per unit in a paved parking area;
                  (3)   Visitor parking: one parking space per three dwelling units;
                  (4)   Parking spaces shall not be located more than 200 feet from the building
                        served by such spaces.
             •     Mobile homes (located in mobile home parks): two spaces on each mobile
                   home site (may be tandem); one space for every three sites for guest parking.
             •     Clubs, fraternities, sororities, dormitories, boardinghouses and lodging houses:
                   one space per four bed spaces and one space per two employees.
             •     Rest homes, family care and special care homes, and other group care or
                   congregate care facilities: one space for each three beds plus one space for
                   each employee.
Impacts of the parking standards on housing cost and supply are minimal, and the City’s parking
standards can be accommodated on parcels that meet the minimum lot size requirements. That
is, the parking standards do not reduce housing capacity below the maximum permitted by zoning
on lots meeting the minimum lot size requirements.
The cost impact of the City’s parking standards on affordability pertains primarily to construction
costs -- that is, the need to construct a garage compared to a carport. Once again, the cost
impacts are minimal because a garage is required only for single family homes. The number of
parking spaces required of rental housing spaces are not extraordinary as a maximum of two
spaces are required for rental housing units having two or more bedrooms. Developers may
satisfy the standard by providing one carport and one paved space (covered or uncovered).
The City standards have not impeded the development of new housing. Over the past several
years, there have been no requests for variances to permit carports instead of garages for single-
family dwellings. However, pursuant to Program #7 of the Housing Plan, the City will continue to
provide relief from the covered parking and parking space requirements in order to facilitate the
development and rehabilitation of affordable housing.
The City’s density bonus regulations allow qualifying projects to provide reduced parking as
follows:
             •     Zero to one bedroom: one onsite parking space
             •     Two to three bedrooms: two onsite parking spaces
             •     Four or more bedrooms: two and one-half parking spaces
The above parking ratios are inclusive of handicapped and guest parking. In addition, a
development may provide "onsite parking" through tandem parking or uncovered parking, but not
through on street parking.
These standards are considered reasonable and do not constrain housing development.
c.     Second Units
Chapter 14.72 of the Zoning Code establishes regulations for second units. Second units are
permitted subject to architectural review and an administrative coastal development permit. The
property owner must reside in either the primary or the second unit, and second units may not be
                                                   III-10                          November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                              III Constraints
sold separately from the main dwelling. Second units must comply with applicable development
standards for the primary unit as well as the following:
             •    Minimum lot size: 8,000 square feet
             •    Maximum unit size: 30% of the primary unit size up to a maximum of 700
                  square feet
             •    Maximum height: one story or 18 feet, not to exceed the height of the primary
                  dwelling
             •    Parking: one enclosed garage space per bedroom
Program 1 in the Housing Plan includes a commitment to review and revise these development
standards as appropriate to facilitate development of additional second units.
d.    Density Bonus
Under state law (SB 1818 of 2004), cities and counties must provide a density increase up to
35% over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the Municipal Code and the
Land Use Element of the General Plan (or bonuses of equivalent financial value) when builders
agree to construct housing developments with units affordable to low- or moderate-income
households. Chapter 14.77 of the Zoning Code establishes density bonus regulations in
conformance with state law.
e.    Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
There is often an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a plant rather than onsite, thereby
reducing cost. State law precludes local governments from prohibiting the installation of mobile
homes on permanent foundations on single-family lots. It also declares a mobile home park to be
a permitted land use on any land planned and zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring
the average density in a new mobile home park to be less than that permitted by the Municipal
Code. Mobile homes on a permanent foundation are permitted in any zone that allows single-
family homes, as well as in the Mobile Home Park zone.
f.    Building Codes
The City’s building regulations (Title 15 of the Municipal Code) incorporate the 2013 versions of
the California Building Code, Residential Code, Electrical Code, Plumbing Code, Mechanical
Code, Green Building Code and Building Energy Efficiency Standards. The City’s building
regulations detail the revisions and amendments to the Building Code that differ from state
standards. These amendments are mostly related to geotechnical review and provisions for
adequate drainage and do not pose unreasonable constraints to housing cost.
g.    Coastal Zone
The entire City is located with the Coastal Zone and the City has a certified Local Coastal
Program (LCP). As a result, all development, other than minor additions to existing dwellings,
requires a Coastal Development Permit. Projects located within the Coastal Appeals Overlay
District may be appealed to the California Coastal Commission.

h.     Inclusionary Ordinance
The City of Carpinteria has adopted an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance to encourage the
development and availability of affordable housing in the above-moderate-income category in an
effort to provide housing for middle-income and critical workforce households that cannot afford
housing in Carpinteria, and to ensure that the private sector, as well as the public sector,
contributes to and participates in providing adequate housing for all economic segments of
Carpinteria.
Residential development of five or more housing units involving a subdivision map for the
purpose of creating individual ownership units or parcels must construct 12% of the total units at
a price affordable to households earning 121% of the area median income (AMI).
The City has provided incentives for developers to facilitate inclusionary requirements. A
developer may request and the City may approve one incentive to facilitate the construction of
inclusionary units, if the developer can demonstrate that the modification is necessary to provide
for affordable housing cost.
If it is determined that the construction of the affordable units is infeasible, the inclusionary
ordinance provides for an in lieu fee. However, no one has requested to pay an in lieu fee since
adoption of the program in 2004. The ordinance does not provide for the affordable housing to be
provided off-site.
Any in lieu fees collected are deposited into an affordable housing trust fund. The fund is used
exclusively for the provision of affordable housing and for reasonable costs associated with the
development, maintenance and oversight of affordable housing in the City. The fund includes in
lieu fees as well as other funds available to the City for exclusive use for the provision of
affordable housing. Currently, the trust fund has approximately $465,000 available to provide for
affordable housing.
The following inclusionary housing units were developed during the previous planning period:

       2.   Development Processing Procedures
a.     Types of Permits Required for Residential Development
The types of permits required for residential development are determined by the zone in which
the residential property is located. All new development projects, as well as certain use changes
in existing buildings, must be reviewed by the Community Development Department staff for
conformance with the City’s Local Coastal Land Use Plan, General Plan and Zoning Code. In
addition, the Planning Commission reviews projects that require one or more of the following
types of permits or approvals:
             •       Conceptual Plan/ Review - Due to the City’s need to implement Coastal Plan
                     and General Plan Policies and integrate citizen participation and environmental
                     review, the Conceptual Plan Review process helps applicants understand if and
                     how a proposal might cause public policy conflicts and/or environmental
                     impacts.
                                                  III-12                                November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                                   III Constraints
             •    Annexation Proposal/Sphere of Influence Amendment - Development proposals
                  for properties outside the City that may be annexed into the City. A Sphere of
                  Influence boundary has been adopted to assist planning. If property outside the
                  City is not within the sphere, the sphere also needs to be amended prior to
                  consideration of a development proposal.
             •    Local Coastal Program Amendment/General Plan Amendment - State law
                  requires every coastal city and county to adopt a Coastal Plan and General
                  Plan. Any development proposal that changes Coastal Plan or General Plan
                  policy or a mapped land use designation requires an amendment.
             •    Rezoning and Zoning Ordinance Amendment - In considering a change of zone
                  request, the Planning Commission determines whether the proposed zoning is
                  consistent with the City’s General Plan, compatible with existing and proposed
                  development in the surrounding area, and consistent with good zoning or
                  planning practices. Some proposals may include a zoning ordinance text
                  amendment. The City Council is the local decision maker on these types of
                  applications.
             •    Specific Plan - State law and the City’s Local Coastal Program require the
                  preparation of a Specific Plan for properties so designated on the Zoning Map.
                  Any proposal involving multiple properties or phasing could benefit by including
                  the preparation of a Specific Plan.
             •    Development Plan and Coastal Development Permit - These types of permits
                  are required for all new development in most zone districts. The Community
                  Development Director or Planning Commission reviews the design and
                  operational characteristics of the proposed development and may impose
                  conditions of approval as deemed necessary. Unless otherwise exempted from
                  the State Coastal Act, any land use activity that fits within the definition of
                  “development” requires a Coastal Development Permit. In Carpinteria, any
                  entitlement for development including Development Plan, Conditional Use
                  Permit, Grading Permit, etc. requires a Coastal Development Permit as well.
             •    Conditional Use Permit - This permit is required for land uses that cannot be
                  readily classified as principal permitted uses in individual districts by reason of
                  their special character or possible effect on surrounding areas or the general
                  community. The Planning Commission may impose conditions on such projects
                  relating to both design and operation, and will require public review of the permit
                  to ensure compliance with conditions.
             •    Architectural Review - Most land use activities that result in physical design
                  changes require architectural review. Those changes that are associated with a
                  Development Plan or Conditional Use Permit application will require
                  Architectural Review Board review in addition to Planning Commission approval.
             •    Tentative Subdivision, Tentative Parcel Maps and Condominium Conversions -
                  In conjunction with review of other permits and approvals for a development
                  project, the Planning Commission will also review a proposed subdivision or
                  parcel map.
             •    Variance - The Planning Commission may approve a variance from certain
                  requirements of the Zoning Code if it makes specific findings regarding unique
                  circumstances or characteristics of the property involved.
                                                 III-13                              November 10, 2014

b.     Coastal Development Permits/Development Plan Approvals
Multi-family housing is a permitted use in the PRD, PUD, CPD, CB and M-RP Zones. This
housing type includes rowhouses, townhouses, apartments, condominiums and community
apartment projects. Multi-family housing is not subject to a conditional use permit in these zones.
However, all uses, not only multi-family rental housing, are permitted subject to approval of a
Development Plan and Coastal Development Permit approval.
A Development Plan describes the proposed development in terms of land uses, parking,
circulation, building heights, building elevations and the number and types of dwellings in each
building. After submittal of the Development Plan and Coastal Development Permit application,
the Community Development Department circulates the application to other City departments and
local special districts. The Planning Commission may then approve, conditionally approve or deny
the project. The Planning Commission’s decision may be appealed to the City Council. If the
project is located in the Coastal Appeals Overlay District, the City’s action may also be appealed
to the California Coastal Commission.
c.     Overlay Zones
In addition to the regulations governing individual zoning classifications, the City has six overlay
districts. The regulations of the overlay districts apply to the land in the same manner as specific
district regulations. Overlay regulations apply wherever the boundaries of the area are shown on
the official zoning maps. When an overlay district is added to an individual zoning district, the
provisions of the overlay district shall be effective in addition to the applicable district regulations.
If any of the provisions of the overlay district conflict with provisions of the specific zoning
classification regulation, the provisions which are most restrictive are enforced. Table III-4 lists
the City’s overlay districts.
                                      Table III-4 Zoning Overlay Districts

             1)    Coastal Appeals Area: The purpose of the CA Overlay District is to set forth
                   special permit procedures for development located in the coastal appeals area,
                   as defined in the City’s official zoning maps, since development in this area is
                   subject to appeal to the state Coastal Commission. The intent is to provide
                   opportunities for the maximum amount of public participation in the review of
                   such development by requiring a public hearing.
             2)    Environmentally Sensitive Habitat: The purpose of the ESH Overlay District is to
                   protect and preserve areas in which plant or animal life or their habitats are
                   either rare or especially valuable because of their role in the ecosystem and
                   which could be easily disturbed or degraded by human activities and
                   development. The intent of this district is to ensure that all development in such
                   areas is designed and carried out in a manner that will provide maximum
                   protection to sensitive habitat areas.
                                                            III-14                    November 10, 2014

             3)    Flood Hazard Area: The purpose of this overlay district is to promote the public
                   health, safety and welfare, and to minimize public and private losses in flood
                   hazard areas defined or designated by the United States Department of Housing
                   and Urban Development, Flood Insurance Administration including specifically
                   the Flood Insurance Rate Map currently in effect. The intent of this district is to
                   avoid exposing new development to flood hazard and to reduce the need for
                   future flood control protective works and resulting alteration of stream and
                   wetland environments by regulating development within flood hazard areas.
             4)    Specific Plan: The purpose of the Specific Plan Overlay district is to provide for
                   a coordinated level of site planning for parcels which are under separate
                   ownership but should be planned as a unit, prior to preparation of development
                   plans. The intent is to ensure a more precise level of planning for such areas
                   than is ordinarily possible under the land use plan. Therefore, a specific plan is
                   an extension of the land use plan, including but not limited to the location and
                   types of land uses, roads, open space, hazardous areas and natural landmarks.
             5)    Visitor-Serving/Highway Commercial: The purpose of the V Overlay District is to
                   provide for commercial development that will serve visitors to the city as well as
                   local residents. The intent is to provide a mechanism for requiring adequate
                   visitor-serving commercial uses in areas serving the beach and major highways
                   and to ensure that such uses are appropriately integrated with other commercial
                   needs of the community.
             6)    R Residential: The purpose of the R Overlay District is to provide the
                   opportunity for residential-only development in zone districts which would
                   otherwise not permit such uses. The intent is to encourage rehabilitation of
                   existing housing stock in certain commercial and industrial areas (excluding
                   coastal dependent industry), to increase the City’s stock of affordable housing
                   through new residential-only developments in areas which allow commercial,
                   industrial and mixed use developments, and to assist the City in maintaining an
                   appropriate balance between jobs and housing. The R Residential Overlay
                   District does not apply to Visitor-Serving Commercial (VC) designated parcels,
                   with the exception that second story mixed use or residential use shall be
                   allowed on VC designated parcels in the Downtown Core District.
The overlay districts do not adversely impact the supply and cost of housing. In fact, the R
Overlay District seeks to increase the supply and reduce the cost of housing by permitting
residential uses in certain commercial and industrial research park areas.
d.    Permit and Approval Time for Residential Projects
Carpinteria has a limited inventory of undeveloped land that provides for the development of
typical single-family, subdivision or multi-family projects. Many developments are infill residential
projects, particularly redevelopment of underutilized infill sites. Depending on the type of
development and permits required, typical processing time ranges from two to six months for
residential projects.
Since adoption of the prior Housing Element, the City has continually implemented the following
Housing Element policy:
             Facilitating Affordable Housing Development Review:               Affordable housing
             developments shall receive the highest priority and efforts by staff, the Planning
             Commission, and City Council to: (a) provide technical assistance to affordable
                                                  III-15                            November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                                 III Constraints
              housing developers, including community involvement; (b) take into account project
              funding and timing needs in the processing and review of the applications; and (c)
              provide the fastest turnaround possible in determining application completeness.
The Planning Commission has final review authority for Development Plans, Coastal
Development Permits, Conditional Use Permits, Tentative Parcel Maps, Condominium
Conversions and Variances. The Planning Commission’s decision may be appealed to the City
Council or the City Council may appeal a Planning Commission decision to itself. The Planning
Commission reviews and makes recommendations to the City Council for Annexations, Sphere of
Influence Amendments, Local Coastal Program and General Plan Amendments, Zone Changes
and Zoning Text Amendments, Specific Plans and Tentative Tract Maps. All of these City Council
decisions, except for some instances Tentative Subdivision Maps, are subject to review and
approval by the State Coastal Commission.
Typical single- and multi-family projects require a Development Plan and Coastal Development
Permit and Architectural Review. Subdivision maps are reviewed in conjunction with the review of
other permits. The decision-making criteria include the Coastal Plan and General Plan goals,
objectives and policies as well as the development standards and findings set forth in the Zoning
Code. In order to expedite the permit process, the Community Development Department
encourages applicants to participate in a Conceptual Review process before an application is
formally submitted to the City, or to consult with planning staff at the public information counter.
The City also has prepared an ‘Applicant’s Guide’ to show applicants the process for projects that
require review by the Planning Commission or City Council. The Guide includes information about
how to submit a complete application package. Through these efforts, the City reduces the costs
and time involved in processing development applications.
The certainty of approval of a development application is a function of the due diligence of the
applicant with respect to submitting a proposal that is complete and satisfies the development
standards and policies. The Community Development Department’s ‘Applicant’s Guide’
encourages applicants to consult with the Department to find out the zoning regulations that may
affect the project, the types of permits that may be needed and what fees are required. The
Applicant’s Guide 9 also describes the nature and sequence of steps that comprise the
development review process.
PUD Review Procedures
Permitted uses subject to Development Plan approval in the Planned Unit Development (PUD)
district include:
              Residential units, either attached or detached, including single-family dwellings,
              rowhouses, townhouses, apartments, condominiums, modular homes and mobile
              homes on a permanent foundation; provided that the units are clustered to the
              maximum extent feasible for modular/mobile home PUDs.
The PUD District has established standards regarding maximum building coverage, minimum
open space and maximum building height. The development standards are as follows:
              •       Parking per the parking regulations for each land use
              •       Building coverage – maximum of 30%
              •       Building height – maximum of 30 feet
              •       Common open space – minimum of 20% of lot area

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                                 III Constraints
             •    Landscaping – in accordance with approved development plan
             •    Density – determined at time of designation unless already established by the
                  General Plan/Coastal Plan
In determining the appropriate density, the following factors are considered:
             1.   Protection of the scenic qualities of the site
             2.   Protection of natural and/or coastal resources, e.g., habitat areas,
                  archaeological sites
             3.   Avoidance of siting of structures on hazardous areas
             4.   Provision of public open space, recreation and/or beach access
             5.   Preservation of existing healthy trees
             6.   Mix of housing types and provision of low- and moderate-income housing
                  opportunities
             7.   Density in surrounding areas
             8.   Service system constraints
Standards with regard to setbacks, lot area and distance between buildings have not been
established. The reason is that the intent of the PUD zone district is to “encourage clustering of
structures to preserve a maximum amount of contiguous open space.” To this end, the “intent is
to promote multiple residential development rather than single-family subdivisions….”
The process of approving a PUD involves the preparation of a Development Plan by the
applicant. The contents of a Development Plan have been described previously in the analysis of
potential governmental constraints. Prior to approving a Development Plan, the City Council or
Planning Commission shall determine that the following requirements have been met:
             1.   That the density and type of proposed development is in conformance with the
                  Coastal Land Use Plan;
             2.   That adequate provisions have been made within the proposed conditions,
                  covenants and restrictions to establish permanent care and maintenance of
                  public and common open spaces, recreational areas and facilities;
             3.   That the existing and proposed circulation is suitable and adequate to serve the
                  proposed uses;
             4.   That setbacks and distances between buildings meet all of the provisions of
                  Section 14.16.070;
             5.   That the development includes a mixture of housing types and that buildings and
                  structures are clustered to the maximum extent feasible to provide the maximum
                  amount of contiguous open space.
The PUD zone does not have negative impacts on the cost and supply of housing. The zone
encourages and facilitates a mixture of housing types, promotes multi-family residential housing,
and encourages the provision of low- and moderate-income housing.

Design Review Process
Community Design Element. The General Plan Community Design Element identifies citywide
and specific key design characteristics of Carpinteria valued by the community. The Element
includes the following major components:
             •     Citywide Community Design Objectives and Policies;
             •     Town Map identifying the geographical framework of where key physical design
                   components are located;
             •     Key physical community design characteristics objectives and policies; and
             •     Detailed objectives and policies for six sub-areas.
The Community Design Element objectives and policies are intended to guide the quality of future
development that residents would like to continue and preserve.
The Community Design Element furthers the purpose of Coastal Act §30251. That section states
that the scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas shall be considered and protected as a
resource of public importance. Permitted development shall be sited and designed to protect
views to and along the ocean and scenic coastal areas, to minimize the alteration of natural land
forms, to be visually compatible with the character of surrounding areas, and, where feasible, to
restore and enhance visual quality in visually degraded areas. New development in highly scenic
areas such as those designated in the California Coastline Preservation and Recreation Plan
prepared by the State Department of Parks and Recreation and by local government shall be
subordinate to the character of its setting.
Residential projects are evaluated in terms of how they comply with the City’s community design
policies and objectives. The policies and objectives are expressed in narrative policy statements
with specific examples of how applicants can comply with the community design policies and
objectives. For instance, graphic examples are given with respect to mass, scale, color and
materials.
The community design review process is conducted concurrently with the evaluation of project
applications for discretionary permits such as a Development Plan and/or Tentative Parcel Map.
That means applicants do not need to go through a separate design review process. However,
projects are subject to Architectural Review Board review of site plans, building elevations and
landscape plans.
Residential Design Guidelines. Residential design guidelines also have been established for
single-family development in two areas of the city:
               Subarea 1 - Beach Neighborhood is bounded by the Carpinteria Salt Marsh to the
               west, the Union Pacific Railroad to the north, Carpinteria City Beach to the south
               and Linden Avenue to the east.
               Subarea 3 is bounded by Highway 101 on the south and by agricultural lands
               outside the City limits on the west, north and east. The area is composed primarily
               of single-family neighborhoods laid out in a suburban pattern typical of new
               development in the1950s through the 1980s. The guidelines are primarily applicable
               to R-1 zoned properties in the Santa Monica, Canalino and El Carro neighborhoods,
               but may also be used as a tool to assist in evaluating single-family dwellings in other
               residential zone districts.
The design guidelines for these two areas provide more specific guidance than the Zoning Code.
While the Zoning Code sets standards for building height, lot coverage, floor area ratio and

setbacks, these are established as maximums or minimums, and therefore, the guidelines are
intended to be more specific about the appropriate size of a building given its neighborhood
context. The guidelines also identify desired characteristics regarding architectural details, color
and materials, privacy, solar access, landscaping, fencing, lighting and utilities.
The design guidelines help to streamline the development process for new single-family projects
and remodels in these two areas by providing specific direction to homeowners and builders
regarding the design characteristics that are consistent with the policies contained in the General
Plan Community Design Element. The guidelines do not apply to multi-family development, and
therefore do not pose a constraint to affordable housing.
e.      Environmental Review
Environmental review is required for all discretionary development projects under the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Processing time for residential projects is dependent on
whether an environmental impact report (EIR) or Mitigated Negative Declaration or no
environmental document is required. Carpinteria follows the procedures set forth in CEQA and its
guidelines. Environmental protection requirements, including protection of endangered species,
may add time to the development process and additional cost where it is necessary to evaluate
the effects of the project and mitigate adverse impacts.
        3.    Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
a.      Development Fees
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost of
providing the service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and assessments are charged by
the City and other public agencies to cover the costs of processing permit applications and
providing services and facilities such as schools, parks and infrastructure. Almost all of these fees
are assessed through a pro-rata share system, based on the magnitude of the project's impact or
on the extent of the benefit that will be derived. Table III-5 shows fees associated with new
development in Carpinteria. The City periodically adjusts fees based on inflation. The last revision
to the fee schedule occurred in 2011.
The City requires developers to provide onsite and offsite improvements necessary to serve their
projects. Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility extensions, street
construction and traffic control device installation that are reasonably related to the project.
Dedication of land or in lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-of-way, transit
facilities, recreational facilities and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision Map Act.
The City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public improvements,
including street improvements and other public works projects, to facilitate the City’s continued
development according to the City’s General Plan. The CIP helps to ensure that construction of
public improvements is coordinated with private development.
Although development fees and improvement requirements increase the cost of housing, cities
have little choice in establishing such requirements due to the limitations on property taxes and
other revenue sources needed to fund public improvements.

b.    Improvement Requirements
There is no single set of standards pertaining to onsite and offsite improvements. The City’s
neighborhoods differ and so do standards of development that occurred many years ago. Also,
most of the development in the City is on infill sites with infrastructure already in place such as
streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks and street lights. Site improvements will occur in conjunction
with the development of individual parcels and tracts. Through the processing of a development
application, various City departments, special districts and utility companies review the residential
development for conformity with development standards.
Streets and Circulation Improvements
The City has established standard right-of-way (ROW) cross sections for each street and
highway. Local streets, which are designed to serve individual subdivisions and neighborhoods
within residential areas, have the following standards: non-through, 52’ ROW and through 56’
ROW. Collector streets connect local streets to secondary arterial streets. Several residential
neighborhoods may be accessed by a collector street. A residential collector has a 60’ ROW.
With regard to vacant land or underutilized sites, the City’s on/offsite circulation improvement
requirements are established pursuant to an approved development plan for residential projects.
These development plans establish standards in regard to the off-site circulation pattern including
right-of-way dedication, street improvements, traffic control measures and acceleration and
                                                                III-20                                          November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                                   III Constraints
deceleration lanes. The minimum acceptable Level of Service at intersections is “LOS C”. Level
of Service C is defined as, “Stable flow but speed and maneuverability restricted to higher traffic
volumes, satisfactory operating speeds for urban conditions.”
Curb, Gutter and Sidewalk Requirements
Standards for type, width and construction specifications for curb, gutters, cross gutters and
sidewalks are based on those of the County of Santa Barbara, Department of Public Works,
Transportation Division. Essentially, for new developments, curbs, gutters and sidewalks must be
installed. In already developed areas, the standard is to match current neighborhood
infrastructure and design standards.
Water and Sewer Connections
The Carpinteria Valley Water District regulates the onsite and offsite water improvements.
According to its rules and regulations, the District will furnish and install service pipe of suitable
capacity from its water mains to the curb line of the property abutting a public street. All piping
and appurtenances inside the curb or property line must be installed by the customer at the
customer’s sole cost and expense. The piping installed by the customer must conform to the
specifications and requirements of the District, which can vary due to the unique characteristics of
individual lots and the land use intensity.
The Carpinteria Sanitary District regulates the onsite and offsite sewer improvements for property
owners desiring sewer service for new construction, second units and additions. New connections
and construction require a permit from the District. The District maintains a set of standards for
building sewers as well as main and lateral sewers. A building sewer is the pipeline that connects
to the District’s sewer main. The building sewer, cleanout and point-of-connection to the District
lateral are the responsibility of the property owner. The District is responsible for main sewers and
lateral sewers within the public right of way.
B. Non-Governmental Constraints
       1.    Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones, floodplains
or sensitive biological habitat. In many cases, development of these areas is constrained by state
and federal laws (e.g., FEMA flood hazard regulations, the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species
Act, Coastal Act, State Fish and Game Code and Alquist-Priolo Act). The City’s General
Plan/Local Coastal Program has been designed to protect sensitive areas from development, and
to protect public safety. Although many portions of the city are affected by such environmental
conditions, the estimated capacity of potential housing development sites identified in the land
inventory reflects these constraints.
       2.    Infrastructure Constraints
a.     Water Supply
The Carpinteria Valley Water District (CVWD) provides the domestic water supply for the City.
Water is distributed throughout the City by a line and storage system. The CVWD has a supply of
approximately 2,800 acre-feet of water per year for the Carpinteria Planning Area from Lake
                                                 III-21                               November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                                  III Constraints
Cachuma. The District also operates three wells that draw from the Carpinteria groundwater
basin, which has a safe yield of about 5,000 acre-feet per year. In addition, about 2,000 acre-feet
per year have been allocated to the CVWD from the State Water Project. This allocation has not
yet been used by the District and is currently held as a reserve supply. These supplies are
sufficient to accommodate the level of new housing development anticipated during the 2015-
2023 planning period.
b.     Wastewater Treatment
The Carpinteria Sanitary District (CSD) manages wastewater collection and treatment services in
the City. In this capacity, the CSD is responsible for maintenance of the collection system and
treatment plant, as well as disposal of treated wastewater. Sewage generated in the City is
conveyed through district lines to the treatment facility located at 5300 Sixth Street.
The treatment plant has a current permitted capacity of 2.0 million gallons per day (mgd). The
plant currently treats about 1.5 mgd of sewage; therefore, available capacity can accommodate
the level of development anticipated during the 2015-2023 planning period.
       3.   Land Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing, particularly in
high-cost areas along the coast. Land values fluctuate with market conditions, and the downturn
in the housing market following the 2008 mortgage crisis had a negative effect on property
values. Real estate professionals have reported that sales and property values are now
recovering, however. Per-unit land cost is generally affected by density – higher density allows
the cost to be spread across more units, reducing the total price. Because Carpinteria is nearly
built-out there are very few sales of vacant residential parcels each year. When sales do occur,
prices can vary widely depending on location and other site factors. The City’s land use plan and
zoning regulations identify appropriate areas for higher-density housing in order to help mitigate
the constraint of high land cost in coastal areas.
       4.   Construction Costs
Residential construction costs vary widely depending on the type of construction, building size
and amenities. Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor, development
standards and general market conditions. Residential building cost can range from $150/square
foot for basic construction to over $400/square foot for high-end homes. The City has no
influence over materials and labor costs, and the building codes and development standards in
Carpinteria are similar to those in other cities in the area.
       5.   Cost and Availability of Financing
Carpinteria is similar to other communities in California with regard to private sector home
financing programs. The recent crisis in the mortgage industry has affected the availability of real
estate loans, although the long-term effects are uncertain. For buyers with excellent credit
histories, mortgages can be obtained at very favorable interest rates but lending standards for
families with average credit have become much more difficult.
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire
neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in the area
                                                   III-22                            November 10, 2014

Carpinteria 2015-2023 Housing Element Technical Report                                  III Constraints
(“redlining”). In monitoring new construction sales, re-sales of existing homes and permits for
remodeling, the City has not seen any indications that redlining is practiced in any area of the city.
C. Fair Housing
State law prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property transactions. The
City addresses fair housing issues through coordination with fair housing organizations to process
complaints regarding housing discrimination and to provide counseling in landlord/tenant
disputes. Anti-discrimination resource materials (e.g., handouts, booklets and pamphlets) are
made available to the public at City Hall, at other public buildings and on the City’s website.

Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the effectiveness of
the existing Housing Element, the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies, and the
progress in implementing programs for the previous planning period. This appendix contains a
review of the housing goals, policies and programs of the previous housing element and
evaluates the degree to which these programs have been implemented during the previous
planning period. The findings from this evaluation have been instrumental in determining the
City’s 2015-2023 Housing Action Plan.
Table A-1 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Housing Element along with the
source of funding, program objectives and accomplishments.
Table A-2 summarizes residential development that has occurred during the 2007-2013 period.
Units completed on or after January 1, 2014 are discussed in Appendix B and are credited toward
the RHNA for the fifth cycle planning period.
Table A-3 presents the City’s progress in meeting the quantified objectives from the previous
Housing Element.

                                                    Appendix B
                                             Residential Land Inventory
State law requires the Housing Element to include an inventory of vacant or underutilized sites
with the potential for residential development during the planning period. The assumptions and
methodology for estimating potential residential development capacity are discussed below. The
fifth cycle RHNA projection period began January 1, 2014. Therefore, units completed after that
date are credited toward the City’s RHNA allocation for the 2015 – 2023 period.
1.        Density and Affordability Assumptions
The land inventory analysis reflects realistic site capacity based on known constraints such as
easements or environmental conditions. Completed units and units approved for construction are
assigned to affordability categories based on the actual or estimated price or rent (see Table I-12
in Chapter I), while sites zoned for residential development are assigned to income categories
based on allowable density. Under state law, 10 the lower-income “default density” for Carpinteria
is 20 units/acre, which means that sites allowing a density at or above that level are assumed to
be appropriate for lower-income housing. Sites allowing a density of at least 10 units/acre are
considered suitable for moderate-income units, and sites with densities below 10 units/acre are
assigned to the above-moderate category.
2.        Residential Sites Inventory
The City’s inventory of residential sites is summarized in Table B-1. This table demonstrates that
the City’s sites inventory can accommodate the RHNA allocation for the 2015-2023 planning
period in all income categories. The detailed inventory of sites is shown in Tables B-2 and B-3.

                                        Public Participation Summary
Public participation is an important component of the planning process in Carpinteria, and this update to
the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties numerous opportunities for
involvement. Public notices of all workshops and hearings were distributed in advance of each meeting,
and posted on the City’s website. Notice of the draft Housing Element was also circulated to housing
advocates and nonprofit organizations representing the interests of lower-income persons and special
needs groups. After receiving comments on the draft Housing Element from the State Housing and
Community Development Department, a proposed final Housing Element was prepared and made
available for public review prior to adoption by the City Council.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this Housing Element
update.

Comment                                                 Response
How can the City encourage production of second units?  The City will review potential revisions to development standards that
                                                        could encourage construction of additional second units as part of the
                                                        comprehensive Zoning Code update process.
How are vacation units treated under the RHNA?          The RHNA addresses total housing units regardless of whether they are
                                                        for permanent or part-time occupancy.
