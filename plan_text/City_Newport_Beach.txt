Introduction
Consistent with state law, the Land Use Element provides guidance regarding the ultimate pattern of
development for Newport Beach at build-out. As such, it is based on and correlates the policies from
all elements into a set of coherent development policies, which serve as the central organizing element
for the General Plan as a whole. Policies for the conservation of natural resources and protection of
residents and businesses from the risks of hazards are reflected in the distribution and densities of uses.

The quantity and location of uses are linked to the City’s objectives for economic development, jobs
generation, and fiscal balance, as well as intentions for urban form and community character. Their
capacities are, in turn, correlated with the provision of adequate housing and services to meet the needs
of its resident population and transportation, parking, and utility infrastructure that support residents,
employees, and visitors. Implicitly, the Land Use Element serves as the final arbiter on how the City of
Newport Beach shall evolve and mature over the next 20 years. Its policies are directly correlated and
supported by those in all other General Plan elements.
Cumulatively, the Land Use Element’s policies directly affect the establishment and maintenance of the
neighborhoods, districts, corridors, and open spaces that distinguish and contribute to Newport
Beach’s livability, vitality, and image. Policies for the development of individual parcels are inseparable
from those that address how they will fit together to create places that are valued by the City’s
residents—safe and attractive neighborhoods, walkable and active commercial districts, and hillsides,

beaches, water, and open spaces that provide recreation and respite from an active lifestyle.
As Newport Beach is almost fully developed, the Land Use Element focuses on how population and
employment growth can be accommodated and still preserve its distinguishing and valued qualities. It
recognizes that most of the City will be conserved with its existing pattern of uses and establishes
policies for their protection and long term maintenance. It recognizes that there are limited areas of the
City that are not achieving their full potential and establishes strategies for their enhancement and
revitalization. It also recognizes the evolving needs of the marketplace and considerable pressures for
population growth in the region and proposes creative strategies for the re-use of land to provide
opportunities for new housing that will complement and enhance Newport Beach’s character and

livability.
These strategies are carefully considered in context of community objectives for the provision of an
efficient transportation system that minimizes congestion for residents, employees, and visitors. At the
same time, it recognizes the needs to balance mobility objectives with priorities of Newport Beach’s
residents for the character of its neighborhoods and commercial districts and corridors.
Our Starting Point—Newport Beach’s Existing Land Uses
Newport Beach has a unique physical setting with many visual, recreational, and environmental
resources that has influenced the type and form of land uses within the community. The majority of the
community is fully developed with a diverse mixture of residential, institutional, commercial, industrial,
and recreational and open space uses.
Residential uses represent the largest portion of land uses within the City, characterized by many
distinct neighborhoods. Older communities were first developed along the coast line including the
Peninsula, West Newport, Balboa Island, and Lido Isle. This early housing is characterized by a
diversity of multi-family, single-family and mixed-use housing located within proximity of commercial
and visitors serving uses. As development spread further inland and proceeded north and east, the
residential pattern changed, becoming more suburban in character and characterized by single-family
ranch-style homes on larger lots. While single-family attached and detached homes comprise the
majority of housing in the community, the City contains many multi-family homes including
condominiums, apartments, duplex, triplex, and fourplex units. These are located in older
neighborhoods along the beaches including West Newport, Balboa Peninsula, Balboa Island, and
Corona del Mar as well as in the northern portions of the community such as Bonita Canyon Village,
and Newport Center. Mobile homes are found along Coast Highway in West Newport, west of
Newport Dunes and near the Newport Pier.
A variety of retail uses are located throughout Newport Beach including neighborhood shopping
centers, commercial strips and villages, and shopping centers. The largest retail center in the City is
Fashion Island, a regional attraction that is framed by a mixture of office, entertainment, and residential
uses. Newport Beach also has many neighborhood shopping centers that service nearby residential
neighborhoods with convenience goods. Many of the older commercial villages located along the coast
and harbor include specialty shops, entertainment, and marine uses that serve nearby residents and
visitors. These retail villages are located within Balboa Island, Balboa Village, Cannery Village,
McFadden Square, and Corona del Mar.
Much of the City’s office space is located in Newport Center and the Airport Area. Newport Center is
an area of both high- and low-rise offices surrounding the Fashion Island retail area. The Airport Area
encompasses the properties abutting and east of John Wayne Airport (JWA) and is in close proximity to
the Irvine Business Complex and University of California, Irvine. This area includes a mixture of low-,
medium-, and high-rise office uses as well as research and development and high technology businesses.
Industrial uses are primarily located within the West Newport Mesa area east of Banning Ranch. A
variety of industrial, manufacturing, and supporting retail uses are located within this area. Research and
development uses are clustered in the Airport Area. Government, educational and institutional uses
include the City Hall, schools, libraries, museums, and religious uses.

The City has approximately 278 acres of developed parks. Newport Beach’s parklands range in size
from mini-parks such as the Lower Bay Park to the 39-acre Bonita Canyon Sports Park. Additionally,
bikeways, jogging trails, pedestrian trails, recreation trails, and regional equestrian trails are also available
in Newport Beach. Numerous open space areas are located within the community, including water
front areas such as beaches, Newport Bay, and Newport Harbor. There are also numerous undeveloped
areas supporting natural habitats and sensitive biological resources including Banning Ranch, Irvine
Coast Marine Life Refuge, Coyote Canyon, Bonita Canyon Creek Watershed, Upper Newport Bay State
Marine Park (formally Ecological Reserve) and Upper Newport Bay Nature Preserve. Other resources
include the City’s many undeveloped canyons and hillsides located primarily in the Newport Coast area.

                      Table LU1, are specified on the Land Use Plan, Figure LU4 through
                      Figure LU15. These are intended to convey maximum and, in some cases,
                      minimums that may be permitted on any parcel within the designation or as
                      otherwise specified by Table LU2 (Anomaly Locations).
                      The density/intensity ranges are calculated based on actual land area, actual
                      number of dwelling units in fully developed residential areas, and development
                      potential in areas where the General Plan allows additional development.
                      To determine the permissible development, the user should:
                      a. Identify the parcel and the applicable land use designation on the Land Use
                         Plan, Figure LU4 through Figure LU15
                      b. Refer to Figure LU4 through Figure LU15 and Table LU1 to identify the
                         permitted uses and permitted density or intensity or amount of development
                         for the land use classification. Where densities/intensities are applicable, the
                         maximum amount of development shall be determined by multiplying the area
                         of the parcel by the density/intensity.
                      c. For anomalies identified on the Land Use Map by a symbol, refer to
                         Table LU2 to determine the precise development limits.
                      d. For residential development in the Airport Area., refer to the policies
                         prescribed by the Land Use Element that define how development may occur.

  Community Character (“Maintaining the Character of Our Neighborhoods and
  Districts”)
Goals and policies provide for the maintenance and enhancement of Newport Beach’s residential
neighborhoods, commercial districts, employment centers, corridors, and open spaces, assuring that
new development complements and reinforces these characteristics. In addition to those listed below,
community design policies are defined in LU 6.0 to reflect the specific community character objectives
for a number of the City’s districts and corridors.
Residential Neighborhoods
  Goal
LU 5.1
Residential neighborhoods that are well-planned and designed contribute to the livability and quality of
life of residents, respect the natural environmental setting, and sustain the qualities of place that
differentiate Newport Beach as a special place in the Southern California region.
          Policies
        ALL NEIGHBORHOODS
        LU 5.1.1      Compatible but Diverse Development
                      Establish property development regulations for residential projects to create
                      compatible and high-quality development that contributes to neighborhood
                      character. (Imp 2.1)
        LU 5.1.2      Compatible Interfaces
                      Require that the height of development in nonresidential and higher-density
                      residential areas transition as it nears lower-density residential areas to minimize
                      conflicts at the interface between the different types of development. (Imp 2.1)
        LU 5.1.3      Neighborhood Identification
                      Encourage and support the identification of distinct residential neighborhoods.

      LU 5.1.5        Character and Quality of Single-Family Residential Dwellings
                      Require that residential units be designed to sustain the high level of architectural
                      design quality that characterizes Newport Beach’s neighborhoods in consideration
                      of the following principles:
                      Articulation and modulation of building masses and elevations to avoid the
                            appearance of “box-like” buildings
                      Compatibility with neighborhood development in density, scale, and street facing
                            elevations
                      Architectural treatment of all elevations visible from public places
                      Entries and windows on street facing elevations to visually “open” the house to
                            the neighborhood
                      Orientation to desirable sunlight and views (Imp 2.1)

                      entries, landscaping, parkways, and minimization of driveway paving.
      LU 5.1.6        Character and Quality of Residential Properties
                      Require that residential front setbacks and other areas visible from the public
                      street be attractively landscaped, trash containers enclosed, and driveway and
                      parking paving minimized. (Imp 2.1)
      LU 5.1.7        Renovation and Replacement of Existing Residential Units
                      Require that residential units that are renovated and rebuilt in existing single-
                      family neighborhoods adhere to the principles for new developments, as specified
                      by Policy 5.1.5 above. Consider the appropriateness of establishing single-family
                      residential design guidelines and/or standards and review procedures for
                      neighborhoods impacted by significant changes in building scale and character.
                      (Imp 2.1, 8.2)
      LU 5.1.8        Parking Adequacy
                      Require that new and renovated single-family residences incorporate adequate
                      enclosed parking in consideration of its number of bedrooms. (Imp 2.1)

             Require that multi-family dwellings be designed to convey a high quality
             architectural character in accordance with the following principles (other than the
             Newport Center and Airport Area, which are guided by Goals 6.14 and 6.15,
             respectively, specific to those areas):
             Building Elevations
             Treatment of the elevations of buildings facing public streets and pedestrian ways
                   as the principal façades with respect to architectural treatment to achieve the
                   highest level of urban design and neighborhood quality
             Architectural treatment of building elevations and modulation of mass to convey
                   the character of separate living units or clusters of living units, avoiding the
                   appearance of a singular building volume
             Provide street- and path-facing elevations with high-quality doors, windows,
                   moldings, metalwork, and finishes
             Illustrates multi-family residential infill townhomes, rowhouses, and apartments. Modulation of building volume and heights,
             articulated elevations, and orientation of residential units to the street.
             Ground Floor Treatment
             Where multi-family residential is developed on large parcels such as the Airport
             Area and West Newport Mesa:
             Set ground-floor residential uses back from the sidewalk or from the right-of-way,
                   whichever yields the greater setback to provide privacy and a sense of security
                   and to leave room for stoops, porches and landscaping
                                                                     Newport Beach General Plan                                  3-53

Land Use Element
                      Raise ground-floor residential uses above the sidewalk for privacy and security but
                            not so much that pedestrians face blank walls or look into utility or parking
                            spaces
                      Encourage stoops and porches for ground-floor residential units facing public
                            streets and pedestrian ways
                      Where multi-family residential is developed on small parcels, such as the Balboa
                            Peninsula, the unit may be located directly along the sidewalk frontage and
                            entries should be setback or elevated to ensure adequate security (as shown
                            below).
                      Illustrates multi-family residential with lobbies and entry gates located on each street and pedestrian-way frontage.
                      Roof Design
                      Modulate roof profiles to reduce the apparent scale of large structures and to
                            provide visual interest and variety.
                      Parking
                      Design covered and enclosed parking areas to be integral with the architecture of
                            the residential units’ architecture.
                      Open Space and Amenity

Mixed-Use Districts and Neighborhoods
 Goal
LU 5.3
Districts where residents and businesses are intermixed that are designed and planned to ensure
compatibility among the uses, that they are highly livable for residents, and are of high quality design
reflecting the traditions of Newport Beach.
          Policies
         LU 5.3.1       Mixed-Use Buildings
                        Require that mixed-use buildings be designed to convey a high level of
                        architectural and landscape quality and ensure compatibility among their uses in
                        consideration of the following principles:
                        Design and incorporation of building materials and features to avoid conflicts
                           among uses, such as noise, vibration, lighting, odors, and similar impacts

Residential Neighborhoods
Newport Beach is a community of distinct residential communities formed by the natural landscape
and the built environment. Many of the City’s older communities are located near the coast, and are
characterized by small lots and the close grouping of structures. Newer residential communities, located
east of the bay, have been built according to specific regulations to encourage their individual
characters.
Residential neighborhoods first began to develop on the Peninsula, West Newport, Balboa Island, and
Lido Isle. These early neighborhoods following a traditional subdivision pattern of homes on streets
designed in a linear grid and are generally pedestrian-oriented and include alleyways. Some of these
older residential areas are within close proximity of commercial and visitors serving uses and are
impacted by limited parking, noise, and traffic generated by commercial and visitor activities.
When development spread further inland and proceeded north and east, the residential pattern
changed, becoming less traditional, and more suburban in character with curvilinear streets and ranch
style homes on larger lots. Examples of this type of development are the Westcliff community and Cliff
Haven. As residential expanded across the bay and to the east, new styles such as attached town homes
and gated communities were constructed. The Bluffs and Big Canyon communities illustrate this type
of development.

Land Use Element
More recent residential development patterns have resulted in numerous distinct neighborhoods with a
single builder constructing most or all of the homes. Many of the these communities were designed as
master planned communities allowing for unique and specialized development standards, as opposed to
the application of traditional, standardized zoning regulations. Examples include Bonita Canyon,
Newport Ridge, and Newport Coast.
There are approximately 125 homeowners associations in Newport Beach. These associations govern
the maintenance of common areas and the administration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions
(CC&Rs). Many of these associations are active in the City’s decision-making process and may have
unique development standards that are not enforced by the City.
Newport Beach includes a variety of residential neighborhoods
As the community has approached build-out, little vacant land remains. New development has focused
on nontraditional sites such as infill and mixed-use development on smaller vacant and underutilized
sites in or near commercial areas.
Other residential development issues in the community include the replacement of original single-
family homes, duplexes, and triplexes with larger homes. Many of these homes are built to the full limit
of the City’s development regulations in neighborhoods where many houses are much smaller in scale.
The policy framework for neighborhoods is geared toward strengthening and expanding the framework
of healthy, cohesive, and identifiable neighborhoods throughout the City.

Districts
Districts are uniquely identifiable by their common functional role, mix of uses, density/intensity,
physical form and character, and/or environmental setting. Generally, they encompass large areas that
often extend equally in length and breadth. They represent common gathering places for commerce,
employment, entertainment, culture, and for living.
While Newport Beach contains many districts, the General Plan policies in the following sections focus
on those that are likely to change over the next 20 years as existing viable districts are enhanced,
underperforming properties are revitalized, and opportunities are provided to accommodate the City’s
fair share of regional housing needs, as shown on Figure LU16. Policies are directed to the management
of these changes to ensure that they complement the characteristics that are valued by Newport Beach’s
residents.
Development in each district will adhere to policies for land use type and density/intensity (Policy
LU 4.1, Table LU1) and community character (LU 5.0), except as amended in this section of the Plan.
The goals and policies for each district are preceded by a description of its uses and characteristics in
2005 and public input from the General Plan Update Visioning Process and Public Workshops that was
considered in their formulation.
Banning Ranch
Located within the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI), the Banning Ranch area encompasses
approximately 518 acres, of which 465 acres (includes 47 acres of water features) are under the
jurisdiction of Orange County, and 53 acres within the jurisdiction of the City of Newport Beach.

                                                                                   Land Use Element
Banning Ranch is located in the western-most portion of the Newport Beach Planning Area, north of
Coast Highway and the Newport Shores residential community, immediately east of the Santa Ana
River, and west and south of residential and industrial uses. The eastern portion of the site is higher in
elevation and contains the western edge of Newport Mesa that slopes gently from east to west. Bluffs
form the western edge of the mesa, and are located in the central portion of the Banning Ranch area.
The western portion of the site, which is lower in elevation, historically contained a tidal marsh
associated with the Semeniuk Slough and Santa Ana River.
Aerial view of the Banning Ranch area
Currently, the Banning Ranch area is primarily undeveloped with some historic oil extraction
infrastructure located in the central and southern portions of the site that includes wells, pipelines,
buildings, improved and unimproved roads, and open storage pipes and machinery. Oil extraction
activities date back at least 75 years.
Although the Banning Ranch site contains an assemblage of diverse habitats that have been historically
disturbed, when this area is considered with the contiguous Semeniuk Slough and restored wetlands, it
provides wildlife with a significantly large, diverse area for foraging, shelter, and movement. Biological
studies performed for Banning Ranch indicate that, while disturbance associated with oil activities
diminishes the quality of existing habitat to some extent, overall, the area should be regarded as
relatively high-quality wildlife habitat due to its size, habitat diversity, and continuity with the adjacent
Semeniuk Slough and federally-restored wetlands.
A preliminary field evaluation of Banning Ranch was conducted by a consultant as a general indicator
of the presence of habitat and species that may be subject to regulatory review. Based on this analysis,
the property is estimated to contain approximately 69 acres with a habitat value rank of “1,” which are
primarily concentrated in the northwestern portion of the site. These areas are considered to have a
high biological resource value, and are likely to require a resource permit from federal and/or state
agencies prior to development. Other areas scattered throughout the site may also be of biological value
but to a lesser extent. Areas with a rank of “2” (approximately 96 acres) may need a resource permit for
development, where additional studies would be required to make this determination. More than likely,
areas with a rank of “3” (approximately 118 acres) contain habitat and species that are not likely to
require resource permitting for development. Resource permitting would likely result in the need for
mitigation measures associated with development such as payment of mitigation fees, habitat
restoration, or off-site habitat replacement. The actual acreage subject to environmental permitting will
be determined in subsequent studies to be conducted in accordance with state and federal regulations.

Additionally, Banning Ranch exhibits distinctive topography that is a physical and visual resource for
the community. The property is divided into lowland and highland mesa areas. Bluff faces traverse the
property generally in a north-south direction, separating these and forming an important visual
backdrop from West Coast Highway. Drainage from upland areas in and adjoining the City of Costa
Mesa formed a number of arroyos with riparian habitats. The bluff face geology is highly erodible and
has experienced sliding over the years. Figure LU17 illustrates these constraints.
During the visioning process, residents were divided in opinion regarding the future of Banning Ranch.
Many residents preferred preserving Banning Ranch as open space at the beginning of the public
process. However, many participants in the process later indicated their willingness to support some
development of the property if it would generate revenue to help fund preservation of the majority of
the property as open space.
 Policy Overview
 The General Plan prioritizes the acquisition of Banning Ranch as an open space amenity for the
 community and region. Oil operations would be consolidated, wetlands restored, nature education
 and interpretative facilities provided, and an active park developed containing playfields and other
 facilities to serve residents of adjoining neighborhoods.
 Should the property not be fully acquired as open space, the Plan provides for the development of a
 concentrated mixed-use residential village that retains the majority of the property as open space.
 This would contain a mix of housing types clustered around a “village center” of local-serving
 commercial uses, small boutique hotel, active park, and possibly a school. Buildings would be located
 and designed and an interconnected street system provided to enhance pedestrian activity and reduce
 vehicular trips. Development would be concentrated to preserve the majority of the property as open
 space, while oil operations would be clustered and wetlands restored. An internal trail system would
 be developed to link uses within its neighborhoods and districts and provide access to adjoining
 neighborhoods. While the Plan indicates the maximum intensity of development that would be
 allowed on the property, this will ultimately by determined through permitting processes that are
 required to satisfy state and federal environmental regulatory requirements.

West Newport Mesa
The West Newport Mesa area contains a mix of residential, office, retail, industrial, and public uses. It is
immediately abutted by Hoag Hospital, the City of Costa Mesa to the north, and Banning Ranch to the
west. Development in the area dates back to the mid-twentieth century.
Hoag Hospital is a major activity center that continues to affect development in the area. It generates a
strong market for the development of uses that support the hospital’s medical activities such as doctors’
offices, convalescent and care facilities, medical supply, pharmacy, and similar uses. Retail commercial
uses serve medical purposes, as well as nearby residents.
Northern portions of the area are largely developed with light manufacturing, research and
development, and business park uses. In many respects, these transition with comparable patterns of

development in the Westside Costa Mesa area to the north. A number of Newport Beach’s marine-
related businesses have relocated to the area over recent decades as coastal land values have escalated.
Most of the properties are developed for single business tenants and have little landscape or
architectural treatment, typical of older industrial districts of Southern California.
Office and commercial buildings in West Newport Mesa
The majority of properties between the industrial uses and medical center are developed with multi-
family uses, including a few mobile home parks. The latter represent a resource of affordable housing in
the City. These are interspersed with a school and other civic uses.
The area’s considerable mix of uses is not always complementary, nor at its edges where it abuts
residential neighborhoods and other uses.
Visioning process participants indicated that the West Newport Mesa area would benefit from
revitalization. The development of additional medical offices and other facilities supporting Hoag
Hospital and additional residential units were widely endorsed. Participants were divided in their
support for the retention of industrial uses.

Land Use Element
 Policy Overview
 The General Plan provides for a mix of land uses for West Newport Mesa that include office,
 research, convalescent care, and retail facilities supporting Hoag Hospital, a consolidated light
 industrial district where non-water-dependent marine-related businesses would be encouraged to
 locate, enhanced housing opportunities, and supporting retail commercial services. While distinct
 sub-districts are defined by the Land Use Plan, the assembly and planning of multiple parcels across
 these districts to create a unified center that is linked by pedestrian walkways, parklands, and other
 amenities is encouraged.
 Goal
LU 6.6
A medical district with peripheral medical services and research facilities that support the Hoag

Lido Village
Lido Village is primarily developed with commercial uses including grocery stores, restaurants, salons,
home furnishings, apparel, and other specialty shops. It also includes Lido Marina Village, a pedestrian-
oriented waterfront development that includes visitor-serving commercial uses, specialty stores, and
marine uses. Lido Village’s southern edge contains specialty retail and restaurants, the Civic Center, and
churches.
Lido Marina Village has experienced a high number of building vacancies and many retail stores are
underperforming. Parking is limited. Multiple property ownerships have traditionally inhibited cohesive
and integrated development.
Lido Village has a unique location at the turning basin in Newport Harbor. The channel is wider than in
other locations, providing an opportunity for waterfront commercial uses that will not negatively
impact residential uses across the channel.

Cannery Village
Cannery Village is the historic center of the City’s commercial fishing and boating industry and contains
a mix of small shops, art galleries, professional offices, and service establishments. Marine-related
commercial (boat sales) and marine-related industrial uses (boat repair) are also found in the area.
Redevelopment of properties for residential, loft, and mixed residential and commercial uses, including
live/work facilities, appears to be an emerging trend. Older developments include some single-family
residential units combined with commercial uses on single lots. Although the residential component of
mixed-use projects has performed well, there has been less success in attracting the commercial uses
envisioned for the area particularly on the waterfront.

A Specific Plan has been developed, but multiple property ownerships have hindered cohesive and

McFadden Square
McFadden Square surrounds the Newport Pier and extends between the ocean front and harbor. It was
the center of the City’s early shipping industry. Located adjacent to Newport Pier is the Dory Fishing
Fleet. The fleet and open-air fish market have operated at this location since the fleet’s founding in
1891 by Portuguese fishermen. The last remaining fleet of its type, it is a designated historical landmark.
Commercial land uses are largely concentrated in the strips along Balboa and Newport Boulevards, with
residential along the ocean front and marine-related uses fronting the harbor. Numerous visitor-serving
uses include restaurants, beach hotels, tourist-oriented shops (t-shirt shops, bike rentals, and surf
shops), as well as service operations and facilities that serve the Peninsula. There are several bars in the
area with some featuring live music, especially along the ocean front. Historically, the area has been
known for its marine-related industries such as shipbuilding and repair facilities and boat storage on the
harbor, some of which have been in continuous operation for over fifty years. Public parking is
available in three lots, which primarily serve the beach users, tourists, and the restaurant patrons.
Retail use in McFadden Square                          Residential in McFadden Square
Much of the McFadden Square area is pedestrian-oriented, with storefronts facing the street, the
presence of signage at a pedestrian scale, and outdoor furniture, providing a pleasant environment for

visitors. However, certain areas present difficulty for pedestrian street crossing. Specifically the
intersection of Newport and Balboa Boulevards, known as the “Mixmaster,” is one such crossing, as
the roadway configuration at this location allows traffic flow from different directions and the street is
wide.
Balboa Village
Balboa Village is the historic center for recreational and social activities on the Peninsula. It has had a
strong marine heritage, and has attracted fishermen, recreational boaters, summer residents, and
beachgoers. Many of the retail uses are visitor-oriented and seasonal in nature, including a “fun zone”
along Edgewater Place that contains entertainment uses. Marine-related commercial uses, including
ferries to Balboa and Catalina Islands and harbor tours, are present in the area. In general, Balboa
Village is pedestrian-oriented with articulated building façades and signage that is pedestrian scale. The
Balboa Village core is surrounded by residences, with isolated pockets of commercial uses scattered
along Balboa Boulevard. Peninsula Park also serves the area.
Balboa Village and the greater Peninsula have experienced a transition to year-round residential
occupancy while the visitor uses have continued. Cumulatively, there is more commercial space than
can be supported by local residents, and marginal commercial space is used by businesses that are
seasonal and do not thrive throughout the year.
Visitor-serving retail in Balboa Village             Housing in Balboa Village
A specific plan has guided development in Balboa Village (“Central Balboa”) since 1997. The Plan’s
vision consisted of aesthetic improvements such as landscaping, pedestrian amenities, and design
standards. It addressed property maintenance standards, parking district implementation, and
circulation improvements. Additionally, it sought to establish a “family marine recreation theme,”
upgrade the Fun Zone, and improve the quality and mix of commercial tenants. The City has
implemented some of this vision with a number of public improvements within the last few years,
which include the addition of street furniture, lighting, landscaping, widened sidewalks, and decorative
paving.
Participants in the Visioning process indicated that Lido Village, Cannery Village, McFadden Square,
and Balboa Village need continuing revitalization, and the City could be proactive in creating a vision
for reinforcement of Lido Village and McFadden Square as primary activity nodes, with the interior of
Cannery Village allocated for residential or mixed-use development. The integration of uses in these
areas and the harbor and bay was emphasized. While overnight lodging was not supported in the

smaller bed and breakfast and boutique hotels could be designed and scaled to complement the
pedestrian-oriented village character of Lido Village, McFadden Square, and Balboa Village, as well as
help the City’s fiscal balance through the revenue that would be contributed.
The public also supported the concentration of commercial uses in the core of Balboa Village, with the
re-use of outlying commercial properties for housing and priority for water-oriented and visitor-serving
commercial uses. Additionally, Balboa Village was identified as a suitable location for mixed-use
development.
 Policy Overview
 The General Plan provides for the enhancement of Lido Village, Cannery Village, McFadden Square,
 and Balboa Village as distinct pedestrian-oriented centers of Balboa Peninsula that would be
 interconnected through improved streetscapes along Newport/Balboa Boulevard, a waterfront
 promenade on Newport Harbor, and cross-access between the Harbor and beachfront. Lido Village,
 McFadden Square, and Balboa Village would contain a mix of visitor-serving, retail, small overnight
 accommodation facilities, and housing. In Cannery Village, commercial or mixed-use buildings would
 be developed at street intersections with intervening parcels developed for mixed-use or free-
 standing housing. Throughout the Peninsula, priority is established for the retention of marine-
 related uses.

Newport Center/Fashion Island
Newport Center/Fashion Island is a regional center of business and commerce that includes major
retail, professional office, entertainment, recreation, and residential in a master planned mixed-use
development. Fashion Island, a regional shopping center, forms the nucleus of Newport Center, and is
framed by this mixture of office, entertainment, and residential. Newport Center Drive, a ring road that
surrounds Fashion Island, connects to a number of interior roadways that provide access to the various
sites within the Center and to the four major arterials that service this development. High-rise office
and hotel buildings to the north of the Center form a visual background for lower rise buildings and
uses to the south and west.
Interspersed in the Newport Center area are two hotels, public and semi-public uses including the
Newport Beach Police and Fire Departments and Orange County Museum of Art, and entertainment
uses (along the perimeter of Newport Center Drive). It is also the location of a transportation center,
located at San Joaquin Hills Road and MacArthur Boulevard. Multi-family residential is located east of
the Police Department. Lands adjacent to Coast Highway and Jamboree Road are developed for the
Newport Beach Country Club and Balboa Bay Tennis Club, with adjoining single-family attached
residential uses.

Newport Center commercial, office, hotel, and residential
While master planned, the principal districts of Newport Center/Fashion Island are separated from one
another by the primary arterial corridors. Fashion Island is developed around an internal pedestrian
network and surrounded by parking lots, providing little or no connectivity to adjoining office,
entertainment, or residential areas. The latter also contain internal pedestrian circulation networks
surrounded by parking and are disconnected from adjoining districts.
Early in the Visioning process a majority of residents and businesses supported little or no change to
Newport Center, except for new hotels. However, some supported growth for existing companies,
expansion of existing stores, and moderate increases for new businesses. Some participants favored
mixed-use development and stressed the need for more affordable housing in particular. During
development of the General Plan, public input reflected moderate to strong support for the expansion
of retail and entertainment uses in Fashion Island, including the development of another retail anchor.
 Policy Overview
 The General Plan provides for additional retail opportunities at Fashion Island and hotel rooms and
 housing units in Newport Center. Office development would be limited to the expansion of existing
 rather than new buildings. Emphasis is placed on the improvement of the area’s pedestrian character,
 by improving connectivity among the “superblocks,” installing streetscape amenities, and
 concentrating buildings along Newport Center Drive and pedestrian walkways and public spaces.

LU 6.14.7 Fashion Island Architecture and Streetscapes
          Encourage that new development in Fashion Island complement and be of
          equivalent or higher design quality than existing buildings. Reinforce the existing
          promenades by encouraging retail expansion that enhances the storefront
          visibility to the promenades and provides an enjoyable retail and pedestrian
          experience. Additionally, new buildings shall be located on axes connecting

Airport Area
The Airport Area encompasses the properties abutting and east of (JWA) and is in close proximity to
the Irvine Business Complex and University of California, Irvine (UCI). This proximity has influenced
the area’s development with uses that support JWA and UCI, such as research and development, high
technology industrial and visitor-serving uses, such as hotel and car rental agencies. A mix of low-,
medium-, and high-rise office buildings predominate, with lesser coverage of supporting multi-tenant
commercial, financial, and service uses. A number of buildings are occupied by corporate offices for
industry and financial uses. Koll Center, at MacArthur Boulevard and Jamboree Road, was developed
as a master planned campus office park. Manufacturing uses occupy a small percentage of the Airport
Area. Three large hotels have been developed to take advantage of their proximity to JWA, local
businesses, and those in the nearby Irvine Business Complex.
The area immediately abutting JWA, referred to as the “Campus Tract,” contain a diverse mix of low
intensity industrial, office, and airport-related uses, including a number of auto-related commercial uses
including carwash, auto-detailing, rental, repair, and parts shops. In comparison to properties to the
east, this area is underutilized and less attractive.
Office in Airport Area                                  Hotel in Airport Area
Development in the Airport Area is restricted due to the noise impacts of JWA. Much of the
southwestern portion of the area is located in the 65 dBA CNEL, which is unsuitable for residential
and other “noise-sensitive” uses. Additionally, building heights are restricted for aviation safety.
Recent development activity in the City of Irvine’s Business Complex to the north has included the
transfer of development rights, bringing more intense development closer to the Airport Area and
resulting in the conversion of office to residential entitlement. This activity is changing the area to a
mixed-use center.
Through the Visioning process and preparation of the General Plan, the public preferred revitalization
of the Airport Area with income-generating land uses. Generally, a range of development types were
acceptable as long as traffic is not adversely affected. However, a majority believed that the Airport
Area is urban in character, different than other City neighborhoods. Additional density and traffic
congestion were considered more acceptable here than other parts of the City. There was strong
support for new hotels and broad consensus on mixed-use development with residential and revenue-
generating uses.

 Policy Overview
 The General Plan provides for the development of office, industrial, retail, and airport-related
 businesses in the Airport Area, as well as the opportunity for housing and supporting services. The
 latter would be developed as clusters of residential villages centering on neighborhood parks and
 interconnected by pedestrian walkways. These would contain a mix of housing types and buildings
 that integrate housing with ground-level convenience retail uses and would be developed at a
 sufficient scale to achieve a “complete” neighborhood. Housing and mixed-use buildings would be
 restricted from areas exposed to noise levels of 65 dBA CNEL and higher. Over time, commercial
 and industrial properties located in the Campus Tract would be revitalized including street frontage
 landscape and other improvements.

On-Site Recreation and Open Space
LU 6.15.16 Standards
           Require developers of multi-family residential developments on parcels 8 acres or

           44 square feet of on-site recreational amenities shall be provided for each dwelling
           unit in addition to the requirements under the City’s Park Dedication Ordinance
           and in accordance with the Parks and Recreation Element of the General Plan.
           On-site recreational amenities can consist of public urban plazas or squares where
           there is the capability for recreation and outdoor activity. These recreational
           amenities may also include swimming pools, exercise facilities, tennis courts, and
           basketball courts. Where there is insufficient land to provide on-site recreational
           amenities, the developer shall be required to pay cash in-lieu that would be used

LU 6.15.23 Sustainable Development Practices
           Require that development achieves a high level of environmental sustainability
           that reduces pollution and consumption of energy, water, and natural resources.
           This may be accomplished through the mix and density of uses, building location
           and design, transportation modes, and other techniques. Among the strategies
           that should be considered are the integration of residential with jobs-generating
           uses, use of alternative transportation modes, maximized walkability, use of
           recycled materials, capture and re-use of storm water on-site, water conserving
           fixtures and landscapes, and architectural elements that reduce heat gain and loss.

Corridors
Corridors share common characteristics of Districts by their identifiable functional role, land use mix,
density/intensity, physical form and character, and/or environmental setting. They differ in their linear
configuration, generally with shallow-depth parcels located along arterial streets. They are significantly
impacted by traffic, often inhibiting access during peak travel periods. Their shallow depths make them
unsuitable for many contemporary forms of commercial development that require large building
footprints and extensive parking.
While the City is crossed by a number of commercial corridors, the General Plan’s policies focus on
those in which change is anticipated to occur during the next 20 years. Additionally, they provide
guidance for the maintenance of a number of corridors in which it is the objective to maintain existing
types and levels of development.
Development in each corridor will adhere to policies for land use type and density/intensity (LU 4.1,
Table LU1) and community character (LU 5.0), except as specified in this section of the Plan.
 Goal
LU 6.16
Development along arterial corridors that is compatible with adjoining residential neighborhoods and
open spaces, is well designed and attractive, minimizes traffic impacts, and provides adequate parking.

West Newport
The West Newport Coast Highway Corridor extends from Summit Street to just past 60th Street. It is a
mixed commercial and residential area, with the former serving the adjoining Newport Shores
residential neighborhood, the West Newport residential neighborhood south of Coast Highway, and
beach visitors. Commercial uses are concentrated on the north side of Coast Highway at the Orange
Street intersection and east of Cedar Street to the Semeniuk Slough. Intervening areas are developed
with a mix of multi-family apartments and, west of Grant Avenue, mobile and manufactured homes.

Land Use Element
Primary commercial uses include community-related retail such as dry cleaners, liquor store, deli, and
convenience stores, as well as a few visitor-serving motels, dine-in, family-style restaurants, and fast-
food establishments. Generally, they are developed on shallow parcels of substandard size and
configuration due to past widening of West Coast Highway and contain insufficient parking. Many of
the commercial buildings appear to have been constructed in the 1960s to 1980s, although some motels
have been recently upgraded.
A portion of the mobile homes are situated along Semeniuk Slough and the Army Corps restored
wetlands, while a number of the single-family homes outside the area are also located along the Slough.
A mobile home park containing older units, many of which appear to be poorly maintained, is located
on the westernmost parcels and a portion of the tidelands. This site serves as the “entry” to the City
and as a portal to the proposed Orange Coast River Park.
This area is regulated by an adopted Specific Plan, which was intended to promote its orderly
development and provide service commercial uses for nearby residences.
Residential in West Newport                          Commercial in West Newport
The visioning process found that the West Newport Corridor is among those that require revitalization.
Clustering of commercial uses to enhance their economic vitality and improve the appearance of the
area was supported, as was the improvement of the quality of commercial development on the
Highway. Redevelopment of the westernmost parcel occupied by a trailer park was a high priority for
the neighborhood.
 Policy Overview
 The General Plan provides for the improvement of Coast Highway fronting properties in West
 Newport by concentrating local and visitor-serving retail in two centers at Prospect Street and
 Orange Street with expanded parking, enhancing existing and allowing additional housing on
 intervening parcels, and developing a clearly defined entry at its western edge with Huntington
 Beach. The latter may include improvements that would support the proposed Orange Coast River
 Park.

Office and retail on Old Newport Boulevard
The corridor is abutted by residential neighborhoods to the east and Hoag Hospital west of Newport
Boulevard. Today, the area is primarily developed with commercial and professional offices. Secondary
uses include personal services, restaurants, and specialty shopping such as home furnishing stores and
beauty salons. Most specialty retail appears to occupy converted residential buildings. A number of
auto-related businesses and service facilities are located in the corridor. Many of these are incompatible
with the predominant pattern of retail service and office uses. Medical office uses have expanded
considerably during recent years, due to the corridor’s proximity to Hoag Hospital, which is expanding
its buildings and facilities.
This corridor does not exhibit a pedestrian-oriented character. While there are some walkable areas,
Newport Boulevard is wide and there is a mix of uses and lot configurations that do not create a
consistent walkway.
Development in the area is guided by the Old Newport Boulevard Specific Plan District that includes
design guidelines and development standards providing for the orderly development of property.

Little public input was received pertaining to Old Newport Boulevard during the General Plan’s
preparation. In general, the preservation of the status quo was supported. Although, the public
supported the development of mixed-use buildings that integrate residential with ground floor retail
and townhomes on the east side of Old Newport Boulevard as a transition with adjoining residential
neighborhoods.
 Policy Overview
 In the Old Newport Boulevard area, the General Plan provides for the development of professional
 offices, retail, and other uses that support Hoag Hospital, and retail uses serving adjoining residential
 neighborhoods. Pedestrian walkways within and connections west to Hoag Hospital would be
 improved and streetscapes installed.

Mariners’ Mile
Mariners’ Mile is a heavily traveled segment of Coast Highway extending from the Arches Bridge on
the west to Dover Drive on the east. It is developed with a mix of highway-oriented retail and marine-
related commercial uses. The latter are primarily concentrated on bay-fronting properties and include
boat sales and storage, sailing schools, marinas, visitor-serving restaurants, and comparable uses. A large
site is developed with the Balboa Bay Club and Resort, a hotel, private club, and apartments located on
City tidelands. A number of properties contain nonmarine commercial uses, offices, and a multi-story
residential building.
Harbor, retail, and visitor-serving uses in Mariners’ Mile
Inland properties are developed predominantly for highway-oriented retail, neighborhood commercial
services. A number of sites contain automobile dealerships and service facilities and neighborhood-
serving commercial uses. The latter includes salons, restaurants, apparel, and other specialty shops
ranging from wine stores to home furnishings stores. While single use free-standing buildings
predominate, there are a significant number of multi-tenant buildings that combine a number of related
or complementary uses in a single building or buildings that are connected physically or through design.
The Mariners’ Mile Strategic Vision and Design Plan provides for the area’s evolution as a series of
districts serving visitors and local residents. Along the northern portion of Coast Highway in the
vicinity of Tustin Avenue, Riverside Avenue, and Avon Street, it provides for a pedestrian-friendly
retail district. In the western and easternmost segments, the Plan provides for the infill of the auto-

oriented retail and visitor-serving commercial uses. Along the Harbor frontage, the Vision and Design
Plan emphasizes the development of Harbor-related uses and proposes a continuous pedestrian
promenade to create a vibrant public waterfront. Throughout the corridor, the Plan proposes to
upgrade its visual character with new landscaping and streetscape amenities, as well as improvements in
private development through standards for architecture and lighting.
Plans provide for the widening of Coast Highway, reducing the depth of parcels along its length.
Recent development projects have set back their buildings in anticipation of this change. Traffic along
the corridor and the potential for widening also impact the ability to enhance pedestrian activity and
streetscape improvements, unless overhead pedestrian crossings are considered.
Visioning process participants identified Mariners’ Mile as a location that needs revitalization and
suggested that an overall vision be defined to meet this objective. It was also defined as a location
appropriate for mixed-use development integrating residential and commercial or office space. A
majority opposed hotel development in Mariners’ Mile. Participants were divided on the questions of
preserving opportunities for coastal-related uses in Mariners’ Mile and whether the City should require
or offer incentives to ensure such uses. Property owners noted that high land values and rents limit the
number of marine-related uses that can be economically sustained in the area. Although the public
supported the development of residential in Mariners’ Mile, there was a difference of opinion regarding
whether it should be located on the Harbor frontage or limited it to inland parcels.
 Policy Overview
 The General Plan provides for the enhanced vitality of the Mariners’ Mile corridor by establishing a
 series of distinct retail, mixed-use, and visitor-serving centers. Harbor-fronting properties would
 accommodate a mix of visitor-serving retail and marine-related businesses, with portions of the
 properties available for housing and mixed-use structures. View and public access corridors from
 Coast Highway to the Harbor would be required, with a pedestrian promenade developed along the
 length of the Harbor frontage. Parcels on the inland side of Coast Highway, generally between
 Riverside Avenue and the southerly projection of Irvine Avenue, would evolve as a pedestrian-
 oriented mixed-use “village” containing retail businesses, offices, services, and housing. Sidewalks
 would be improved with landscape and other amenities to foster pedestrian activity. Inland
 properties directly fronting onto Coast Highway and those to the east and west of the village would
 provide for retail, marine-related, and office uses. Streetscape amenities are proposed for the length
 of Mariners’ Mile to improve its appearance and identity.
 Goal
LU 6.19
A corridor that reflects and takes advantage of its location on the Newport Bay waterfront, supports
and respects adjacent residential neighborhoods and exhibits a quality visual image for travelers on
Coast Highway.

          Clustering of buildings to provide open view and access corridors to the Harbor
          Modulation of building volume and masses
          Variation of building heights
          Inclusion of porticoes, arcades, windows, and other “see-through” elements in

the area’s primary uses are restaurants, home furnishings, and miscellaneous apparel and professional
offices including architectural design services. Almost half of the commercial uses are located in multi-
tenant buildings with retail on the ground floor and professional services above. Other uses include the
Sherman Library and Gardens, a research library and botanical garden open to the public, and an
assisted-living residential complex.
Buildings in the Corona del Mar corridor mostly front directly on and visually open to the sidewalks,
with few driveways or parking lots to break the continuity of the “building wall” along the street. These,
coupled with improved streetscape amenities, landscaped medians, and a limited number of signalized
crosswalks, promote a high level of pedestrian activity.
Views of Corona del Mar along Pacific Coast Highway
The Corona del Mar Vision Plan, developed by the Business Improvement District, is intended to
enhance the shopping district through community improvements. These envision a linear park-like
environment with extensive sidewalk landscaping, street furniture, pedestrian-oriented lighting fixtures,
activated crosswalks, parking lanes, and comparable improvements.
Visioning process participants expressed support for protecting Corona del Mar as an important
historic commercial center that serves adjoining neighborhoods.
  Policy Overview
  The General Plan sustains Corona del Mar as a pedestrian-oriented retail village that serves
  surrounding neighborhoods. New development largely would occur as replacement of existing uses
  and developed at comparable building heights and scale. Additional parking would be provided by
  the re-use of parcels at the rear of commercial properties and/or in shared parking lots or structures
  developed on Coast Highway.

Introduction
Newport Bay, including the Upper Bay and Newport Harbor in the Lower Bay, is a vital component
of Newport Beach’s natural resources, community identity, and economy. Some aspects of the
Harbor and Bay Element that address public access, water quality and the environment and
administration are also covered in the Natural Resources, Recreation, Safety and Circulation
Elements. These overlapping policies or goals are noted within each Element. In addition, some land
use policies relating to the waterfront uses along Lower Bay and Newport Harbor are also discussed
in the Land Use Element.
Over the decades, public and private initiatives have enhanced and improved the natural resources of
the Lower Bay to create what is today a world class small craft harbor. The natural and manmade
resources of the Bay were once home to an economy that saw commercial fishing, fish canning, and
industrial shipbuilding coexist with recreational boaters, restaurants, and waterfront homes. Today,
fish canning and shipbuilding industrial uses are gone, while a wide range of recreational boating
activities such as sport fishing, kayaking, diving, wind surfing, sailboat racing, excursion and
entertainment boat activities, as well as visitor serving commercial and recreational uses and
waterfront residences, are the main land uses located along the harbor. These different users of coastal
lands and the water can lead to competing interests and demands, which are magnified by rising land
values and a changing economic climate. Several issues presently face the harbor and bay areas. These
include the following:
    ■ Economic pressures to replace marine uses and harbor support facilities and services with
       residential uses.

                                                                     Harbor and Bay Element
    ■ Balancing access to and benefits of marine uses such as recreational boating activities and
       marine commercial uses with associated impacts such as noise, traffic, parking, and disturbances
       to sensitive environmental resources and habitats.
    ■ Increasing demand to accommodate larger vessels in the harbor, leaving limited affordable
       berthing and dry storage options for smaller boats and vessels.
    ■ Need to improve administration of Harbor Resources
    ■ Difficulty in obtaining permits to perform routine maintenance dredging.
    ■ Seasonal presence of large population of California Sea Lions, causing noise, pollution, property
       damage, and odors.

Goals and Policies
The goals and policies pertaining to harbor issues are intended to guide the content of regulations
related to development of, and the activities conducted on, the water. Additional goals and policies
recognize the important component of land use decisions related to waterfront property around
Newport Harbor. The aim of the Harbor and Bay Element goals and policies are to preserve the
diversity and charm of existing uses without unduly restricting the rights of the waterfront property
owner. Goals and policies within the Harbor and Bay Element have been organized to address both
water and land related issues, provision of public access, water quality and environmental issues, visual
characteristics, and the administration of the Harbor and Bay.
 Diversity of Land Uses
 Goal
HB 1
Preservation of the diverse uses of the Harbor and the waterfront that contribute to the charm and
character of Newport Bay, and that provide needed support for recreational boaters, visitors, and
residents.

CHAPTER 5 Housing Elemen
Housing Element
      HOUSING ELEMENT
               A Balanced Residential Community
               Providing Opportunities for All Social
                           and Economic Segments
Executive Summary
The City of Newport Beach’s Housing Element details the City’s strategy for enhancing and
preserving the community’s character, identifies strategies for expanding housing opportunities and
services for all household types and income groups, and provides the primary policy guidance for
local decision-making related to housing. The Housing Element provides in-depth analysis of the
City’s population, economic, and housing stock characteristics as well as a comprehensive evaluation
of programs and regulations related to housing. Through this evaluation and analysis, the City has
identified priority goals, polices, and programs that directly address the housing needs of current and
future City residents.
The City completed a comprehensive update of its General Plan in 2006. Through the General Plan
update process, several key areas in the City were identified as ideal locations for future housing
opportunities. Key sites for future development include the Airport Area, Newport Center, Banning
Ranch, Newport Mesa and the Balboa Peninsula area. The comprehensive Zoning Code Update,
completed in October, 2010, implements many of the land use changes included in the 2006 General
Plan update.
The 2014–2021 Housing Element is an update and revision of the 2008-2014 Housing Element and
consists of new technical data and updated policies and programs. The land use opportunity areas
developed as part of the 2006 General Plan update have remained the same. This Housing Element
also addresses meeting the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for the projection period of
January 1, 2014, through October 31, 2021, and is consistent with recent revisions to State Housing
Element Law.
PURPOSE AND STATUTORY AUTHORITY
The Housing Element is mandated by Sections 65580 to 65589 of the Government Code. State
Housing Element law requires that each city and county identify and analyze existing and projected
housing needs within its jurisdiction and prepare goals, policies, programs, and quantified objectives
to further the development, improvement, and preservation of housing. To that end, State law
requires that the housing element:
   5-2   Newport Beach General Plan

                                                                                                Housing Element
        Identify adequate sites to facilitate and encourage the development, maintenance and improvement of
        housing for households of all economic levels, including persons with disabilities; Remove, as legally
        feasible and appropriate, governmental constraints to the production, maintenance, and improvement
        of housing for persons of all income levels including persons with disabilities; Assist in the development
        of adequate housing to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income households; Conserve and
        improve the condition of housing and neighborhoods, including existing affordable housing; Promote
        housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex, marital status, ancestry, national
        origin, color, familial status, or disability; and Preserve for lower income households the publicly
        assisted multi-family housing developments within each community.
California state law requires that Housing Elements be updated periodically to evaluate: 1) the
appropriateness of the housing goals, policies, and programs in contributing to the attainment of the
state housing goal; 2) the effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community's
housing goals and objectives; and 3) the progress of the City in implementation of the Housing
Element. The City of Newport Beach has prepared this updated Housing Element in compliance with
State law with the established October 2013, deadline for jurisdictions within the Southern California
Association of Governments region and addresses all statutory requirements and regulations.
The City has accepted and is committed to providing sites to accommodate its 2014–2021 RHNA
allocation of five housing units. The City is also committed to pursuing the preservation and/or
replacement of 153 existing assisted rental units that are at risk of conversion to market-rate rents
during this planning period. Achieving the RHNA units and replacement of at-risk units is expected
through the future redevelopment of several key housing opportunity areas identified in the General
Plan, opportunities created by implementation of the 2008-2014 Housing Element Policies,
implementation of existing Affordable Housing Implementation Plans, and financial assistance
through the Affordable Housing Fund. The City Council has also established an Affordable Housing
Task Force that works with developers and landowners to facilitate the development of affordable
units, the preservation of at-risk units, and determines the most appropriate use of in-lieu fee funds.
The Task Force and staff continually investigate and research potential new affordable housing
opportunities.
CONSTRAINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
The City is constrained in its effort to provide new housing opportunities due to many factors beyond
its control. However, this General Plan Housing Element update provides several opportunities to
create new residential uses through infill development and reuse of existing land uses. Furthermore,
policies that have been implemented from the 2008-2014 Housing Element Update have removed
previously identified constraints on the development of housing affordable to lower-income
households within the Airport Area facilitating these opportunities.
FOCUS OF HOUSING PROGRAMS
Following are the housing programs that Newport Beach believes will be the most effective in
meeting the City’s housing goals. These programs will be the focus of the City’s housing efforts
during the period of this Housing Element.
    1. Actively promote the development of affordable housing through in-fill development and assist
       developers with the removal of site constraints.
                                                                 Newport Beach General Plan                         5-3

Housing Element
    2. Research sites and developments that could include affordable housing, such as infill, mixed-use
       and redevelopment opportunities.
    3. Discuss the extension of affordability covenants with owners of existing affordable apartments.
    4. Offer incentives to developers of affordable housing, including density bonuses, fee waivers,
       expedited permit processing, and the use of the Affordable Housing Fund.
    5. Promote the development of senior accessory dwelling units.
    6. Continue to support housing and special needs services providers through the use of
       Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and General Funds.
TIME PERIOD COVERED BY THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The Housing Element covers the RHNA allocation period of January 1, 2014, through October 31,
2021.
Introduction
The City completed a comprehensive General Plan update that was adopted by the City Council on
July 25, 2006. In November 2006, the General Plan was placed on the electoral ballot and approved
by the voters.
The California Government Code specifies the Legislature’s intent to ensure that counties and cities
are active participants in attaining the state housing goal and establishes specific components to be
contained in a housing element. These components include the following: identification and analysis
of existing and projected housing needs, resources and constraints; a statement of goals, policies,
quantified objectives, and scheduled programs for preservation, improvement and development of
housing; identification of adequate sites for housing; and adequate provision for existing and
projected needs of all economic segments of the community.
The Newport Beach Housing Element has been written in a consistent and mutually dependent
relationship with other Elements of its General Plan. Furthermore, the Element is in conformance
with Government Code Sections 65580–65589.
The updated Housing Element is a comprehensive statement of the City’s housing policies and serves
as a specific guide for implementation of these policies. The Element examines current housing needs,
estimates future housing needs, and establishes goals, policies, and programs pertaining to those
needs. Housing programs are responsive to current and future needs. They are also established within
the context of available community, state, and federal economic and social resources, and realistic
quantified housing objectives. State housing goals are as follows:
    ■ Availability of housing is of vital statewide importance. Early attainment of decent housing and
       a suitable living environment for every California family is a priority of the highest order.
    ■ Early attainment of this goal requires cooperative participation of government with the private
       sector to expand housing opportunities and accommodate housing needs of Californians of all
       economic levels.
    ■ Provision of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households requires cooperation
       among all levels of government.

                                                                                Housing Element
    ■ Local and state governments have a responsibility to use powers vested in them to facilitate
      improvement and development of housing to make adequate provision for housing needs of all
      economic segments of the community.
    ■ The Legislature recognizes in carrying out this responsibility, each local government also has a
      responsibility to consider economic, environmental, and fiscal factors, and community goals set
      forth in its general plan. Cities must cooperate with other local governments and the state in
      addressing regional housing needs.
The City of Newport Beach has prepared this Housing Element in compliance with the established
deadline for jurisdictions within the Southern California Association of Governments region. The
Housing Element covers the RHNA allocation period of January 1, 2014, through October 31, 2021.

Housing Element
   ■ Housing Goals and Policies, Quantified Objectives, and Programs
       This section has three primary functions: 1) to establish City housing goals and policies; 2) to
       quantify the maximum number of housing units that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and
       conserved over the 8-year period between 2014 to 2021; and 3) to present City housing
       programs, which represent a schedule of actions to be implemented by the City to achieve
       goals, policies, and quantified objectives of the Housing Element. Government Code
       Section 65588 requires review of the Housing Element as frequently as appropriate and to
       evaluate the effectiveness of housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to attainment
       of the State housing goal. Additionally, the City is required to evaluate the effectiveness of the
       Housing Element in attainment of community goals and objectives and its progress in
       implementation of its housing goals. This section provides the required review and evaluation
       of the 2008-2014 Housing Element.
REVIEW AND UPDATE OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The City of Newport Beach will review this Housing Element annually as part of its General Plan
review to evaluate appropriateness of objectives, effectiveness of programs, and progress in
implementation. The Housing Element will be revised again in 2021 in accordance with State law.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
General Plan Update
Opportunities for residents to recommend strategies for, and review and comment on the Newport
Beach Housing Element were an important component of the 2006 General Plan update, including
the Housing Element. The General plan update was the first comprehensive revision of the City’s
General Plan in more than 30 years and was the result of more than 4 years of work by the 38-
member citizens General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC), City staff, technical consultants,
Planning Commission, City Council as well as input by thousands of residents that were received
during the most extensive public outreach and visioning campaign in the City’s history. In November
2006, the General Plan was placed on the electoral ballot and approved by 54 percent to 46 percent,
validating that the General Plan reflected what residents indicated during the outreach process.
Opportunities for residents to recommend strategies, review, and comment upon housing issues and
discuss new opportunities for housing were an important component of the update. The Housing
Element reflects the vision and principles for future land use and housing development that were
developed as part of the General Plan process.
As part of the General Plan update, the Housing Element was updated and adopted in 2010 to reflect
new land use changes and updated demographics. In November 2011, HCD found the 2008-2014
Housing Element Update in compliance with State Housing Element Law and it was adopted by City
Council on November 22, 2011.

Public Workshops
As part of development of the 2014–2021 Housing Element, two specialized workshops were held.
The first workshop was held on November 14, 2012, soliciting input from members of the
community and other housing stakeholders regarding the City’s needs, constraints, and goals related
to housing. Workshop participants identified the need for more affordable rental units in the City due
to rising rental costs and the need for increased senior housing opportunities to respond to the
growing senior population in the City. Participants also expressed a desire to see more mixed-use
developments that provide housing opportunities closer to amenities and services. In anticipation of a
second workshop, the Draft Housing Element was made available for public review on March 15,
2013. Notice of the documents availability were provided to all persons on the City’s housing interest
list and to persons enrolled in the City’s e-mail notification system for planning and land use related
items. Notice was also provided on the City’s website. The second workshop was subsequently held
on March 27, 2013, to formally present the Draft Housing Element Update to the public, share
findings with regard to changes in housing data, and explain revised policies for public review and
discussion. Throughout the process, workshop attendees were asked to comment on the existing
needs and issues as well as provide feedback for the development of new housing programs.
Invitations to both workshops were distributed to service providers, housing stakeholders, and
developers and a notice of the workshop was advertised in the Daily Pilot. In addition, workshop
notices were included in the Kennedy Commission (local nonprofit housing organization) newsletters
that are sent via e-mail to a wide variety of housing stakeholders in the Orange County area. Staff also
presented an update to the Corona del Mar Chamber of Commerce Government Affairs Committee
to engage the local real estate community.
Public Meetings
Public meetings on the Housing Element update were conducted before the Planning Commission on
April 18, 2013, and the City Council on May 14, 2013. All City meetings were open to the public. The
City provided citizens with advanced notice of the public meeting and made copies of all related
materials available for public review. Notice of the public meeting was published in the Daily Pilot
newspaper at least 10 days prior to the meeting date. In addition, notices were also provided to those
on the City’s Housing Interest list, including service providers, developers, community stakeholders,
and participants to prior Housing Element workshops. The Draft Housing Element was also
presented to the Affordable Housing Task Force, a City committee comprised of three City Council
members, on April 25, 2013, during a noticed public meeting.
Public Review and Comments
Throughout the Housing Element update process, the City has posted Draft Housing Element
documents and presentation materials on the website to facilitate the review by residents and
interested parties. Hard copies of the Draft Housing Element were also made available at the
Planning Division Counter. Where feasible, comments provided at the two housing workshops,
during the public review period of the Housing Element and at the Planning Commission and City
Council hearings were incorporated into the April 2013 draft of the Housing Element. The most
significant revisions (discussed in more detail throughout the Housing Element) include:

           that are set to expire.
      ■ An expanded discussion related to the options and costs associated with the replacement and
           preservation of at-risk units.
      ■ Updates to the City’s existing and projected housing conditions and needs.
      ■ Programs have been revised and added within the Housing Plan as necessary to reflect
           changed circumstances.

HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
Residential Growth and Dwelling Unit Types
Between 1990 and 2012, 9,883 housing units were constructed and/or annexed, and added to the City
of Newport Beach housing inventory (refer to Table H1). Between 2006 and 2012, an average of 311
housing units per year were added to the housing stock. However, 2011 and 2012 saw a significant
reduction in housing unit production with 13 units per year. It should be noted that the significant
increase in units in 2009 is attributable to the annexation of West Santa Ana Heights.

Residential Densities
As shown in Table H3, residential densities in many older neighborhoods in the City of Newport
Beach range from 12 to more than 22 units an acre, according to City figures that were estimated by
dividing residential acreage by current dwelling unit counts.
In addition, many attached housing projects in the City were developed to maximize land usage.
Existing attached projects in the City and their densities are listed in Table H4.

Housing Tenure
The tenure distribution (owner-occupied versus renter-occupied) of a community's housing stock
influences several aspects of the local housing market. Residential mobility is influenced by tenure,
with ownership housing evidencing a much lower turnover rate than rental housing. The tenure of
housing in Newport Beach in 2010 was comprised of 45 percent renter households and 55 percent
owner-occupied households and as shown in Table H5:

Since 1960, (when only 36 percent of all occupied units were rented) the percentage of rental housing
increased due to a sizeable amount of new rental construction. New construction subsided
substantially in the 1980s. Table H7 lists the major rental projects in Newport Beach.
In addition, the City contains many rented duplex, triplex, and fourplex units. Areas where this type of
rental housing is predominant include West Newport, Balboa Peninsula, Balboa Island, and Corona
del Mar. One of the most recent new multi-family rental projects in the City is the Bayview Landing
project. This affordable housing project provides 120 units for very low– and low-income seniors.

Condominium Conversion Ordinance
In the mid-1990s, the City of Newport Beach adopted a new ordinance to ease restrictions on
condominium conversions. Easing restrictions on condominium conversions was intended to
promote the availability of first-time home buyer opportunities and to promote the rehabilitation and
preservation of smaller, more affordable housing units. Many rental units in certain areas of the
community were overcrowded and deteriorating due to absentee owners and the renting of units on a
weekly basis. Health and safety issues were also a concern given quality of life impacts resulting from
excessive noise, pollution, and traffic in areas where weekly vacation rentals were prevalent. In 2005,
the City became concerned that severe parking inadequacies of older apartment buildings were being

perpetuated through condominium conversions, and adopted ordinances restricting condominium
conversions to structures that provide the code required parking at the time of the conversion. Under
these ordinances, duplexes, and multi-family properties that are nonconforming by way of parking
cannot be converted to condominiums. These regulations have slowed the rate of condominium
conversions in the City.
The total number of units affected by condominium conversions approved since 1995 is 411 units.
Table H8 identifies the number of conversions each year between 1995 and 2012.

Vacancy Rates
A vacancy rate is often a good indicator of how effectively for-sale and rental units are meeting the
current demand for housing in a community. Vacancy rates of 5 to 6 percent for rental housing and 1
to 2 percent for ownership housing are generally considered optimum, where there is balance between
the demand and supply for housing. A higher vacancy rate may indicate an excess supply of units and
therefore price depreciation, while a low vacancy rate may indicate a shortage of units and resulting
escalation of housing prices. The overall housing unit vacancy rate of the City of Newport Beach has
varied between 1990 and 2010, as fluctuations have occurred in the housing market. The available
data for all vacant units categorized by the type of housing stock is from the 2010 Census. It indicated
that the vacancy rate for rental units was approximately 3 percent versus 1 percent for ownership
                                                                     Newport Beach General Plan          5-13

housing (Table H9). It also indicates that the overall vacancy rate in the community has increased to
12.3 percent in 2010. The discrepancy between overall vacancy rates and vacancy rates among
available units may be due to the large number of seasonal units and second homes in Newport
Beach. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, 2,841 of 5,442 (52.2%) vacant units were identified as
“seasonal use.”

To assist in administration of its condominium conversion ordinance, the City has conducted rental
vacancy surveys since 1979. This survey only includes vacancies for the larger apartment complexes in
the City, not for other homes that may be used as rentals. Results of the most recent surveys are
provided on Table H10. As shown in 2012, the vacancy rate for apartment units was 5.05 percent.

Housing Condition
There has not been a comprehensive survey of housing conditions in Newport Beach since the 1976
Special Census for Newport Beach. That survey indicated only 1.3 percent of all housing units were
deficient. Three neighborhoods in the city contained concentrations of substandard housing. Of all
housing units on Balboa Peninsula, 5.1 percent were in substandard condition, while 2.5 percent and
2.6 percent of all units on Balboa Island and in Newport Heights, respectively, were in substandard
condition. Deficient units in this regard are defined as deteriorated, dilapidated units, as well as those
units inadequate in original construction, or which were under extensive repair.
The lack of complete plumbing or kitchen facilities serves as a narrow indicator of substandard
housing conditions. Only a small number of homes in Newport Beach lacked these basic utilities in
2010. The 2006-2010 American Community Survey Estimates reported that 94 units had incomplete
plumbing and 174 units were without a complete kitchen. However, it is possible that many of these
units are illegal dwelling units resulting from the unpermitted conversion of garages or splitting of
living space. It is the consensus of City staff that the condition of legal housing units in Newport
Beach is considered to be very good. Extremely high property values and the very limited number of
code enforcement cases indicate that property owners within Newport Beach are, for the most part,
conscientious about maintaining their properties. Substandard housing does not appear to be a
problem for the community at this point in time.

Illegal Dwelling Units
Illegal or “bootleg” dwelling units have historically been a problem in Newport Beach, experienced
most often in the older, beach-oriented areas of West Newport, Balboa Peninsula, Balboa Island, and
Corona del Mar. These units are found in two typical forms: the “splitting” of a single dwelling unit
into two separate occupancies, and the conversion of garages to living space. These units usually have
a higher number of health and safety code violations than legal units, due to conversion without
proper building permits and inspections.
Illegal units continue to be a problem today, but are less prevalent than in the past, due to increased
year-round owner occupancy in these areas, and inspections which occur when properties are sold.
While it is difficult to estimate the number of illegal units, code enforcement personnel estimate that
as much as 2 percent of the City’s housing stock may be in the form of illegal units. While not
considered safe and adequate housing, these units do provide living arrangements that tend to be
more affordable than legal units.
Mobile Homes
As described later, mobile homes generally provide more affordable housing opportunities for
residents. There are presently 933 mobile home spaces in ten mobile home parks in Newport Beach
(Table H11).
Many of these units are occupied by permanent residents and some are used by households that use
the unit for vacations or weekend visits to the area. The character of the City’s ten mobile home parks
varies. Three of the parks are located on or close to Newport Harbor. These three parks appeal to
retirees and a substantial number of spaces in these parks are occupied by permanent residents. It
should be noted that mobile homes in Cannery Village and some in West Newport have been
replaced with manufactured housing that is not affordable to low-income and moderate-income
individuals and families.
It should be noted that one mobile home park, the Beach and Bay Mobile Home Park at 7204 W.
Coast Highway, appears to be in substantial physical decline and could be subject to redevelopment or
replacement within this planning period.
Both the Marina Park Mobile Home Park and the Seacliffe Mobile Home Park were approved for
closure in 2006. Pursuant to California law, a Closure Impact Report was prepared for both parks that
assessed the impact of the park’s closure on tenants. The Report provided numerous options to
tenants for relocation assistance, including payment of reasonable costs to relocate the mobile homes,
payment to purchase the homes, and payment of relocation expenses.
The Marina Park Mobile Home Park has been owned and operated by the City of Newport Beach
since 1919 and is located on tidelands. Residential use is inconsistent with the legal restrictions on the
use of tidelands; therefore, the City is in the process of redeveloping the site with a consistent use that
includes a visitor-serving marina, a community building, a sailing center, a new Girl Scout meeting
house, parking, and a park. The residents of Marina Park entered into a Settlement Agreement with
the City in 2007 that allowed the City to purchase their coaches and lower the rent for the remainder
of the residents’ stay at Marina Park. The project was approved by the California Coastal Commission
on June 13, 2012.

The Seacliffe Mobile Home Park is a privately owned 117 unit Park near the West Newport Industrial
Area. In 2006, the owner decided to move forward to terminate the mobile home park space
tenancies as part of the park closure. The park owner currently owns and rents all 117 mobile units.
At this time, the owner has decided to maintain the operation of the mobile home park. City staff
periodically receives developer interest in the redevelopment of the Seacliffe Mobile Home Park;
however, no formal plans have ever been submitted to the City for consideration.
Assisted Housing Stock
The City has had policies in effect since the mid-1980s requiring the provision of affordable housing
in association with all new residential developments where more than four units are proposed. Most
were provided within new or existing apartment projects. In some cases, an in-lieu fee was assessed.
The City also facilitated the teaming of market rate and affordable housing developers to produce
required affordable housing. Recent projects include the 120-unit Bayview Landing project (2004) that
produced 119 units that are affordable to very low- and low-income senior households and one
managers unit.
Table H12 summarizes the total number of completed affordable units receiving public assistance as
well as regulated affordable housing in private development. Over 375 restricted/assisted affordable
housing units are located within Newport Beach. Newport Beach has facilitated affordable housing

        units and three three-bedroom units are required to remain affordable for a term of 30 years
        for very low-income households. The affordability covenant is set to expire in 2017.
        Newport Seashore Apartments located at 849 West 15th Street. The 15-unit apartment
        development was constructed in 1988 as affordable housing and utilized a density bonus. The
        15 two-bedroom units are required to remain affordable for a term of 30 years to low-income
        households. Maximum rents shall not exceed Section 8 Fair Market Rents with preference
        given to active Section 8 voucher holders. The affordability covenant is set to expire in 2018.
        Pacific Heights Apartments located at 881-887 West 15th Street. The 16-unit apartment
        development was constructed in 1989 utilizing a density bonus. As a result, seven 2-bedroom
        units were required to remain affordable for a term of 30 years to low-income households.
        Maximum rents shall not exceed Section 8 Fair Market Rents with preference given to active
        Section 8 voucher holders. For non-voucher holders, maximum rents shall not exceed 30
        percent of the permitted income level divided by 12. The affordability covenant is set to
        expire in 2019.
        Newport Harbor Apartments located at 1538 Placentia Avenue. The 26-unit apartment
        development was constructed in 1990 utilizing $350,000 in Community Development Block
        Grant funds from the City and a density bonus. As a result, 21 two-bedroom and five three-
        bedroom units are required to remain affordable for a term of 30 years to low-income
        households. Maximum rents shall not exceed Section 8 Fair Market Rents with preference

         Newport Harbor II Apartments located at 1538 Placentia Avenue. The 14-unit apartment
         building was constructed in 1993 utilizing $50,000 in Community Development Block Grant
         funds from the City, $147,576 in-lieu housing fees, and a density bonus. As a result, ten two-
         bedroom units are required to remain affordable to low-income households and four
         efficiency units are required to be affordable to very low-income households for a term of 30
         years. Maximum rents shall not exceed Section 8 Fair Market Rents with preference given to
         active Section 8 voucher holders for the two-bedroom units. The maximum rent for the
         efficiency units shall not exceed 28.5 percent of the permitted annual income level divided by
         12. The affordability covenant is set to expire in 2023.
Replacement and Preservation Costs
Replacement Costs: The construction of new low-income housing can be a means to replace at-risk
units. The cost of developing new housing depends on a variety of factors including density, size of
units, construction quality and type, location, and land cost. Based on the construction cost analysis
included within the Inclusionary Housing Study prepared for the City by Economic & Planning
Systems (EPS) on October 7, 2008, typical development costs for a low-income apartment project is
$338,459 per unit (including land costs). Therefore, it is estimated that the cost of replacing all 155 at-
risk affordable units would be approximately $52.5 million.
Preservation Costs: Currently, availability of funding for Section 8 contract renewal is uncertain.
Under the Section 8 contract program, HUD pays owners the difference between what tenants can
pay (defined as 30 percent of household income) and HUD’s payment standard. Rent subsidies using
state, local, or other funding sources can be used to maintain the affordability of the at-risk projects
and structured to mirror the Section 8 program.
For the purposes of determining the subsidy needed to preserve an at-risk unit, the difference
between the average market rate of monthly rent for a typical studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom
apartment in Newport Beach and the maximum monthly rent that a low-income household can
afford to pay (30 percent of annual income) was calculated. It is assumed that studio (efficiency) units
are occupied by one person, one-bedroom units are occupied by a two-person household, two-
bedroom units are occupied by a four-person household, and three-bedroom units are occupied by a
six-person household. This analysis assumes that low–income households earn below 80 percent of
the County median. Thus, the average income would be $53,950 for a one person household, $61,650
for a two-person household, $77,050 for a four-person household, and 89,400 for a six-person
household according to 2012 HUD/HCD income limits.
As Table H13 shows, given the 153 units contained in the six rental housing projects, whose
affordability may expire in this planning period, the total anticipated subsidy needed to maintain those
units is $723,528 annually or $60,294 monthly.

 a. Affordable rents are calculated as 30% of the maximum annual income limit for low-income households for the County of Orange, divided by 12
    months. A studio (efficient) unit shall be considered occupied by one-person, one-bedroom units occupied by a two-person household, two-
    bedroom units occupied by a four-person household, and three-bedroom units occupied by a six-person household.
 b. Average Market-Rate rent is based on a rental cost survey of apartment units in Newport Beach conducted in 2012. See Table H27.
Resources for Preservation
The types of resources available for preserving at-risk units fall into three categories:
    1. Financial resources available to purchase or subsidize existing units or develop replacement
        units
    2. Entities with the interest and ability to purchase/manage the units at risk
FINANCIAL RESOURCES: The following summarizes financial resources available to the City for
preservation of assisted, multi-family rental housing units.
    ■ Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)—The City is programmed to receive
        approximately $1,750,000 during the next 5 years. This program is intended to enhance and
        preserve the City’s affordable housing stock. CDBG funds are awarded to the City on a formula
        basis for housing activities. Approximately, $200,000 per year in CDBG funds are used to repay
        a 20-year Section 108 loan which was used to provide public facilities improvements projects to
        revitalize the low/moderate-income Balboa Peninsula neighborhoods.
    ■ Affordable Housing Fund—The City has collected in-lieu fees from various development
        projects since 1997, which are deposited into the City’s Affordable Housing Fund. The City is
        also projected to have a fund balance of $4.5 million by fiscal year 2014, from previously
        approved projects subject to the inclusionary ordinance. Because the Fund is a local housing
        resource, the City has a large degree of flexibility for use of the funds. The Affordable Housing
        Fund monies shall be used in compliance with the General Plan Housing Element to construct,
        rehabilitate, or subsidize affordable housing or assist other governmental entities, private
        organizations or individuals to provide or preserve affordable housing. A $135,000 grant from
        the Affordable Housing Fund allocated to Seaview Lutheran Plaza in 2009 is an example of
        how this Fund can successfully be used to preserve at-risk housing in the City. Through this
        grant, 50 very-low income and 50 extremely low-income units were preserved for a period of 30
        years (March 2039).
    ■ Section 202—Provides grant to nonprofit developers for supportive housing for seniors.
        Eligible activities include acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, and rental assistance.
    ■ California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) Multiple Rental Housing Programs—This
        state program provides below market rate financing to builders and developers of multiple-
        family and senior rental housing. Tax exempt bonds provide below market mortgage money.

                                                                                   Housing Element
      Eligible activities include new construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition of properties with 20
      to 150 units.
   ■ Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)—This state program provides tax credits to
      individuals and corporations that invest in low-income rental housing. Tax credits are sold to
      corporations and people with high tax liability and proceeds are used to create housing. Eligible
      activities include new construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition.
   ■ California Community Reinvestment Corporation (CCRC)—This private, nonprofit
      mortgage banking consortium provides long-term debt financing for affordable multi-family
      rental housing. Eligible activities include new construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition.
ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES: An alternative to providing subsidies to private for-profit
owners to maintain units as low-income housing is for public or nonprofit agencies to acquire or
construct housing units to replace “at-risk” units lost to conversion. The City can explore prioritizing
tenants that have lost their unit or rent subsidy in these at-risk buildings for inclusion in new projects
funding by the City. The following housing development corporations are active in developing
affordable housing in Newport Beach and Orange County:
   ■ Related Companies of California has developed and preserved over 6,000 units of housing in
      California. Related Companies of California constructed the affordable Bayview Landing
      project in 2004. In addition to construction, Related Companies of California is also
      experienced with the preservation and management of at-risk properties.
   ■ Jamboree Housing is an active nonprofit housing developer that has constructed over 7,000 new
      affordable senior, family, and special needs housing units throughout California. They also
      preserve existing affordable housing units through acquisition and rehabilitation. Jamboree also
      provides on-site social services with many of its affordable and special needs projects. Jamboree
      Housing has recently developments projects in the cities of Brea, Irvine, and Long Beach.
   ■ National Community Renaissance (National CORE) includes National Community Renaissance of
      California (formerly So Cal Housing), National Housing Development Corporation (formerly
      NHDC), and Hope Through Housing Foundation. Together, the combined nonprofit entity
      now operates over affordable 9,500 apartments in the United States. Programs include
      construction, acquisition, rehabilitation, job education and training, adult education and literacy,
      senior services, and after-school youth programs.
   ■ Olson Company—a local, for-profit developer, the Olson Company is experienced in developing
      multi-family, mixed-use, and affordable work-force housing units. Recent affordable projects
      have occurred in the cities of Pasadena, Cerritos and Fullerton.
   ■ The Irvine Company—one of the largest land developers in Orange County, The Irvine Company
      owns and manages 106 apartment projects located throughout Orange County, Los Angeles,
      San Diego, and Silicon Valley. Affordable rental units are located at approximately 39 of these
      projects including inclusionary housing units, HUD-Funded Programs, and Section 8 units. The
      Irvine Company owns several apartment complexes within Newport Beach.

POPULATION AND HOUSING PROJECTIONS
According to the US Census, the population of Newport Beach in 2010 was 85,186 residents.
Updated information from the State Department of Finance estimates the population in 2012 to be
85,990. Pursuant to the updated General Plan, ultimate residential capacity within the City of Newport
Beach will be 49,968 dwelling units, including the Newport Coast area. Future residential growth will
largely occur through infill development and reuse of existing and obsolete land uses. As discussed in
greater detail later in the document, the key sites for future growth include the Airport Area, Newport
Center, Banning Ranch, West Newport Mesa, and the Balboa Peninsula area.
According to the California State Fullerton Center for Demographic Research projections, the
population of Newport Beach is anticipated to grow steadily over the next several years, increasing to
90,261 residents by 2035.
Tables H14 and Table H15 were created to demonstrate housing and population trends based on past
State Department of Finance estimates. These estimates are supplemented with housing unit and
population projections based on estimates of actual construction. Estimates are for 2000 to 2012.

POPULATION GROWTH
The City’s rate of population growth exceeded the County rate of population growth through 1950
(Table H16). From 1950 until 2010 the City’s proportionate gain in population has been substantially
less than that of the County. Annexations of the West Newport Triangle in 1980, a portion of Santa
Ana Heights in 1987, and construction of large housing developments helped to increase City
population 6.5 percent between 1980 and 1990. Construction of housing developments contributed to
an increase of City population of 13.5 percent between 1990 and 2000. Between 2000 and 2010 the
City’s 12.5 percent gain was larger than the County’s 5.8 percent gain. These population increases
were generally due to intensification of land uses and annexation of the Newport Coast and Santa Ana
Heights areas. Past and future populations of both Orange County and Newport Beach are presented
below. Newport Beach population will continue to constitute a decreasing percentage of the County
population.
The County population is projected to increase by 12.9 percent between 2010 and 2030. The City of
Newport Beach population is projected to increase by a slower rate of 7.6 percent during the same
time period.
The average household size in 1970 was 2.6; the 1980 Census reported an average household size of
2.2 (Table H17). Between 1980 and 1990, this rate increased to 2.3 persons per unit. The decrease in
average persons per household between 1970 and 1980 and the increase in average persons per
household between 1980 and 1990 are shown below. From 1990 through 2010 the average persons
per household indicates a plateau with little to no changes. These trends are consistent with the trend
in Orange County.
Reduction in household size in Newport Beach since 1970 has been the result of increased numbers
of persons 65 years of age and older and reduced numbers of child-rearing households and child
population in the City Table H18 further indicates a general aging of the population of the City
between 2000 and 2010.

More recent data displays several population trends within Newport Beach. One of the most notable
issues was that the City’s senior population (age 65+) remains a significant proportion of the City’s
population and continues to grow, comprising almost 19 percent in 2010. In comparison, the
County’s senior population is only 11.6 percent of the County’s total population. Another significant
population in the City is children under 19 years, which is composed of approximately 20 percent of
all residents. This trend is generally consistent with the County’s population of children under 19
years, which is approximately 27.5 percent of all County residents.
The City is served by the Newport Mesa Unified School District (NMUSD), Laguna Beach Unified
School District (LBUSD), and the Santa Ana Unified School District (SAUSD). Information on
Newport Beach resident public school enrollment is provided in Table H19. NMUSD serves the
majority of the City. This data does not include private school enrollment or children that are home-
schooled.

Household Incomes
An important component of housing affordability is household income. Upper income households
have discretionary income to spend on housing; lower- and moderate-income households are more
limited in terms of housing they can afford. Median household income in Newport Beach historically
has been greater than that of Orange County. In 2000, the City median household income was
41.8 percent higher than the County median income (Table H21). In 2010, the City median household
income dropped slightly to 37 percent higher than the County median.

In discussing affordable housing, it is important to identify the income levels associated with labels
such as “very low,” “low,” or “moderate” income. These are defined as annual household incomes
not exceeding a percentage of the median family income identified annually by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the Orange County area, which was $85,300 for a four-
person household in 2012.
For planning and funding purposes, the State Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD) categorizes households into four income groups based on the County area median income
(AMI):
   ■ Very Low-Income—up to 50 percent of County area median income (Extremely Low-Income is a
      subset of very low-income and is defined as annual income not exceeding 30 percent of the
      County area median income)
   ■ Low-Income—51–80 percent of County area median income
   ■ Moderate-Income—81 percent to 120 percent of County area median income
   ■ Above Moderate-Income—above 120 percent of the County area median income
Income by Household Type and Tenure
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data from the 2005-2009 American
Community Survey developed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is
used to provide an overview of income distribution by household type and tenure in Newport Beach.
According to HUD data, 27 percent of the City’s total households were lower-income (0 to 80
percent AMI). More specifically, 8.6 percent of the City’s total households were Extremely Low-
Income (0–30 percent AMI), 7.4 percent were Very Low-Income (31 to 50 percent AMI), and
approximately 11 percent were Low-Income (51–80 percent AMI). The remaining 73 percent of the
households were Moderate- and Above Moderate-Income with incomes above 80 percent of the
median (Table H22).
Certain groups had higher proportions of lower-income households. As shown in Table H22, senior
(age 62+) renter households had significantly higher proportions of lower-income households than
any other household type. Approximately 55 percent of all senior renter households and 30.3 percent
of senior owner households earned lower-income levels (earned less than 80 percent of AMI).
Although according to CHAS data, only 400 large family renter households were located within the
community, among these households, 36.3 percent earned less than 80 percent of the AMI and 15.8
percent of large family owner households earned lower-income levels.

SOURCE:       2005-2009 HUD CHAS Data based on 2005-2009 ACS
For planning purposes, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) uses Census data to develop special tabulations by HUD income
group and special needs category. This data set is collectively known as the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS).
Housing Cost Burden
Housing cost burden occurs when the cost of a desired unit is greater than the monthly affordable
rent or mortgage payment for that household. According to the 2005-2009 CHAS data, 39 percent of
Newport Beach home owners and 40 percent of renter households had a housing cost burden (paying
more than 30 percent of income on housing). This translates into 6,080 renter households and 7,910
owner households in the community.
Housing Costs
Affordability is determined by comparing the cost of housing to the income of local households. If
the costs are high relative to the incomes, housing problems such as overcrowding and cost burden
are more likely to occur. This section details the costs of housing in Newport Beach and examines the
overall affordability of housing within the City.

Housing Affordability
The costs of home ownership and renting can be compared to a household’s ability to pay for
housing, based on the 2012 HUD median income of $85,300 for Orange County and current market
prices in Newport Beach (Table H26). While the median household income in Newport Beach is
higher than the County, a significant number of households in the City earn lower income levels.
Specifically, 27 percent of households earned lower incomes (below 80 percent Orange County
median household incomes). In addition, senior and large family renter households had higher
proportions of lower income levels than any other household type, indicating that finding affordable,
adequately sized housing is difficult for these households.
                                                                                  Newport Beach General Plan                        5-31

  ■ Moderate-Income Households—Moderate-income households earn 81 to 120 percent of the
     County’s median household income. At 120 percent of the County’s median income, moderate-
     income households are unable to afford any of the condominiums or single family homes sold
     in the City at current prices. With a maximum affordable rent payment of $1,791.25 to
     $2,968.75 per month, moderate-income households can afford the price of most of the market-
     rate rental units in the City listed in Table H26 and the affordable housing in the community
     listed in Table H12.
  ■ Low-Income Households—Low-income households earn between 51 to 80 percent of the County’s
     median household income. At 80 percent of the County’s median income, low-income
     households are unable to afford any of the homes sold within the City and are limited to the
     rental market in Newport Beach. However, low-income households can only afford the rent of
     the affordable housing units in the community listed in Table H12, with the exception of a very
     limited amount of market-rate studios, one-bedroom apartment units, and some of the mobile
     home units for rent. Due to the limited supply of affordable housing units in the City, low-
     income households may have difficulty obtaining larger affordable rental units and often are
     subject to waiting lists. As a result, many low-income households within the City experience a
     housing cost burden greater than 30 percent of their annual income.

   ■ Very Low–Income and Extremely Low–Income Households—Extremely low- and very low-income
      households earn 50 percent or less than the County’s median family income and are also unable
      to purchase any market-rate homes or rent any market-rate apartment units in Newport Beach.
      Affordable/assisted units in the community are affordable to these households; however, due
      to the limited supply of affordable housing units in the City, these households may have
      difficulty obtaining affordable rental units and are often subject to waiting lists. As a result,
      many of these households within the City experience a housing cost burden greater than 30
      percent of their annual income.
Overcrowding
A housing unit that is occupied by more than one person per room (excluding kitchens, bathrooms,
hallways, and porches) is defined by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as
being overcrowded. A housing unit with more than 1.5 persons per room is considered to be severely
overcrowded. The substantial reduction in the average household size in the City of Newport Beach
in the last third of the twentieth century indicates the majority of City households are not
overcrowded in terms of persons per dwelling unit.
The 2007-2011 American Community Survey data indicates that in Newport Beach, 90 (0.24 percent)
owner-occupied units and 370 (2.2 percent) renter-occupied units included more than one person per
room and are considered overcrowded. A total of 11 (less than 1 percent) owner-occupied units and
155 ( 1.1 percent) renter-occupied units were severely overcrowded with more than 1.5 persons per
room. According to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey data, within Orange County as a
whole, overcrowding rates are considerably higher compared to the City: Countywide 24,871 (4.2
Percent) owner-occupied units and 67,485 (17.2 percent) renter-occupied units included more than
1.01 persons per room and are considered overcrowded. Approximately 6,718 (1.1 percent) owner-
occupied units and 27,909 (7.1 percent) renter-occupied units were severely overcrowded.
EMPLOYMENT TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS
A comparison of employment by industry between 2000 and 2010 is illustrated in Table H27.
Employment has increased approximately 10 percent. The 2006-2010 U.S. Census American
Community Survey estimates the total labor force among the Newport Beach population in 2010 was
46,135, of whom 44,109 were employed. Labor force is defined as the number of people 16 years of
age and older (who reside within the City of Newport Beach) that are employed or are seeking
employment.
The 2006-2010 U.S. Census American Community Survey estimates that the top eight industries
within the City’s labor market were as follows: professional services (8,985); finance, insurance and
real estate (8,075); educational services and health care (7,223); retail trade (4,425); manufacturing
(3,507); arts, entertainment, recreation, and food services (3,362); construction (2,123); and wholesale
trade (2,058). The proportional diversification of industries has not changed significantly since 2000.
There was a slight increase in the proportion of jobs related to professional services and financial,
insurance, and real estate; conversely, there was a slight reduction in the proportion of jobs related to
manufacturing and wholesales trade.
Newport Beach serves as a large employment center within the community and the County, including
professional occupations associated with major office centers located within Newport Center and the

    Airport Area as well as medical and research jobs associated within Hoag Hospital within the West
    Newport Mesa area. As a beachfront community, tourism is also a key component of Newport
    Beach’s economy and lifestyle. As such, a number of jobs within the community are within the service
    sector. While many of the industries providing the largest number of jobs consist of higher paid
    occupations such as jobs within the professional, scientific and portions of the healthcare fields, there
    are also a number of lower-paid service jobs in the community such as jobs in the retail and food
    services. Most of these workers likely commute from places outside the City.
     Table H28 presents the median salary by industry in 2010 for Newport Beach and Orange County.
    Overall, salaries were significantly higher in Newport Beach compared to Orange County, $81,647
    and $50,410 respectively.

SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION GROUPS
Certain segments of the population may have a more difficult time finding decent affordable housing
due to special circumstances. The state of California defines “special needs” households as seniors,
disabled persons (including developmental disabilities), large families, female-headed households, farm
workers, and the homeless. This Housing Element has included students in the “special needs”
population.
Data from the 2010 Census of Population and Housing indicate the “special needs” population in
Newport Beach most in need of affordable housing is senior citizens (those at least 65 years of age). A
large percentage of Newport Beach senior citizens in 2010 had a work disability with a mobility or
self-care limitation.
Students
Students attending the University of California, Irvine (UCI) or Orange Coast College (OCC) in Costa
Mesa also reside in Newport Beach. The Student Housing Offices provide information to students on
locating housing but students do not necessarily obtain housing through the offices. Also, Student
Housing Offices have no way of tracking residences of students. The University of California, Irvine
Housing Office conducts its services via an on-line website which provides general information on
current housing listings to assist students in finding off-campus housing within the Orange County
area. This information includes rental rates in Irvine, Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, and surrounding
communities. Rental information specific to Newport Beach was not available. That study was based
on number of rooms and made no distinction between apartments and homes. Rents then ranged
from $1,050 per month for a studio, to $3,000 per month for a three-bedroom, two-bath unit
(Table H29):

Persons with Disabilities
According to the 2009-2011 American Community Survey, 6,194 persons in Newport Beach had a
disability, comprising approximately 7.3 percent of the population 5 years and older. Disabilities are
defined as mental, physical, or health conditions that last over 6 months. The proportion of
individuals with disabilities increases with age. Approximately 3.6 percent of children and adolescents
aged 5 to 17 had a disability, 4.1 percent of adults aged 18 to 64 and 23.3 percent of seniors.
The most prevalent public need for persons with disabilities is access to public places, housing and
facilities.
Mobility impaired individuals require special housing or structural needs. These include, but are not
limited to, wheelchair ramps, widened doorways, grab bars, and access ramps. Certain individuals may
require housing that has access to health care facilities. From available Census data it is not possible to
determine how many of these disabled persons need housing assistance; however, as of December 21,
2012, a total of 20 of the 127 low-income residents that relied on Section 8 rental assistance vouchers
were reported to be disabled. The City has produced 2 units designed for handicapped occupancy in
one of its rent restricted, financially assisted housing developments. Rental of these two units was
restricted to allow use of Section 8 rental assistance Certificates or Vouchers. These units also are
located in close proximity to the largest concentration of health care facilities within Newport Beach.
Persons with Developmental Disabilities
The term developmental disability refers to a severe and chronic disability that is attributable to a
mental or physical impairment that begins before an individual reaches adulthood. These disabilities
include intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and disabling conditions closely related
to intellectual disability or requiring similar treatment. The State Department of Developmental
Services (DDS) currently provides community-based services to approximately 266,304 persons with
developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four
developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The Regional Center of Orange County
(RCOC) is one of 21 regional centers in the State of California that provides point of entry to services
for people with developmental disabilities. The RCOC is a private, non-profit community agency that
contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental
disabilities and their families.
Any resident of Orange County who has a developmental disability that originated before age 18 is
eligible for services. Services are offered to people with developmental disabilities based on Individual
Program Plans and may include: Adult day programs; advocacy; assessment/consultation; behavior
management programs; diagnosis and evaluation; independent living services; infant development

programs; information and referrals; mobility training; prenatal diagnosis; residential care; respite care;
physical and occupational therapy; transportation; consumer, family vendor training; and vocational
training. RCOC also coordinates the state-mandated Early Start program, which provides services for
children under age three who have or are at substantial risk of having a developmental disability.
According to the RCOC, as of December 2012, they serve between 17,500 and 18,000 individuals. Of
those individuals, a total of 157 individuals currently reside in Newport Beach with more than half of
them (87) under the age of 15, based on information provided by the RCOC.
Female Head of Household
Single-parent households often require special consideration and assistance as a result of their greater
need for affordable housing, accessible and affordable day care, health care, and other supportive
services. Female-headed households with children in particular, tend to have significantly lower
incomes, lower rate of homeownership, and higher poverty levels than other types of households.
Data from the 2006-2010 U.S. Census American Community Survey estimates that there were 2,309
female-headed households with children under 18 years of age in Newport Beach. The data also
revealed that 12.7 percent of these female-headed households with children were living below the
poverty level1. However, the extent of poverty experienced by female-headed families in Newport
Beach was significantly lower than the countywide rate of 24.4 percent.
Seniors
In 2010, the fastest growing segment of the County population was older adults (ages 65 and older).
Federal regulations stipulate senior citizens are presumed to have “presumptive benefit” for Americans
with Disabilities Act mandated provisions. Additionally, special housing needs of many senior persons
result from lower, fixed incomes, physical disabilities, and dependence needs.
Since 1960, the senior population in Newport Beach has grown steadily, and there is no indication of
this trend reversing. According to the 2010 Census, 16,162 persons in Newport Beach were aged 65
years and older representing 19 percent of the City’s population. The percentage of older persons in
the City is large compared to the region. In 2010, 11.6 percent of Orange County residents were 65
years of age or older. Due to aging “baby boomers,” the 65 years and older age group has been,
proportionately, the fastest growing segment of the total population in the previous two decades. The
number of seniors can be expected to increase as persons between the ages of 35 and 64 continue to
mature.
Many senior persons residing in Newport Beach are long-time residents. However, many others have
arrived more recently to pursue a retirement lifestyle suited to the area’s attractive locale. Those
persons in the latter category generally are well-housed because their housing arrangement was chosen
to match their retirement lifestyle and financial situation. Persons in the former category are more
often living in houses purchased before real estate prices increased dramatically. Many of these
individuals today would be unable to afford the house in which they are currently living. Furthermore,
these homes may no longer match their housing needs regarding space, maintenance, and proximity
to community facilities. Thus, persons living on low, fixed incomes may be “house rich” in terms of
1 Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who
is in poverty. The 2012 poverty level for a four-person household is an annual income of $23,550 or less.

accumulated equity in their homes, but poorly served by the housing unit itself. In such cases, senior
residents may retain their houses only because they wish to remain in the community. Alternative
living arrangements in the community, such as smaller units close to commercial and transportation
facilities with some congregate services, would better serve the housing needs of this population
segment.
According to the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 2005-2009 CHAS data, of the 10,770
senior households (ages 62+) in the City of Newport Beach, 8,545 were owner-occupied and 2,225
were rental. These households represented 30.3 percent of the total households in the City. Of the
senior renter occupied households, 62.5 percent (1,390 persons) and 33.2 percent (2,835 persons) of
senior owner households had problems as defined by HUD2. According to CHAS data, approximately
55 percent of all senior renter households and 30 percent of senior owner households earned lower
income levels (earned less than 80 percent of area median income).
2006-2010 U.S. Census American Community Survey estimates that 4.3 percent of senior persons in
the City were living below the federally established poverty line. Escalating housing costs, particularly
in the rental housing market, severely impact housing affordability for the seniors because many of
the seniors live on fixed incomes.
Many senior residents in the City reside in mobile home parks. A number of long-time senior
residents live in older parks developed in the 1950s and 1960s. Others live in mobile home parks close
to the bay that cater to the retirement lifestyle.
Assistance for low-income seniors is a high priority for the City of Newport Beach. Additionally, there
are many social service programs whose clients include seniors in Orange County. These include the
Section 8 “Housing Voucher” programs administered by the Orange County Housing Authority,
Meals on Wheels, and various social service programs provided by and through the City’s OASIS
Senior Center. A more detailed description of these programs is contained in Appendix H1 to this
Housing Element.
Additionally, the Bayview Landing Senior Affordable Housing Project was constructed in 2004. With
the exception of one “managers unit,” all of the 120 units are designated for very low- and low-
income seniors. This project received $1.5 million in funds from the City’s “in-lieu” housing fund
reserves. In addition, the City provided expedited permit processing, partial fee waivers of entitlement
fees and substantial entitlement assistance.
Large Households
Families are defined as groups of persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption. Households
represent all persons living together as groups, whether related or not. The City has identified large
households as five or more persons. Table H30 shows distribution of number of persons per
household as indicated in the 2010 U.S. Census and demonstrates the number of large households in
the City of Newport Beach comprises only five percent of all Newport Beach households.
2 Housing Problems as defined by HUD are as follows: cost burden greater than 30% of income and/or
overcrowding and/or without complete kitchen facilities or plumbing.

Homelessness
Homelessness continues to remain a growing issue in the United States. Factors that contributed to
the increase in homelessness include a lack of housing affordable to low and moderate-income
persons and families, loss of jobs, increases in the number of persons whose incomes fell below the
poverty level, reductions in public subsidies to the poor, and de-institutionalization of the mentally ill.
Homelessness is a regional problem throughout Southern California. Homeless persons and families
exist in every city and populated unincorporated area of Orange County. Due to the lack of accurate
data regarding the homeless population, various organizations, institutions, and agencies often
generate strikingly different estimates of homeless individuals/families.
On October 15, 2007, the state enacted SB 2, which amended State Housing Element Law. This
legislation took effect January 1, 2008, and applies to the City’s Housing Element. This legislation
requires local jurisdictions to strengthen provisions for addressing the housing needs of the homeless,
including the identification a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use
without the need for CUP approval. The City also must identify a zone or zones that can
accommodate at least one year-round emergency shelter. As part of the Zoning Code Update in 2010,
the City added emergency shelters as a permitted use without the requirement of a use permit to the
Private Institutions (PI) and Airport-Office (OA) zoning districts.
Housing Element law mandates that municipalities address the special needs of homeless persons
within their jurisdictional boundaries. “Homelessness” as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development, describes an individual (not imprisoned or otherwise detained) who:
   1. Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and
   2. Has a primary nighttime residence that is:
       X A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living
          accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing for
          the mentally ill);
       X An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be
          institutionalized; or
       X A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping
          accommodation for human beings.
                                                         Newport Beach General Plan                 5-39

Housing Element
This definition does not include persons living in substandard housing (unless it has been officially
condemned); persons living in overcrowded housing (e.g., doubled up with others), persons being
discharged from mental health facilities (unless the person was homeless when entering and is
considered to be homeless at discharge), or persons who may be at risk of homelessness (e.g., living
temporarily with family or friends.)
SB 2 requires an analysis of homeless persons and their families including the average number of
persons lacking shelter and, wherever possible, the characteristics of their needs. As local data permits,
a description of homeless population that is mentally ill, developmentally disabled, substance abusers,
and victims of domestic violence, runaway and other homeless subpopulations should be included.
The legislation does not specify how this data is to be collected, only that it should be included if data
is available.
County Information
The County has developed and assists in funding a housing and service delivery system—the
Continuum of Care—that responds to the needs of the region’s homeless. The Orange County
Continuum of Care was established through a community-based process to ensure the region’s
residents and homeless are empowered to effect changes in the existing social services system. For the
past several years, leadership and coordination of Orange County’s Continuum of Care (CoC)
planning process has been the shared responsibility of OC Partnership, 2-1-1 Orange County and the
OC Community Resources. This public-nonprofit partnership helps ensure comprehensive, regional
coordination of efforts and resources to reduce the number of homeless and persons at risk of
homelessness throughout Orange County. This group serves as the regional convener of the year-
round CoC planning process and as a catalyst for the involvement of the public and private agencies
that make-up the regional homeless system of care. This includes an Orange County Housing
Management Information System (HMIS), Annual Housing Assessment Report (AHAR), and a
Point-In-Time Count and Comprehensive Survey every other year consistent with HUD
recommendations. All 34 cities within the County, including Newport Beach, as well as homeless
service and housing providers, and other community groups provide support and participate in
implementing the regional CoC.
 According to the Orange County 2011 Homeless Census and Survey and Point-in-Time Count (2011
Survey and Count), there were approximately 6,939 unduplicated persons identified in shelters and on
the streets of Orange County on January 22, 2011. This represents a 17percent decrease (or a decrease
of 1,394 individuals) from the 2009 survey. The 2011 Survey and Count included data collected from
shelter service providers and provided a count of the number of chronically homeless (street
homeless) individuals that typically do not seek shelter. Approximately 24 percent of all homeless
people in Orange County were chronically homeless. It is estimated that on any given day, Orange
County has a chronically homeless population of approximately 1,651 persons. This represents a 56
percent decrease from 3,783 chronically homeless individuals in 2009. In 2011, HUD extended the
definition of chronic homelessness to include families and 19 individuals were found to be in
chronically homeless families.
According to the 2011 Survey and Count, it is estimated that 18,325 unduplicated persons experience
homelessness annually in Orange County, which based on the 2010 Census, represents approximately
0.6 percent of Orange County’s total population of 3,010,232 people. Data showed that a total of 574
homeless families with children under 18 years old were identified, a 19 percent increase from 481
homeless families in 2009. The data also showed that the number of persons in families with children

in Orange County increased by 124 percent (from 1,377 persons in 2009 to 1,708 persons in 2011).
The most commonly cited cause of homelessness in both the 2009 and 2011 Survey and Count was
job loss.
The 2011 Survey and Count provides valid and useful data; however, the count should be considered
conservative since it is well-known that even with a thorough methodology, many homeless
individuals stay in locations where they cannot be seen or counted and further, many women, families,
and children try to remain hidden for safety. Orange County has a total homeless shelter bed
inventory of 3,832 year-round-beds comprised of 116 emergency shelter beds and 1,664 transitional
shelter beds, and 1,378 permanent supportive housing beds. Additionally there are 907 seasonal
emergency shelter beds. According to the 2010-2015 Orange County Consolidated Plan, there is an
unmet homeless housing need of 4,478 beds for homeless individuals and 81 beds for families with
children. The largest housing gap is for permanent supportive housing and emergency shelters for
individuals. Additionally, the plan reported that there are unmet needs for individuals in the following
categories: seriously mentally ill, veterans, persons with HIV/AIDS (7/69/75); victims of domestic
violence, youth, and chronic substance abusers.
In January 2010, the Orange County Board of Supervisors approved the Draft Orange County Ten-
Year Plan to End Homelessness and a Final Plan was adopted in January 2012. The Commission to
End Homelessness provides oversight and accountability for the implementation of the goals and
strategies. The overarching goal of the plan is to more strategically invest resources for a coordinated,
efficient, and effective system and includes nine main goals: Goal 1-Prevent Homelessness - Ensure
that no one in our community becomes homeless; Goal 2-Outreach to those who are homeless and at
risk of homelessness; Goal 3-Improve the efficacy of the emergency shelter and access system; Goal
4-Make strategic improvements in the transitional housing system; Goal 5-Develop permanent
housing options linked to a range of supportive services; Goal 6-Ensure that people have the right
resources, programs, and services to remain housed; Goal 7-Improve data systems to provide timely,
accurate data that can be used to define the need for housing and related services and to measure
outcomes; Goal 8-Develop the systems and organizational structures to provide oversight and
accountability; Goal 9-Advocate for community support, social policy, and systemic changes necessary
to succeed. Quarterly reports are provided on the status of the Ten-Year Plan and the Commission’s
progress to implement the goals and strategies. The main goals of 2012 were: 1) Continuing the
development of a web-based database to deliver accurate and timely performance, and capacity
information on the Orange County homeless system of care; 2) Engaging the majority of community
stakeholders, primarily service providers, in owning the results of, and actively participating in, the
implementation of the Ten-Year Plan; and 3) Establishing a year-round emergency shelter to replace
the current seasonal Armory Emergency Shelter Program.
Local Need
The regional nature of the homelessness problem makes it challenging for Newport Beach to define
and serve its fair share of the homeless population. With a population of approximately 85,186
residents within the County of Orange (a County with 3 million people and thirty-four municipalities)
Newport Beach does not control either the movement of homeless people across its boundaries or
the county-level resources that are needed to help people leave homelessness. While the Orange
County 2011 Homeless Census and Survey and Point-in-Time Count estimated that 18,325
unduplicated persons experience homelessness annually in the County, this data did not provide
information on homelessness per City.
                                                         Newport Beach General Plan                5-41

Housing Element
The 2010 U.S. Census did not identify any homeless persons in the City of Newport Beach. However,
according to the Newport Beach Police Department, approximately ten to 15 homeless individuals are
visible on a regular basis within the community, particularly around Balboa Peninsula and on Superior
Avenue. The majority of this population is single males. Although the Police Department does not
keep statistics, they note that there tends to be a higher number of homeless people around the beach
areas during the warmer summer months.3
OC Partnership works directly with nearly 200 agencies by serving as a liaison between nonprofits,
local, state, and federal government agencies, and other private and public funding sources. According
to the 2011 Orange County Partnership, Annual Housing Assessment Report, of the 2,667
unduplicated homeless and at-risk clients that have been enrolled in Orange County programs,
14 clients have listed Newport Beach as their last know permanent address. 4 (Service providers most
often utilized “last city of residence” as the means to determine a client’s city of residency for
reporting purposes).
To help ascertain the characteristics of the City’s homeless and at-risk population, contact was made
with groups that provide assistance to persons in need of emergency shelter and assistance. The
agencies that provide housing and other services for the homeless in the region include the Orange
County Housing Authority, Serving People In Need (SPIN), Families Forward, Human Options,
Colette’s Children’s Home, and others. Detailed descriptions of services offered by these agencies are
contained in Appendix H1 to this element.
Services provided to the homeless population of Newport Beach are as follows:
    ■ Serving People In Need (SPIN) operates a housing program for low-income families with
        children, Guided Assistance to Permanent Placement Housing Program (GAPP), that provides
        initial housing costs, rent to prevent eviction, and proven cost effective case management and
        guidance, professional counseling and monitoring which moves the families from unstable
        housing and living situations and empowers them to become reliable, self-sufficient
        contributors to the community on a permanent basis. SPIN serves between five and six
        homeless families and individuals with housing assistance each year in Newport Beach and
        between 50 and 60 with various support services. SPIN staff indicated that the need in Orange
        County for families with children and individuals has increased due to the economic downturn.
    ■ Colette’s Children’s Home (CCH) provides shelter for homeless women and children
        throughout Orange County. CCH operates seven shelters in Orange County. Since 1998, CCH
        has served over 1,400 women and children. CCH indicates that approximately 20 requests have
        originated from women and children in Newport Beach.
    ■ Human Options, which provides housing and services for women and children in Orange
        County that deal with the effects of domestic violence, estimates that of the 2,000 persons per
        year that receive housing and counseling services, about 40 to 50 are from Newport Beach.
        Services provided by Human Options include crisis intervention and individual counseling, legal
        advocacy, personal empowerment programs, and parenting education. According to Human
        Options, the number of women and children seeking services per year increased in 2009, but
        since has been consistently between 40 and 50.5 In the 2011-2012 fiscal year 14 unduplicated

       residents of Newport Beach received services and additionally, 32 residents were
       accommodated at the Human Options emergency shelter and transitional shelter.
    ■ Families Forward, helps families in need achieve and maintain self-sufficiency through food,
       housing, counseling, education, and other support services. Families Forward Transitional
       Housing Program is a decentralized, service-enriched transitional housing program for Orange
       County homeless families with minor-aged children. The program serves homeless families
       whose last city of residence was within Orange County. For the 2011-2012 fiscal year, Families
       Forward Transitional Housing served 166 clients, four of which are listed as previously living in
       Newport Beach. The program anticipates serving 150 clients in the 2012-2013 fiscal year.
    ■ According to the Orange County Department of Education, which collects data on the number
       of youth and homeless children in Orange County, of the 502,195 students enrolled in public
       schools (K-12) in Orange County in 2011/12, 28,6256 are defined as homeless. The number of
       homeless students breaks down as follows: 26,113 housed in doubled/tripled-up conditions due
       to economic hardship (excluding cultural reasons); 1,034 living in shelters; 1,323 living in
       hotels/motels; and 155 unsheltered. Of this total number of homeless students, 344 were
       enrolled in the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, which serves Newport Beach and Costa
       Mesa. Discussion with the Newport-Mesa School District indicates that in the 2012/13 school
       year, 255 homeless children were enrolled in the Newport-Mesa Unified school district and
       approximately 42 (16 percent) of these students are enrolled in Newport Beach schools.
Based on the service records provided by agencies that provide housing and other services for the
homeless in Newport Beach, and conversations with Newport Beach Police Department and
Newport-Mesa School District, an annual estimate of 133 homeless persons from Newport Beach
utilize emergency shelters or services over the course of one year. It should be noted that this is a
conservatively high estimate in that a number of the individuals may be receiving assistance from
multiple service providers, and therefore, may be counted more than once.
Conversations with local service providers also indicate that, while the number of homeless in the City
is difficult to quantify, there is a growing number of “at-risk” individuals that are having trouble
meeting rising rental and mortgage prices. These persons are not visibly homeless but have difficulty
finding and affording housing in Newport Beach. These include senior households that require help
with one-time rental assistance or singles and families that live within the City. Due to the downturn
in the mortgage and building industry, there are a growing number of individuals who have lost their
jobs or have had a reduction in employment hours and have difficulty making their mortgage
payments and other bills. These individuals often request financial or service assistance.7,8
The City’s strategy to address homelessness in Newport Beach is to adopt the regional homeless
priorities and strategies, listed herein, as its own. The City will continue to work with the area’s
Continuum of Care (CoC) providers to address the CoC priorities and goals and will continue to have
an active participation in the County’s Continuum of Care program including the Ten Year Plan to
End Homelessness
6 The Federal Department of Education defines a student homeless if they live in any of the following conditions:
doubled/tripled up due to economic reasons/hardship, (i.e. lost home/apartment due to foreclosure, job loss, not
due to cultural preferences), shelters, motels/hotels, and/or unsheltered (i.e. cars, parks, campgrounds, etc.)

Housing Element
In addition, the City continues to utilize Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to
support local and regional homeless and at-risk homeless providers (Appendix H1). No emergency
shelters or transitional homeless facilities are located within the community. However, a number of
homeless facilities are located in nearby communities. These facilities are listed also within Appendix
H1. Pursuant to SB2 requirements, the Zoning Code update added emergency shelters as a permitted
use without the requirement of a conditional use permit approval to the PI and OA zoning districts.
Farm Workers
The special housing needs of farm workers result from low wages and the seasonal nature of their
employment. The 2006-2010 U.S. Census American Community Survey estimates farm workers
comprised of less than 1 percent (approx. 149) of the population in Newport Beach and less than
1 percent of the County population. Therefore, demand for housing generated by farm workers in the
City was nominal and could be addressed adequately by overall housing affordability programs in the
City and the County. This remains the case in the City of Newport Beach.
HOUSING NEEDS
2014-2021 RHNA Allocation
In accordance with State Housing Element law, the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) has prepared a Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) to identify the housing need
for each jurisdiction within the SCAG region. This assessment was prepared for the 2014–2021
period. The RHNA allocates Newport Beach’s share of housing units required to satisfy housing
needs resulting from projected growth in the region. To accommodate projected growth in the region,
SCAG estimates the City needs to target its housing unit production to accommodate five new
housing units. State law requires SCAG to distribute new units on the basis of income to avoid further
impact to localities with relatively high proportions of low-income households. Table H31 indicates
future need for housing in Newport Beach for the 2014-2021 planning period and its distribution by
income group as calculated by the RHNA.

INVENTORY OF LAND SUITABLE FOR RESIDENTIAL
DEVELOPMENT
In 2006, the City completed a comprehensive update of its General Plan including an update of the
Land Use Element. The General Plan recognizes that most of the City will be conserved with its
existing patterns of uses and establishes policies for their protection and long-term maintenance.
However, the General Plan identifies several areas where land use changes may be anticipated over
time, including new residential opportunities. Other than Banning Ranch, this would occur within
existing developed areas of the City as infill and replacement of previously permitted retail and office
development capacity. These sites can realistically provide an attainable opportunity to create
approximately 4,612 new housing units in the community, (up to 3,237 units excluding the Banning
Ranch area).
In accordance with Government Code Section 65583(a)(3) and 65583.2, the following section of the
Housing Element provides an inventory and description of land determined suitable for residential
development that can realistically be developed within the planning period. A detailed, parcel-specific
analysis, inventory, and maps of available and suitable sites (Sites Analysis and Inventory) have been
prepared and are included as Appendix H3. The Sites Analysis and Inventory is organized by the key
opportunity areas within City (i.e., Banning Ranch, Corona del Mar, West Newport Mesa, Mariner’s
Mile, Balboa Peninsula, Dover Dr./Westcliff Dr., Newport Center, and the Airport Area).
The Sites Analysis and Inventory demonstrates the sites are currently available and unconstrained so
as to provide realistic housing opportunities prior to October 2021 (the end of the planning period). A
methodology describing the site selection process and calculations of achievable and realistic densities
is included within the Sites Analysis and Inventory. To demonstrate the realistic development viability
of the sites, the analysis also discusses: 1) whether appropriate zoning is in place; 2) the applicable
development limits/densities and their impact on projected development capacity and affordability; 3)
existing constraints including any known environmental issues; and 4) the availability of existing and
planned public service capacity levels.
Since a limited amount of vacant land remains in the community, future housing development would
primarily be achieved through infill and reuse of sites with existing, underdeveloped or underutilized
land uses. Table H32 summarizes the total residential development capacities identified in Sites
Analysis and Inventory for each of the potential housing opportunity areas in the City. A general
description and maps of each of the housing opportunity areas follows the table.

 * Capacities reflect potential net increase in dwelling units above existing uses. As explained in detail within the Sites Analysis and Inventory,
 realistic capacities were based on average densities of actual constructed, permitted, or proposed projects within the City and accurately reflect
 achievable housing units. For example, although mixed-use designations permit densities of up to 26.7 du/ac, realistic capacities were calculated
 using 16 du/ac, based on actual mixed-use projects constructed within the City.
 ** Pursuant to Government Code Section 65583.2, a minimum density of 30 du/ac shall be deemed appropriate to accommodate housing for lower-
     income households for urbanized areas.

Vacant Sites
Banning Ranch
Located within the City’s Sphere of Influence in the western-most portion of the Newport Beach
Planning Area, the Banning Ranch area encompasses approximately 518 acres, of which 465 acres
(including 47 acres of water features) are under the jurisdiction of Orange County and 53 acres are
within the jurisdiction of the City of Newport Beach. The site is located within the coastal zone
boundary and is subject to the provisions of the Orange County Local Coastal Program (LCP).
However, the site is referred to as a “white hole,” because neither the City’s nor the County’s LCP
provides land use designations for the Banning Ranch area (Figure H1).
The Land Use Element prioritizes the retention of the Banning Ranch property as open space,
consolidating existing oil operations, restored upland wetlands and habitat, and a community park.
However, due to the significant cost of purchasing the site and habitat restoration, a large amount of
revenue would need to be generated to help fund preservation of the majority of the property as open
space. Should the property not be acquired for open space, the Land Use Element considers the
possible development of a mixed-density residential village that would include open space,
convenience commercial, and small hotel uses. The Land Use Element designates the Banning Ranch
Area as Open Space (OS) and Residential Village (RV). This designation provides for the
development of a planned residential community that integrates up to 1,375 single-family detached,
single-family attached, two-family, and/or multi-family residential units with supporting schools,
parks, community services, local-serving convenience commercial uses and services, and open spaces.
On July 23, 2012, the City approved an application filed by Newport Banning Ranch, LLC for a
proposed planned community on a 401.1 gross-acre project site for development of 1,375 residential
dwelling units, a 75-room resort inn and ancillary resort uses, 75,000 square feet of commercial uses,
approximately 51.4 gross-acres of parklands, and approximately 252.3 gross-acres of permanent open
space. The project will require the approval of a coastal development permit by the California Coastal
Commission. Newport Banning Ranch LLC submitted their application to the California Coastal
Commission in January 2013. The review by Coastal Commission staff is expected to take a minimum of
1 to 3 years.
Corona del Mar
The Corona del Mar corridor extends along Coast Highway between Avocado Avenue and Hazel
Drive. It is developed with commercial uses and specialty shops that primarily serve adjoining
residential neighborhoods. Among the area’s primary uses are restaurants, home furnishing stores, and
miscellaneous apparel and professional offices. Almost half of the commercial uses are located in
multi-tenant buildings with retail on the ground floor and office uses above. Other uses include the
Sherman Library and Gardens, a research library and botanical garden open to the public, and an
assisted-living residential complex. Within the corridor, the General Plan land use designations include
Corridor Commercial (CC) with an FAR of 0.75 and Multiple Residential (RM). Per the Land Use
Element up to 8 dwelling units may be accommodated on an RM parcel that is currently occupied by
a dirt parking lot (Figure H2). On January 3, 2013, the City approved an application that allows
development of the site with six detached condominiums above a common subterranean parking
structure. As a condition of approval, the project is required to pay an in-lieu housing fee to the City
in the amount of approximately $123,000. Construction of the project is expected to occur in 2014.

Infill/Reuse Opportunity Areas
West Newport Mesa
The West Newport Mesa area contains a mixture of residential, office, commercial, industrial, and
public uses. It is immediately abutted by Hoag Hospital, a major employment center. The General
Plan identifies the opportunity to develop new, complementary uses such as residential, medical
offices and other facilities supporting Hoag Hospital. In addition, providing well-planned residential
neighborhoods will enable residents to live close to their jobs and reduce commutes to outlying areas.
Residential uses within this area are permitted under the Multiple Family Residential land use
designation at up to 18 dwelling units per acre, including several new opportunity sites that were
previously designated for office and industrial uses (Figure H3). Based on the Sites Analysis and
Inventory, approximately 71 new residential units could realistically be developed as new and
replacement housing.
Mariners’ Mile
Mariners’ Mile is a heavily traveled segment of Coast Highway extending from the Arches Bridge on
the west to Dover Drive on the east. It is developed with a mix of highway-oriented retail and marine
related commercial uses. The latter are primarily concentrated on bay-fronting properties and include
boat sales and storage, sailing schools, marinas, visitor-serving restaurants, and comparable uses. The
General Plan identifies Mariners’ Mile as a location appropriate for mixed-use development
integrating residential and commercial or office space. Land use designations for Mariners’ Mile
include Mixed-Use Water 1 (MU-W1), Mixed-Use Horizontal 1 (MU-H1) and General Commercial
(CG) (Figure H4).
On the inland side of Coast Highway, land is designated as Mixed-Use Horizontal 1 (MU-H1), and
General Commercial (CG-0.3 and CG-0.5) to accommodate a mix of visitor and local-serving retail
commercial, residential, and public uses. Coast Highway frontages shall be developed for marine-
related and highway-oriented general commercial uses, and properties located on interior streets may
be developed for free-standing neighborhood-serving retail, multi-family residential units, or mixed-
use buildings that integrate residential with retail uses on the ground floor. The floor area ratio of
mixed-use buildings is 1.5 with a maximum commercial floor area to land ratio of 0.5 and a maximum
of 1.0 for residential uses.
Bay fronting properties along Mariners’ Mile are designated MU-W1 which permits the inter-mixing
of marine-related and residential uses. Permitted uses include multi-family residential, mixed-use, and
commercial activities. Residential uses are permitted on parcels with a minimum frontage of 200 lineal
feet where a minimum of 50 percent of the permitted square footage shall be devoted to
nonresidential uses. The floor area ratio of mixed-use buildings is 1.0. Multi-family residential
densities are 12 units per adjusted gross acre, with the number of units calculated on a maximum of
50 percent of the property.
Based on the residential capacities calculated within the Sites Inventory Analysis, approximately 232
new residential units could realistically be developed in Mariner’s Mile as new and replacement
housing.

Balboa Peninsula Area
The Balboa Peninsula area is comprised of a series of coastal districts linked by the Newport
Boulevard/Balboa Boulevard commercial and residential corridor. These include Lido Village,
Cannery Village, McFadden Square, and Balboa Village. The General Plan identifies the potential for
new mixed-use development within these areas (Figure H5 and Figure H6).
Cannery Village
Cannery Village is the historic center of the City’s commercial fishing and boating industry and
contains a mix of small shops, art galleries, professional offices, and service establishments. Recent
redevelopment activity within this area has been composed of new residential and mixed-use
development such as Cannery Lofts, a 22-unit live/work project. All of these units were market-rate,
loft-style ownership units. Older developments include some single-family residential units combined
with commercial uses on single lots. The updated Land Use Element designates the Cannery Village
Area as Mixed-Use Horizontal 4 (MU-H4) and Mixed-Use Water 2 (MU-W2). The intent of the MU-
H4 land use category is to create a distinct district or neighborhood containing multi-family homes
with clusters of mixed-use and/or commercial buildings at intersections. Mixed-use buildings are
permissible throughout the area. Density ranges for multi-family residential uses are 20.1 to 26.7 units
per net acre. Mixed-use parcels have a maximum floor area ratio of 1.5 with a minimum floor area to
land area ratio of 0.35 for commercial and maximum of 1.0 for residential uses.
The MU-W2 designation applies to waterfront parcels within Cannery Village. Permitted uses include
mixed-use structures that vertically integrate housing within retail uses, where the ground floor shall
be restricted to retail and other pedestrian-active uses along the street frontage and/or the upper
floors used for residential units or nonresidential uses including retail and office. Mixed-use parcels
have a maximum floor area ratio of 1.25 with a maximum floor area to land ratio of 0.5 for
commercial and a maximum of 0.75 for residential purposes. The average size of parcels designated as
MU-W2 and MU-H4 in Cannery Village is 0.08 acre or 3,840 square feet.
Based on the residential capacities calculated within the Sites Analysis and Inventory, approximately
55 new residential units could realistically be developed in Cannery Village as new and replacement
housing.
Lido Village
Lido Village is primarily developed with commercial uses including a grocery store, restaurants, salons,
home furnishings, apparel, and other specialty shops. It also includes Lido Marina Village, a
pedestrian-oriented waterfront development that includes visitor-serving commercial uses, specialty
stores, and marine uses. The guiding General Plan goal for Lido Village is to create a mixture of land
uses within a pedestrian-oriented village environment. To facilitate these uses, a portion of the Lido
Village General Plan subarea has been designated as Mixed-Use Water 2 (MU-W2) and Multiple
Residential (RM(20/ac)). The MU-W2 designation applies to waterfront parcels. Permitted uses
include mixed-use structures that vertically integrate housing with retail uses, where the ground floor
shall be restricted to retail and other pedestrian-active uses along the street frontage and/or the upper
floors used for residential units or nonresidential uses including retail and office. Mixed-use parcels
within the Lido Village area have a maximum floor area ratio of 1.5 with a maximum commercial
floor area of 0.7 and a maximum of 0.8 for residential purposes. This translates to a maximum density
of 26.7 dwelling units per acre for mixed-use projects. The RM(20/ac) designation is intended to
                                                          Newport Beach General Plan                5-49

Housing Element
provide multi-family residential development containing attached or detached dwelling units up to
20 dwelling units per acre (Figure H6).
Based on the residential capacities calculated within the Sites Analysis and Inventory, approximately
62 new residential units could realistically be developed in Lido Village as new and replacement
housing.
McFadden Square
McFadden Square surrounds the Newport Pier and extends between the ocean front and harbor.
Commercial land uses are largely concentrated in the strips along Balboa and Newport Boulevards,
with residential along the ocean front and marine-related uses fronting the harbor. Numerous visitor-
serving uses include restaurants, beach hotels, tourist-oriented shops (t-shirt shops, bike rentals, and
surf shops), as well as service operations and facilities that serve the Peninsula. Historically, the area
has been known for its marine-related industries such as shipbuilding and repair facilities and boat
storage on the harbor. Much of the McFadden Square area is pedestrian-oriented, with storefronts
facing the street, the presence of signage at a pedestrian scale, and outdoor furniture, providing a
pleasant environment for visitors. The Land Use Element identifies a portion of McFadden Square as
Mixed-Use Water 2 (MU-W2). This designation is applied to waterfront locations in which marine-
related uses may be intermixed with mixed-use buildings that integrate housing with ground level
retail. The floor area ratio for mixed-use buildings is 1.25, with a minimum floor area ratio of 0.35 and
maximum of 0.75 for residential uses.
Based on the residential capacities calculated within the Sites Analysis and Inventory, approximately
39 new residential units could realistically be developed in McFadden Square as new and replacement
housing.
Balboa Village
Balboa Village has served as the center for recreational and social activities on the Peninsula. Many of
the existing land uses include retail uses and are visitor-oriented and seasonal in nature. The Balboa
Village core is surrounded by residences, with isolated pockets of commercial uses scattered along
Balboa Boulevard. Balboa Village and the greater Peninsula have experienced a transition to year-
round residential occupancy while the visitor-serving uses have continued. The General Plan
designates a portion of the Village Core area as Mixed-Use Vertical (MU-V) which provides for the
development of mixed-use structures that vertically integrate retail commercial, and office or related
functions on the ground floor and the upper floors used for residential units. Non-residential uses are
also permitted including office and commercial activities. The floor area ratio for mixed-use buildings
is 1.5; with a floor area ratio of 0.35 to 0.5 for commercial and maximum of 1.0 for residential uses.
The average size of parcels designated as MU-V in Balboa Village is 0.10 acre or 4,356 square feet.
Based on the residential capacities calculated within the Sites Analysis and Inventory, approximately
14 new residential units could realistically be developed in Balboa Village as new and replacement
housing.
Dover Drive/Westcliff Drive
The General Plan identifies several properties located at the southwest corner of the intersection of
Dover Drive and Westcliff Drive as a location appropriate for mixed-use development where
residential is integrated with retail or office uses on the ground floor (Figure H8). The land use
  5-50 N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n
                                                                                Housing Element
designation for this area is Mixed-Use Horizontal 1 (MU-H1). The MU-H1 designation provides for
the horizontal intermixing of uses, including the development of free-standing multi-family residential
units. These properties were previously designated for administrative and professional office use and
are currently developed as such, with the exception of one property that is currently developed with a
church. The floor area ratio of mixed-use buildings is 1.5 with a maximum commercial floor area to
land ratio of 0.5 and a maximum of 1.0 for residential uses.
Based on the Sites Analysis and Inventory, approximately 89 new residential units could realistically be
developed as new and replacement housing.
Newport Center
Newport Center is a regional center of business and commerce that includes major retail, professional
office, entertainment, recreation, and housing in a master planned mixed-use development. Fashion
Island, a regional shopping center, forms the nucleus of Newport Center (Figure H8).
The General Plan identifies the goal of creating a successful mixed-use district that integrates
economic and commercial centers serving the needs of Newport Beach residents and the sub-region,
with expanded opportunities for residential development. The Land Use Element creates a new
residential land use designation of Mixed-Use Horizontal 3 (MU-H3) on the northern portion of the
subarea. The MU-H designation provides for the horizontal intermixing of regional commercial
office, hotel, multi-family residential, and ancillary commercial uses.
The Irvine Company (TIC) is the main land owner/developer in the Newport Center area. A Planned
Community Development Plan (North Newport Center PC) for TIC owned property within the
Newport Center area was approved in December 2007 and amended in August of 2012. The North
Newport Center PC area comprises approximately 158.4 acres along San Joaquin Hills Road and
Newport Center Drive, and consists of seven sub-areas. This Development Plan allows for the
diversification of land uses in order to encourage new and original uses consistent with the Mixed-Use
concept as established in the General Plan, including the development of 445 of the permitted 450
mixed-use units. As part of the amendment approved in 2012, an additional 79 residential units were
approved for construction with North Newport Center as a result of the conversion and transfer of
79 unbuilt hotel units from the Newport Beach Marriot site in Newport Center. As a result of the
amendment, the Development Plan now allows for the total construction of up to 524 residential
units within the San Joaquin Plaza subarea. The development plan and accompanying text sets forth
the property development standards that govern development within the PC area. These standards
include requirements for site coverage, building heights, setback line designations, off-street parking,
vehicular access, signage, lighting, storage, screening, and landscaping. To facilitate the development
of the housing and provide considerable flexibility, maximum building height is set at 65 feet and no
maximum density limit was established, but rather maximum development limit of 524 dwelling units
was set.
The remaining five residential units authorized by the General Plan in Newport Center were entitled
for development at the Newport Beach Country Club site.
In addition to the mixed-use infill units available for development with the MU-H3 designated
properties in Newport Center, the General Plan includes a development opportunity for 79 multi-
family residential (RM) dwelling units. A 79-unit condominium project (Santa Barbara

Phase 1 of the project is anticipated to begin construction by summer of 2013.
Based on the residential capacities calculated within the Sites Analysis and Inventory, approximately
608 new residential units could realistically be developed in Newport Center as new housing.
John Wayne Airport Area
The Airport Area encompasses the properties abutting and east of John Wayne Airport (JWA) and is
in close proximity to the Irvine Business Complex and University of California, Irvine (Figure H9).
Existing uses include research and development, office, high technology, industrial and commercial
uses. Development in the Airport Area is restricted due to the noise impacts of JWA. Much of the
southwestern portion of the area is located in the JWA Airport Environs Land Use Plan (AELUP)
65 dBA CNEL, which is unsuitable for residential and other “noise-sensitive” uses. Additionally,
building heights are restricted for aviation safety.
The General Plan provides for the maintenance and limited expansion of the currently developed mix
of uses. Additionally, it identifies this Area as one of the greatest opportunities in the community to
create new residential neighborhoods including workforce housing, through the replacement of
existing uses and new construction on underutilized surface parking lots.
The housing capacity for the John Wayne Airport planning area was determined by the maximum
permissible new automobile trips that could be generated for the statistical area in which it is located
(Figure LU3 statistical area L4), in compliance with City Charter Section 423 and Measure S. Land
Use Element Policy LU 6.15.5 allocates a maximum of 2,200 housing units in areas designated as
Mixed-Use Horizontal 2 (MU-H2) on the General Plan land use diagram (Figure H1 and Figure H2).
The MU-H2 designation provides for the horizontal intermixing of uses, including the development
of free-standing multi-family residential units. Housing and mixed-use areas are not located within
areas exposed to noise levels of 65 dBA CNEL and higher. All of the units may be developed as
replacement of existing uses, while a maximum of 550 of the total may be developed as infill on
existing surface parking lots with the latter replaced in parking structures.
Land Use Element Policy LU 6.15.7 stipulates that residential units be developed at a maximum
density of 50 units per acre and minimum density of 30 units per acre. The MU-H2 district contains
approximately 207 acres, which, if fully redeveloped, would yield 6,210 to 10,350 units and would
considerably exceed the limits imposed by Policy LU 6.15.5. Conversion of the entire area designated
for housing is unlikely due to the presence of existing viable office, industrial, and retail uses. For the
purposes of determining a realistic level of potential development, the Sites Inventory and Analysis
evaluates existing uses to determine which of those properties are underutilized and may be subject to
conversion. Additionally, the owners of a number of properties approached the City and expressed
interest in redeveloping these sites for housing. Based on these analyses and input, areas considered
highly suitable for change are depicted on Figure H10, which depicts a series of clustered residential
“villages.” Potential housing units include a mix of building types ranging from townhomes to high-
rises to accommodate a variety of household types and incomes.
Based on the residential capacities calculated within the Sites Analysis and Inventory, approximately
2,061 new residential units could realistically be developed in the Airport Area as new and
replacement housing at the minimum required density of 30 units per acre.

Conclusion
As demonstrated in Table H32, the City has sufficient sites to accommodate the City’s the 2014-2021
RHNA allocation. These sites realistically provide the opportunity to create approximately 4,612 new
housing units in the community, (up to 3,237 units excluding the Banning Ranch area), significantly
exceeding the combined future housing need of five dwellings.
The City of Newport Beach is not a residential developer and, therefore, must rely on private
developers or organizations that have the capacity to develop, acquire, and manage affordable housing
developments. Given the allowed densities of between 30 and 50 dwelling units per acre, the John
Wayne Airport Area has the greatest potential to accommodate development of lower-income
housing in the City.

SITES TO ACCOMMODATE THE RHNA FOR LOWER-
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
Given the allowed densities of between 30 and 50 dwelling units per acre, the John Wayne Airport
Area has the greatest potential to accommodate the development of lower-income housing in the
City. Pursuant to Government Code Section 65583.2, a minimum density of 30 du/ac shall be
deemed appropriate to accommodate housing for lower-income households for urbanized areas. The
City’s 2014-2024 RHNA allocation results in a total lower-income housing need of only two dwelling
units. However, the following analysis was prepared in support of the City’s lower-income housing
need identified in the previous 2006-2014 Housing Element and remains relevant to illustrate the
significant opportunity that continues to exist in the City for lower-income housing development. In
addition to the information provided within the Sites Analysis and Inventory, this section of the
Housing Element analyzes how the existing uses, land-use regulations, and parcel sizes impact the
viability of this strategy to accommodate lower-income households within the planning period.
Non-Vacant Sites
The General Plan provides for the maintenance and limited expansion of the currently developed mix
of research and development, office, high technology, industrial and commercial uses with the Airport
Area; however, the General Plan also identifies this area as one of the greatest opportunities in the
City to create new residential neighborhoods through the replacement of existing uses and new
construction on underutilized parking lots. The fact that these properties are currently developed with
existing uses should not be viewed as an impediment to new residential development. With high land
values in Newport Beach and a strong demand for housing, the feasibility for infill and reuse of these
sites within the Airport Area is supported by several factors:
     ■ Irvine Business Complex- The Airport Area shares many similarities and borders the Irvine
         Business Complex (IBC) located in the City of Irvine. Similar to the Airport Area, the IBC
         was developed in the 1970’s solely as a commercial and industrial center; however, the IBC
         has increasingly experienced redevelopment in the form of residential and mixed-use housing.
         Market forces have increased housing and mixed-use development in the IBC. Various tilt-up
         industrial buildings have been demolished over the years and reconstructed with high-density
         apartments and condominiums. According to City of Irvine staff reports, a number of factors
         have created an impetus for the IBC to transition from a predominately low density office and
         industrial park to an urban, mixed-use center. These factors include; 1) a strong residential
         market demand combined with a lack of available land in the region for new housing; 2) an
         existing stock of aging, low density tilt-up industrial buildings; and 3) a key location at the
         confluence of several freeways and regional circulation systems. Given the similar location of
         the Airport Area and high land values in Newport Beach, these same factors that have
         influenced the development in the IBC also influence development in the Airport Area.
     ■ To determine the market feasibility of units developed at densities prescribed for the Airport
         Area, housing development densities in the adjoining IBC were reviewed. Data indicated that
         units constructed have averaged 50 units per acre; therefore, it can reasonably be expected that
         redevelopment of existing non-vacant sites within the Airport Area is feasible given a similar
         density limit.
                                                        Newport Beach General Plan                 5-75

Housing Element
    ■ Several property owners and developers have approached and are currently processing
        applications with the City of Newport Beach to request consideration for new housing
        development, such as owners of the Uptown Newport site (formerly referred to as Conexant)
        where development on 25 of the total 26.9 acres has been proposed. The Uptown Newport
        project would result in the demolition and replacement of 441,127 square feet of existing
        industrial and office buildings with a residential and mixed-use development. Utilizing a
        density bonus, a total of 1,244 housing units, consisting of approximately 1,060 market-rate
        units and 184 affordable units (depending on final target income level) would be developed.
        In addition, 11,500 square feet of neighborhood-serving uses, a Central Park and two pocket
        parks totaling two acres, and required parking would be developed in a pedestrian-friendly
        village. The project was approved by the City Council on March 13, 2013. Implementation of
        this project is expected to occur over two phases, with the first phase anticipated to begin in
        late 2014 and the second phase beginning in 2017. To the west of Uptown Newport, property
        owners of the Koll Center Newport are in the process of preparing a Planned Community
        Development Plan amendment for submission to develop 260 infill housing units within the
        approximately 25 acres of surface parking areas; public hearings are anticipated for late 2015.
    ■ Not all 207 acres of MU-H2 properties within the Airport Area are required to be redeveloped
        to achieve the maximum development limit of 2,220 units. Based on the Sites Analysis and
        Inventory, cumulatively, areas determined as strong candidates for redevelopment contain
        approximately 96 acres. Only 44 acres would be required to be redeveloped at the maximum
        density (50 du/ac) and 73 acres at the minimum density (30 du/ac) to achieve the maximum
        development limit of 2,200 units. Housing development, however, is likely to occur as both
        infill and re-development as evidenced by submittal of applications by property owners such
        as Koll and Uptown Newport.
Lot Consolidation
The General Plan provides policies for the orderly evolution of the Airport Area from a single
purpose business park to a mixed-use district with cohesive residential villages integrated within the
fabric of office, industrial, retail, and airport-related business. The goal of the General Plan is to create
livable neighborhoods with a strong sense of place and community. General Plan policies indicate that
residential villages shall be centered on neighborhood parks interconnected by pedestrian walkways
with a mix of housing types and buildings at a sufficient scale to achieve a complete neighborhood. In
formulating General Plan policies, it was important that residential development not occur on a
“piecemeal” basis, but rather there must be sufficient critical mass to enable each increment of
housing to stand alone as a viable and livable neighborhood. Therefore, the General Plan establishes
several policies that set forth criteria for the configuration and design of new residential villages in the
Airport Area. Specifically, General Plan Policy LU 6.15.6 defines standards for the development of
cohesive and integrated neighborhoods. It stipulates that residential neighborhoods shall contain a
minimum of 10 contiguous acres centered on a neighborhood park and other amenities. The first
phase of residential development in each village shall be at least five gross acres, exclusive of rights-of-
ways.
The Uptown Newport and Koll parcels are large in area, 26.9 acres and 25 acres respectively, and are
therefore not constrained by the minimum 10-acre site requirements. The Uptown Newport parcels
are identified as Potential Residential Village Site 4 and the Koll parcels are identified as Potential
Residential Village Site 3 in the Sites Analysis and Inventory. The other two potential residential

                                                                                Housing Element
villages identified within the Sites Analysis and Inventory would require the assemblage of several
independently owned parcels in order to meet the minimum 10-acre site requirement. Although it is
not unreasonable to assume that larger scale, for-profit developers will have the means and ability to
acquire and assemble the required number of parcels over time, an affordable housing developer with
a smaller scale development proposal, such as a low-income housing tax credit project, may find it
difficult to assemble the necessary sites.
Recognizing that General Plan Policy LU6.15.6 may result in a potential constraint to the
development of affordable housing in the Airport Area and consistent with Programs 3.2.2 and 3.2.3
of the 2008-2014 Housing Element, the City approved an amendment to the Newport Place Planned
Community (PC11) to eliminate the constraint on the smaller parcels located within Potential
Residential Village Sites 1 and 2. Specifically, the amendment permits residential development that
includes a minimum of 30 percent of the units affordable to lower-income households with the approval
of a Site Development Review. Developments meeting these criteria are also eligible for a waiver of the
minimum 10-acre site area requirement. The amendment also established minimum development
regulations including building height, setbacks, and parking requirements.
The City will continue to encourage affordable housing developers to collaborate with the developers
of the Uptown Newport and Koll developments. Within these developments, there may be
opportunities for these developers to integrate an affordable housing project. There may also be the
opportunity for agreements to develop the necessary affordable housing units for projects that utilize
a density bonus. City staff will also compile and provide a list of interested affordable housing
developers to current and future developers of residential villages within the Airport Area.
Adequacy of Parcel Sizes
Given the economies of scale, it is important that housing opportunity sites are of sufficient size to
facilitate the development of housing affordable to lower-income households. Based on information
received from HCD, most assisted housing developments utilizing State or federal financial resources
typically include at least 50 to 80 dwelling units. For the purpose of this discussion, a site that can
accommodate the construction of a minimum of 50 dwelling units shall be considered to be of
sufficient size for the development of lower-income housing. At the minimum density requirement of
30 du/ac, a minimum parcel size of 1.7 acres would be required. At a maximum density of 50 du/ac, a
minimum parcel size of one acre would be necessary.
As required by General Plan Policy LU6.15.6, a development site of a minimum of 10 acres will easily
facilitate the development of housing affordable to lower-income households; however, for projects
that include a minimum of 30 percent of the units affordable to lower-income households and are
eligible for a waiver from the lot assemblage requirements discussed above, it is necessary to evaluate
whether the individual parcels identified within the Sites Analysis and Inventory are of sufficient size
to facilitate the development of lower-income housing units (1.7 to 1 acre in size minimum).
There are over 22 separate parcels identified as housing opportunity sites within the Sites Analysis and
Inventory for the Airport Area. Of the 22 total parcels, 19 parcels are greater than 1 acre in size and
cumulatively have the potential to yield 4,712 dwelling units at a density of 50 du/ac. Also, of the 22
total parcels, there are 11 parcels greater than 1.7 acre in size and cumulatively have the potential to
yield 2,503 dwelling units at a density of 30 du/ac. The aforementioned development yields exceed
the 2,200-unit maximum development established by the General Plan for the Airport Area and

ENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES
The City of Newport Beach fully enforces provisions of Title 24 of the California Administrative
Code, which require energy conservation in new residences. Standards in Title 24 create energy
savings of approximately 50 percent over residential construction practices utilized prior to the
Title 24 enactment.
The City of Newport Beach Building Division is knowledgeable about energy conserving design
innovations and solar technology. The department utilizes the Solar Systems Code Review Manual
and its companion document, the Pool and Spa Solar Systems Code Review Manual, published by the
International Code Council (ICC) to facilitate installation of appropriate solar systems.
Under existing state law (the California Resources Code), local jurisdictions may adopt structural
energy conservation standards in excess of the existing state standard. Such an increase in standards
would be of marginal value because of the moderate climate of the City of Newport Beach. A major
concern pertaining to energy conservation is the relationship of housing to employment and related
affected transportation modes. Although specific energy savings are difficult to quantify because of
the myriad of variables involved in a transportation system, it is generally true that physical proximity
between home and work saves transportation energy. Existing affordability concerns in Newport
Beach increase energy use by forcing workers employed within the City to seek less expensive housing
outside the City. New mixed-use development opportunities may help by reducing the length and
frequency of automobile trips and energy usage. However, the jobs/housing imbalance in the City
cannot be totally mitigated by increased residential development within the City.
Newport Beach is not in an area of geothermal or significant wind activity and consequently cannot
take advantage of these “alternative” energy sources. It appears that the City, through enforcement of
Title 24 and sensitivity to innovative design, is maximizing residential energy conservation
opportunities.
The City’s updated Natural Resources Element includes Policies NR 24.1, 24.2, 24.3, 24.4, and 24.5
which promote energy efficient construction for residential development and encourage the provision
of energy alternatives such as solar power. In addition, Housing Programs 4.2.1 through 4.2.5 in the
Housing Plan promote and encourage the improved energy efficiency of all housing types.

NONGOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Community Attitudes
The citizenry in Newport Beach is well organized through neighborhood homeowners associations
and community environmental groups. There exists strong public sentiment in favor of preserving the
suburban environment in the City.
Public sentiment is a constraint because of its influence on local officials and because of the ability of
citizens to establish development policies and zoning through the initiative process. In November
2000, an initiative passed in the City of Newport Beach that requires a general election be conducted
to approve General Plan Amendment applications that include increases of 100 or more dwelling
units or that would generate more than 100 peak hour trips. See Governmental Constraints for
additional discussion of this initiative.
Financing Constraints
Financing costs largely are not subject to local influence. Control of interest rates is determined by
national policies and economic conditions. Interest rates directly influence purchasing power of
home-buyers and cost of home construction through construction loans. Currently, interest rates are
historically low and enable many homebuyers to obtain favorable mortgage terms; however, the
banking industry has adopted more conservative mortgage underwriting standards that have had a
greater impact on lower-and moderate-income families qualifying more mortgages. More conservative
lending criteria have also created difficulties in obtaining construction loans for new residential
development, negatively impacting housing supply throughout Southern California. Difficulty in
producing housing affordable to first-time homebuyers is therefore compounded. Also, because
development costs in Newport Beach are higher than in other areas of the state, housing is even
further out of the reach for first-time homebuyers.
Land and Construction Costs
Land costs and construction costs are the major components of housing cost. Land costs are a
function of the market and are relatively high due to the City’s location near major employment
centers and the Pacific Ocean. Due to the built out nature of the City, vacant land that is available for
development of any kind and for affordable housing projects in particular, is extremely limited.
Construction costs also are set by the market and are influenced by a variety of factors including
availability and price of materials and labor, quality of construction, and amenities offered.
Cost factors used to estimate the direct costs of construction (costs for labor, materials, site
improvements, and contractor’s fees) for new housing are approximately as follows:
    ■ Multi-Family (per gross square foot)
       $140 apartment buildings /$150 condominiums9
    ■ Single-Family Dwellings (per gross square foot)
       Wood Frame - $130.00 (average quality); $160.00 (good quality)

Housing Element
Growing market demand for housing in Newport Beach and little remaining vacant land in the City
has had a strong impact on financial aspects of residential development in the City. The greatest
impact of this market demand on cost of new housing is seen in the price of residential land in the
City. According to the 2008 Inclusionary Housing In-Lieu Fee Study, land entitled for multi-family
residential housing in the City would cost approximately $3.5 million per acre. It is estimated that such
land value would now cost over $3.5 million per acre.10 Density increases often are used to offset high
construction and land costs. Density increases may decrease land costs on a per-unit basis, but sales
prices of units in Newport Beach indicate density increases do not necessarily bring the cost of
housing to consumers to a level that is affordable to lower- or even moderate-income households.
Assuming that multi-family housing would be built at 20 units an acre, the land cost would be
approximately $178,000 per unit.
In addition, high residential densities involving buildings taller than three stories will greatly increase
unit marketability in many areas of the City because of the addition of a view factor. Regardless of
square-footage or density, a unit with a blue water or white water view can be marketed as a luxury
condominium and command an extremely high price.
Higher land costs in the City are the main factor in higher square-footage costs for housing provision.
High land costs also trigger higher costs in other areas of development. To balance land prices,
developers must increase amenities within the housing unit as well as within the community area.
Thus, a higher land price promotes development of higher-end units.
Infrastructure Constraints
The City of Newport Beach is primarily a built-out community that is adequately served by existing
infrastructure including sewer, water, and police and fire services. Presently, the main area in the
community that is not served by any water or sewer infrastructure is Banning Ranch. However, if the
Banning Ranch area is annexed to the City, the City intends to provide service to this area. 11 With the
exception of the undeveloped Banning Ranch area, new development will primarily occur through the
re-use and intensification of existing land uses in other areas of the City as previously discussed.
According to the City of Newport Beach Environmental Impact Report for the General Plan Update
(April 2006), new residential development associated with implementation of the General Plan Land
Use Element would not exceed the capacity of existing sewer and water facilities or police or fire
protection services. Specifically, new residential development within the Airport Area, Newport
Center, Mariners’ Mile, and Balboa Peninsula areas will be adequately served by existing infrastructure.
In accordance with Government Code Section 65583.2(b)(5), the Sites Analysis and Inventory
(Appendix H3) includes a description of existing or planned water, sewer, and dry utilities supply,
including the availability and access to distribution facilities.
Environmental Constraints
Very few areas of vacant, developable land remain within Newport Beach. Open areas include the
beach, bay, parks, and undeveloped areas such as Banning Ranch, and the canyons, hillsides, and
bluffs of Newport Ridge/Coast. The Housing Element concentrates new infill housing development
and redevelopment within several specified areas: Newport Center/Fashion Island, Balboa Village,
Balboa Peninsula, Mariners’ Mile, West Newport Mesa, and the Airport Area. Development within

each of these areas would involve the re-use or intensification of land uses, with no significant
environmental constraints within these areas.12 The only housing opportunity area identified in the
updated General Plan and associated Environmental Impact Report with significant environmental
constraints is the Banning Ranch area. The Banning Ranch area includes significant environmental
resources including wetlands, habitat areas, sensitive wildlife, and valuable biological resources. In
conjunction with City’s approval of the Newport Banning Ranch Planned Community Development
Plan on July 27, 2012, the City also certified the Final Environmental Impact Report for the project.
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
This section of the Housing Element addresses actual and potential City governmental constraints on
development of housing for all income levels. Such constraints include land use controls (zoning),
building codes and their enforcement, site improvements, fees, and local processing procedures. In
many of these areas, localities have varying degrees of discretion to modify state standards for local
implementation and/or conditions. Included in this analysis are constraints created by specific state
regulations (i.e. Subdivision Map Act, Coastal Act, CEQA).
Voter Initiative: Section 423 of the City Charter
All housing opportunities identified in the Table H36 (Sites Analysis and Inventory Summary) are not subject to
Charter Section 423 as a result of voter approval of Measure V in November 2006.
Background
In November 2000, the voters of the City of Newport Beach approved a ballot initiative (Measure S),
which is now “Section 423 of the City Charter.” It requires voter approval of any project that
increases density, intensity, or peak hour trip, above that provided for in the General Plan.
Significance is quantified as 100 or more dwelling units, over 100 peak hour trips, or 40,000 or more
square feet of nonresidential floor area. Charter Section 423 applies exclusively to General Plan
amendments.
Should a developer propose a housing project that exceeds the allocation provided in the General
Plan, or propose a change in land use of an underperforming property, a General Plan Amendment
would be required and review of the project would be subject to review pursuant to the Measure S
Guidelines. If the project exceeds the established threshold(s) and is approved by the City Council,
the General Plan amendment would then be subject to a vote. The project proponent would then
have to wait until the next regular municipal election or until a special election if the City and project
proponent enter into an agreement to share the costs of the special election.
2006 Election—Voter Approval of the General Plan Update
On November 11, 2006, the City’s comprehensive General Plan Update was placed on the ballot
(Measure V) as required by Charter Section 423 and approved by the voters. As a result, all dwelling
units and residential densities in the current General Plan can be developed without a General Plan
Amendment and vote. Therefore, it is important to note that all sites identified in Table H36 (Sites
Analysis and Inventory Summary) are not subject to an additional vote under Charter Section 423.

Housing Element
Pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915, Charter Section 423 will have no impact on
the City’s ability to provide density bonuses required by state law for affordable housing projects on
sites already designated for residential development. California Government Code Section 65915(f)(5)
states:
        (5) All density calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
        The granting of a density bonus shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan
        amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. As used in
        subdivision (b), "total units" or "total dwelling units" does not include units permitted by a density
        bonus awarded pursuant to this section or any local law granting a greater density bonus. The density
        bonus provided by this section shall apply to housing developments consisting of five or more dwelling
        units.
However, Charter Section 423 could be a constraint to development if a development proposal
exceeds the updated General Plan levels for market rate units and/or affordable units beyond those
provided for in state density bonus law. It is important to note, however, that Charter Section 423 will
not have any impact on the allowed density established for the housing sites identified to meet the
City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation, including affordable units. As indicated in the prior
paragraph, this section is only applicable when a change to the existing General Plan is proposed.

Zoning
The City Zoning Code is complex but typical for an already highly developed community. The Code
uses a “district” concept appropriate to the diverse urban patterns and topography found in the City.
The Zoning Code contains six basic zoning districts and six mixed-use zoning districts (excluding
Planned Community districts and other specialized districts) to regulate residential uses within the
City. The basic zoning districts are R-A (Residential Agricultural), R-1 (Single Family Residential), R-2
(Two-Family Residential), Medium Density Residential (RMD) and RM (Multi-Family Residential).
The mixed-use zoning districts are MU-V (Mixed-Use Vertical), MU-MM (Mixed-Use Mariners Mile),
MU-DW (Mixed-Use Dover/Westcliff), MU-CV/15th St. (Mixed-Use Cannery Village and 15th Street),
MU-W1 (Mixed-Use Water), and MU-W2 (Mixed-Use Water).

Zoning Code development standards could be considered constraints to development because they
limit for the density and sizes of dwelling units. However, zoning standards are designed to protect
the quality of life and provide, at a minimum, access to sunlight and fresh air. Access to air and sun
are guaranteed through building setbacks, open volume requirements, maximum building heights, and
floor area limit.
The Newport Beach Zoning Code controls density for each zoning district through development
regulations pertaining to land required per dwelling unit. In the older neighborhoods of the City,
density standards have not changed since 1936. Densities of approximately thirty dwelling units per
acre are still allowed in these areas. In the newer neighborhoods, developed since the 1960s, single-
family densities are generally less than 10 dwelling units per acre. The City’s Codes contain many
procedures to grant relief from certain development standards which can be of assistance in allowing
higher densities. However, even if the City is willing to approve reductions in some of the zoning
regulations (such as parking), the California Coastal Commission has similar development
requirements which would still need to be complied with for properties in the Coastal Zone.
Maximum density in the Multiple Residential Zone (RM) and the Mixed-Use Zones is a function of
the size of the lot. For example, a minimum lot area per dwelling unit of 1,200 square feet applies,
which translates to a maximum density of 36 units per net acre.

Permitted Residential Uses
Table H35 summarizes permitted residential uses by zoning districts.
Single-, Two-, and Multi-Family Residential: These classifications include mobile homes and factory-
built housing.
Group Residential: Group residential is defined as shared living quarters, occupied by two or more
persons not living together as a single-housekeeping unit. This classification includes, without
limitation, boarding or rooming houses, dormitories, fraternities, sororities, and private residential
clubs, but excludes residential care facilities and SROs. Group residential uses are not permitted in any
zoning district.
Residential Care Facilities: Licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons are permitted by
right in all residentially-zoned properties, in accordance with state law, and are treated as single family
residences. Residential care facilities for seven or more persons (Residential Care General) and
unlicensed residential care facilities are permitted in the following zoning districts, with a Use Permit
issued by a Hearing Officer:
   ■ Residential District— RM and RMD zoning districts.
   ■ Planned Community Districts—Property development regulations applicable to residential
       districts, related to residential care facilities, shall also apply to the corresponding portions of
       the PC Districts.
Convalescent Facilities: Convalescent facilities that provide care on a 24-hour basis for persons
requiring regular medical attention, but excluding facilities providing surgical or emergency medical
services are permitted in the RM and RMD Districts with a Conditional Use Permit, in the PI District
with a Minor Use Permit, and in the OM District with no Use Permit required.
Accessory Dwelling Units: The City’s Zoning Code includes provisions for “granny units” (accessory,
age-restricted units) which may be approved by the Zoning Administrator in single- and multi-family
districts. The accessory dwelling unit is intended for the sole occupancy of 1 or 2 adult persons who
are 60 years or older, and the size of the unit does not exceed 640 square feet. Since adoption of the
City’s “accessory dwelling unit” provisions, 24 age-restricted units have been authorized and 15
constructed.

Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Residential Hotels: Within the Zoning Code, SROs fall under the
classification of Visitor Accommodations and are defined as buildings with six or more guest rooms
without kitchen facilities in individual rooms, or kitchen facilities for the exclusive use of guests, and
which are also the primary residences of the hotel guests. SROs are permitted in all commercial and
office zoning districts with the approval of a conditional use permit. To facilitate the development of
SROs within these districts, the City will not develop, nor impose, a standard set of conditions or use
restrictions on SROs; instead, each application would be evaluated individually and approved based
upon its own merits and circumstances. Project specific conditions may be placed on the project by
the Planning Commission to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses.
Emergency Shelters: On October 15, 2008, the state enacted SB 2, which amended State Housing
Element Law. This legislation requires the City to designate a zoning district or districts where
emergency shelters will be allowed without requiring a use permit or other discretionary review. The
designated district or districts must include sufficient capacity to accommodate the need for
emergency shelters.
State law defines an emergency shelter as a means of housing with minimal supportive services for
homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of 6 months or less by a homeless person. No
individual or household may be denied emergency shelter because of inability to pay.
Based on the service records provided by agencies that provide housing and other services for the
homeless in Newport Beach, and conversations with Newport Beach Police Department and
Newport-Mesa School District, an annual estimate of 13313 homeless persons from Newport Beach
utilize emergency shelters or services over the course of one year. It should be noted that this is a
conservative estimate in that a number of the individuals may be receiving assistance from multiple
service providers, and therefore, may be counted more than once.
The Zoning Code provides two zoning districts that permit emergency shelters without the need for a
conditional use permit. These zoning districts are the Private Institutions (PI) and Office-Airport
(OA). Section 20.48.100 of the Zoning Code also establishes specific standards and the following
performance standards for emergency shelters which comply with state law and do not constrain
development:
         A maximum of 40 beds per shelter;
         Off-street parking based on demonstrated need;
         Size and location of exterior and interior waiting drop-off (10 sq. ft. per bed min.);
         Design and amenities (min. 35 sq. ft. of sleeping area per bed and requirements for bathroom
         and shower facilities);
         Provision of on-site management;
         Proximity to other shelters (min. 300–foot separation);
         Length of stay (max. 14 days); and
         Security, litter and graffiti.

Properties designated for PI are distributed throughout the City, but primarily located along major
transportation corridors and offer easy access to public transportation. The PI zoning district is
intended to provide for areas appropriate for privately owned facilities that serve the public, including
places for assembly/meeting facilities (e.g., religious assembly), congregate care homes, cultural
institutions, health care facilities, marinas, museums, private schools, yacht clubs, and comparable
facilities. There are over 44 parcels totaling approximately 135 acres in the proposed PI zoning
district. Several of the existing uses on these properties are religious assembly uses, many of which
consist of large campuses. Given the high land costs in the City, these religious assembly facilities
could provide the best means to facilitate the development and management of emergency shelters in
the City.
Properties designated for AO are located within three large blocks east of John Wayne Airport, west
of Birch Street, north of Bristol Street/73 Freeway, and south of MacArthur Boulevard. These
properties are also located along major transportation corridors and offer easy access to public
transportation. The AO zoning district is intended to provide for areas appropriate for the
development of properties adjoining the John Wayne Airport for uses that support or benefit from
airport operations. These may include corporate and professional offices; automobile sales, rental and
service; aviation sales and service; hotels; and accessory retail, restaurant, and service uses. There are
over 56 parcels totaling approximately 54 acres in the AO zoning district. Several of the existing uses
on these properties are low and medium density professional office buildings, many of which are
aging and offer affordable rents compared to most other parts of the City. These properties should
provide realistic opportunities for reuse of these structures for the development and management of
emergency shelters in the City.
Combined, the PI and AO zoning districts consist of over 98 parcels and 189 acres. By allowing
emergency shelters as permitted uses within these districts, adequate sites are available for the
potential development of emergency shelters in the City.
Transitional and Supportive Housing: As defined by Section 50675.2(h) of the Health and Safety Code,
transitional housing means buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under
program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation for the unit to
another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less
than 6 months.
As defined by Section 50675.14(b) of Health and Safety Code, supportive housing is housing with no
limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population as defined in subsection (d) of Section
53260, and that is linked to onsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the
housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when
possible, work in the community.
Pursuant to the requirements of SB2, the current Zoning Code provides definitions for transitional
and supportive housing uses and clarifies that these uses are treated in the same manner as other
residential uses of the same types and are subject to the same permitting processes. For example, if
the transitional or supportive housing is provided within a residential care facility, that facility is
subject to the same permitting processes as other residential care facilities in that zone. If the
transitional or supportive housing is provided to individuals or groups living in rental apartments as
single housekeeping units, then the use is permitted by right as a multi-family residential use where
multi-family housing is permitted.

Zoning Code Consistency
The updated General Plan created several new residential development opportunities and land use
categories. Specific policies regarding land use capacity, encouragement of residential development,
consolidation, and density levels are contained in the Land Use Element. These land use categories,
associated densities, and FAR limitations are identified in Table H34. For example, the Land Use
Element calls for residential development in Airport Area to have a density of 50 units per acre,
averaged over the first phase for each residential village. The minimum density for subsequent phase
of residential development is 30 units per acre.
The comprehensive Zoning Code Update, completed in October, 2010, implements the land use
changes included in the 2006 General Plan update, including creating new zoning districts and
development regulations for several areas of the City where residential and mixed-use designations
have been added. The General Plan Land Use designation of MU-H2 for the Airport Area creates the
greatest opportunity for the City to provide new residential development. Properties in this area are
currently zoned Planned Community and regulated by the development standards contained within
the following three Planned Community development plan texts: 1) The Newport Place Planned
Community (PC 11); 2) The Koll Center Planned Community (PC 15), and The Uptown Newport
Planned Community (PC-58). On July 24, 2012, Newport Place PC was amended to establish a
residential development overlay where multi-unit residential developments, which include a minimum
of 30 percent of the units affordable to lower-income households, are permitted subject to site
development review. On March 13, 2013, the Uptown Newport Planned Community was created
(formerly a part of the Koll Center Planned Community) to specifically serve as zoning document for
the construction of up to 1,244 residential units, 11,500 square feet of retail commercial, and 2.05
acres of park space. Both the Newport Place and Uptown Newport Planned Communities require
densities between 30 du/acre and 50 du/acre, consistent with the densities of the General Plan, and
allow additional density opportunities with a density bonus. The Koll Center Planned Community text
was also amended on March 13, 2013, to remove the properties now regulated by the new Uptown
Newport Planned Community. The remaining properties within Koll Center Planned Community do
not include the allowance for residential uses at this time; however, Koll, the primary property owner
within the development area, has submitted an application requesting the ability to develop 550
residential dwelling units.
The Subdivision Process
Basic provisions of the City of Newport Beach Subdivision Code are similar to those of most
jurisdictions of similar size to Newport Beach. The Subdivision Code contains design standards that
provide minimum criteria for development. In some cases, the Code allows flexibility in application of
its provisions and thereby potentially could reduce development costs. Examples of such cases are
allowances for the development of nonconforming lots and park fee waivers. The Subdivision Code
also addresses improvements (e.g., street trees, placing utilities underground, street lighting) that add
to development costs. Additionally, the Newport Beach Subdivision Code requires dedication of
parkland and/or payment of in-lieu fees concurrently to recordation of a final subdivision map. This
requirement is made in compliance with state law, but also adds to costs of development.

Housing Element
Inclusionary Housing Ordinance
Due to the lack of dedicated funding sources such as redevelopment agency housing set-aside funds,
Newport Beach adopted an inclusionary housing policy in prior Housing Elements. To specifically
assist with the City’s total RHNA construction goal of 1,914 units, including 770 lower-income units,
for the 2008-2014 planning period, the previous Housing Element included Housing Program 2.2.1
that required an average of 15 percent of the units in a new residential development be affordable to
persons of very low-, low-, or moderate-income, or that an equivalent in-lieu fee be paid. For projects
where an in-lieu fee is not paid, or for projects with more than 50 residential units, the Program
required the preparation and approval of an Affordable Housing Implementation Plan (AHIP) setting
forth the method of satisfying the affordable housing requirement. On May 11, 2010, the City Council
adopted Ordinance No. 2010-9 adding a chapter (Chapter 19.54) to the City’s Subdivision Code and
establishing the specific requirements implementing Housing Program 2.2.1 of the prior Housing
Element.
Since the adoption of the ordinance, several members of the development community, including the
Building Industry Association of Orange County, argued that the inclusionary housing requirements
are a barrier to the production of housing due to increased costs. The City has also since pursued
other programs to help facilitate the development of the City’s existing and projected housing needs,
such as the adoption of Residential Development Overlay standards in the Newport Place Planned
Community District of the Airport Area, promotion of density bonuses and promotion of senior
accessory dwelling unit allowances. The City is also projected to have a fund balance of $4.5 million
by fiscal year 2014, from previously approved projects subject to the inclusionary ordinance. This
fund will assist with the production, rehabilitation, or preservation of affordable housing during this
planning period. Lastly, the City’s RHNA allocation for the 2014-2021 planning period has also been
significantly reduced, with a total projected housing need of five units. Based on the increased
financial constraints due to the inclusionary housing program and the availability of other programs
and resources for the production of affordable housing, it has been determined that it is appropriate
to remove the inclusionary housing program at this time.
Local Coastal Program
Portions of the City are located within the Coastal Zone and regulated under the California Coastal
Act. The City does not have a certified Local Coastal Program (LCP) and, therefore, does not have
the jurisdiction to issue Coastal Development Permits (CDP). The City does, however, have a Coastal
Land Use Plan that has been certified by the California Coastal Commission. Since the City does not
have permit jurisdiction, the City reviews pending development projects for consistency with the
City’s General Plan, Coastal Land Use Plan and Zoning regulations before an applicant can file for a
coastal development permit with the Coastal Commission. The City is presently in the process of
preparing an Implementation Plan for the City’s Coastal Land Use Plan.
The Coastal Land Use Plan portion of the Local Coastal Program, approved by the California Coastal
Commission on February 5, 2009, and adopted by the City Council on July 14, 2009, might be a
constraint to providing affordable housing. The Coastal Land Use Plan consists of land use
designations and resource protection and development polices for the Coastal Zone. The Land Use
Plan policies result in consistency with Chapter 3 of California Coastal Act, which addresses the
planning and management of coastal resources.

One of the major goals of the California Coastal Act and the Coastal Land Use Plan is to assure the
priority for coastal-dependent and coastal-related development over other development in the Coastal
Zone, which is a constraint on residential development, particularly in areas on or near the shoreline.
The Coastal Land Use Plan indicates that areas within the Coastal Zone designated for residential use
include senior citizen housing facilities (whose occupancy is limited to senior persons, as defined by
state or federal law). In addition, the Coastal Land Use Plan contains restrictions applicable to twelve
sensitive habitat areas that limit potential residential development areas and that control and regulate
locations on new buildings and structures to ensure (to the extent practical) preservation of unique
natural resources and to minimize alteration of natural land forms along bluffs and cliffs.
Mello Act
In 1981, the California Legislature enacted SB 626 (Mello), which added Government Code
Section 65590 and eliminated certain provisions of the California Coastal Act that required local coastal
programs to include housing policies and programs; Section 65590 mandates coastal communities
require inclusion of low- and moderate-income housing as part of new residential developments and
replacement of low- and moderate-income housing eliminated as a result of demolition of existing
housing within coastal zones of those communities. On August 19, 1982, the Newport Beach City
Council adopted Council Policy P-1, establishing administrative guidelines and implementation
procedures to administer Section 65590 within the coastal zone areas of the City. This Policy now is
in the Zoning Code in Chapter 20.34 which establishes the requirement of a Coastal Residential
Development Permit for certain activities involving dwelling units within the Coastal Zone. This
permit ensures compliance with state law by maximizing low and moderate-income housing
opportunities within the Newport Beach Coastal Zone.
The Community Development Director is required to make a determination as to the applicability of
Chapter 20.34 of the Zoning Code when a property owner within the Coastal Zone proposes to
demolish or convert 11 or more dwelling units in two or more structures, or to demolish or convert
three or more dwelling units in one structure. A determination is not required for demolition or
conversion of a residential structure to establish a nonresidential use that is “coastal related” or
“coastal dependent” and that is consistent with provisions of the City of Newport Beach Local
Coastal Program Land Use Plan. In addition, a determination is not required to demolish a residential
structure declared a public nuisance or to reconstruct a nonconforming building damaged by fire,
earthquake, or other calamity when a use permit is not required.
The Newport Beach Municipal Code indicates replacement affordable units in the Coastal Zone shall
be provided on a one-for-one basis when demolition or conversion activities involve low- and
moderate-income dwelling units, if feasible. The test of feasibility shall be initially conducted at the
Housing Element standard and subsequently at progressively higher standards contained in California
State Health and Safety Code Section 50093. Furthermore, the City of Newport Beach and the owner
of the low- and moderate- income dwelling units provided are required to enter into an affordable
housing agreement (to be recorded against the property) governing the dwelling units.
Senior citizen housing facilities may require higher dwelling unit limits than normally allowed in the
Municipal Code. Such higher dwelling unit limits are allowed and are consistent with the Local Coastal
Program when a finding can be made that the use is a particular benefit to the City and that traffic
generated by the project is not greater than the predominant use allowed in the area. Senior citizen
housing facilities must conform to floor area limits of applicable residential zone(s).

California Environmental Quality Act
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was enacted in 1970, and requires governmental
agencies that propose to approve projects to undertake analysis of environmental impacts resulting
from those projects.
The CEQA process can be lengthy, and project delays can increase costs to developers. Likewise,
costs to prepare environmental documentation necessary to satisfy CEQA can be quite high, and
traditionally is borne by the project applicant.
The CEQA process particularly affects Newport Beach due to rich natural resources in the area.
Concern for protection of natural resources within Newport Beach has in the past required, and will
continue to require, modifications to intensity of residential development and design of projects. The
City environmental review process is responsive, well coordinated, and meets CEQA requirements.
Review of this environmental reporting process for purposes of preparation of this Element illustrates
it is not excessive or overly restrictive according to state law.
Building Codes and Enforcement
Building codes regulate new construction and rehabilitation, and are designed to ensure adequate
protection against fire, structural collapse, unsanitary conditions, and other safety hazards. The City
Council adopted the 2010 edition of the California Codes.
These building codes establish minimum standards for construction to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of citizens. These codes and regulations are based on uniform standards and are applied
throughout the region and therefore are not considered to significantly impact construction costs or
constrain the provision of housing for person with disabilities. State energy conservation regulations,
which are cost effective in the long term, may add to construction costs.
Impact Fees
The role fees play in constraining production of housing is difficult to measure, although fees can
affect housing prices in certain markets. The theory behind fees is that new development should bear
its own costs and these costs should be spread equitably among new development. State law requires
fees bear a reasonable relationship to actual costs incurred by a city. However, fees may add
significantly to the cost of a housing unit. To offset the cost of constructing housing units, the
Newport Beach City Council adopted a program that allows for the waiver of fees when affordable
housing units are proposed. In addition the Municipal Code allows for the waiver of fair share trip
fees. The in-lieu housing fee was established as a component of the City’s Inclusionary Housing
Policy that has been eliminated from the current Housing Element; therefore, the in-lieu housing fee
will no longer be applicable to future developments and eliminates a potential constraint. The City of
Newport Beach fees for discretionary applications are compared to discretionary application fees of
various nearby cities in Table H36 and Table H37.

Development Review Process
All residential development in the City requires review to determine compliance with the City’s
development regulations and guidelines. The development review process may require a discretionary
approval as part of the process and may include actions such as zone change, modification permit or
use permits. The City’s review procedures are considered efficient with typical zone change requests
reaching completion in as few as 90 days if no environmental impact report is required. An
Environmental Impact Report may require up to one year before a decision is rendered, which is
within the time frame established by state law. Use Permits and subdivision maps typically can be
approved in six to eight weeks, provided an environmental impact report is not required. Planning
Commission decisions on maps, and use permits are final unless appealed within 14 days of the date
of decision to the City Council, or unless a member of the City Council within 14 days of the date of
decision requests to review the Planning Commission decision. Zone Changes require City Council
action. For applications that are more routine or minor in nature, such as modification permits, minor
use permits, and minor mapping requests (parcel maps for condominiums), the Zoning Administrator
is the review authority and applications are processed in a shorter time frame with reduced application
                                                                                      Newport Beach General Plan                             5-93

fees. The City’s policy is that building permit plan checks take a maximum of four weeks for first
review.
It should be noted that the City does not impose a design review process. The lack of this procedure
further lends to an expeditious approval process.
Modification Permits
The City has a process to obtain a “Modification Permit.” Whenever strict interpretation of the
Zoning Code precludes reasonable use of a property, a modification permit may be issued to deviate
from the standards of the Code relating to building setbacks, size, and location of parking spaces,
structural appurtenances or projections that encroach into setbacks, and related matters. A public
hearing before the Zoning Administrator is typically not set more than 30 days after a completed
application is deemed complete by Planning Division.
Use Permit (Conditional and Minor)
Conditional use permits and minor use permits are required for certain use classifications typically
having unusual site development features or operating characteristics requiring special consideration
to ensure compatibility with adjacent properties. For a conditional use permit a noticed public hearing
is held by the Planning Commission or a Hearing Officer within 60 days after accepting a complete
application. The Planning Commission has the authority to approve, conditionally approve, or deny
applications for conditional use permits. Minor use permits require a less extensive review and a
noticed public hearing is typically held by the Zoning Administrator within 30 days after an
application is deemed complete. The Zoning Administrator has the authority to approve,
conditionally approve, or deny applications for minor use permits.

Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Building Codes
The City implements and strictly enforces Chapter 11 of the California Building Code, which
establishes regulations for new multi-family construction projects pertaining to access and adaptability
for persons with disabilities. These codes and regulations are based on uniform standards and are
applied throughout the region and therefore are not considered a constraint. Although Chapter 11 of
the California Building Code pertains only to new multi-family projects of three or more units, staff
currently processes any and all voluntary proposals of ADA retrofits. If for any reason an applicant
should request an accommodation to the code for reasons related to a disability, the Building Division
is willing to closely examine the special needs of the applicant and consider a hardship request or an
alternative material, design, and methods of construction request.
Information Regarding Accommodation for Zoning,
Building Codes, and Permit Processing
In an effort to remove regulatory constraints for persons with disabilities, the City provides the
following accommodations to zoning standards, application of building codes, and permit processing
for housing with persons with disabilities.
Reasonable Accommodations
In 2008, and in accordance with federal and state fair housing laws, the City adopted an ordinance
creating the Reasonable Accommodations Chapter (Chapter 20.52.070) of the Zoning Code. The
Chapter provides procedures for obtaining reasonable accommodation from the City’s zoning and
land use regulations, policies, and practices when necessary to provide an individual with a disability
an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. With a reasonable accommodation, a group of
disabled individuals can reside in any district zoned for residential use within the City, even if they are
not living as a single housekeeping unit. Prior to the adoption of the ordinance, the City did not have
a reasonable accommodations process, and requests would have required either a use permit (for
residential care facilities for seven or more residents), or the application of a variance or modification
permit in order to obtain relief from Zoning Code standards. The Chapter ensures that reasonable
accommodation requests are processed efficiently without imposing costs on the applicant. The City
does not assess a fee for reasonable accommodation requests. Although a public hearing is required,
the matter is heard before a Hearing Officer rather than the Planning Commission, which helps
expedite processing.
Request for Hardship or Request for Alternative Materials, Design, and Methods of
Construction
The City allows residential retrofitting to increase the suitability of dwellings for persons with
disabilities in compliance with accessibility requirements. Further, the Building Division has a process
to approve hardship requests, as well as requests for alternative materials, design, and methods of
construction when compliance to the strict letter of the building codes is impractical. This process
                                                          Newport Beach General Plan                 5-95

Housing Element
ensures that application of the Building Code does not create a constraint on housing. These requests
may be approved by the Building Official and Fire Marshall, or their designated agent, if he/she
determines that unique characteristics or conditions exist that make compliance with the strict letter
of the Code impractical and equivalency is provided. The resulting condition must be in conformance
with the spirit and purpose of the Code provisions involved and such modification may not
compromise fire protection, structural integrity or occupant safety. The review of the request is based
upon a written report that must be submitted by the applicant describing the alternate proposal along
with applicable data.
Assistance to Persons with Disabilities
In April 2013, City Hall was relocated to a newly constructed facility that is fully accessible to persons
with disabilities. In addition, permit technicians are continually available to assist persons with
disabilities in completing forms and applications, submitting and issuing permits, and the processing
of plans. Engineers, planners, inspectors, and other staff will accommodate disabled persons with any
inquiries or assistance requested. Furthermore, all information and applications related to permit
processing, including development standards and applications, are available on the City’s website
minimizing the number of visits to the City that would be required for information and permit
processing.
Zoning and Other Land Use Regulations
Zoning
As part of the preparation of an Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice, which is required
for receipt of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, the City has conducted a
comprehensive review of its zoning standards, policies and practices for compliance with fair housing
laws. The City has not identified any zoning or other land-use regulatory practices that could
discriminate against persons with disabilities or impede the availability of such housing for these
individuals.
Examples of the ways in which the City facilitates housing for persons with disabilities through its
regulatory and permitting processes include but are not limited to:
    ■ The City defines “family” or “single housekeeping units” in such a way that does not have the
         effect of discriminating against unrelated individuals, or individuals with disabilities who reside
         together in a congregate or group living arrangement.
    ■ The Zoning Code does not distinguish housing for persons with disabilities who are residing
         as a single housekeeping unit from any other residential use in which individuals are residing
         as a single housekeeping unit.
    ■ Through use permits and reasonable accommodations, the Zoning Code permits disabled
         individuals not living as a single housekeeping unit to reside in residential zones where all
         other groups not living as a single housekeeping unit are prohibited.

Group Home Ordinance
On January 22, 2008, the City Council approved Ordinance No. 2008-5 with the intent of maintaining
zoning protections for residential districts while benefiting disabled persons who wished to live in
those districts. Ordinance No. 20078-5 allows disabled persons to live in residential districts in
residential care facilities, while prohibiting all other groups not living as single housekeeping units
from residing in residential districts. The term “group home” as used by HCD is interchangeable with
the City’s definition of a “residential care facility.” The purpose of the Ordinance is to ensure that the
residential care facilities are operated in a manner consistent with the residential character of
surrounding neighborhoods, do not recreate an institutional environment that would defeat the
purpose of community-based care, and that residential care facilities serving the disabled are operating
in compliance with City and state laws and regulations. To achieve these purposes and to provide
disabled persons with an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling in the City’s residential zoning
districts and in recognition of the services that may be required by the disabled, the Ordinance
regulates residential care facilities as follows:
    ■ Licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons (not living as a single housekeeping
         unit) are permitted by right in all residentially-zoned districts, in accordance with state law, and
         are treated as single family residential uses.
    ■ Licensed residential care facilities with seven or more residents (not living as a single
         housekeeping unit), and unlicensed residential care facilities, may be established in the MFR
         district with a use permit, or in any residential district through a reasonable accommodation. It
         is important to note that these types of facilities are the only groups not living as a single
         housekeeping unit that may be established in a residential district. Other types of group
         residential uses occupied by two or more persons not living as a single housekeeping unit (i.e.
         boarding houses, dormitories, fraternities, sororities, and private residential clubs) are not
         permitted within residential districts. By providing an opportunity to establish residences with
         a use permit or reasonable accommodation to disabled groups only, the code gives more
         favorable treatment to disabled groups not living as single housekeeping units than it gives to
         non-disabled groups that are not living as a single housekeeping unit. Therefore, groups of
         disabled individuals are distinguished only to the extent they are treated preferentially.
    ■ The Zoning Code requires specific parking requirements for residential care facilities which
         may be less or more stringent than the standard residential parking requirements depending
         on the number of client beds. If a residential care facility operator wants a reduction in the
         number of required parking spaces, he or she may apply for a reasonable accommodation
         from the parking requirements, or request a lower on-site parking requirement in its use
         permit application. If findings can be made that parking demand is less than required by code,
         and that the long-term occupancy of the building will not generate an additional parking
         demand, the request can be granted.

Housing Plan: Goals, Policies, Quantified Objectives, and
Programs
Analyses contained in previous sections of this Housing Element provide the basis for the Newport
Beach Housing Plan, which is comprised of housing goals, policies, and programs. The plan places
emphasis on providing adequate opportunity for satisfaction of the City’s Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) requirement and preservation and/or replacement of the City’s existing lower-
income housing stock that is at risk of converting to market-rate rental units.
The special needs populations most evident within Newport Beach and most easily quantifiable by
United States Census of Population and Housing are seniors, the disabled, and female-headed
households. Many of those Policies and Programs in this Housing Plan focus on providing housing
opportunities for the dominant Special Needs population—senior citizens (those 65 years of age and
older). Senior citizens comprise a large component of the total special needs population and have, as a
group, many who are disabled, as well as live at or below the poverty level.
Goals and policies contained in this Housing Plan address the City of Newport Beach’s anticipated
housing needs during the tenure of this Housing Element (2014–2021) and are implemented by a
series of Housing Policies and Programs. These Policies and Programs prescribe specific actions the
City of Newport Beach will take during the tenure of this Housing Element. The Housing Plan set
forth in this Housing Element contains an annotated description of future actions for each Housing
Program policy, the Program funding source, responsible agency, and time frame for implementation.
GENERAL REVIEW OF 2008–2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
AND HOUSING ACTIVITIES
California state law requires the City Housing Element be reviewed as frequently as appropriate and
that it be revised appropriately to reflect results of the review. The last comprehensive revisions of the
Newport Beach Housing Element were completed in 2006 that reflected changes in the City’s Land
Use Plan, with a subsequent update in 2011 for consistency with state housing law and approval by
HCD. All the following must be evaluated during a review of the Housing Element:
   ■ Appropriateness of housing goals, policies, and programs in contributing to attainment of the
       state housing goal
   ■ Effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the community housing goals
   ■ Progress of the City in implementation of the Housing Element
   ■ When a City has land within the California Coastal Zone, review of its Housing Element must
       consider housing pursuant to coastal requirements. This evaluation must include the following:
       X Number of new housing units approved for construction within the Coastal Zone after
           January 1, 2000
       X Number of housing units required to be provided in new housing developments within the
           Coastal Zone or within three miles of the Coastal Zone for persons and families of low- or
           moderate-income, as they are defined in Section 50093 of the Health and Safety Code
       X Number of existing residential dwelling units in the Coastal Zone that have been authorized
           to be demolished or converted since January 1, 1992, that were occupied by persons or

In the course of administering the Housing Element and preparing the updated 2006–2014 Housing
Element, the City determined that the previously adopted goals and policies continue to contribute to
the attainment of California state housing goals as well as the housing goals of Newport Beach. As a
result, most of those goals and policies have been retained to facilitate attainment of the 2014–2021
City housing goals. Specific Housing Programs that have not been effective have been revised or
deleted.
2006-2014 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Review
According to the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) for the Housing Element cycle of
2008-2014, SCAG estimated that the City needed to target its housing unit production to
accommodate 1,769 new housing units. In addition, the City was required to carry over the
unaccommodated portion of the RHNA from the prior planning period pursuant to Government
Code Section 65584.09. As a result, an additional 145 units were added to the 1,769 units, for a total
housing need of 1,914 units.
The distribution of these new units according to income was as follows: Very Low Income
(451 units), Lower Income (319 units), Moderate Income (442 units), and Above-Moderate Income
(702 units).
Table H38 summarizes the total RHNA construction need by income, calculated through the RHNA
process for the 2006–2014 projection period.

The Planning Division maintains a detailed Permit Activity Report for each calendar year that
provides the total number of building permits for new and demolished dwelling units. The report
includes new units constructed within Newport Coast. Using this data, staff has created Table H39
illustrating the total number of new additional units that were constructed during the RHNA period
of 2006 to 2012. These figures exclude existing units added to the City’s housing stock through
annexations.

             SOURCE:   City of Newport Beach, 2006-2012 Planning Activity Reports
The City issued and inspected a total of 1,420 permits for new or replacement housing between 2006-
2012, with a net increase of 678 additional dwelling units (including six senior accessory dwelling
units). With exception of the six senior accessory dwelling units, the new units are assumed to be
affordable to above-moderate income households. The downturn in the economy and decline of
home prices significantly affected housing production during the planning period. However,
development applications were approved for over 3,260 new housing units during the planning period
(including City approval of Banning Ranch), a majority of which would likely be permitted and
constructed during the 2014-2021 planning period. Each of these development applications include
provisions for affordable housing production or payment of housing in-lieu fees that will ultimately
assist in the development and preservation of affordable housing during the current planning period.
Attainment of Community’s Housing Goals
The Orange County Business Council has, again, recently ranked Newport Beach as one of top cities
in the County that has produced workforce housing, and that includes housing policies that will
enable continued construction of workforce housing. The Orange County Business Council’s 2012
Workforce Housing Scorecard provides a comprehensive evaluation of the current and future state of
Orange County’s housing supply and demand. This study examines the past, present, and future of
the County’s housing by analyzing homes constructed, currently available and planned from 1991–
2035. The report ranked Newport Beach as among the study’s top ten performing cities in Orange
County that have created new jobs and the necessary supply of homes to serve the related workforce,
both currently and in the future. Of Coastal cities, Newport Beach was ranked within the top two.
Newport Beach’s relatively high rank was the result of a high score in the following four areas:
   1. Number of jobs—Promotion of job growth
   2. Housing unit density—The study rewards cities that embrace higher density mixed-use
        development policies and penalizes cities that are less hospitable
   3 Housing growth—Promotion of housing growth
   4. Jobs to Housing Ratio—The study rewards cities for past balanced jobs/housing growth, in
        addition to plans for the future

In addition, the City took the following actions to implement its Program objectives in 2006–2012:
   ■ The City received and spent approximately $2.2 million of Community Development Block
      Grant (CDBG) funds. Funds were used to support a variety of housing services including fair
      housing, homeless housing, supportive services, and services for single women and children.
   ■ The City continued to participate in County of Orange programs that provided housing and
      social services for special needs populations.
   ■ A comprehensive General Plan update was completed in 2006 which included substantial
      community outreach. Since the City is largely built out, most of the options considered involved
      the re-designation of some commercial/office/industrial areas for residential or mixed
      residential/commercial uses. Of these, properties in the Airport Area and Newport Center have
      been identified as having the highest potential to yield new dwelling units.
   ■ The City collected housing in-lieu fees in the amount of $656,142 from developers of market-
      rate residential projects that will be used for affordable housing projects in the City.
   ■ The City permitted a total of six senior accessory dwelling “granny” units.
   ■ Two affordability covenants expired in 2011 and 2012. The Baywood apartment complex (part
      of The Bays apartment complex) included 14 low- and 14 moderate-income units. The
      Newport North apartment complex contained 18 low-income units. The City initiated
      conversations with the property owner of both apartment complexes to discuss preservation
      options; however, the property owner ultimately indicated their desire to allow the affordability
      covenants to expire. The City also considered using in-lieu housing funds to preserve these
      units; however, the amount of funds available at the time was determined to not be sufficient to
      subsidize the units long-term. The City worked with the property managers to get information
      to the tenants regarding other affordable housing options within the City and surrounding
      areas.
   ■ Although the original affordability covenants discussed above expired, an Affordable Housing
      Implementation Plan for the North Newport Center Planned Community project was approved
      in 2007, and amended in 2012, and requires the property owner to provide new affordability
      covenants on existing units within The Bays apartment complex for a period of 30 years for
      either 52 very low-, 79 low-, or 105 moderate-income households. The new covenants are
      anticipated to be recorded in 2014/2015.
   ■ The City assisted with the preservation of the Seaview Lutheran Plaza apartments, a 100-unit
      affordable senior apartment development. The development serves residents who are over the
      age of 62 and also a limited number of mobility-impaired residents over the age of 18, all of
      whom have extremely low- and very low-incomes. The project was considered to be at-risk
      during the planning period due to a deteriorating water delivery system. A break in the water
      delivery system occurred in November of 2008 as a result of electrolysis/corrosion and caused
      major damage to several of the apartments, and became an eminent concern for the health and
      safety of the residents. The replacement of the deteriorated water delivery system was necessary
      to comply with current Code requirements, and to prevent further damage to the building and
      the displacement of its residents. To assist with the needed repairs of the water delivery system
      and preserve this supply of affordable rental units, in 2009, the City granted $140,000 from the
      Affordable Housing Fund to the owner of the Seaview Lutheran Plaza Apartments. In
      exchange for the monetary assistance, the owner agreed to extend the affordability of its units
      for a total period of 30 years (March 2039).

   ■ The City registered as a Qualified Preservation Entity with HCD and receives notices from all
      owners intending to opt out of their Section 8 contracts and/or prepay their HUD insured
      mortgages. This action provides the City opportunity to consult with property owners and
      potential preservation organizations regarding the potential use of CDBG funds and/or
      affordable housing fund monies to preserve affordable housing in those developments.
   ■ Approval of four Affordable Housing Implementation Plans in conjunction with the approval
      of the following projects:
                    Santa Barbara Condominiums (79 units)- AHIP amended February 2012, to
                    require the payment of in-lieu housing fee in the amount of $1.2 million into the
                    City’s Affordable Housing Fund. Payment of the fee is due upon issuance of
                    building permits for the project (estimated in 2013 and 2014).
                    North Newport Center Planned Community Development Plan (524 units)- AHIP
                    amended July 2012, to require the recordation of affordability covenants on
                    existing market-rate rental units to maintain rents affordable for a period of 30
                    years to either 52 very low-, 79 low-, 105 moderate-income households, or a
                    combination of units. Affordable housing agreements to be recorded based on
                    phased schedule, in conjunction with the issuance of certificates of occupancy for
                    the market-rate units in the project (estimated 2014/2015).
                    Banning Ranch (1,375 units)- AHIP approved July 23, 2012 (pending Coastal
                    Commission approval), which includes a requirement that 15 percent of the units
                    be affordable to either very low-, low-, or moderate-income households. A
                    minimum of 50 percent must be constructed onsite, with alternative development
                    options for the other 50 percent. Units must remain affordable for a period of 30
                    years.
                    Uptown Newport (922 units + 322 density bonus units)- AHIP approved March
                    12, 2013, requires that either 11 percent (102 units) of the units be rented at very
                    low-income rates or 20 percent (185 units) of the units at low-income rates. Units
                    must remain affordable for a period of 30 years. Alternatively, 40 percent (369
                    units) of the units may be sold at an affordable price for moderate-income
                    households. A combination of these income groups can also be accommodated.

Housing Element Coastal Zone Review
The City of Newport Beach uses Chapter 20.34 of the Municipal Code to implement Government
Code Section 65590 et seq. Between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2013, 1,265 new residential units
were approved for construction within the California Coastal Zone. Of these new units, 120 were
developed as housing affordable to low-income and moderate-income individuals and/or families
(Bayview Landing project). During the same time period, the City permitted landowners to demolish
817 residential units within the Coastal Zone for a net increase of 448 units (excludes units within
Newport Coast that are permitted under the County of Orange per annexation agreement). Of the
units demolished, none were known to be occupied by low-income and/or moderate-income persons
and/or families.
YEAR 2014–2021 HOUSING PLAN
Quantified Objectives
The 2014–2021 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) determined the City of Newport
Beach had a construction need for five residential units between January 2014 and January 2021. The
total need for each target income group is as follows: Very Low-Income (1 unit); Low-Income
(1 unit); Moderate-Income (1 unit); and, Above Moderate-Income (2 units). In addition to the goals of
constructing new units to satisfy the RHNA, the City has goals to rehabilitate and preserve existing
units.
As required by State housing law, quantified objectives by income group for the 2014-2021 planning
period are stated in this section. The quantified objectives are the actual number of housing units that
the City anticipates can be constructed, rehabilitated, or preserved over the planning period.

New Construction: Achieving the new construction goals is expected to be achieved through the
redevelopment of several key housing opportunity areas such as Airport Area, Newport Center,
Newport Mesa, Banning Ranch, the Balboa Peninsula area, and Mariners’ Mile. These areas could
potentially accommodate up to 4, 612 new residential units based on the realistic development
capacity calculated in the Sites Analysis and Inventory. The Airport Area in particular is a key
opportunity site within the community that can facilitate the development of housing that is
affordable at a variety of income levels. General Plan Policy LU 6.15.6 stipulates that residential units
be developed at a maximum density of 50 units per acre and minimum of 30 units per acre.
         For the purposes of quantifying the number of new units that may be permitted during the
         planning period based on identified need, available resources, and constraints, the City
         believes that a total of 1,199 above moderate-income units may be constructed through the
         combination of the following projects: Santa Barbara Condominiums (79 units), North
         Newport Center Planned Community (524 units), Plaza Corona del Mar (6 units), and the first
         phase of the Uptown Newport Planned Community (590 units).
         Based on the Uptown Newport Affordable Housing Implementation Plan that was approved
         for the project, at least 20 percent of the new units proposed (excluding density bonus units)
         are required to be affordable to low-income households. Based on the first phase of
         development, a minimum of 101 low-income rental units are anticipated to be constructed
         during the planning period. Should the affordable rental units be restricted to very low-income
         households, the total number of units would be reduced to 56 units to reflect the greater
         subsidy required. Alternatively, should the affordable units be restricted to moderate-income
         for-sale units, a total of 202 units would be provided. It should also be noted that if the
         second phase of development occurs during the planning period, either 46 very low-income or
         84 low-income rentals units, or 168 moderate-income for-sale units are expected.
         Based on past production of granny units, and future promotion efforts required by Housing
         Program 5.1.3, it is the City’s goal to approve approximately 20 new senior accessory dwelling
         units during the planning period. Given the maximum size of the units, occupancy restrictions
         that these units be occupied by persons of age 55 years or older, and discussions with current
         owners of these properties, these units are assumed to be occupied by a combination of
         moderate- and low-income households. Therefore, it is presumed that 50 percent of new
         granny units would be rented to low-income senior households.
Rehabilitation: Between 2006-2012, the Code Enforcement Division has issued 266 notices of
violations for “unsafe, unsightly, or poorly maintained property” and required the rehabilitation of
these units. The City anticipates that this trend will continue and through continued Code
Enforcement activities, it is estimated that approximately 304 units would be rehabilitated as a result
during this planning period. Many of these units become deteriorated due to the owner’s inability to
afford repairs. Through the Housing Program 1.1.2, the City will strive to identify the home owners in
need of assistance and to develop a program to assist these homeowners. The City’s estimated goal is
to assist approximately 20 units occupied by low-income and extremely low-income households.
Preservation: The preservation objective refers to maintaining existing affordable housing through
measures such as providing or continuing rent subsidies, enforcing existing affordability covenants,
preservation of affordable units at risk of conversion, and implementing land use controls during the
planning period.

As of December 21, 2012, a total of 127 Newport Beach low-income residents relied on
Section 8 rental assistance vouchers. Based on Section 8 program targets, it is assumed 75
percent of the voucher holders were extremely low-income (95 units). The quantified
objective includes conservation of the 127 Section 8 units/assisted households through
continued participation as a member of the Orange County Housing Authority Advisory
Committee and cooperation with the Orange County Housing Authority to provide Section 8
Rental Housing Assistance to residents of Newport Beach. The City will also continue to
educate and encourage landowners within the City about the benefits of renting their units to
Section 8 voucher holders.
The preservation objective utilizes the City’s Affordable Housing Fund as a financial resource
to assist the City with the replacement of existing affordable housing developments that
convert to market-rate units.
Through the implementation of Program Nos. 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.4, and 4.1.5, the City will
attempt to negotiate the extension of existing affordability covenants for the 153 rental units
affordable to lower-income households that are set to expire during the planning period and
are at risk of converting to market rate apartments.

Newport Beach Housing Element: Goals, Policies, and
Programs
Goals for the City include the following: promoting quality residential development through
application of sound planning principles and policies that encourage preservation, conservation, and
appropriate redevelopment of housing stock; providing a balanced residential community that
contains a variety of housing types, designs and opportunities for all economic segments of the
community; extending ownership opportunities to as many households as possible, particularly those
of moderate and upper incomes because these comprise the greatest demand; preserving and
increasing housing affordability, through rental housing, for very low– and low-income households;
and, providing housing for special needs groups. The policies and programs described below focus on
providing appropriate and affordable housing opportunities, and related services to the special needs
populations most in need of such in Newport Beach, that is, in particular to senior citizens.
Additionally, the policies and programs (particularly under Goals 3, 4, and 5) will ensure that the City
will meet its quantified housing objectives for very low-, low-, and moderate-income units.
For purposes of defining income groups, the Housing Element follows the regulations of Title 25
(Housing and Community Development) of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Sections 6910
through 6932. The income groups are defined as follows:
   ■ Very Low–Income: 50 percent or less of the area median income, as adjusted for family size
      by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   ■ Low-Income: 50–80 percent of the area median income, as adjusted for family size by the
      United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   ■ Moderate-Income: 80–120 percent of the area median income, as adjusted for family size by
      the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   ■ Above Moderate–Income: 120+ percent of the area median income, as adjusted for family
      size by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The following affordability standards shall apply to rental and ownership housing:
   ■ Maximum household income shall be determined by number of persons in a family or
      household.
   ■ Income shall be in conformance with the limits set forth in 25 CCR §6932.
   ■ An efficiency unit shall be considered occupied by one person; a one bedroom occupied by two
      persons; a two bedroom occupied by four persons; a three bedroom occupied by six persons; and a
      four bedroom occupied by eight persons.
   ■ Rents for very low–, low-, and moderate-income households shall be no more than 30 percent
      of the income limits set forth in Section 6932. The selling price of a for-sale unit shall be no
      more than three times the buyer’s income. Units may be sold to buyers with qualifying incomes
      for the limited sales price without regard to the number of persons in the family.
Specific Goals, Policies, and Programs of the 2014–2021 Newport Beach Housing Plan follow.

                                     rezoning of developed or vacant property from nonresidential to
                                     residential uses when appropriate. These rezoned properties shall

       Housing Program 3.2.2         Recognizing that General Plan Policy LU6.15.6 may result in a
                                     potential constraint to the development of affordable housing in
                                     the Airport Area, the City shall maintain an exception to the
                                     minimum 10-acre site requirement for projects that include a
                                     minimum of 30 percent of the units affordable to lower-income
                                     households. It is recognized that allowing a smaller scale
                                     development within an established commercial and industrial area
                                     may result in land use compatibility problems and result in a
                                     residential development that does not provide sufficient amenities

                                     provisions for adequate amenities, design considerations for the
                                     future integration into a larger residential village, and a
                                     requirement to ensure collaboration with future developers in the

                      announced.
Housing Program 4.1.5 The City shall inform and educate owners of affordable units of
                      the State Preservation Notice Law (Government Code Section
                      65863.10-13), if applicable. Pursuant to the law, owners of
                      government-assisted projects cannot terminate subsidy contract,
                      prepay a federally-assisted mortgage, or discontinue use
                      restrictions without first providing an exclusive Notice of
                      Opportunity to Submit an Offer to Purchase. Owners proposing
                      to sell or otherwise dispose of a property at any time during the 5
                      years prior to the expiration of restrictions must provide this
                      Notice at least 12 months in advance unless such sale or
                      disposition would result in preserving the restrictions. The intent
                      of the law is to give tenants sufficient time to understand and
                      prepare for potential rent increases, as well as to provide local
                      governments and potential preservation buyers with an
                      opportunity to develop a plan to preserve the property. This plan
                      typically consists of convincing the owner to either (a) retain the
                      rental restrictions in exchange for additional financial incentives or
                      (b) sell to a preservation buyer at fair market value. (Imp 25.1

 Appendix H2 Agencies Providing Emergency Shelter and
                           Housing Assistance
Orange County Housing Authority — The County offers rental assistance for those individuals and
families in the County in danger of becoming homeless. The Section 8 “Certificate” and “Housing
Voucher” programs were established by federal law. Both provide rental assistance for low-income
persons (those having incomes 80 percent or less of the County median income) in need of decent,
safe, and sanitary housing. The “Certificate” program requires families pay a portion of their rent, but
an amount not to exceed 30 percent of their adjusted income. Total amount of the rental unit must be
approved by the Housing Authority based on utilities, location, and the condition of each rental
dwelling. Additionally, total rent must fall within Housing Authority Fair Market Rent limits. It should
be noted that United States Department of Housing and Urban Development regulations were
modified in October, 2000 to allow Section 8 monies to be used for home purchases in addition to
rental assistance.
The “Housing Voucher” program allows families to pay more than 30 percent of their adjusted
income toward rent should they wish to rent a housing unit that has a rent greater than Fair Market
Rent. Families pay the difference between the rental price of the dwelling and the Housing Authority
portion of the rent.. No assistance is provided to the renter should the renter choose a unit more
expensive than Fair Market Rent. According to the Orange County Housing Authority, there are more
than 2,000 Certificates in existence in Orange County.
Fair Housing Council of Orange County and Fair Housing Foundation — The City of Newport Beach has
worked in conjunction with the Fair Housing Council of Orange County and the Fair Housing
Foundation to affirmatively further fair housing opportunities in this community. Both organizations
actively support and promote freedom of residence through education, advocacy and litigation to the
end that all persons have the opportunity to secure the housing they desire and can afford, without
regard to their race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, familial status, marital
status, disability, ancestry, age, source of income or other characteristics protected by law.
Both organizations provide a wide array of programs and services, including landlord/tenant
mediation and fair housing law education to its clients free of charge and which are available in a
number of different languages to residents, housing professional and community service providers
under contracts with the City of Newport Beach, and many other communities throughout the
County.
Families Forward: Families Forward Transitional Housing Program (THP) — THP serves homeless families
with children and provides transitional housing. Families may stay up to 2 years and are required to
pay 30 percent of their income on rent. Families are also linked with appropriate supporting resources
and counseling.
OASIS Senior Center — This is a multi-purpose center dedicated to meeting needs of senior citizens
and their families. OASIS estimates as many as 75 percent of its clients are residents of Newport
Beach. OASIS offers classes in art, exercise, mature driving, topics of enrichment, and computers and
arranges social groups for those who share hobbies and interests. The Center’s travel department
coordinates day and overnight trips. OASIS offers transportation programs for Newport Beach
seniors who have disabilities that limit their access to public transportation. This shuttle program
                                                          N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n 5-149

provides transportation from senior citizens’ homes to the Senior Center. A Care-A-Van program is
available for those senior citizens who require transportation for medical appointments, grocery
shopping, and banking. OASIS distributes information about job openings that might interest seniors
who wish to supplement their retirement income or to remain active through part-time work. OASIS
offers various health services for seniors. Support groups meet regularly at the Center to help senior
citizens and their families cope with stress, illness, life transitions, and crises. Informational and
supportive counseling is available to seniors and their family members on an individual basis. OASIS
also offers a lunch program for active and homebound senior citizens ages 60 and older that is funded
by the federal government through the Older American Act. A donation is requested for meals, which
are provided by South County Senior Services.
Assistance League of Newport Mesa — This is a nonprofit volunteer service organization that assesses and
helps meet the physical, material, emotional and cultural needs of the children in our community
through self-funded, ongoing philanthropic projects. Programs include “Children’s Dental Health
Care Center” providing oral hygiene instruction, general dentistry, orthodontia, and endodontics. The
Assistance League also provides “Operation School Bell” providing clothing, shoes, school uniforms,
and backpacks at no cost to children of low-income families. Still another program includes “Kids on
the Block,” a nationally recognized educational program that teaches young adults increased
understanding and tolerance for fellow classmates who have learning disabilities, physical handicaps or
special emotional needs. The latest program, “The Community Outreach Program” provides funding
for supplies used in supervised study programs for developmental education, parenting classes and
counseling, living expenses for single parents, and day care at accredited facilities.
Human Options: Community Resource Center — Human Options offers a wide variety of counseling and
education programs to help victims and their family members deal with the effects of domestic
violence. Services include crisis intervention, individual counseling for adults, support groups, legal
advocacy, education, referrals, therapy, and emergency shelter.
South County Outreach — Formerly known as Saddleback Community Outreach, this center is a nonprofit
organization that opened in August 1989. It is funded with federal (Super NOFA) monies, monies
from local jurisdictions, and monies from faith-based organizations in the following areas: “in-kind”
Donations Programs; Sponsorship and Underwriting for Programs and Fundraising Events; Housing
Fund Donations; Food Drives; and, “Adopt-A-Family” Holiday Programs (which provides a holiday
meal at Thanksgiving and holiday meal and gifts in December). The major objective of South County
Outreach programs and services is to help those assisted become self-supportive. This organization
operates without paid administrators. The Emergency Lodging Program is intended for homeless
families needing temporary housing until a permanent residence is established. The Housing
Assistance Program is intended for families needing an interest free loan to prevent eviction or to
assist with move-in costs. The Interfaith Shelter Program is a 6-month program available for homeless
singles seeking employment, shelter, and counseling. The Transitional Housing Program is a 2-year
program for homeless families. Applicants are screened by the Housing Committee to assess each
family’s ability to pay a reduced rent in a condominium, maintain employment, set goals, meet
commitments, and attend practical counseling for budget management. South County Outreach also
will pay a portion of a family’s utility bill to help avoid disconnection of services. Additional services
include vouchers for adults and children to obtain clothing at local thrift stores, gasoline vouchers or
bus tickets for transportation to job interviews or physician appointments, donation of automobiles
contributed to South County Outreach to clients in need, medical prescription vouchers for pre-
screened families or individuals, “motivational counseling” to help restore hope and confidence,

        families with children (one adult must be working full-time) with move-in costs to permanent
        housing. The program also requires mandatory, comprehensive case management lasting up to
        2 years which includes family advisors, tutors for children, childcare cost subsidies, personal and
        job counseling and budgeting skills.
    ■ The SARP (Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program) program offers participants move-in
        costs to a recovery home, counseling, bus passes to locate employment and eligibility to the
        GAPP program if sobriety is maintained for 12-18 months.
    ■ The Street Services Program involves volunteers preparing and delivering a sack meal, hygiene
        kits and seasonal clothing to the homeless living on the streets
Age Well Senior Services (formerly South County Senior Services) — A regional nonprofit charitable
organization that has as its mission to promote, advocate, and improve quality of life, dignity, and
independence of seniors. This organization serves approximately 10,000 seniors annually in its
combined programs. Age Well Senior Services receives funding from federal grants, project income,
MediCal, client fees, USDA, funding drives, and special events. Age Well Senior Services provides

special events, music, and art to delay institutionalization and social isolation. Age Well Senior
Services has an Alzheimer’s treatment center and an in-home assessment program to determine needs
of frail seniors, 60 years of age and older, and to establish a Plan-of-Care for services needed to assist
seniors to maintain independence in their own homes for as long as possible. A transportation
program coordinates lift-equipped paratransit services for senior centers. A referral service for In-
Home Providers is offered to help seniors maintain independence in their own homes for as long as
possible. Various programs and services are offered to meet educational, recreational, social, and
human service needs of the senior population. The Shared Housing Program was designed for seniors
and various age groups to share their existing homes for companionship and relief from financial
burden of housing costs for short- or long-term tenures. This Program had operated throughout the
1990s, but was discontinued in 2000 because the County of Orange discontinued Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds for the Shared Housing Program.

food, and clothes to the homeless and other needy persons/families.
Several motels in the Newport Beach–Costa Mesa area are utilized by various agencies to
accommodate homeless persons. These agencies pay all or a portion of the costs.

transitional shelters.

Housing Element
  Appendix H4 Housing Sites Analysis and Inventory
This appendix to the Housing Element addresses the requirements of Government Code Sections
65583 and 65583.2, requiring a parcel-specific inventory to identify sites that can be developed for
housing within the planning period and that are sufficient to provide for the City’s share of the
regional housing need allocation, and to provide realistic opportunities for the provision of housing
to all income segments within the community.
The Sites Analysis and Inventory is organized by the key opportunity areas identified within the
Housing Element text. For each of these opportunity areas, the sites inventory table provides a
listing of individual sites. The analysis demonstrates the sites are currently available and
unconstrained so as to provide realistic development opportunities prior to October 15, 2021 (the
end of the planning period). To demonstrate the realistic development viability of the sites, the
analysis discusses: 1) current General Plan land use designations and whether appropriate zoning is
in place; 2) applicable development limits/densities and their impact on projected development
capacity and affordability; 3) past development trends; 4) existing constraints including any known
environmental issues; 5) the availability of existing and planned public service capacity levels.
Since a limited amount of vacant land remains in the community, future housing development
would primarily be achieved through infill and reuse of sites with existing, underutilized land uses.
The inventory describes whether the sites are currently vacant or underutilized, and whether or not
they are currently zoned for residential use.
Site Selection
It is important to note that this inventory of realistic development sites is much smaller than the
total potential number of sites and number of units that can be redeveloped for housing under the
General Plan build-out projections. To identify sites that can realistically be developed for housing
within the planning period, staff utilized a combination of resources, including the review of the
City’s Land Use Element and Zoning Code, site analysis using the City’s Geographical Information
Systems (GIS) database, updated County Assessor’s data to determine age of buildings and ratio of
improvement value to land value, discussion with developers and land owners, research of past
development trends within the City, and field surveys of each of the properties. The analysis of the
data resulted in the identification of select underutilized sites and the realistic development capacity
of those sites. Properties that were excluded from the inventory include:
         Properties currently developed with newer structures or structures that have recently been
         remodeled, and which tend to have a higher ratio of improvement value to land value.
         Properties that are nonconforming due to floor area ratios (FAR) that greatly exceed the
         ratios currently permitted. For example, several of the older structures located within the
         Balboa Village area are aging; however, redevelopment of those properties are not
         anticipated to occur because they are currently developed at a 2.0 FAR, significantly
         exceeding the current allowable 0.5 FAR for stand-alone commercial. Even if developed for

Vacant Sites
Banning Ranch
On July 23, 2012, the City approved an application filed by Newport Banning Ranch, LLC for a
proposed planned community on a 401 gross-acre project site for development of 1,375 residential
dwelling units, a 75-room resort inn and ancillary resort uses, 75,000 square feet of commercial uses,
approximately 51.4 acres of parklands, and approximately 252.3 acres of permanent open space. The
Planned Community Development Plan was adopted August 14, 2012, and provides zoning
regulations for those portions of the property within the City of Newport Beach and serves as pre-
annexation zoning for those portions under the jurisdiction of the County of Orange. The project
also requires the approval of a coastal development permit by the California Coastal Commission.
Newport Banning Ranch, LLC submitted their application to the California Coastal Commission in
January 2013. The review by Coastal Commission staff is expected to take a minimum of 1 to 3 years.
The realistic unit capacity of 1,375 units for this area is based on the approved planned community
development plan and tract map.
Corona Del Mar
The General Plan land use designations include Corridor Commercial (CC) with an FAR of 0.75 and
Multiple Residential (RM). Per the Land Use Element up to eight dwelling units may be
accommodated on the two adjoining RM parcels that are currently occupied by a dirt parking lot.
On January 3, 2013, the City approved an application that would allow development of the site with
six detached condominiums above a common subterranean parking structure.
Infill/Reuse Opportunity Areas
In order to establish a realistic development capacity for the mixed-use redevelopment opportunity
sites within Areas 2-7, recently constructed or approved mixed-use projects throughout the City
were researched and analyzed. It is also important to realize that when the General Plan was updated
to add additional mixed-use opportunity areas, it was done so with the intent of stimulating
revitalization within these areas through the creation of new value that is added to these properties
that could not previously be achieved as stand-alone commercial developments. For example, a
property can be redeveloped as a stand-alone commercial building with a 0.5 FAR, or the same
property can be redeveloped for mixed-use with a 0.5 FAR commercial component and a 0.75
residential component, for a total 1.25 FAR. In most cases it would not make economic sense to
only build a stand-alone commercial building when you can add a residential component without
impacting the commercial allowance. Therefore, in establishing what the realistic capacity of the
selected sites within the inventory should be, it is assumed that each of the selected sites would be
                                                        N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n 5-163
Housing Element
redeveloped as a mixed-use project. To confirm this assumption, staff researched all new
construction projects that have occurred on existing mixed-use zoned properties within the Cannery
Village area. Based on that research, staff has confirmed all new construction that has occurred
(excluding remodels) has in fact been a mixed-use development that incorporates residential units.
Based on the economics and the confirmed historical development trend, it is justifiable to assume
that these selected sites would likely be developed as mixed-use.
The next step in establishing the realistic capacity of these selected sites within the inventory
involved establishing the realistic density that these properties would be developed to. Although
allowed densities under the Zoning Code would permit up to 26.7 du/acre, the reality is that market
demands, product types, as well as parking and height restrictions, impact achievable densities.
Therefore, to arrive at an achievable density, staff analyzed actual mixed-use projects that have been
developed or approved in the City. The analysis includes research of projects developed on both
small and large sites, illustrating that the densities are achievable regardless of parcel size. The
following are existing mixed-use projects that have been constructed or approved:
607-615 E. Balboa Boulevard
        Parcel Size: 0.29 acres
        Project/Built: 5 du with commercial below
        Achieved Density: 17.2 du/acre
        Code Relief: Allow tandem commercial parking

        Parcel Size: 2.095 acres
        Project/Built: 35 du and 22,500 sq. ft. commercial

        Parcel Size: 1.44 acres
        Project/Built: 22 du and commercial below
        Achieved Density: 15.27 du/acre

Taking an average of the aforementioned examples, 16 du/acre was used for Areas 2-7 as a realistic
density to derive a realistic unit capacity.
Area 1- West Newport Mesa
These sites currently consist of some industrial properties, commercial properties and residential
development. All of the sites have been designated Multi-Unit Residential (RM) with the
comprehensive Zoning Code Update to be consistent with the General Plan designation of Multiple
Family Residential (RM). The RM zoning designation allows 18 du/acre.
The industrial and commercial sites are considered underutilized due to aging commercial and
industrial structures that are partially or wholly vacant. The RM zoning provides these properties
with redevelopment opportunities not previously afforded to them.
The older single-family residences are also considered underutilized because they have not realized
the development potential permissible under the RM zoning district.
To determine the realistic development capacity of these sites, the lot size and densities of three
existing affordable housing apartment complexes were analyzed:
        843 W. 15th Street - 30 du/acre (65 du on a 2.2 acre lot)
        1544 Placentia –31 du/acre (25 du on a 0.8 acre lot)
        1530 Placentia –31 du/acre(14 du on a 0.45 acre lot)
The existing developments were constructed pursuant to the multi-residential development
standards of the old Zoning Code and illustrate that a density of 18 du/acre is a realistic density for
this area; therefore, it was used to compute the realistic unit capacity for the West Newport Mesa
opportunity sites.
Area 2- Mariners Mile
These sites were previously zoned for commercial use and are developed as such. All of the sites are
now zoned for mixed-use (MU-MM and MU-W1), a result of the comprehensive Zoning Code
Update and consistent with their mixed-use General Plan designations (MU-H1 and MU-W1).
These sites are considered underutilized because the properties consist of older buildings, buildings
with vacancies, or boat storage sites where there has not been a previous opportunity to realize the
potential of the mixed-use zone. Many of the existing struggling commercial services will benefit
from the mixed-use redevelopment opportunity, which would increase customer activity and create
new demand for the commercial services.
For the sites on the inland side of Coast Highway, the General Plan establishes a maximum density
of 26.7 du/acre; however, based on the average density yield of recently constructed or approved
mixed-use developments in the City, 16 du/acre was utilized as the realistic development capacity of
those sites (see Mixed-Use Realistic Development Capacity Assumption section for detailed discussion). For
                                                         N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n 5-165

Housing Element
bay-fronting properties in this area, the General Plan establishes a lower density limit of 12 du/acre.
based on a maximum 50 percent of the property; therefore, for bay-fronting sites, the realistic
development capacity was established as 12 du/acre based on a maximum 50 percent of the
property.
Area 3- Lido Marina Village
These sites were previously zoned for commercial use and are developed as such. All of the sites are
now zoned for mixed-use with the exception of one property that is zoned for multi-unit residential,
as a result of the comprehensive Zoning Code Update and are consistent with their General Plan
designations of Mixed-Use Water 2 (MU-W2) and Multiple Residential (RM 20 du/acre).
These sites are considered underutilized because they consist of properties that are developed with
aging commercial buildings, many with vacancies where there has been no opportunity to realize the
potential of the mixed-use redevelopment currently afforded. The mixed-use is a realistic
opportunity that will bring vitality back to the failing commercial area. The property that is zoned
multi-unit residential is also underutilized and economically obsolete due to an aging commercial
building that occupies the site and that has an entire second floor vacant. The City is currently
reviewing a development application for the property to allow the demolition of an underutilized
office building and redevelopment of the site with 23 new townhouse-style multi-unit dwellings. The
application also includes a request to rezone a property designated as private institutional to multi-
unit residential.
The mixed-use designation provides for a maximum density of 26.7 du/acre; however, based on
existing mixed-use projects developed in the area, a realistic density of 16 du/ac was used to derive a
realistic unit capacity for the mixed-use sites. For the multi-unit residential site, realistic development
capacity was based on the maximum allowed density of 20 du/acre, which is supported by the actual
development capacities achieved on existing multi-unit residential projects within the area. The
following provide examples of these projects:
         711 Lido Park Drive – 20 du/acre (12 du on a 0.6 acre lot)
         621 & 633 Lido Park Drive – 36 du/acre (36 du on a 1 acre lot)
Area 4- Cannery Village
These sites were previously zoned for commercial and mixed-use, and are developed as such. The
properties have mixed-use General Plan land use designations of Mixed-Use Horizontal 4 (MU-H4)
and are currently zoned for mixed-use (MU-CV/15th St.), a result of the comprehensive Zoning
Code Update.
These sites consist of aging commercial and light industrial buildings. There are some existing
mixed-use properties in the area; however, the mixed-use regulations of the updated Zoning Code
are less restrictive (i.e. parking) and facilitate additional opportunities for mixed-use projects.

Area 5- McFadden Square
This area is similar to Cannery Village and the sites were previously zoned commercial and mixed-
use. The properties have mixed-use General Plan land use designations of MU-W2. All of the
properties are currently zoned MU-W2, a result of the comprehensive Zoning Code Update,
consistent with their General Plan designations.
These sites consist of aging commercial buildings and vacant lots used for commercial parking.
There are existing mixed-use properties; however, the mixed-use development regulations of the
updated Zoning Code are less restrictive (i.e. parking) and facilitate additional opportunities for
mixed-use projects.
The General Plan establishes a maximum density of 26.7 du/acre; however, based on the average

Area 6- Balboa Village
This area is similar to Cannery Village and McFadden with sites that were previously zoned
commercial and mixed-use. The properties have mixed-use General Plan land use designations of
Mixed-Use Vertical (MU-V). All of the properties are currently zoned MU-V, a result of the
comprehensive Zoning Code Update, consistent with their General Plan designations.
These sites consist of aging commercial buildings. There are existing mixed-use properties; however,

Area 7- Dover Drive/Westcliff Drive
These sites consist of properties that were previously zoned for administrative, professional, and
financial use. The properties have General Plan land use designations of Mixed-Use Horizontal 1
(MU-H1). All of the properties are currently zoned for mixed-use (MU-DW), a result of the
comprehensive Zoning Code Update and consistent with their General Plan land use designations.
These sites are currently developed with aging commercial and financial buildings, which are no
longer considered to be the highest and best use for these properties due to the mixed-use
development opportunities that have been created for these properties.

Area 8- Newport Center
The Land Use Element creates a new residential land use designation of Mixed-Use Horizontal 3
(MU-H3) in this area with up to 450 new high-density multi-family housing units.
The Irvine Company (IC) is the main land owner/developer in the Newport Center area. A Planned
Community Development Plan (North Newport Center PC) for IC owned property within the
Newport Center area was approved in December 2007 and amended in August of 2012. The North
Newport Center PC area comprises approximately 158.4 acres along San Joaquin Hills Road and
Newport Center Drive, and consists of seven subareas. This Development Plan allows for the
diversification of land uses in order to encourage new and original uses consistent with the Mixed-
Use concept as established in the General Plan, including the development of 445 of the permitted
450 mixed-use units. Implementation of this development will provide residential opportunities in
proximity to Newport Center which is a regional job center and commercial area. As part of the
amendment approved in 2012, an additional 79 residential units were approved for construction
with North Newport Center as a result of the conversion and transfer of 79 unbuilt hotel units from
the Newport Beach Marriot site in Newport Center. As a result of the amendment, the
Development Plan now allows for the total construction of up to 524 residential units within the
San Joaquin Plaza sub-area (identified as Site 1 within the sites inventory and maps). The
development plan includes development standards for site coverage, building heights, setback line
designations, off-street parking, vehicular access, signage, lighting, storage, screening and
landscaping. To facilitate the development of the housing and provide considerable flexibility,
maximum building height is set at 65 feet and no maximum density limit was established, but rather
maximum development limit of 524 dwelling units was established.
The remaining five mixed-use units authorized by the General Plan in Newport Center were entitled
for development at the Newport Beach Country Club site (Site 3).
Within Newport Center, the General Plan includes a development opportunity for 79 multi-family
residential (RM) dwelling units. A 79-unit condominium project (Santa Barbara Condominiums) was
approved by the City in 2006 and the California Coastal Commission in 2007; Phase 1 of the project
is anticipated to begin construction by summer of 2013 (Site 2).
Area 9- Airport Area
Properties in this area are currently zoned as Planned Community and regulated by the development
standards contained within the following three Planned Community development plan texts: 1) The
Newport Place Planned Community (PC 11); 2) The Koll Center Planned Community (PC 15), and
The Uptown Newport Planned Community (PC 58). Properties within these planned communities
are currently developed with existing research and development, office, high technology, industrial
and commercial uses. The General Plan provides for the maintenance and limited expansion of the
 5-168 N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n
                                                                                    Housing Element
currently developed mix of uses. Additionally, it identifies this Area as one of the greatest
opportunities in the community to create new residential neighborhoods including workforce
housing, through the replacement of existing uses and new construction on underutilized surface
parking lots. Land Use Element Policy LU 6.15.5 allocates a maximum of 2,200 housing units in
areas designated as MU-H2. The MU-H2 designation provides for the horizontal intermixing of
uses, including the development of free-standing multi-family residential units. All of the units must
be developed as replacement of existing uses, with the exception of a maximum of 550 units that
may be developed as infill on existing surface parking lots.
On July 24, 2012, the Newport Place PC was amended to establish a residential development overlay
where multi-unit residential developments, which include a minimum of 30 percent of the units
affordable to lower-income households, are permitted subject to site development review and
eligible for a waiver of 10-acre site requirement specified in General Play Policy LU6.15.6. On
March 12, 2013, the Uptown Newport Planned Community was adopted (formerly a part of the
Koll Center Planned Community) and serves as the zoning document for the construction of up to
1,244 residential units (including 322 density bonus units), 11,500 square feet of retail commercial,
and 2.05 acres of park space. Both the Newport Place and Uptown Newport Planned Communities
require densities between 30 du/acre and 50 du/acre, consistent with the densities of the General
Plan. The Koll Center Planned Community text was also amended on March 12, 2013, to remove
the properties now regulated by the new Uptown Newport Planned Community. The remaining
properties within Koll Center Planned Community do not include the allowance for residential uses
at this time and an amendment to the Planned Community text would be required to allow a future
residential development. The Koll Center Company is presently processing an amendment to the
Koll Planned Community to provide residential opportunities for 260 infill units.
In formulating General Plan policies, it was important that residential development not occur on a
“piecemeal” basis, but rather there must be sufficient critical mass to enable each increment of
housing to stand alone as a viable and livable neighborhood. Therefore, the General Plan establishes
several policies that set forth criteria for the configuration and design of new residential villages in
the Airport Area. The realistic development capacity for the Airport Area takes into consideration
each of the following development limitations:
         Density- General Plan Policy LU 6.15.7 stipulates that residential units be developed at a
         maximum density of 50 units per acre and minimum of 30 units per acre. Pursuant to
         Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(1), since a minimum density limit has been established
         for this area, the realistic development capacity utilizes a density of 30 du/acre.
         Residential Villages- General Plan Policy LU 6.15.6 defines standards for the development
         of cohesive and integrated neighborhoods. It stipulates that residential neighborhoods shall
         contain a minimum of 10 contiguous acres centered on a neighborhood park and other
         amenities. The housing opportunity sites illustrated in the site inventory and map are based
         on 4 of the 5 potential residential villages illustrated in the Airport Area Residential Villages
         Concept Diagram contained in the Land Use Element of the General Plan (Figure LU23).
         The fifth potential residential village was excluded from the site inventory and map because
         of the fragmented ownership of the parcels within that area and shared use of common
                                                          N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n 5-169

Housing Element
         parking lots. Recognizing that General Plan Policy LU6.15.6 may result in a potential
         constraint to the development of affordable housing on the smaller parcels located within
         Potential Residential Village Sites 1 and 2, the City approved an amendment to the Newport
         Place Planned Community (PC 11) to eliminate the constraint and create a waiver to the
         minimum 10-acre site requirement. Specifically, the amendment permits residential
         development that includes a minimum of 30 percent of the units affordable to lower-income
         households with the approval of a Site Development Review.
         Vehicle Trip Conversion Rate- General Plan Policy 6.15.5 states that of the 2,200 units
         permitted within the Airport Area, only 550 units may be developed as infill on surface lots
         or areas not occupied by buildings. The remaining 1,650 units are permitted as the
         replacement of existing nonresidential uses or industrial uses. When a development phase
         includes a mix of residential and nonresidential uses or replaces existing industrial uses, the
         number of peak hour trips generated by the cumulative development of the site shall not
         exceed the number of trips that would have resulted from the development of the
         underlying permitted nonresidential uses. A standardized set of conversion rates is provided
         by the Traffic Engineer in order for all conversions to occur in a consistent and fair manner.
         33. Both the AM and PM peak hour trip rates from the Newport Beach Transportation
         Model (NBTM) were reviewed and the more conservative of the two was selected for
         determining the conversion factors. The sites inventory for the Airport Area includes the
         potential unit capacities based on the trip conversion rates. The results of the analysis
         demonstrate that potential dwelling unit capacity based on trips exceeds the maximum
         2,200-unit capacity allowed per the General Plan and further supports the realistic
         development capacity for the area.
Because all of the sites within the Airport Area are currently developed with a mix of research and
development, office, industrial, and other commercial uses, it was important to identify which of the
parcels within the area had the greatest potential to be redeveloped for housing. The fact that these
properties are currently developed with existing uses should not be viewed as an impediment to new
residential development. As discussed in detail on page 5-75 of the Housing Element, high land
values within Newport Beach and a strong demand for new housing significantly increases the
feasibility for infill and reuse of these sites within the Airport Area. In addition, the following
factors were taken into account when selecting which particular sites had a realistically potential to
be developed for housing within the planning period:
         Improvements to Land Value Ratio- To assist in the identification of parcels that have
         redevelopment potential, the ratio of improvement value to land value was calculated for
         each of the parcels using data for the County Assessor’s Office. Where the ratio is 1:1 or
         less, this means that the value of buildings or improvements on a site is equal to or less than
         the value of the land. Existing developed lands that are least likely to be redeveloped are
         those with high ratios of improvement values to land values. Conversely, when the
         improvement values are equal to or less than the land values, the site is considered
         underutilized and may have redevelopment potential. These Assessed Valuation ratios were

          considered along with other factors to identify which sites can realistically be developed for
          housing within the planning period.
          Visual Inspections- The City conducted visual inspections of each of the properties located
          within the Airport Area to assist in the selection of sites. After inspecting these sites, many
          of the sites that had improvement values equal to, or less than the land values, were still
          excluded from the inventory because the buildings maintained characteristics that did not
          lead the City to believe they would realistically be redeveloped within this planning period.
          These characteristics included recent construction or improvements, existing high-rise
          buildings, and age of buildings. However, several sites with high ratios of improvement
          values to land values were actually added to list based on other characteristics, such as large
          numbers of vacancies, age of buildings, condition of buildings and level of reinvestment, and
          low intensity of existing development.
          Developer/Property Owner Interest- Since the adoption of the General Plan Update in
          2006, several property owners and developers have approached the City with inquiries and
          interest in developing certain properties for residential development. Applications have been
          submitted with the City for Residential Villages Sites 3 and 4, described below, requesting
          consideration for new housing developments. Based on this information, certain sites were
          selected and identified as sites that realistically be developed for housing within the planning
          period.
The parcel-specific inventory table for Area 9 (John Wayne Airport Area) includes a column
indicating the ratio of improvement value to land value and a column listing which of the factors
above were considered when selecting that particular parcel to be included within the inventory.
The following is a summary of each of the four identified potential residential villages:
Residential Village Site 1- Residential Village Site 1 is located at the southwest corner of MacArthur
Boulevard and Corinthian Way. A total of eight underutilized parcels have been selected for the sites
inventory and map based on certain characteristics of the properties. Four of the parcels (Sites 1g-
1h) have land values that exceed the improvement value of the properties. The other four parcels
(Sites 1a-1d) are owned by the same property owner and are currently developed as one commercial
complex. The buildings were constructed in the early 1970’s and exhibit signs of aging and need for
rehabilitation. Several of the suites within the commercial complex are vacant.
Residential Village Sites 2- Residential Village Site 2 is located at the northwest corner of Dove
Street and Quail Street. A total of ten underutilized parcels have been selected for the sites inventory
and map based on certain characteristics of the properties. Six of the parcels (Sites 2c, 2e, 2f, 2i, 2g,
and 2j) have land values that exceed the improvement value of the properties. Site 2j in particular
has a land value that significantly exceeds the improvement value and is currently being utilized as a
vehicle storage lot. The other four parcels (Sites 2a, 2b, 2d, and 2h) were included within the
inventory based on the visual inspections of the parcels. The existing buildings on these parcels were
all built in the early 1970’s and consist of 2-story, low-intensity office development.

Residential Village Sites 3 - Further supporting the realistic development potential for these areas is
the Integrated Conceptual Development Plan that has been prepared for future residential
development on the Koll (Site 3) and Uptown Newport (formerly referred as Conexant)(Site 4)
properties. For the Koll development project, the Plan includes 260 residential infill units within a
24-acre area of the Koll Center. The 24-acre area currently consists of surface parking and
landscaping, and maintains a land value that significantly exceeds the improvement value of the
property. The applicant is currently working on a conceptual site plan for the project and has had
discussions with City staff to address issues with traffic circulation, fire access, and open space
requirements. The applicant is currently preparing the Planned Community Development Plan
amendment for submission and public hearings are anticipated for late 2015.
Residential Village Sites 4- On March 12, 2013, the Uptown Newport Planned Community was
adopted (formerly a part of the Koll Center Planned Community) and serves as the zoning
document for the construction of up to 1,244 residential units (including 322 density bonus units),
11,500 square feet of retail commercial, and 2.05 acres of park space.
Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include possible asbestos from older building construction for many of
the aging structures throughout all of the Areas. In Area 1 West Newport there are light industrial
uses that could have created possible toxins. Smaller projects may be exempt from the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and larger projects will be subject to CEQA beginning with
Initial Studies which will identify all possible environmental issues at the time of project submittal.
The only housing opportunity area identified in the updated General Plan and associated
Environmental Impact Report with significant environmental constraints is the Banning Ranch area.
The Banning Ranch area includes significant environmental resources including wetlands, habitat
areas, sensitive wildlife, and valuable biological resources.
Adequate Infrastructure Capacity within all Sites
Government Code Section 65583.2(b)(5) requires a general description of existing or planned water,
sewer, and other dry utilities supply, including the availability and access to distribution facilities.
This information need not be identified on a site-specific basis. There is adequate infrastructure
capacity within these underutilized sites, and redevelopment of these infill sites is considered
feasible. The infrastructure capacity is considered adequate to accommodate the City’s share of the
regional housing need. Presently, the area in the community that is not served by any water or sewer
infrastructure is Banning Ranch. However, if the Banning Ranch area is annexed, the City intends to
provide service to this area.
         Adequate water supply, water delivery, and water treatment facilities. The sites are served by Irvine
         Ranch Water District (IRWD) and the City. The City continues to produce groundwater and
         purchase local water. Currently the City purchases imported water through the Municipal
         Water District (MWD) from the Municipal Water District of Orange County (MWDOC).

                                                                                Housing Element
Build out of the General Plan land use designations including these sites would increase
water demand however; the MWDOC has indicated that there is adequate existing and
planned imported water supply to accommodate the increased demand associated with the
build out of the General Plan land use designations. The amount of projected development
including these sites could place more demand on the local groundwater supply to avoid the
purchase of additional imported water, even though sufficient imported water is projected to
be available. However, General Plan policies are in place within the Natural Resources
Element including enforcement of water conservation measures that limit water usage,
prohibit activities that waste water or cause runoff, and require the use of water efficient
landscaping and irrigation in conjunction with other water conserving devices and practices
in both new construction and major alterations and additions to existing buildings. Overall
General Plan policies found in the Land Use and Natural Resources Elements are in place to
reduce impacts associated with water supplies, treatment, and conveyance systems related to
build out of the General Plan land use designations including these sites.
IRWD anticipates a sufficient water supply to cover estimated demands as well as future
demands resulting from unanticipated changes in land use, IRWD would be able to serve the
new land uses from existing entitlements and resources.
Waste Water Facilities. The City, IRWD, and Costa Mesa Sanitation District (CMSD) provide
wastewater infrastructure to the City and they utilize Orange County Sanitation District
(OCSD) facilities for the treatment of wastewater collected with their infrastructure. The
existing treatment plants operate well below their design capacity and it is anticipated that
cumulative development of the General Plan land use designations including these sites
would not exceed the capacity of the waste water treatment system. Cumulative impact of
the additional residential and mixed-use development within each of the service providers’
areas could result in the need for additional wastewater conveyance infrastructure depending
on the project. However, any person connecting to the sewer system is required to pay
connection fees in accordance with existing regulations. Existing regulations ensure that all
users pay their fair share for any necessary expansion of the system, including expansion to
wastewater treatment facilities.
Adequate solid waste facilities. Refuse is consolidated and transported to a materials recovery
facility where recyclable materials are then sorted from refuse by machines and other
methods. The remaining solid waste is then taken to one of three County landfills. Currently,
only the Frank R. Bowerman Sanitary Landfill services the City of Newport Beach. The
increase in solid waste generated by the development under the proposed General Plan land
uses including these sites would not exceed capacity of the landfill. In addition, AB 939
mandates the reduction of solid waste disposal in landfills.
Adequate residential trash collection facilities. The majority of residential solid waste generated in
the City is collected by the City’s Refuse Division and the remaining solid waste is collected
by waste haulers and transported to a City-owned transfer station. The City has implemented
                                                      N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n 5-173

       recycling ordinances to help ensure that AB 939 requirements are met and solid waste is
       regulated by the City through the requirement of franchises.
       Adequate electric, gas and cable services. The private utility providers are able to service all future
       developments resulting from the cumulative development of the General Plan land use
       designations including these sites.
       Adequate public facilities. The City’s libraries and other public facilities can adequately serve the
       increased demand from residential users. The increased demand on the schools would be
       addressed by implementation of General Plan policies which allow for the development of
       new public and institutional facilities within the City.

         (1) General Plan policy requires development of mixed-use residential villages containing a minimum of 10 acres. Each site represents a potential residential village with a
             minimum of 10 acres. Properties in Sites 1 and 2 are exempt from 10 acre requirement if developed consistent with the Residential Development Overlay standards of the
             Newport Place Planned Community.
         (2) A Planned Community text amendment is required to add residential as a permitted use to be consistent with the General Plan designation that allows mixed-use
             development.
                                                                                                                             N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n 5-231

   (3)    General Plan policy requires that residential units be developed at a minimum density of 30 du/ace and a maximum density of 50 du/acre averaged over the total area of each
          residential village.
   (4)    The General Plan provides for the conversion of existing land uses in the Airport Area with a cap of 1,650 du that can be developed based on a trip generation rate conversion
          in addition to 550 du allowed as infill development. A standardized set of trip conversion rates is provided by the Traffic Engineer in order for all conversions to occur in a
          consistent and fair manner. Both the AM and PM peak hour trip rates from the Newport Beach Transportation Model (NBTM) were reviewed and the more conservative of the
          two was selected for determining the conversion factors. Sites 1, 2 and 4 provide the trip conversion rate and resulting dwelling units to show the traffic related capacity for
          each residential village. If the maximum dwelling units based on the traffic based capacity is more restrictive than the dwelling units based on the density of 30 du/acre than
          the more restrictive traffic based capacity is used as the realistic unit capacity.
   (5)    Koll development project is in process and includes 260 additive residential units within a 24-acre area of the Koll Center. These units are additive and do not replace any
          existing use so there is no need to do a trip generation conversion rate. The applicant is currently working on a conceptual site plan for the project and has had discussions
          with City staff to address issues with traffic circulation, fire access, and open space requirements. The applicant is currently preparing the Planned Community text for
          submission and public hearings are anticipated for late 2014.
   (6)    On March 12, 2013, the Uptown Newport Planned Community was adopted (formerly a part of the Koll Center Planned Community) and serves as zoning document for the
          construction of up to 1,244 residential units (including 322 density bonus units), 11,500 square feet of retail commercial, and 2.05 acres of park space. The 322 density bonus
          units are not subject to the 2,200 maximum development limit established by the General Plan and were excluded from the realistic development capacity calculation to
          provide a more conservative estimate.

Introduction
This Element addresses the protection and sustainability of Newport Beach’s historic and
paleontological resources. Goals and policies presented within this Chapter are intended to recognize,
maintain, and protect the community’s unique historical, cultural, and archeological sites and
structures. Preserving and maintaining these resources helps to create an awareness and appreciation
of the City’s rich history.
For many years, Newport Beach’s scenic location, attractive neighborhoods, and active commercial
areas have continued to place many of the City’s original buildings, paleontological resources, and
historical sites under extreme development pressures. Many of the community’s early structures and
archeological sites have since been demolished or altered. However, a significant number of historical
sites and buildings have been preserved that are representative of the community and the region.
Many of these historical resources have been recognized as being of statewide or national importance.
The preservation of these sites has been the result of active efforts by residents, community groups,
private organizations and the City of Newport Beach.
It is important to continue to protect Newport Beach’s heritage and to identify and safeguard
historical resources worthy of protection and ensure that new development enhances rather than
alters or eliminates reminders of Newport Beach rich heritage.

Context—Early History
The community of Newport Beach has a rich and diverse history. The picturesque coastline of the
community and its close proximity to the water have played a large role in the development of the
City. Early inhabitants thousands of years ago were aboriginal hunters and gatherers who were first
drawn to this area by the rich bounty of the bay and ocean. The most recent native people were the
Tongva (Gabrielinos) and the Acjachemem (Juanenos), who lived in small villages around the bay.
In July of 1769, the expedition led by the Spaniard Gaspar de Portola reached the boundaries of
present-day Orange County. Father Junipero Serra, a member of the expedition, dedicated the
Mission of San Juan Capistrano, Orange County's first permanent settlement, on November 1, 1776.
The Mission’s chapel and adjoining structure were the first signs of civilization erected upon the Santa

That Are Historically Significant
Ana Region. Decades later in the 1800s, land holdings of the Capistrano Mission were parceled out as
Spanish and Mexican land grants to war heroes and aristocratic families. Later, many Spanish and
Mexican landowners were forced to sell large tracts of their land. The most prominent landowners of
the area, Don Sepulveda and Don Bernardo Yorba, men whose combined holdings comprised
Newport Beach's upper bay and lower bay, sold their tracts to American entrepreneurs by the names
of Flint, Bixby, Irvine and McFadden. The first stirring of commerce began in the community of
Newport Beach in 1870, when a small stern wheeler from San Diego named "The Vaquero" made its
first trip to a marshy lagoon to exchange lumber for hides, tallow, livestock and grain. James
McFadden and ranch owner James Irvine named the landing on the bay “Newport.” The McFadden
brothers brought in lumber from Northern California and shipped out produce from local farmers on
a shallow draft steam schooner named Newport.
In 1888, James McFadden, due to the treacherous harbor entrance, moved the isolated settlement to
the peninsula and built a wharf that extended to deep water where large steamers could dock. In 1891
the McFadden brothers completed a railway connection to Santa Ana. Shipping activity increased
dramatically and for the next eight years, the McFadden Wharf area was a booming commercial and
shipping center and a company town began to grow. However, in 1899, the federal government
allocated funds for major improvements to a new harbor at San Pedro, which was served by the
Southern Pacific Railroad and would become Southern California’s major seaport. The McFadden
Wharf and railroad was sold to a beet-sugar producer in Los Alamitos who six months later sold to
the Southern Pacific Railroad signaling the end of Newport as a commercial shipping center.
In 1902, James McFadden sold his Newport town site and about half of the Peninsula to William S.
Collins, who saw Newport Bay’s resort and recreation potential. Collins took on Henry E. Huntington

as a partner in the Newport Beach Company. Huntington had acquired the Pacific Electric railway
system and used it to promote new communities outside of Los Angeles.
As recently as 1947, lands surround Newport’s Upper Bay were developed tenant farms. Newport Beach 75: A Diamond Jubilee History, James P. Felton.

Soon after, the Pacific Electric Railroad established itself in Newport Beach in 1905, connecting the
City of Los Angeles by rail. Rapid transit “Red Cars” brought new visitors to the waterfront, and small
hotels and beach cottages were developed that catered to the tourist industry. Between 1902 and 1907,
many of Newport Beaches’ waterfront communities were subdivided, including West Newport, East
Newport, Bay Island, Balboa, Corona del Mar, Balboa Island and Port Orange (at old Newport
Landing), and in August 1906, residents in the booming bay town voted to incorporate. On
September 1, 1906, Newport Beach became the fifth city to incorporate in Orange County. Newport
Heights and Corona del Mar were annexed in 1917. In the 1920s, the City and County began work to
improve the harbor entrance and create navigable channels in the bay. Between 1934 and 1936, the
federal government and the County Harbor District undertook work around the harbor. They

dredged the Lower Bay, extended jetties, and created the present day contour of Newport Harbor. In
1936, community members dedicated the City's main harbor. During World War II, the harbor
became a vital hub as naval ships were built and repaired in its coastal waters. Servicemen stationed at
the Santa Ana Army Air Base came to Balboa to visit the entertainment hot spots. After the war,
many of these men returned to build their homes in Newport Beach and the surrounding area.
The Santa Ana freeway, built in the 1950s, triggered further growth. During this time, housing
development began to spread north and eastward from the waterfront to the hills and mesa areas. The
community’s economic industry changed, as the fishing industry, once the backbone of Newport
Beach’s economy, gradually declined to be replaced with new businesses and commercial centers.
Beginning in 1967 and through the 1970s and 1980s, the building of shopping centers such as Fashion
Island, hotels, high-scale restaurants, offices, and many new homes led to the creation of the active
employment, retail, and residential areas that characterize much of Newport Beach today.3 While
Newport Beach is no longer a small resort community, the bay and beach continue to play an
important role in the community’s character and economy and the City continues to be a destination
for visitors.

FEDERAL PROGRAMS
The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 is a federal law that establishes the legal and
administrative context to encourage preservation of historic resources associated with the country’s
history and heritage. The NHPA establishes criteria for inclusion into the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) which is an inventory of the United States’ historic resources maintained by
the National Park Service. Structures and features must usually be at least 50 years old to be
considered for listing on the NRHP, barring exceptional circumstances.
Properties listed in the NRHP, or determined eligible for listing, must meet certain criteria for
historical significance and possess integrity of form, location, and setting.
STATE PROGRAMS
The California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR) was created to identify resources deemed
worthy of preservation on a state level and was modeled closely after the NRHP. The criteria are
nearly identical to those of the NRHP but focus upon resources of statewide, rather than national,
significance. The CRHR automatically includes resources listed on the NRHP as are State Landmarks
and Points of Interest.

Historical Resources
Reflective of Newport’s unique history, several properties in the City exhibit significant heritage
distinction. Twelve sites have been listed or designated eligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places or California Register of Historical Resources, or otherwise listed as historic or
potentially historic in the California Historic Resources Information System (CHRIS) maintained by
the Office of Historic Preservation (Figure HR1).
Nationally Recognized Resources
Four properties within the City have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
    ■ Balboa Inn—Built in 1929, the
       Balboa Inn is representative of
       Spanish        Colonial       Revival
       architecture and beachfront tourist
       development.
    ■ Balboa Pavilion—Constructed in
       1905, the Balboa Pavilion has been
       the site of numerous social and
       cultural activities over the turn of
       the century. It is one the state’s last
       surviving examples of great
       waterfront recreational pavilions.
                                               One of the City’s first landmarks was the Balboa Pavilion constructed in 1905. Today it
                                               is listed on the National and State Historic Registers. (Newport Beach 75: A Diamond

       portion of the 2,791-acre Crystal Cove State Park. The federally listed Historic District is an
       enclave of 46 vintage rustic coastal cottages originally built in the 1920s and 1930’s that are
       nestled around the mouth of Los Trancos Creek. It is one of the last remaining examples of
       early twentieth century Southern California coastal development.
   ■ Lovell Beach House—Built in 1926, the Lovell Beach House was designed by Rudolf
       Schindler and is considered the first pure International Style house built in America.
State-Recognized Resources
In addition, four properties within the City have been listed as California Historical Landmarks.
   ■ Old Landing—Established by Captain Dunnells in the 1870s, it was the site of the first
       shipping business in Newport Bay.
   ■ Site of First Water-to-Water Flight—Commemorates the May 10, 1912, flight of pioneer
       pilot Glenn L. Martin who flew from the waters of the Pacific Ocean at Balboa to Catalina
       Island; on a primitive hydroplane; the first water-to-water flight. Today a plaque at the foot of
       the Balboa Pier honors the memory of Glenn Martin.
   ■ McFadden Wharf—The site of the original wharf built in 1888 by the McFadden brothers.
   ■ Balboa Pavilion—described above
Four additional properties are also listed in the CHRIS database:

   ■ Balboa Island Firehouse No. 4—early police and fire station for the Balboa Peninsula
   ■ Bank of Balboa/Bank of America—Bank of Balboa, Bank of America, provided services
       from 1928 to 1984 (now demolished)
   ■ Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church
Locally Recognized Resources
Properties that are not listed on the NRHP or CRHR may also be considered historical resources. The
City of Newport Beach has established the Newport Beach Register of Historical Property (“City
Register”) to recognize structures or properties of local historical or architectural significance. The
City has listed seven properties in the City Register in recognition of their local historical or
architectural significance, as described above. In addition to the Balboa Pavilion and the Balboa Inn,
which are also listed in the NRHP and CRHR, the City Register includes the following:
   ■ Rendezvous Ballroom Site—A popular Balboa Dance Hall that featured numerous famous
       Big Bands of the 1930s and 1940s. It was destroyed by fire in 1966.
   ■ Wilma’s Patio (formally Pepper’s Restaurant)—Located on Balboa Island, the exposed
       structural components of Wilma’s Patio are timbers used in the original Balboa Island Bridge
       and McFadden Wharf.
   ■ Balboa Theater—Built in 1928, the Balboa Theater is a former vaudeville theater that at one
       time housed an infamous speakeasy during the prohibition period. Currently, the theater is
       under renovation.

In 1953, the International Boy Scout Jamboree was held where Newport Center and Fashion Island are now located. Thousands of tents were pitched in
the area reachable only by a two-lane muddy trail.
     ■ Balboa Saloon—The 1924 building is
          representative of the nautical history and
          Main Street commercial masonry style of
          Newport Beach.
     ■ Dory Fishing Fleet— The Dory Fishing
          Fleet is located adjacent to Newport Pier.
          The fleet and open-air fish market have
          operated at this location since the founding
          of the fleet in 1891 by Portuguese
          fishermen. The last remaining fleet of its
          type, it is a historical landmark designated
          by the Newport Beach Historical Society.
          It is a City Council policy that an area
          immediately west of the Newport Pier be
          reserved for the Newport Dory Fishing
          Fleet.
Additionally, in 1991, City Council established an
Ad Hoc Historic Preservation Advisory
Committee (AHHPAC) to investigate the
historic resources of the community and make
recommendations regarding preservation. The
AHHPAC completed its assignment on May 12,                               A memorial plaque located at what is now Fashion Island commemorates
1992, and reported its findings, which included a                        the event

officially adopted by the City, and the structures were never placed on the City Register, but the
inventory still serves as a useful guide to potentially historic properties that may have historic or
cultural significance to the City.

CHAPTER 7 Circulation Elemen
Circulation Element
                                   CIRCULATION
        A Safe and Convenient Transportation System
Introduction
The ability to move people and goods throughout Newport Beach and beyond is important to
residents and businesses. Local roadways are the most important element for mobility in Newport
Beach, but transit, shuttles, the trail system, and the harbor provide opportunities for alternative
modes of travel that could relieve pressure on roadways. The Circulation Element governs the long
term mobility system of the City of Newport Beach. The goals and policies in this element are closely
correlated with the Land Use Element and are intended to provide the best possible balance between
the City’s future growth and land use development, roadway size, traffic service levels and community
character. The Element is also consistent with the Transportation Demand Management Ordinance
and the Local Coastal Program.
Context
SETTING
Since Newport Beach fronts on the Pacific Ocean, the City has access from only three directions.
Upper Newport Bay acts as a barrier, resulting in only two east/west routes through Newport Beach
(Coast Highway and the Bristol Street/SR 73 corridor) and high traffic volumes on these two routes,
which results in congestion. John Wayne Airport (JWA) also acts as a barrier to circulation on the
City’s northern border, and adds traffic on Airport Area streets.
  7-2   Newport Beach General Plan

                                                                            Circulation Element
At the same time, Newport Harbor creates a unique opportunity for transportation solutions.
Examples of existing water transportation services in Newport Beach include the Santa Catalina Ferry
(providing access from the Balboa Pavilion to Santa Catalina Island), and the Balboa Ferry
(connecting Balboa Island to the Balboa Peninsula). In conjunction with policies in the Harbor and
Bay Element encouraging the development of more public docks in Newport Harbor, more water
transportation services (such as shuttles and taxis) could be established, as well as increased use of
private vessels for transportation around the Bay.
Newport Beach’s location along the coast, development in neighboring cities and regional imbalances
in housing and employment opportunities contribute to the use of Newport Beach’s arterial roadways
by through traffic (traffic that does not have at least one end of the trip within the City of Newport
Beach). During the morning and evening peak hours when traffic is heaviest, a substantial percentage
of vehicles traveling on Coast Highway, MacArthur Boulevard and Newport Coast Drive are making
ELEMENT
That Is Friendly to Pedestrians and Bicycles
through trips. County-wide, trip generation is expected to increase by approximately 18 percent from
2000 to 2025. Studies done in conjunction with this Circulation Element show that more than half of
future traffic growth and future unsatisfactory intersection performance in Newport Beach will result
from growth in the surrounding region, regardless of any future growth and development in Newport
Beach. The location of JWA along Newport Beach’s boundary also contributes to regional traffic
through the City. JWA users access the freeway system as well as nearby destinations through the
Newport Beach roadway system. The additional JWA activity generated by the recently approved
increases in passenger service levels and passenger loading bridges will increase traffic volume on
Airport Area roads such as MacArthur Boulevard, Campus Drive, Jamboree Road, and the Bristol
Street couplet.
Summertime beach traffic has been a challenge for Newport Beach since the 1920’s. During June, July
and August, weekend traffic near the beach and harbor is substantially higher than typical spring/fall
(“shoulder season”) or winter conditions. Volumes on impacted roadways generally increase by
almost 30 percent, but summertime beach traffic occurs at different times than the typical weekday
business or school related traffic during most of the year. The two locations with weekend volume
increases of more than 30 percent during the summer are Newport Boulevard south of Coast
Highway (75 percent) and Balboa Boulevard east of 20th Street (75 percent) on the Peninsula.
This Circulation Element continues longstanding Newport Beach policies of using the shoulder
season for transportation planning, sizing the circulation system to meet the needs of City residents
and businesses, and maintaining the character of the community. While these policies may prevent the
City from achieving a desired level of service at all locations at all hours, they also protect Newport
Beach from building oversized roads to serve weekend summer beach traffic or traffic generated

Circulation Element
outside of our borders and our control. Instead, policies in this Element encourage improvements to
the regional system that will provide more capacity outside Newport Beach and reduce the number of
through travelers that drive on our local streets.
LOCAL ROADWAY SYSTEM
The roadway system serves primarily vehicular traffic in Newport Beach. The roadway system is of
particular interest to the citizens of Newport Beach, as the majority of them use it for primary travel
needs.
ROADWAY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
The roadway system is generally organized in terms of a roadway classification system. The road
classifications used by the City of Newport Beach are required to be consistent with the County of
Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways, which is administered by the Orange County
Transportation Authority (OCTA). OCTA is the
regional agency responsible for overseeing the
regional transportation system and local agency
compliance with regional and statewide programs
such as the Congestion Management Program
(CMP) and Growth Management Program
(GMP). The general roadway classifications and
their generalized daily capacities are presented
below.
The actual daily capacity of a roadway can vary
widely. Although it is primarily based on the
number of through lanes, it is also influenced by
traffic peaking characteristics, intersection
spacing, traffic turning volumes, and the volume Automobile traffic along Pacific Coast Highway in Corona del Mar
of vehicular and pedestrian cross traffic. The
typical daily capacities are therefore most appropriately used for long range General Plan analysis, or
as a screening tool to determine the need for more detailed peak hour analysis. More detailed peak
hour analysis at all potentially impacted intersections will be required as part of the City’s review of
development projects that have the potential to result in traffic impacts.
Principal Arterial—A Principal arterial highway is typically an eight-lane divided roadway. A
Principal arterial is designed to accommodate a daily capacity ranging from 60,000 to 73,000 with a
typical daily capacity of 68,000 vehicles per day (VPD). Principal arterials carry a large volume of
regional through traffic not handled by the freeway system.
Major Arterial—A Major arterial highway is typically a six-lane divided roadway. A Major arterial is
designed to accommodate a daily capacity ranging from 45,000 to 67,000 with a typical daily capacity
of 51,000 vehicles per day. Major arterials carry a large volume of regional through traffic not handled
by the freeway system. A Major Augmented is similar to a Major arterial, but may include additional
lanes, particularly at intersections, resulting in a daily capacity ranging from 52,000 to 70,000 with a
typical daily capacity of 58,000 vehicles per day.

                                                                                Circulation Element
Primary Arterial—A Primary arterial highway is usually a four-lane divided roadway. A Primary
arterial is designed to accommodate a daily capacity ranging from 30,000 to 45,000 with a typical daily
capacity of 34,000 VPD. A Primary arterial’s function is similar to that of a Principal or Major arterial.
The chief difference is capacity. A Primary Augmented is similar to a Primary arterial, but may include
additional lanes, particularly at intersections, resulting in a daily capacity ranging from 35,000 to
50,000 with a typical daily capacity of 40,000 vehicles per day.
                                                                Secondary         Arterial—A        Secondary
                                                                arterial highway is a four-lane roadway
                                                                (often undivided). A Secondary arterial
                                                                distributes traffic between local streets and
                                                                Major or Primary arterials. Although some
                                                                Secondary arterials serve as through
                                                                routes, most provide more direct access to
                                                                surrounding land uses than Principal,
                                                                Major, or Primary arterials. Secondary
                                                                arterials carry a daily capacity ranging from
                                                                20,000 to 30,000 with a typical daily
                                                                capacity of 23,000 VPD.
                                                                Commuter Roadway—A commuter
Automobile traffic along MacArthur Boulevard                    roadway is a two-to-four-lane, unrestricted
access roadway with a daily capacity ranging from 7,000 to 11,000 with a typical daily capacity of
10,000 VPD. It differs from a local street in its ability to handle through traffic movements between
arterials.
In addition to these basic classifications, this Circulation Element provides for roadways that can carry
traffic above the typical capacity level for the classification, if the standard section is augmented.
Examples of augmented sections include additional through and/or turning lanes at some locations
and additional turning lanes at signalized street intersections with heavy turning movements. This may
be accomplished by adding right-of-way or by reducing the widths of sidewalk areas, medians, travel
lanes, and emergency shoulder lanes.
ROADWAY OPERATIONS
The best way to determine the level of traffic service is to analyze performance at major intersections,
and this Element is based on a comprehensive traffic study, a summary of which is presented in the
Appendix. The traffic study includes key information regarding citywide trip generation, daily traffic
volumes, detailed peak hour analysis of all key arterial intersections throughout the City, and roadway
improvement requirements. The forecast traffic volumes are based upon development at the
maximum level allowed by the Land Use Element in Newport Beach and development in adjacent
areas over the next 25 years. Therefore, they present a “worst case” result. As a practical matter, actual
development in any community is typically less than the entitlement or theoretical limit, and Newport
Beach’s experience has been no different. Because of the impact of regional traffic on Newport
Beach, a supplemental traffic study was completed to help determine the impact of traffic growth in
the region on local streets, and a summary of this study is in the Appendix. Intersections that do not
perform well are the major constraint to the efficient operation of the circulation system, and the
                                                           Newport Beach General Plan                    7-5

Circulation Element
traffic study focuses on the level of service at primary intersections in Newport Beach. Generalized
definitions of level of service are as follows:
    ■ LOS “A”—Minimal delay (less than 10 seconds on average) is experienced.
    ■ LOS “B”—Vehicles at signalized intersections experience between 10 and 20 seconds of delay
       on average, while vehicles on the side street STOP controlled approaches at unsignalized
       intersections experience between 10 and 15 seconds of average delay.
    ■ LOS “C”—Delays at signalized intersections range from 20 to 35 seconds and from 15 to 25
       seconds for side street / STOP controlled traffic at unsignalized intersections.
    ■ LOS “D”—Delays at signalized intersections range from 35 to 55 seconds and from 25 to 35
       seconds for side street / STOP controlled approaches at unsignalized intersections.
    ■ LOS “E”—Delays at signalized intersections range from 55 to 80 seconds on average, while
       delays for side street / STOP controlled traffic at unsignalized intersections range from 35 to 50
       seconds.
    ■ LOS “F”—All vehicles at signalized intersections can be expected to wait through more than a
       single signal cycle with average delays in excess of 80 seconds, while delays to side street /
       STOP controlled approaches at unsignalized intersections will exceed 50 seconds on average.
This Element includes intersection improvements that will reduce congestion at major arterial
intersections and links. These improvements, shown in Exhibits CE-1 and CE-2 and listed in the
Appendix, have been developed to meet the level of service standard adopted in Circulation Element
policies, based upon analysis using the computerized traffic model with traffic projections to the year
2030. Improvements included in this Element are those that require the least additional right-of-way
and cause the least environmental impacts. Because this analysis is long-term, some of the intersection
improvements listed may not be constructed exactly as described herein, or a particular improvement
may be shown to be unnecessary over the course of the next 25 years.
The City of Newport Beach has traditionally set LOS “D” as its goal for intersection performance,
whenever possible. At the same time, the City has recognized that achieving this goal in every case
would require a circulation system with oversized elements to accommodate summer beach traffic or
regional through traffic. The City has chosen to provide a circulation system that is sized to meet the
needs of residents and local businesses and respects the character of Newport Beach. This Circulation
Element continues that longstanding practice. The vast majority of intersections in Newport Beach
will continue to function at or better than LOS “D” with implementation of the improvements
included in this Element, and policy establishes LOS “D” as the standard for most intersections. LOS
“E” is the established standard for a limited number of intersections discussed below.
The Airport Area is heavily impacted by through traffic accessing JWA, and intense development in
the Irvine Business Complex. The circulation improvements that would be necessary to accommodate
traffic from these sources and achieve LOS “D” would be extremely expensive, and would be
contrary to the desires of Newport Beach residents expressed during the Visioning Process for this
General Plan. For these reasons, LOS “E” is the standard for any intersection in the Airport Area
shared with the City of Irvine (which has established LOS “E” as its standard in the adjacent Irvine
Business Complex).
Coast Highway through Mariners’ Mile is significantly impacted by through traffic and summer beach
traffic, and also experiences considerable pedestrian and bicycle activity. The improvements that
would be necessary to achieve LOS “D” at the Dover Drive intersection would require the
  7-6    Newport Beach General Plan

                                                                             Circulation Element
elimination of sidewalk that could compromise bicycle and pedestrian safety, and would have adverse
impacts on adjacent residential neighborhoods and the local business community. Therefore, LOS
“E” is the established standard for this intersection.
Corona del Mar is a pedestrian oriented, neighborhood serving commercial area that is being
upgraded consistent with the Corona del Mar Vision Plan that has received overwhelming community
support. The goal of this plan is to create a more pedestrian friendly commercial area with improved
aesthetics and an attractive streetscape. Coast Highway, the primary route through Corona del Mar,
carries a large amount of through traffic during the morning and evening peak hour periods. The
improvements that would be necessary to achieve LOS “D” at the intersections of Marguerite Avenue
and Goldenrod Avenue would be contrary to the goals and efforts of the Corona del Mar community.
For these intersections, LOS “E” is the standard set by policy in the Circulation Element.
In addition to specific intersection improvements that can be identified at this time, future operational
issues may arise in the vicinity of closely spaced intersections or other locations where analysis of
isolated intersections does not accurately depict the quality of traffic flow. Potential examples include
the Bristol Street couplet, freeway interchanges, or the intersections of San Miguel Drive at Avocado
Avenue and at MacArthur Boulevard. The Circulation element includes policy for the City to monitor
these locations and make adjustments as appropriate in the future.
TRUCK TRAFFIC
Trucks are needed to provide delivery of heavy goods to residences and commercial areas, and for
other purposes such as pick up of refuse throughout the City. However, the City needs to control and
limit truck traffic to minimize the noise and other impacts on residents, avoid undue damage to
infrastructure and minimize the potential for traffic congestion. Commercial vehicles are generally
permitted on City of Newport Beach roads. Commercial vehicles weighing in excess of 3 tons (6,000
pounds) are prohibited from certain roadways, as signed.
REGIONAL FACILITIES
Regional transportation facilities serve the needs of travelers through Newport Beach, and residents
and workers that travel between Newport Beach and other locations. Major roadway system features
such as freeways, airports, and marine terminals serve regional traffic.
The facilities that provide regional access to Newport Beach include the I-405 Freeway, SR-55
Freeway, SR-73 freeway/tollway and Coast Highway (Highway 1). Coast Highway is owned and
operated by Caltrans with the exception of the segment between Jamboree Road and Newport Coast
Drive. Newport Boulevard from Finley Street to the northerly city limits at Industrial Way is also
under Caltrans jurisdiction. Caltrans controls the signal timing and coordination along these roadways,
and the City needs to work with Caltrans to meet Newport Beach’s needs and desires to provide a
coordinated and efficient circulation system.
Regional traffic interacting with Newport Beach generally accesses the City roadway system through
Coast Highway or other connections from the 405, 55 and 73 freeways/tollway. Ramp intersections
are maintained and controlled by Caltrans. Ramp capacity constraints can sometimes (during peak
hours) slow access to the freeway system, potentially resulting in a back-up of freeway traffic onto the

local roadway system. Conversely, traffic exiting the freeway system can sometimes cause congestion
that affects the freeway mainline.
Air travel for residents, workers, and visitors in Orange County is served by JWA (located just
northwest of Campus Drive along the City boundary), which is owned and operated by the County of
Orange. JWA is a part of the regional system of airports. JWA is presently authorized to serve 10.3
million annual passengers (MAP), which increases to 10.8 MAP on January 1, 2011.
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
Transit services are provided by OCTA and through paratransit programs, such as the one provided
by the Oasis Senior Center and/or OCTA. The program at the Oasis Senior Center provides local
transportation for a nominal fee to seniors.
An established network of bus routes provides access to employment centers, shopping and
recreational areas within the City. OCTA periodically updates a Countywide Bus Service
Implementation Program (BSIP), which includes changes to service levels and route configurations.
OCTA also provides enhanced service during the summer months to serve the beach oriented traffic
destined for Newport Beach. The Newport Transportation Center and Park-and-Ride facility is
located at MacArthur Boulevard and San Joaquin Hills Road in Newport Center.
TRAILS

automobile travel, also provide recreational
opportunities for the community. The existing
trail system in Newport Beach has been
developed to provide access for commuter and
recreational bicyclists, along with pedestrians and
equestrians.
Bicycle Trails
Bikeway is a term used to designate all facilities
which provide for bicycle travel. The City of
Newport Beach Master Plan of Bikeways A number of bike and pedestrian trails are located within the community.
provides the following types of facilities:
    1. Bicycle Lane. A lane in the street, either the parking lane or a separate lane, designated for the
       exclusive or semi-exclusive use of bicycles. Through travel by motor vehicles or pedestrians is
       not allowed, vehicle parking may or may not be allowed. Cross flow by motorists to gain access
       to driveways and parking facilities is allowed. Separation from the motor vehicle travel way is
       normally by a painted solid stripe. Bicycle lanes and bicycle routes together are also known as
       Class 3 bicycle trails.
    2. Bicycle Route. A shared right-of-way for bicycle operation, whether or not it is specified by
       signs or markings. All main streets and highways by authority of the California Vehicle Code
       include bicycle routes as defined herein. Bicycle lanes and bicycle routes together are also
       known as Class 3 bicycle trails.

    3. Bicycle Trail. A pathway designated for the use of bicycles which is physically separated from
        motor vehicle traffic. Pedestrian traffic may or may not be excluded. Bicycle trails are also
        known as Class 1 bicycle trails.
    4. Backbone Bikeway. Backbone bikeways are major through bikeways, as shown on the Master
        Plan of Bikeways. They are primarily on major roads. Backbone bikeways may connect to
        regional trails, as shown in the Master Plan.
    5. Secondary Bikeway. Secondary bikeways connect to backbone trails and serve cyclists and
        children riding to and from school. Secondary bikeways may also be a bicycle lane, route, or
        trail.
The city has designated additional off road facilities in the form of sidewalk bikeways which provide
improved bike safety for recreational riders and children within high use corridors in the vicinity of
schools, beaches, and residential neighborhoods.
The needs of bicyclists will vary with the function of the trip and the speed and skill level of the rider.
Those residents who use bicycles daily for their primary means of transportation are concerned with
utilizing the most convenient and direct route available to reach their destination. These bicyclists
normally will select a route along a primary or a major highway. In contrast, the recreational rider
might choose a route for its scenic interest such as a ride on a bike trail separated from vehicular
traffic. Thus, it is necessary to provide bikeways for bicyclists along major transportation corridors as
well as residential and scenic areas. It is also necessary to provide bikeways which separate faster
cyclists from pedestrian travel and slower cyclists, integrating bicycle travel more closely with
vehicular traffic, and bikeways which separate slower cyclists from motor vehicle traffic.
The Circulation Element considers additional bikeways that could be developed in the Newport
Beach area, as well as the safety of bicyclists in Newport Beach.
Pedestrian Corridors
Newport Beach has a variety of pedestrian facilities. These include sidewalks in developed areas, the
oceanfront boardwalk on Balboa Peninsula, bayfront walkways on Balboa Island and parts of Balboa
Peninsula and Mariners’ Mile, and trails along Upper Newport Bay and in open space areas.
Pedestrian activity is high in coastal areas such as Balboa Island, Balboa Peninsula, and Corona del
Mar, with high numbers of pedestrians crossing Coast Highway through Mariners’ Mile.
Newport Beach has opportunities to provide more pedestrian walkways along the bayfront on Balboa
Peninsula and Mariners’ Mile. As properties in these areas are developed pursuant to the Land Use
Element, there will be opportunities to enhance and increase pedestrian activity and reduce driving.
Equestrian Trails
Equestrian trails are primarily located in the Santa Ana Heights portion of the City. These trails, and
other equestrian facilities, are highly valued by residents of this area and provide regional recreation
opportunities as well.

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT/TRAVEL
DEMAND MANAGEMENT
With the exception of summer beach traffic, Newport Beach roads are most heavily traveled during
the morning and evening commutes. Implementation of Transportation Systems Management (TSM)
or Travel Demand Management (TDM) measures can reduce peak hour traffic and possibly result in
intersection service levels better than those forecast in this Element and the General Plan Traffic
Study. In some jurisdictions, transportation demand management (TDM) plans/programs have
reduced peak hour traffic by 10 to 15 percent.
TSM techniques involve enhancing capacity without physical roadway widening, and can help to
retain the community character and limit the impact of the roadway system on the environment.
Examples of TSM improvements include traffic signal timing improvements, traffic signal
coordination along a route and improvements to roadway signage, especially for tourist destinations.
The City’s TDM Ordinance requires projects to reduce the number of peak-period vehicle trips by
promoting and encouraging the use of alternative transportation modes, such as ridesharing, carpools,
vanpools, public transit, bicycles and walking; and provide facilities that support such alternate modes.
TDM methods are enhanced by incorporating employment near residential uses, providing incentives
for alternative/multi-user modes, etc. Employers with large work forces can utilize all of these
techniques, while smaller companies are typically limited to ridesharing and flextime programs.
PARKING
Parking availability is limited in the coastal portions of Newport Beach, especially during the peak
summer months. Balboa Peninsula, Balboa Island, Mariners’ Mile, Corona Del Mar, and West
Newport are areas of particular concern. The Balboa Peninsula Parking Management Plan included
parking surveys/studies and recommendations, which the City has begun to implement, as follows:
meter time limits (ongoing), visitor parking guide, bus layover area (completed), additional red curbing
to improve intersection visibility (completed), increased meter fees (ongoing), business permit
program, consolidating public parking, monitoring of lot utilization (ongoing), Balboa Pier lot
validation program, and a shared parking program. Valet services have also been suggested for both
the Balboa Peninsula and Mariners’ Mile.
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING
Newport Beach receives funding from gasoline tax apportionment, county, state, and federal funds
and the Traffic Phasing Ordinance, Fair Share Ordinance, and the General Fund. The City’s Traffic
Phasing Ordinance has been in effect since 1978. It requires developer funding of a proportional
share of intersection improvements when a proposed project has a direct negative impact on the level
of service at that intersection. This ordinance phases intersection improvements with development to
maintain the City’s standards for level of traffic service. The City’s Fair Share Ordinance, which was
adopted in 1984, establishes a fee, based upon the unfunded cost to implement the Master Plan of
Streets and Highways, to be paid in conjunction with the issuance of a building permit.

                                                  Highlight Newport Beach’s
Introduction
The City’s parks, bicycle and pedestrian trails, recreational facilities, and coastal resources such as
beaches play an important role in the physical, mental, social, and environmental health of Newport
Beach residents. These facilities are important land use components in an urban environment,
providing both visual relief from the built environment and contributing to residents’ quality of life
through recreation and aesthetic value.
California state law requires that recreational issues be discussed in the General Plan. Since 1973,
Newport Beach has had a Recreation and Open Space Element that was most recently amended in
1998. With the update of this General Plan, only policies related to recreation are included within this
element, while open space policies are contained within the Natural Resources Element.
The primary purpose of the Recreation Element is to ensure that the balance between the provision
of sufficient parks and recreation facilities are appropriate for the residential and business population
of Newport Beach. Specific recreational issues and policies contained in this Recreation Element
include: parks and recreation facilities, recreation programs, shared facilities, coastal recreation and
support facilities, marine recreation, and public access.

Context
PARKS AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
The City has approximately 278 acres of developed parks. Newport Beach’s parklands range in size
from mini-parks such as the Lower Bay Park (0.1 acre) to the 39-acre Bonita Canyon Sports Park. The
existing park facilities are shown in Figure R1. School facilities also provide indoor and outdoor
recreational opportunities in the City, while greenbelts and open space areas provide passive
recreational opportunities or open space relief. These park and recreation facilities are described
below. Additionally, bikeways, jogging trails, pedestrian trails, recreation trails, and regional equestrian
trails are also available in Newport Beach.

Park Types
Community Park—Community parks serve the entire City and are easily accessible via arterial roads.
Community parks are those with improvements such as community buildings, parking, swimming,
facilities for picnicking, active sports, and other facilities that serve a larger population. Community
Parks may have a particular theme or orientation such as active sports or aquatic facilities.
Mini Park—Mini parks are smaller parks which may take one of two different forms. Most mini
parks are less than one acre in size, serve a quarter-mile radius, and are located within a neighborhood,
separate from major or collector roads. Some mini parks serve the entire City and are located as urban
trail heads along major trails or streets.
Neighborhood Park—Neighborhood parks serve all ages and are generally one to eight acres in size.
They are located adjacent to public schools when possible. Neighborhood parks contain a wide
variety of improvements which can include turf areas, active sport fields and courts, community
buildings, play apparatus and picnic facilities. Other improvements might include senior centers,
youth centers, and aquatic facilities.

Recreation Element
View Park—View parks are smaller passive
parks designed to take advantage of a significant
view. They are often located on coastal bluffs to
focus upon ocean or bay views. Most view parks
are between one-half to three acres in size and
serve the entire City. View parks are generally
improved with landscaping, walkways, and
benches.
Greenbelt—Greenbelts in public or private
ownership are included in this category. They
may include areas with some recreational
facilities, although the primary function of the
area is passive open space.
                                                   Children’s play area at West Newport Park
Open Space—Open space includes passive and
active open space areas which do not function as public parks but do provide open space relief. Such
areas may or may not be accessible to the general public.
Public Beach—Public beaches serve a number of local and regional functions. In some
neighborhoods, beaches function as neighborhood or community parks. Easy accessibility, lack of
entrance fees and a lack of other available parks has contributed to this function. Public beaches all
include sandy beach areas adjacent to the bay or ocean and may include active sports, snack bars,
showers, drinking fountains, restrooms, walkways, docks, benches, shade trees and parking areas.
From observation, it has been determined that active beach recreation takes place within about 100
feet of the water’s edge. Therefore, this Element treats this seaward 100 feet of the public beaches in
the City as active recreation acreage.
School—Public schools are a part of the recreation system in the City because field and playground
areas can serve the general public during weekends and after school.
Circulation and Improvement and Open Space
Agreement
Some of the City’s parks and open space areas consist of dedicated lands through the Circulation and
Improvement and Open Space Agreement (CIOSA). This agreement is between the City of Newport
Beach and The Irvine Company, and has allowed building entitlements for The Irvine Company in
exchange for payments for circulation projects, an interest free loan, and land for open space and
potential senior housing sites for the City. The amount of open space land dedication was
substantially more than what would have been required under the City’s Park Dedication Ordinance.
Six sites have been dedicated under CIOSA in Newport Beach, and include: Back Bay View Park,
Newport Village (formerly Newport Center Park), Newporter Knoll, Freeway Reservation, Upper
Castaways, and Harbor Cove. Another site, located at Jamboree Road and MacArthur Boulevard, will
be dedicated upon issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for final CIOSA project.

Recreational Facilities
The City’s parks contain a variety of recreational facilities, with areas available for organized sports
including soccer fields, baseball diamonds, tennis courts, volleyball courts, and basketball courts.
Recreational opportunities exist for children in many of the play areas in the City’s parks. Biking and
walking trails are also popular recreational amenities. Swimming pools are available to the public at
aquatic facilities at the Marian Bergeson Aquatic Center and Newport Harbor High School through
joint use agreements with the Newport-Mesa Unified School District. Additional recreational
resources in the City include three community centers, several multipurpose recreation centers, a
senior center, and two gymnasium facilities. Locations of these recreational facilities are also shown
on Figure R1. Private facilities, including yacht clubs, golf courses, and country clubs are also facilities
that serve residents of Newport Beach.
Peninsula Park offers opportunities for organized sports
Sharing of Parks and Recreation Facilities
Public schools within the City under the jurisdiction of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District
contain a number of important recreation facilities. Currently, after-school recreational use of these
facilities is utilized by youth and adult residents through joint use agreements between the school
district and the City.
Parkland Dedication Standards
Parkland dedication standards associated with the Quimby Act and the Newport Beach Subdivision
Code are applicable to development in the City. As required under California Government Code, the
Quimby Act provides for the dedication of parkland, or the payment of fees in lieu of land, by
developers as a requirement for residential development. The Act requires the provision of three acres
of park area per 1,000 persons residing within a subdivision, unless the amount of existing
neighborhood and community park area exceeds that limit, in which case the City may adopt a higher
standard not to exceed five acres per 1,000 residents.

Recreation Element
Chapter 19.52, Park Dedication and Fees of the City’s Municipal Code provides for the dedication of
land, the payment of fees in lieu thereof or a combination of both, for park or recreational purposes
in conjunction with the approval of residential development. Newport Beach’s park dedication
requirement is five acres per 1,000 persons. In-lieu fees are placed in a fund earmarked for the
provision or rehabilitation of park and recreation facilities that can serve the subdivision. The park
dedication ordinance also provides for credit to be given, at the discretion of the City Council, for the
provision of private recreation facilities within a new residential development or for the provision of
park and recreation improvements to land dedicated for a public park. If allowed, the private facilities
or public improvements are credited against the dedication of land and/or the payment of in-lieu fees.
The ordinance is not applicable to non-residential subdivisions.
MARINE RECREATION AND FACILITIES
Throughout its history, Newport Beach has been a major marine recreational center. There are over
eight miles of sandy beaches that provide opportunities for sunbathing, volleyball, swimming, surfing,
windsurfing, and other recreational activities. Newport Bay and Harbor are used for a wide variety of
recreational activities, including boating, diving, excursions, fishing, kayaking, paddle boarding,
parasailing, rowing, sailing, swimming, and windsurfing.
Coastal Recreation Opportunities
Newport Beach’s beaches are a popular destination     Public dock at 15th Street
As previously discussed, public beaches serve a number of local and regional functions, while
providing the largest coastal recreation opportunity within Newport Beach. Public beaches all include
sandy beach areas adjacent to the bay or ocean and may include active sports, snack bars, showers,
drinking fountains, restrooms, walkways, docks, benches, shade trees and parking areas. Public
beaches are shown in Figure R1.
Other coastal recreation opportunities include two recreational piers, provided by the City. The 800-
foot Newport Pier is located at the end of Newport Boulevard (McFadden Place) in McFadden
Square. The 950-foot Balboa Pier is located at the end of Main Street in Balboa Village.
Additionally, the City provides ten public docks in the harbor, which can be used for boat launching
and fishing. The Newport Aquatic Center property is also co-owned by the City and County, but is

leased and privately operated by the Center. Located on Northstar Beach, the Newport Aquatic
Center provides an opportunity for the public and members to kayak and canoe in Upper Newport
Bay as well as advanced training facilities for world-class athletes.
                                                       The county and the state own four recreational

                                                       The privately operated 100-acre Newport Dunes
                                                       Aquatic Park provides opportunities for camping,
                                                       boating, canoeing, kayaking, swimming and other
                                                       water and beach activities. The 752-acre Upper

                                                       Ecological Reserve) and 140-acre Upper
                                                       Newport Bay Nature Preserve provide
                                                       opportunities for canoeing, kayaking, horseback
                                                       riding, biking, and hiking. Lastly, the Crystal
Trail in Crystal Cove Park
                                                       Cove State Park also provides coastal recreation
opportunities with 3.5 miles of beach and 2,000 acres of undeveloped woodland which is popular for
hiking and horseback riding. Approximately 240 acres is located within the City. The offshore waters
are designated as an underwater park. Crystal Cove is used by mountain bikers inland and scuba and
skin divers underwater. The beach is popular with swimmers and surfers. Visitors can explore
tidepools and sandy coves.
Commercial areas adjacent to beaches and the bay play an important role in providing and enhancing
recreational activities. A large number of businesses provide recreational services to residents and
visitors that include charter, entertainment and excursion vessels, sports equipment rentals, launching
facilities, amusement facilities, and shops and restaurants.
Shoreline Access
The public’s right to access recreational features such as the Pacific Ocean beaches, Lower Newport
Bay/Harbor, and Upper Newport Bay are important. According to the City’s Local Coastal Plan,
there are two basic types of public access: vertical access (access to the shoreline), and lateral access
(access along the shoreline). Newport Beach has developed an extensive system of access to ocean
beaches and the bay. Virtually all of the Pacific Ocean shoreline beaches are public and the bay is
accessible via public beaches, parks, street ends, shoreline trails, walkways, and boardwalks.
Needs
Although the City of Newport Beach appears largely built out, there are a number of vacant parcels
available for future development. The General Plan Land Use Element projects additional population
increases through infill development, intensification of existing uses, and annexations. Therefore, in
addition to any unmet park and recreation needs of the present population, the demand for recreation
facilities will grow. In addition, the Land Use Element allows for higher density development within
the City, where opportunities for different types of park and recreational facilities may arise.
Specific citywide and service area needs for parks and recreational facilities, as well as marine
recreation and facilities, are described below.

CITYWIDE ISSUES AND NEEDS
Parks and Recreational Facilities
In June 2005, it is estimated that a total of 415.6 acres of parklands are needed within the City to
accommodate the current population of 83,120 residents (utilizing the City standard of 5 acres per
1,000 population). As shown in Table 1, below, there are an existing total of 286.4 acres of parks and
90.4 acres of active beach recreation within Newport Beach with a combined total of 376.8 acres.
Thus, this represents a total deficit of 38.8 acres of combined park and beach acreage citywide. Seven
of the twelve service areas are experiencing a deficit in this combined recreation acreage. Three
planned parks in West Newport, Newport Center, and Newport Coast would help alleviate the
citywide park deficit. In addition to a deficit in combined park and beach recreation acreage, there is
also an overall shortage in active playfields throughout Newport Beach. Many of the service areas
within the City, as discussed in greater detail below, may have a park surplus but are still experiencing
a deficit in active playfields. Also, it is difficult to provide playfields because of the large amount of
land required for sports fields, the lack of suitable vacant land, and the high cost of such land within
the City.
The citywide parks and recreation facilities needs described below have been identified through the
following: (1) community surveys (administered from December 1996 to February 1997), (2) data
shown in Table R1 (Parkland Acreage Needs), and (3) monitoring of the use of recreation programs
and facilities.

Identified Issues and Needs
Sports Fields—Perhaps the fastest growing recreational demand in Newport Beach is the need for
additional sports fields, especially lighted facilities available for after-work sports leagues. This need
stems from the evolving nature of sports activities, diversity of sports that residents are involved in,
growing participation of girls in a number of field sports, the lengthening of seasons for many sports
and consequent season overlap, the need for sports facilities for the physically challenged, and the
continuing high level of participation in company sports leagues such as coed softball. Meeting this
need will be a challenge because of the large amount of area required for sports fields, the lack of
suitable vacant land in the City, and the high cost of such land. In addition, school districts are adding
new teams to accommodate the diversity of sports students are interested in, making it more difficult
for the City’s Recreation Department to use school sports fields to provide public recreation
opportunities.
Indoor Facilities—The community surveys emphasized the need for additional gymnasium or other
indoor sports facilities, such as for basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics. With the exception of the
West Newport Community Center, all of the current indoor facilities owned by the City are small and
consist of one or two small classrooms. There is a need for community centers with large meeting and
multipurpose rooms that can be programmed for many different classes and activities. Additional
indoor facilities should be planned for the long-term, located preferably within a community-level
park.
Community Pool Facilities—The need surveys showed a strong desire for additional adult and
youth swimming pool and aquatic sports facilities and programs. The City does not own a swimming
pool and currently offers all aquatics programs to the community at one of two high school pools.
There is a growing demand through the schools for additional aquatic programs serving the students,
thereby limiting the amount of time the City can operate programs for the general public.
Sharing of School Facilities—Public schools within the City administered by the Newport-Mesa
Unified School District contain a number of important indoor and outdoor recreation facilities. After-
school recreational use of these facilities including playfields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and other
facilities could be utilized by other non-school age residents of Newport Beach to maximize the
recreational opportunities available. However, as schools evolve in function, the City’s Recreation
Department may lose use of these school facilities.
Other Facilities—Other identified facility needs include bike and pedestrian trails, lighted tennis
courts, dog parks, tot lots/playgrounds, golf driving range, public marine recreational and educational
facilities, and public restrooms.
Temporary Events—Temporary events such as festivals are held at parks and recreation facilities
within the City. During these events, access to and use of these facilities could be impacted.
Marine Recreation and Facilities
The citywide marine recreation and facilities needs described below have been identified through
community surveys (administered from December 1996 to February 1997), through the data in
Table R1 (Parkland Acreage Needs), and through monitoring of the use of recreation programs and
facilities.

Recreation Element
Identified Issues and Needs
Boating Facilities—Although not as great as the need for sports fields, there is a substantial demand
for public boat launching facilities, sailing facilities, marine sanitation facilities, and guest slips. In
addition, there is a continuing high level of
interest in crew rowing and outrigger paddling
activities and facilities.
Shoreline       Access—Throughout           Southern
California, access to the shoreline is restricted to
the public due to private residential communities.
Although most of the shoreline in Newport
Beach is publicly owned and accessible, there are
a few private residential communities that
impede public access to and along the shoreline.
Temporary Events—Newport Beach’s coastal
areas have long been the venue for temporary
events, including film production, surfing Additional boating facilities are an identified need in Newport Beach.
contests, volleyball tournaments, runs, races, concerts, boat shows, and other such competitions,
exhibitions, and events. Also, a number of view parks have become popular locations for large private
gatherings. The nature and frequency of such events can impact access to the shoreline and other
coastal resources.
SERVICE AREAS
The City has been divided into service areas, as shown in Figure R2, for the purposes of park planning
and to equitably administer parkland dedications and fees provided by residential development. Two
of the 12 service areas within the City, Newport Center and Harbor View, have no identified park and
recreation needs, as discussed below.
Service Area 9—Newport Center. There is park surplus within this service area. The Back Bay View
Park was completed in the summer of 2005, and a new passive park, Newport Center Park, is planned
for development sometime after 2006.
Service Area 11—Harbor View. There is a surplus in park area, and the Harbor View Service Area
contains substantial active and passive recreation facilities. The City’s efforts should be focused on
maintaining and/or upgrading existing facilities, such as Grant Howald Park, Arroyo Park, and Bonita
Canyon Sports Park.
Parks and Recreational Facilities
Service area parks and recreational facilities needs described below have been identified through
community surveys (administered from December 1996 to February 1997), through the data in
Table R1 (Parkland Acreage Needs), and through monitoring of the use of recreation programs and
facilities.

Identified Issues and Needs
Service Area 1—West Newport. Most of West Newport’s recreation land is in beaches. There is a
deficit of 21.6 acres, and a need for sports fields within a new community or neighborhood-level park.
There is a future park site identified in this service area, Sunset Ridge Park which is designated as an
active park to include ball fields, picnic areas, a playground, parking, and restrooms. Additionally, an
active community park (possibly lighted) should be developed in Banning Ranch, regardless of the
ultimate development of the site, to accommodate the Service Area and Citywide needs for active
sports fields.
Service Area 2—Balboa Peninsula. Like West Newport, most of the peninsula’s recreation area is in
beaches. This area has little vacant land for development and the population is expected to remain
stable. Although there is currently a surplus in park acreage, any future park needs can be satisfied via
the renovation and upgrading of facilities, such as those at Las Arenas Park and Peninsula Park.
Additional active park facilities are desirable, along with support facilities such as restrooms, showers,
and drinking fountains. There is also a need for additional boat launching and mooring facilities, as
well as pedestrian pathways to and along the Bay. Future development of the City’s Marina Park
property could provide for the existing community center and the City’s current sailing and boating
facilities on the site to be renovated and expanded.
Service Area 3—Newport Heights/Harbor Highlands. This area is largely built out and contains
several important park and recreation facilities. Substantial school recreation facilities, including
Newport Harbor High School, Ensign Junior High, Mariners Elementary, and Newport Heights
Elementary, compensate for the deficiency in total park area.
Service Area 4—Santa Ana Heights/Airport Commercial. There is currently a park surplus, and the
present two-acre Bayview Park and the proximity of the Upper Bay recreation area provide substantial
recreational opportunities for this area. There is also a planned pocket park and the City is planning a
joint use community center project with the YMCA and there is the possibility that the Caltrans site
may be a future park location. However, this service area is experiencing a shortfall in active
playfields. In addition, the population within this service area is expected to increase under the
General Plan. Future development however will be subject to special provisions that require the
provision of on-site recreational amenities, and dedication of land or payment of in-lieu fees.
Service Area 5—Lower Bay. This area contains Lido Isle and the Bayside Drive area and is largely
built out. Although there is a deficiency in park area, the service area has substantial private
recreational and boating facilities. It is also adjacent to Area 3 (Newport Heights) where there are
extensive recreational facilities. Because of these factors and the fact there is little or no vacant land
suitable for park use, the provision of additional parkland is probably not feasible in this area.
Service Area 6—Balboa Island. This area is similar, in terms of recreation needs and conditions with
a deficiency in park area, to Area 5 above. However, Balboa Island contains more public recreational
facilities in the form of public beach area, the Carroll Beek Community Center, and Balboa Island
Park (a mini-park). The acquisition of additional parkland is probably not feasible in this area.
Service Area 7—Eastbluff/North Ford. Although there is a numerical excess of existing parkland in
this area, most of the land is limited to passive use, such as Big Canyon Park. Additional sports fields
and other active facilities will be needed to satisfy the recreational demands from new development.
                                                          Newport Beach General Plan                 8-15

Recreation Element
However, this Service Area is adjacent to Service Area 11 Harbor View, which contains the 47.6 acre
public park in Bonita Canyon that is available to all Newport Beach residents.
Service Area 8—Big Canyon/Belcourt. Although there are substantial private facilities, there are no
public recreation facilities in this area; thus, there is park deficiency. However, this Service Area is
adjacent to Service Area 11 Harbor View, which contains the 47.6 acre public park in Bonita Canyon
that is available to all Newport Beach residents.
Service Area 10—Corona del Mar. Although there is a deficiency in park area, existing active and
passive facilities should meet present and future need, provided these facilities are renovated and
upgraded to meet demand for sports fields and active recreation.
Service Area 12—Newport Coast. This area is deficient in public facilities, but exceeds the City park
ratio standard if its extensive private facilities are included. Currently, a public park is under design
(estimated to be completed by 2008) near the end of Ridge Park Road. Newport Ridge park, largely
owned and operated by the Newport Ridge Community Association, includes land that the City
operates as an active ballfield along with the site of the Newport Coast Community Center that will
include community meeting rooms and a gymnasium. The City’s Recreation Department does not
offer programs at the privately-owned parks. The youth of the Newport Coast Service Area
participate in programs outside of the service area.

 Policies
R 1.1     New Residential Subdivisions
          Require developers of new residential subdivisions to provide parklands at five
          acres per 1,000 persons, as stated in the City’s Park Dedication Fee Ordinance,
          or to contribute in-lieu fees for the development of public recreation facilities
          meeting demands generated by the development’s resident population, as
          required in the City’s Park Dedications Fees Ordinance. (Imp 8.1, 23.5, 30.2)
R 1.2     High-Density Residential Developments
          Require developers of new high-density residential developments on parcels
          eight acres or larger, to provide on-site recreational amenities. For these
          developments, 44 square feet of on-site recreational amenities shall be provided
          for each dwelling unit in addition to the requirements under the City’s Park
          Dedications and Fees Ordinance. On-site recreational amenities can consist of
          public urban plazas or squares where there is the capability for recreation and
          outdoor activity. These recreational amenities can also include swimming pools,
          exercise facilities, tennis courts, and basketball courts. Where there is insufficient
          land to provide on-site recreational amenities, the developer shall be required to
          pay the City of Newport Beach cash in-lieu that would be used to develop or
          upgrade nearby recreation facilities to offset user demand as defined in the
          City’s Park Dedications and Fees Ordinance.
          The acreage of on-site open space developed with residential projects may be
          credited against the parkland dedication requirements where it is, for example,
          accessible to the public during daylight hours, visible from public rights-of-way,
          and of sufficient size to accommodate recreational use by the public. (Imp 2.1,
          6.1, 8.1, 23.5, 30.2)
R 1.3     Park Fee Update
          Update the park fee assessed to new residential development in lieu of
          dedicating park land on a regular basis. (Imp 23.5, 30.2)
R 1.4     Density Bonuses
          Consider development of incentives such as density bonuses for private
          commercial, office, and other developments to provide usable open space such
          as rooftop courts, pocket parks, public plazas, jogging trails, and pedestrian
          trails. (Imp 2.1)
R 1.5     Parkland Acquisition Criteria
          Use the following criteria when considering acquisition for parkland:
          a. City’s identified current and projected needs for recreation and sports
              facilities
          b. City’s needs for recreation facilities based on location of existing facilities

                      f. Consistency with established parks and recreational facility Goal
                      g. Fiscal impact on General Fund for any immediately needed refurbishments
                          and on-going maintenance
                      h. The existence of a deficiency in a particular Service Area (Imp 23.1)
      R 1.6           Surplus School Site Suitability
                      In the event that surplus school sites become available for parkland acquisition,
                      site desirability should be evaluated using the following criteria:
                      a. Does the school site currently provide recreational facilities that have been
                          identified to meet local or community-wide needs?
                      b. Are other public lands in the vicinity of the school site inadequate to meet
                          the identified existing or foreseeable needs of the community for recreation
                          or open space purposes?
                      c. Is the school site a more economical or otherwise more feasible alternative
                          than other parcels which are available as potential sites in the area? (Imp 23.1)
      R 1.7           Private Parkland
                      Coordinate with the appropriate home owners association to conduct City
                      recreation programs on private parkland. (Imp 39.2)
                      One Ford Road community park
      R 1.8           Passive Parks
                      Use underutilized City rights-of-way located on Ocean Boulevard and Bayside
                      Drive in Corona del Mar as passive parks that are accessible for public use. (Imp
                      23.1, 23.2)
      R 1.9           Priority for Facility Provision
                      Provide additional park and recreation facilities that meet the needs as identified
                      by direct feedback from residents, analysis of future trends, and through

Introduction
Arts and cultural activities play an important role in community life and have been a valued
component of Newport Beach for over 125 years. Newport Beach has a wide range of art and cultural
organizations, resources, attractions, and activities that are a source of community pride and
enrichment. These achievements have evolved over time and have been the result of the dedication
and involvement of numerous individuals, groups, and organizations. However, without intervention,
coordination, preservation and promotion, art and cultural activities and resources can easily be lost
through destruction, indifference, or through unintended land use decisions or policies.
The goals and policies of the Arts and Culture Chapter are intended to be a guide for meeting the
future cultural needs of the community. Future challenges in Newport Beach require maximizing the
community’s cultural arts potential by coordinating with various community groups, businesses,
agencies, citizens and the City to create an active and cohesive cultural and arts programs. The
Chapter is intended to serve as a mechanism for integrating these resources in order to provide
improved and expanded arts and cultural facilities and programs to the community.

LIBRARIES
The Newport Beach Public Library system consists of a Central Library and three branches that
provide a permanent collection of books, periodicals and other materials in addition to hosting events,
lectures, educational programs and other community enrichment activities. The Central Library is
located at 1000 Avocado Avenue and the branch libraries are located in Corona del Mar and the
Balboa Peninsula. The Mariners Library branch, which includes shared use with the Mariners
Elementary School, opened in April 2006.
As of 2006, four libraries serve 84,098 active borrowers and circulate 1,475,025 items annually. Many
resources are also available through specialized databases licensed to the Newport Beach Public
Library, and with a library account, can be accessed from remote locations 24 hours a day.

Introduction
The primary objective of the Natural Resources Element is to provide direction regarding the
conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources. It identifies Newport Beach’s natural
resources and policies for their preservation, development, and wise use. This element addresses:
water supply (as a resource) and water quality (includes bay and ocean quality, and potable drinking
water), air quality, terrestrial and marine biological resources, open space, archaeological and
paleontological resources, mineral resources, visual resources, and energy.
A commitment to sustainable development through the efficient use and conservation of natural
resources is important to meet the needs of current and future residents of Newport Beach.
Commitment to conservation secures ongoing availability of finite resources such as an ample supply
of safe water, diversity of biological resources, and available energy resources. This assurance
contributes substantially to the physical and psychological health and well-being of the community
and strengthens the vitality of the local and regional economic base.

Context
WATER SUPPLY
Water supply is an important resource that needs to be used efficiently. Water service within Newport
Beach is provided by the City, Irvine Ranch Water District (IRWD), and Mesa Consolidated Water
District (Mesa). Generally, Newport Beach provides water service to approximately 13.5 square miles
of the City; IRWD serves approximately nine square miles; and Mesa serves less than one square mile.
Domestic water for the City is supplied by both groundwater and imported surface water. Currently,
about 64 percent of the water supplied to both the City and Mesa’s service area is from groundwater
from the Orange County Groundwater Basin (administered by the Orange County Water District or
RESOURCES ELEMENT
Environmental Quality
OCWD), and the remaining 36 percent of water supply is provided by the Metropolitan Water
District (MWD), which delivers surface water imported from the Colorado River and State Water
Project. This ratio can change year to year based on the OCWD’s administration of the Basin’s
supply. Approximately 35 percent of IRWD’s current water supply is purchased from MWD, with the
remaining 65 percent coming from groundwater.
The future supply projection assumes that the City will continue to produce groundwater and
purchase local water from MWD, which is projected to meet 100 percent of the City’s imported water
needs until the year 2030. Beyond that, improvements associated with the State Water Project supply,
additional local projects, conservation, and additional water transfers would be needed to adequately
provide surface water to the City. The Groundwater Replenishment System (GRS), a joint venture by
OCWD and the Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD), will help reduce Orange County and
Newport Beach’s reliance on imported surface water by taking treated wastewater and injecting it into
the groundwater basin. GRS will be online by 2007, and will produce approximately 70,000 acre feet
of water per year. OCWD projects that there would be sufficient groundwater supplies to meet any
future demand requirements in Newport Beach. IRWD’s treated and clear groundwater supplies are
also expected to be a significant source of potable water supply in the future. MWD water will be
required for supplemental supply as well as peak and emergency conditions.
In an effort to effectively manage water resources, the City’s service area participates in regional water
management programs that assist in the development of resource mixes that balance water supply
sources and meet future local and regional water requirements. In addition, all service providers focus
on demand management efforts that promote efficient water use and effective management of
imported and local water supplies through a variety of water conservation programs.

Natural Resources Element
The City also began purchasing recycled water from OCWD and IRWD in 1999, and has identified
and approached all cost-effective end users in the City that could potentially use recycled water, and
uses a combination of incentives to encourage recycling. The City has maximized opportunities for
end users of recycled water and could only increase users if a neighboring water agency provided the
reclaimed water to the City. Both Mesa and IRWD encourage water recycling as well. Currently,
reclaimed water makes up 20 percent of IRWD’s total water supply.
WATER QUALITY
Newport Beach’s greatest resources are its coastline and bay. Urban runoff from the surrounding
watershed impacts not only the biological diversity and functionality of Newport Bay and the
surrounding coastal waters, but also its water quality. This runoff includes various pollutants, such as
fecal materials from pets, oil and grease,
fertilizers, and other urban-based pollutants. The
City also has traditionally been concerned
regarding these issues and has embarked on a
number of programs to improve its quality.
Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs)—
Newport Bay receives urban runoff from the
Newport Bay watershed, and is designated as
“water quality-limited” for four impairments
under the federal Clean Water Act’s
Section 303(d). Being “water quality-limited”
means that a water body is “not reasonably
expected to attain or maintain water quality
standards” without additional regulation. The law
requires that US EPA develop TMDLs for each China Cove Beach, Corona del Mar
impaired water body in the nation, which specifies the maximum amount of a pollutant that a
waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards. A TMDL may also include a plan for
bringing an impaired water body back within standards. TMDLs have been developed for the
following substances in Newport Beach: sediment, nutrients, fecal coliform, and toxic pollutants.
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)—Additionally, Newport Beach
operates a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) permit under the NPDES. MS4 permits
require an aggressive water quality ordinance, specific municipal practices, and the use of best
management practices (BMPs) in many development-related activities to further reduce the amount of
contaminants in urban runoff. MS4 permits also require local agencies to cooperatively develop a
public education campaign to inform people about what they can do to protect water quality.
Sanitary Sewer Overflows—Newport Beach owns and operates a wastewater collection system that
collects residential and commercial wastewater and transports it for treatment to the Orange County
Sanitation District. Portions of the City receive wastewater service from IRWD. Residences and
businesses hook up private lateral lines to the City’s collection lines. Private and public lines and the
City’s pump stations have the potential to cause sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs), which may lead to
several beach closures in and around Newport Beach each year. Most SSOs in the area are caused by
line blockages from grease and root clogs, or maintenance failures of plumbing associated with pump

                                                                  Natural Resources Element
stations. The City regulates the disposal of grease and other insoluble waste, and follows a defined
Sewer System Master Plan to replace or reline older wastewater lines and upgrade pump stations.
AIR QUALITY
Newport Beach is located within the South Coast Air Basin (Basin), named so because its
geographical formation is that of a basin, with the surrounding mountains trapping the air and its
pollutants in the valleys or basins below. Due to the typical daily wind pattern, much of the Basin is
flushed of high levels of air pollutants on most spring and early summer days. From late summer
through the winter months, the flushing is less pronounced because of lighter wind speeds.
Mobile sources account for the majority of the air pollutant emissions within the Basin. Both the
Federal and state governments have established ambient air quality standards for outdoor
concentrations of various pollutants in order to protect public health. The South Coast Air Quality
Management District (SCAQMD) is responsible for bringing air quality within the Basin into
conformity with the national and state standards.
In an effort to monitor the various concentrations of air pollutants throughout the Basin, the
SCAQMD has divided the region into 27 source receptor areas (SRAs). Newport Beach is located
within SRA 18, which encompasses the North Coastal Orange County area. The air pollutants for
which national and state standards have been promulgated and which are most relevant to air quality
planning and regulation include ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur
dioxide (SO2). As of 2003, SRA 18 did not exceed state or national standards for any criteria pollutant
monitored.
Toxic air contaminants are also a concern in the air basins, but are different than the “criteria”
pollutants listed above in that ambient air quality standards have not been established for them, largely
because there are hundreds of air toxics and their effects on health tend to be local rather than
regional. These contaminants include chemical substances that may be emitted from a variety of
common sources including gasoline stations, motor vehicles, dry cleaners, painting and industrial
operations, etc.
Land use patterns and density of development affect the amount of air pollutants that are generated
by communities. Newport Beach is a low-density community, where the distance between uses is
greater than in high-density communities. As a result, there are fewer public transportation routes and
vehicles, and an increase in the number of motor vehicle trips and associated air pollutant emissions.
Newport Beach is also a jobs-rich City, which increases the potential for emissions to be generated as
employees or residents have to commute long distances to and from their homes and work.
The City’s Municipal Code does address air quality by establishing a special fund to receive revenue
distributed by the SCAQMD. The SCAQMD imposes an additional vehicle registration fee, of which
the City is eligible to receive a portion, to implement mobile source air pollution reduction programs.
Aircraft Pollution
Aircraft operations at the John Wayne Airport (JWA) contribute air pollutants that affect residents
and visitors of Newport Beach. Specifically, aircraft engines emit water vapor, carbon dioxide, small
amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, sulfur gases, and soot and metal
particles formed by the high temperature combustion of jet fuel during flight. NOx emissions are a
                                                         Newport Beach General Plan                10-5

Natural Resources Element
precursor to the formation of ground-level ozone, also known as smog. Ozone affects human
pulmonary and respiratory health. Also, NOx reacts in the atmosphere to form secondary particulate
matter (PM2.5), which also causes detrimental health effects. In addition, NOx, ozone, and PM
adversely affect the environment in various ways including visibility impairment, crop damage, and
acid rain.
Aircraft engine emissions prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) were
adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the United States in 1997. The City of
Newport Beach does not have any specific regulations governing aircraft engine emissions.
BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
A variety of diverse, valuable, and sensitive biological resources occur within the City of Newport
Beach. The terrestrial and marine resources that are present in the City are described below.
Terrestrial Resources
Many plant habitats can be found in Newport Beach that includes scrub, chaparral, grassland, and
riparian habitats. Additionally, Newport Beach contains vernal pools, seeps, and wet meadows. Other
plant habitats present in Newport Beach include annual grasslands, ruderal areas that are generally a
result of disturbances caused by humans, and ornamental landscaping that consist of introduced trees,
shrubs, flowers, and turf grass.
Sensitive Terrestrial Species
The California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) California Natural Diversity Database
(CNDDB) and the California Native Plant Society’s Electronic Inventory of Rare and Endangered
Vascular Plants of California identifies occurrences of federal- or state-listed or proposed endangered
or threatened species, federal Species of Concern, species categorized as federal Species of Concern,
California Species of Concern, or otherwise sensitive species or habitat that may occur within or in
the immediate vicinity of Newport Beach. These species are protected under state and federal
regulations. The databases indicate that there are three listed plant species that occur or have the
potential to occur within the City of Newport Beach: San Fernando Valley spineflower, salt marsh
bird’s beak, and Crownbeard.
Eleven listed wildlife species occur or have the potential to occur within the City of Newport Beach:
San Diego fairy shrimp, Tidewater goby, California black rail, light-footed clapper rail, western snowy
plover, California least tern, southwestern willow flycatcher, coastal California gnatcatcher, least Bell’s
vireo, Belding’s savannah sparrow, and pacific pocket mouse.
In addition, other sensitive species include 27 sensitive wildlife species and 24 sensitive plant species
that occur or potentially occur within the Newport Beach area.

are considered wetland habitat by the state of California and federal wetland definitions are protected
by a no-net loss wetlands policy.
Sensitive Marine Species
Several species of marine mammals are present in the waters near the shore along the Newport
coastline. All marine mammals are protected by the Marine
Mammal Protection Act
Protected marine mammals that are most likely to appear in the City are: California sea lion, Harbor
seal, California gray whale, Killer whale, Common dolphin, Pacific white sided dolphin, and Dall’s
porpoise.
                                                         Eelgrass (Zostera marina), a flowering, marine
                                                         vascular plant, is considered a sensitive marine

Environmental Study Areas
Undeveloped areas supporting natural habitats that may be capable of supporting sensitive biological
resources within the City are also referred to as Environmental Study Areas (ESAs) by the Local
Coastal Plan. An ESA may support species and habitats that are sensitive and rare within the region or
may function as a migration corridor for wildlife. The portions of the ESAs within the Coastal Zone

Natural Resources Element
that contain sensitive or rare species are referred to as Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas
(ESHAs), as defined by the California Coastal Act. ESHAs are areas in which “plant or animal life or
their habitats are either rare or are especially valuable because of their special nature or role in an
ecosystem that could easily be disturbed or degraded by human activities and developments.” The
California Coastal Act requires that ESHAs be protected against any significant disruption of habitat
values. Only uses dependent on those resources are allowed within ESHAs and adjacent development
must be sited and designed to prevent impacts that would significantly degrade the ESHA and must
be compatible with the continuance of the ESHA.
There are 28 identified ESAs within the City of Newport Beach, as shown in Figure NR2:

of the ESAs also contain endangered species of plants and animals. Most of these ESAs are protected
as parks, conservation areas, nature preserves, and other open space areas. However, each of these
ESAs is subjected to various threats from the surrounding urban environment that include degraded
water quality, traffic, noise, public access, development encroachment, erosion and sedimentation,
dredging or filling, stormwater runoff, invasive species, and feral animals.
Newport Harbor
Newport Harbor is home to valuable habitat such as eelgrass and mudflats that support a wide range
of species, and also provides the public with recreational boating opportunities. There is a need to
protect the biological habitat, and continue to serve the needs of the recreational boating community
by ensuring compatibility between these uses of Newport Harbor. The City believes the best way to
meet this objective is to develop a comprehensive plan for the management of the Harbor, with the
support and cooperation of the County of Orange, US National Fish and Wildlife Service, National
Marine Fisheries Service, US Army Corps of Engineers, California Coastal Commission, Regional
Water Quality Control Board, recreational boating community, environmental community, and public.

Upper Newport Bay
The City Council has consistently supported the concept of developing, in cooperation with CDFG
and the County of Orange, a facility on Shellmaker Island that would serve as a center for water
quality and ecosystem education as well as water quality testing and research. The proposed facility,
Back Bay Science Center (BBSC), includes a County-operated water quality lab, facilities for CDFG
personnel involved in the management of the Upper Newport Bay State Marine Park (formerly
Ecological Reserve), space and exhibits for estuarine, ecosystem and water quality education and
research programs, a wetland demonstration marsh and ecological interpretive stations. The City has
taken the lead role in the planning, design and construction of the Back Bay Science Center using Oil
Spill Settlement Proceeds designated for that purpose. The City, CDFG, County, and UCI have
entered into a cooperative agreement that identifies the maintenance and operational responsibilities
of the parties involved.
The Upper Newport Bay State Marine Park (formerly Ecological Reserve), one of few remaining
estuaries in Southern California, is home to nearly 200 species of birds, including several endangered
species, as well as numerous species of mammals, fish, and plants. It is an important stopover for
migrating birds on the Pacific Flyway and up to 30,000 birds can be seen here on any day during the
winter months. The Upper Newport Bay State Marine Park (formerly Ecological Reserve) is
contiguous to 140 acres of County owned uplands on the north and northwest that was, in 2000,
designated as the Upper Newport Bay Nature Preserve, which includes an educational facility known
as the Muth Center. The State Marine Park and Nature Preserve are shown in Figure NR1.
The Upper Newport Bay State Marine Park (formerly Ecological Reserve) is an extremely valuable
natural resource that must be carefully managed to (a) protect and enhance the habitat of the
endangered species; (b) protect and enhance the various ecologies within and adjacent to the State
Marine Park; (c) ensure that the public’s access to and use of the State Marine Park does not adversely
impact the flora or fauna; (d) maximize the public’s understanding and awareness of the resource and
recreational value of the State Marine Park; and (e) promote direct community involvement in
resource protection and enhancement.
Natural Communities Conservation Plan (NCCP)
In July of 1996, the City became a signatory agency in the Orange County Central-Coastal NCCP
Subregional Plan. The plan covers nearly 38,000 acres in coastal southern California and is a
collaboration of federal and state resource agencies, local governments, special districts, and private
property owners. The NCCP uses a multi-species habitat conservation approach rather than a species
specific approach resulting in the preservation of some of the most valuable native habitats while
freeing other properties for development. As a signatory agency, the City is responsible for enforcing
mitigation measures and other policies identified in the NCCP/Habitat Conservation Plan
Implementation Agreement for properties located within the City Limit that are part of the NCCP
Subregional Plan.
OPEN SPACE RESOURCES
Open space may be defined as areas generally free from development or developed with low intensity
uses. Open space is generally non-urban in character and may have utility for the following: park and
                                                        N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n 10-13

Natural Resources Element
recreation purposes; conservation of land, water, or other natural resources; or for historic or scenic
purposes. Most of the City’s open space resources are located along the coast and in the eastern half
of the City. Newport Beach’s open space resources consist of undeveloped areas such as the
Environmental Study Areas as described above, the Newport Bay, and Newport Harbor. Other
resources include the City’s many undeveloped canyons and hillsides located primarily in the Newport
Coast area. The beaches, parks, and the Crystal Cove State Park also represent some other open space
resources. Some of these resources are not preserved as parks or dedicated open spaces; however,
local, state, and federal regulations help protect, preserve, and restore lands containing hillsides,
sensitive biological resources, coastal beaches, and sensitive coastal bluffs.
Upper Newport Bay is an important open space resource for the City
Circulation and Improvement and Open Space
Agreement (CIOSA)
Some of the City’s open space areas consist of dedicated lands through CIOSA. This agreement is
between the City of Newport Beach and The Irvine Company, and has allowed building entitlements
for The Irvine Company in exchange for payments of required proposed projects, an interest free
loan, and land for open space and potential senior housing sites for the City. The amount of open
space land dedication was substantially more than what would have been required under the City’s
Park Dedication Ordinance.
Six sites have been dedicated under CIOSA in Newport Beach, and include: Back Bay View Park,
Newport Center Park (formerly Newport Village), Freeway Reservation, Upper Castaways, Harbor
Cove, and Newporter Knoll Grant Deeds. Another site, located at Jamboree Road and MacArthur
Boulevard will also be dedicated as open space upon issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the
final CIOSA project.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND PALEONTOLOGICAL
RESOURCES
Fossils in the central Santa Ana Mountains represent the oldest formations in Orange County at 145
to 175 million years old. Changes in geological land formations over time, brought upon by tectonic
activity, have resulted in a mix of aquatic and terrestrial fossils underlying the City. The Miocene-age
rock units (26 million years ago [mya] to 7 mya), particularly in the Newport Coast area, are
considered to be of high-order paleontological significance (6 to 9 on a scale of 1 to 10).
Other deposits found in the Newport Beach area include a variety of marine mammals, sea birds,
mollusks, and a variety of vertebrate animals typically associated with the Ice Age (2.5 mya to 15,000
years ago). Local paleontological sites, particularly near the Castaways, have yielded fossils of Ice Age
horses, elephants, bison, antelopes, and dire wolves. Also, a number of localities in the portions of the
Vaqueros formation that underlie the Newport Coast area have yielded a variety of invertebrate and
vertebrate fossils, and are also considered to be of high-order paleontological significance. Other areas
with significant fossils and known paleontological deposits include the Banning Ranch area, which
contains at least fourteen documented sites of high significance, and Fossil Canyon, in the North
Bluffs area, which is considered a unique paleontological locality.
Newport Beach also contains many significant archaeological sites. The Upper Newport Bay area has
yielded some evidence for the earliest human occupation of Orange County and date to about 9,500
years before present. Over fifty sites have been documented in the Newport Beach area, including the
Newport Coast area and Banning Ranch, many yielding substantial information regarding the
prehistory of the City and County, and have included human burials. At least two and possibly three
distinct cultural groups inhabited the area, including the Tongva and Acjachemem tribes, although the
boundaries of their tribal territories are unclear.
MINERAL RESOURCES
Historically, drilling for oil in this part of Orange County began as early as 1904, and oil production
became the primary mineral extraction activity in and around the City. Two separate production and
reserve areas exist within the City’s Sphere of Influence: Newport Oil Field, which lies under the
Pacific Ocean but has land-based tanks and extraction pumps just outside the municipal boundary in
west Newport and West Newport Oil Field, which is located in the Banning Ranch area. The
Newport Oil Field is estimated to have oil reserves of approximately 35 million barrels (Mbbl) and
produces approximately 39.2 thousand cubic feet of gas per year. The West Newport oil field
produces approximately 16.8 thousand cubic feet of gas per year with a daily production per oil well
of approximately 4 bbl/d and a yearly production of approximately 107 thousand bbl/d.
The concentration of active wells lies within the West Newport and Newport production areas. As of
2002, there were approximately 65 wells (plus four injection wells) producing oil and natural gas in the
Newport production area, 3 methane gas collection/recovery systems designed to reduce noxious
odor on the Hoag Hospital Campus and Pacific Coast Highway in the Newport production area, and
65 oil wells in the West Newport area (out of 862 total wells). Of the 65 wells in the West Newport
area, 15 are directionally drilled (not counting the one injection well) to extract oil from the offshore
Newport oil field and are operated by the City, 48 are operated by West Newport Oil Company (29 of
                                                         N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n 10-15

which are not currently used for production but have not been abandoned (classified as “shut in”)),
and 2 by South Coast Oil.
Thirty-three abandoned oil wells are located in numerous sites throughout the City, concentrated
along the northwest boundary. Additionally, other than oil and gas resources, there is no active mining
within the Newport Beach area. Mineral Resource Zones (MRZ) within the City are either classified as
containing no significant mineral deposits (MRZ-1), or the significance of mineral deposits has not
been determined (MRZ-3).
Section 1401 of the City’s Charter does not allow new drilling, or production or refining of oil, gas, or
other hydrocarbon substances within the City. However, the Section does not prohibit these activities
within any area annexed to the City after the effective date of the Charter if these activities were
already in operation. The City’s Charter and Municipal Codes do allow for slant drilling activities for
oil, gas, tar, and other hydrocarbon substances within a designated area of Newport Beach.
VISUAL RESOURCES
Visual resources are an important component of the quality of life of any geographic area. The City of
Newport Beach is located in a unique and
dynamic physical setting and enjoys views of the
rolling green hills of Crystal Cove State Park to
the east, and spectacular ocean views to the
southwest, including those of the open waters of
the ocean and bay, sandy beaches, rocky shores,
wetlands, canyons, and coastal bluffs. From
higher elevations within the City, views to the
north include the rolling hills of the San Joaquin
Corridor, and in the distance, the Santa Ana
Mountains.
The West Bay Environmental Study Area
contributes to the visual resources of Newport The West Bay Environmental Study Area contributes to the visual resources
Beach. Specifically, the City’s habitat areas and of Newport Beach
open spaces are among the contributing visual
resources, including the Semeniuk Slough, North Star Beach, West Bay, Upper Newport Bay State
Marine Park (formerly Ecological Reserve) and DeAnza/Bayside Marsh Peninsula, and San Diego
Creek. Coastal views are also provided from a number of streets and highways and, due to the grid
street pattern in West Newport, Balboa Peninsula, Balboa Island, and Corona del Mar, many north-
south tending streets provide view corridors to the ocean and bay.
Coastal canyons and gullies in the eastern portion of the City known as the Newport Coast/Ridge
area, typify the topographic landforms that render significant views of the City, including Buck Gully,
Morning Canyon, Los Trancos, Muddy Canyon, and Pelican Hill. The City’s coastal bluffs along the
shoreline, facing the wetlands, and surrounding Upper Newport Bay are also important scenic
resources. Other valuable resources include the City’s more than 441 acres of parkland and passive
open space, including the Crystal Cove State Park, and State Route 1, which is identified as Eligible
for State Scenic Highway designation.

The City has historically been sensitive to the need to protect and provide access to these scenic
resources and has developed a system of public parks, piers, trails, and viewing areas. The City’s
development standards, including bulk and height limits in the area around the bay, have helped
preserve scenic views and regulate the visual and physical mass of structures consistent with the
unique character and visual scale of Newport Beach. Located throughout Newport Beach, the City’s
many small “view parks” are intentionally designed to take advantage of significant views. In addition,
the City provides policies in the Municipal Code and Local Coastal Plan that protect public views,
which is defined as views from public vantage points. As for the City’s coastal and other bluffs, while
many have been preserved as parkland and other open space, most have been subdivided and
developed over the years, including Newport Heights, Cliff Haven, Irvine Terrace, and Corona Del
Mar.
ENERGY CONSERVATION
Natural Gas. Southern California Gas Company (SCG) provides natural gas service for the City.
Natural gas is a “fossil fuel” and is a non-renewable resource. Most of the major natural gas
transmission pipelines within the City are owned and operated by SCG. SCG has the capacity and
resources to deliver gas except in certain situations that are noted in state law. As development occurs,
SCG will continue to extend its service to accommodate development and supply the necessary gas
lines.
Electricity. Electricity is provided on an as-needed basis to customers within existing structures in the
City. Southern California Edison Company (SCE) is the distribution provider for electricity in
Newport Beach. Currently, SCE has no immediate plans for expansion of infrastructure, as most of
the City is built out. However, every year SCE expands and improves existing facilities according to
demand.

         A Safe and Healthy Community That Protects
Introduction
The primary goal of the Safety Element is to reduce the potential risk of death, injuries, property
damage, and economic and social dislocation resulting from natural and human-induced hazards. This
Safety Element recognizes and responds to public health and safety risks that could cause exposure to
the residents of Newport Beach. Implementation of city, county, and state emergency response and
mutual aid plans will enable the community to avert or minimize impacts to the extent practical and
feasible, as well as allow restoration of the City in a timely manner after an event.
This element specifically addresses coastal hazards, geologic hazards, seismic hazards, flood hazards,
wildland and urban fire hazards, hazardous materials, aviation hazards, and disaster planning. As
discussed below, the type and location of hazards have been identified in this element, as well as
policies and programs to minimize impacts.
Context
COASTAL HAZARDS
Newport Beach is susceptible to low-probability but high-risk events such as tsunamis, and two, more
common, isolated hazards such as storm surges and coastal erosion. Each of these has a potential to
  11-2 N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n
                                                                                    Safety Element
significantly impact Newport Beach residents and the built environment. Figure S1 shows potential
tsunami inundation areas, and areas subject to coastal erosion.
Tsunamis and Rogue Waves
Newport Beach is generally protected from most distantly generated tsunamis by the Channel Islands
and Point Arguello, except for those generated in the Aleutian Islands, off the coast of Chile, and
possibly off the coast of Central America. Nevertheless, since the early 1800s, more than thirty
tsunamis have been recorded in Southern California, and at least six of these caused damage in the
area, although not necessarily in Newport Beach. Tsunamis generated in the Alaskan region take
approximately six hours to arrive in the Southern California area, while tsunamis generated off the
Chilean coast take 12 to 15 hours. Given those timeframes, coastal communities in Southern
California can receive adequate warning, allowing them to implement evacuation procedures.
         ELEMENT
         Its Residents and Visitors from Natural
Alternatively, very little warning time, if any, can be expected from locally generated tsunamis. Locally
generated tsunamis caused by offshore faulting or landsliding immediately offshore from Newport
Beach are possible, and these tsunamis have the potential to be worst-case scenarios for the coastal
communities in Orange County. Modeling off the Santa Barbara coast suggests that locally generated
tsunamis can cause waves between 2 and 20 meters (6 to 60 feet) high, and that these could impact
the coastline with almost no warning, within minutes of the causative earthquake or slump. Areas
within Newport Beach that are most likely to be impacted by a tsunami include West Newport,
Balboa Peninsula, Lido Isle, Balboa Island, and Upper Newport Bay.
Rogue waves are very high waves that arise unexpectedly in the open ocean. These waves are difficult
to plan for as they are unpredictable. Rogue waves have historically impacted the Orange County
coast and have the potential to impact Newport Beach in the future.
Storm Surges
Unlike tsunamis, which can occur anytime, storm surges are associated with inclement weather. Given
that during inclement weather a lot less people are expected to be at the beach, storm surges are more
likely to impact residents than tourists, and the potential number of casualties can be expected to be
significantly less. The most common problem associated with storm surges is flooding of low-lying
areas, including structures. This is often compounded by intense rainfall and strong winds. If a storm
surge occurs during high tide, the flooded area can be significant. Coastal flooding in Newport Beach
occurred in the past when major storms, many of these El Niño Southern Oscillation events,
impacted the area. Storm surging associated with a tropical storm has been reported only once in the
history of Newport Beach, in 1939. This suggests that the hazard of cyclone-induced storm surges has
a low probability of occurrence.

Safety Element
Coastal Erosion
Newport Beach has a variety of coastal features ranging from replenished beach sands in West
Newport, to steep bluffs comprised of sandstone and siltstone to the south of Corona del Mar.
Significant coastal bluff retreat, bluff-top erosion, gullying, and beach erosion are occurring along the
eastern Newport shoreline, and the rates of erosion are dependent on the underlying geologic units
and their different responses to the weathering
effects of water (including rain and waves),
gravity, and wind. Coastal erosion occurs as a
result of natural processes such as long-shore
drift, storm surge, and sea level rise. Sea bluff
erosion occurs as a result of processes that
impact both the bottom and top of the cliffs.
Pounding of the waves during high tide and
storm surges causes considerable damage to the
bottom of the bluffs. If the sediments exposed in
this zone are soft and highly erodible, eventual
collapse of the bluff can occur as it is undercut
by wave action. Uncontrolled surface runoff, if
allowed to flow over the top of the bluffs, can
cause extensive erosion in the form of rills and Coastal bluff erosion along the Newport Beach coastline
gullies. During wet years, large canyons can
develop quickly, often as a result of a single storm. Unchecked foot and vehicular traffic and rodent
burrowing can also cause significant damage at the top of the bluffs. Increased irrigation associated
with agricultural and residential watering can lubricate fine-grained layers in the sediments or bedrock
forming the cliffs, leading to failure as a result of landsliding.
The protection of the beaches from coastal erosion, through effective structural devices and sand
replenishment, provides more than just a wider beach; it serves as a buffer zone that provides
protection from tsunami run-up or storm surges, especially in areas where there are no dune deposits
in front of residential or commercial development.
GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
The geologic diversity of Newport Beach is strongly related to tectonic movement along the San
Andreas Fault and its broad zone of subsidiary faults. This, along with sea level fluctuations related to
changes in climate, has resulted in a landscape that is also diverse in geologic hazards. Geologic
hazards are generally defined as surficial earth processes that have the potential to cause loss or harm
to the community or the environment.

Slope failures
Slope failures often occur as elements of interrelated natural hazards in which one event triggers a
secondary event such as a storm-induced mudflow. Slope failure can occur on natural and man-made
slopes. The City’s remaining natural hillsides and coastal bluff areas are generally vulnerable to slope
failures that include: San Joaquin Hills; and bluffs along Upper Newport Bay, Newport Harbor, and
the Pacific Ocean. Despite the abundance of landslides and new development in the San Joaquin
                                                               Hills, damage from slope failures in Newport
                                                               Beach has been small compared to other hillside
                                                               communities. This can probably be attributed to
                                                               the development of strict hillside grading
                                                               ordinances, sound project design that avoid
                                                               severely hazardous areas, soil engineering
                                                               practices, and effective agency review of hillside
                                                               grading projects.
                                                               Compressible Soils
                                                               Compressible soils underlie a significant part of
                                                               the City, typically in the lowland areas and in
                                                               canyon bottoms. These are generally young
Geologic hazards such as slope failures occur in Newport Beach sediments of low density with variable amounts
of organic materials. Under the added weight of fill embankments or buildings, these sediments will
settle, causing distress to improvements. Low-density soils, if sandy in composition and saturated with
water, will also be susceptible of the effects of liquefaction during a moderate to strong earthquake.
Expansive Soils
Some of the geologic units in the Newport Beach area, including both surficial soils and bedrock,
have fine-grained components that are moderate to highly expansive. These materials may be present
at the surface or exposed by grading activities. Man-made fills can also be expansive, depending on
the soils used to construct them.
SEISMIC HAZARDS
The City of Newport Beach is located in the northern part of the Peninsular Ranges Province, an area
that is exposed to risk from multiple earthquake fault zones. The highest risks originate from the
Newport-Inglewood fault zone, the Whittier fault zone, the San Joaquin Hills fault zone, and the
Elysian Park fault zone, each with the potential to cause moderate to large earthquakes that would
cause ground shaking in Newport Beach and nearby communities. Earthquake-triggered geologic
effects also include surface fault rupture, landslides, liquefaction, subsidence, and seiches. Earthquakes
can also lead to urban fires, dam failures, and toxic chemical releases, all man-related hazards.
Figure S2 shows areas within Newport Beach that are subject to liquefaction and landslides.
                                                                 Newport Beach General Plan               11-7

Safety Element
Liquefaction
Strong ground shaking can result in liquefaction. Liquefaction, a geologic process that causes ground
failure, typically occurs in loose, saturated sediments primarily of sandy composition. Areas of
Newport susceptible to liquefaction and related ground failure (i.e. seismically induced settlement)
include areas along the coastline that includes Balboa Peninsula, in and around the Newport Bay and
Upper Newport Bay, in the lower reaches of major streams in Newport Beach, and in the floodplain
of the Santa Ana River. It is likely that residential or commercial development will never occur in
many of the other liquefiable areas, such as Upper Newport Bay, the Newport Coast beaches, and the
bottoms of stream channels. However, other structures (such as bridges, roadways, major utility lines,
and park improvements) that occupy these areas are vulnerable to damage from liquefaction if
mitigation measures have not been included in their design.
Seismically Induced Slope Failure
Strong ground motions can also worsen existing unstable slope conditions, particularly if coupled with
saturated ground conditions. Seismically induced landslides can overrun structures, people or
property, sever utility lines, and block roads, thereby hindering rescue operations after an earthquake.
Much of the area in eastern Newport Beach has been identified as vulnerable to seismically induced
slope failure. Approximately 90 percent of the land from Los Trancos Canyon to State Park boundary
is mapped as susceptible to landsliding by the California Geologic Survey. Additionally, the
sedimentary bedrock that crops out in the San Joaquin Hills is locally highly weathered. In steep areas,
strong ground shaking can cause slides or rockfalls in this material. Rupture along the Newport-
Inglewood Fault Zone and other faults in Southern California could reactivate existing landslides and
cause new slope failures throughout the San Joaquin Hills. Slope failures can also be expected to
occur along stream banks and coastal bluffs, such as Big Canyon, around San Joaquin Reservoir,
Newport and Upper Newport Bays, and Corona del Mar.
FLOOD HAZARDS
Flooding can be a destructive natural hazard, and is a recurring event. Flood hazards in Newport
Beach can be classified into two general categories: flash flooding from small, natural channels; and
more moderate and sustained flooding from the Santa Ana River and San Diego Creek.
The 100- and 500-year flood zones have been identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, and include the low-lying areas in West Newport at the base of the bluffs, the coastal areas
which surround Newport Bay and all low-lying areas adjacent to Upper Newport Bay. 100- and 500-
year flooding is also anticipated to occur along the lower reaches of Coyote Canyon, in the lower
reaches of San Diego Creek and the Santa Ana Delhi Channel, and in a portion of Buck Gully. Most
flooding along these second- and third-order streams is not expected to impact significant
development. However, flooding in the coastal areas of the City will impact residential and
commercial zones along West Newport, the Balboa Peninsula and Balboa Island and the seaward side
of Pacific Coast Highway. Figure S3 shows the 100- and 500-year flood zones.

In addition, seismically induced inundation, which refers to flooding that results when water retention
structures fail due to an earthquake, can also occur in the City. Portions of Newport Beach are
threatened by flooding from Prado Dam, Santiago Creek Reservoir, Villa Park Reservoir, San Joaquin
Reservoir, Big Canyon Reservoir, and Harbor View Reservoir. Seismically induced inundation can also
occur if strong ground shaking causes structural damage to aboveground water tanks. Currently, there
are no above-ground water tanks in the City.
Various flood control measures have helped mitigate flood damage in the City, including reservoirs in
the San Joaquin Hills and Santa Ana Mountain foothills, and channel alterations for the Santa Ana
River. These structures help regulate flow in the Santa Ana River, San Diego Creek, and smaller
streams and hold back some of the flow during intense rainfall period that could otherwise
overwhelm the storm drain system in Newport Beach.
FIRE HAZARDS
Wildland Fires
The City of Newport Beach defines a wildland fire hazard area as any geographic area that contains
the type and condition of vegetation, topography, weather, and structure density that potentially
increases the possibility of wildland fires. The eastern portion of the City and portions of the Newport
Beach region and surrounding areas to the north, east, and southeast include grass- and brush-covered
hillsides with significant topographic relief that facilitate the rapid spread of fire, especially if fanned
by coastal breezes or Santa Ana winds. Fire susceptibility in Newport Beach is shown in Figure S4.
                                                        In those areas identified as susceptible to
                                                        wildland fire, the Fire Department enforces
                                                        locally developed regulations which reduce the
                                                        amount and continuity of fuel (vegetation)
                                                        available, firewood storage, debris clearing,
                                                        proximity of vegetation to structures and other
                                                        measures aimed at “Hazard Reduction.”
                                                        New construction and development are further
                                                        protected by local amendments to the Uniform
                                                        Building Code. These amendments, which are
                                                        designed to increase the fire resistance of a
Fire in the Back Bay in 2000                            building, include: protection of exposed eaves,
noncombustible construction of exterior walls, protection of openings, and the requirement for Class
“A” fireproof roofing throughout the City. Additionally, a “Fuel Modification” plan aimed at reducing
fire encroachment into structures from adjacent vegetation must be developed and maintained.
Urban Fires
Many factors contribute to an area being at risk of structural fires in terms of the local fire
departments capabilities to control them, including the construction size and type, built-in protection,
density of construction, street widths, and occupancy size. The City’s daytime population levels may
also add to the congestion and difficulty of ingress and egress of emergency response vehicles.
                                                           N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n 11-11

Safety Element
Many of the structures in the older portions of the City, some dating back to the 1930s, are
susceptible to urban fires. These areas were built to older building standards and fire codes, made
from non-fire-resistive construction materials, and built with no internal sprinklers and other fire
safety systems in place. These areas include Balboa Peninsula, Balboa Island, and Corona del Mar.
Newport Beach has over 30 high-rise buildings that were constructed since the 1960s, four of which
are not sprinklered: 3121 West Coast Highway, 601 Lido Park Drive, 400 Newport Center Drive, and
611 Lido Park Drive.
Geography is also a factor to fire safety in the City. Upper and Lower Newport Bay essentially divide
the City into two regions, with approximately one-third of the Fire Department assets located west of
the bay, and the remaining assets east of the bay. Connection between these two sides is provided by
only a limited number of roadways (Pacific Coast Highway in the south, Bristol Street and the 73
Freeway on the north), making it difficult for fire stations on both sides of the bay to support each
other during multiple alarm emergencies. Failure of the bridge connectors on any of these roadways as
a result of an earthquake, for example, would hinder emergency response from fire stations in east
Newport Beach and Newport Coast into the densely populated areas of the City west and south of
the bay.
Earthquake-induced fires have the potential to be the worst-case fire-suppression scenarios for a
community because an earthquake can cause multiple ignitions distributed over a broad geographic
area. There are some older sections in Newport Beach where due to ground failure, breaks in the gas
mains and the water distribution system could lead to a significant fire-after-earthquake situation.
The City of Newport Beach has adopted the 2001 California Fire Code with City amendments and
some exceptions. These provisions include construction standards in new structures and remodels,
road widths and configurations designed to accommodate the passage of fire trucks and engines, and
requirements for minimum fire flow rates for water mains.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
The state of California defines hazardous materials as substances that are toxic, ignitable or
flammable, reactive, and/or corrosive. The state also defines hazardous materials as substances that
show high acute or chronic toxicity, is carcinogenic (causes cancer), has bioaccumulative properties
(accumulates in the body’s tissues), is persistent in the environment, or is water reactive. The primary
concern associated with a hazardous materials release is the short and/or long-term effect to the
public from exposure to the hazardous material. The best way to reduce the liability for a hazardous
material release is through regulation governing the storage, use, manufacturing and handling of
hazardous materials. These regulations are typically issued by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), but various local agencies are tasked with the responsibility of monitoring
those facilities that use, store, transport, and dispose hazardous materials for compliance with the
federal guidelines, or if applicable, with more stringent state guidelines. Following is a summary of
hazardous material found in Newport Beach.

Toxic Release Inventory
According to the EPA records, there is one facility in the Newport Beach area that is listed in the
most recently available Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). TRI sites are known to release toxic chemicals
into the air. The EPA closely monitors the emissions from these facilities to ensure that their annual
limits are not exceeded. The South Coast Air Quality Management District also issues permits to
facilities that emit chemicals, both toxic and nontoxic, into the atmosphere. These facilities include
restaurants, hotels, dry-cleaners, and other small businesses.
Hazardous Waste
According to the most recent EPA and City data available, there are two large quantity generators and
approximately 115 small quantity generators in the Newport Beach area. The number of small
quantity generators is expected to increase with increasing development in the City, since this list
includes businesses like gasoline stations, dry cleaners, and photo-processing shops.
Leaking Underground Storage Tanks
According to data from the State Water Resources Control Board, 76 underground storage tank leaks
have been reported in the Newport Beach area. Of these, 47 sites have been either cleaned up or
deemed to be of no environmental consequence, leaving 29 cases that are still open and in various
stages of the remediation process. None of the leaks that have been reported in the City have
impacted a drinking source of ground water. The Orange County Environmental Health Department
provides oversight and conducts inspections of all underground tank removals and installation of new
tanks.
Oil Fields
There is one oil field in the City of Newport Beach and one in its Sphere of Influence. Hazardous
materials are often associated with these facilities, usually as a result of poor practices in the early days
of exploration, when oil cuttings, brine water, and other by-products were dumped onto the ground.
The development of oil fields for residential or commercial purposes typically involves a detailed
study to identify any areas impacted by oil or other hazardous materials, and the remediation of the
property prior to development.
Methane Gas Mitigation Districts
Natural seepages of gas occur in the western and southwestern portions of the City. Methane gas
associated with an abandoned landfill has also been reported near the City’s northwestern corner. The
City has implemented a series of mitigation measures to reduce the hazard associated with methane
gas.
Hazards Overlay
Given the mixed-use character of Newport Beach, where residential and commercial uses reside
relatively close to one another or often co-exist, facilities that generate, use, or store hazardous
                                                          N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n 11-17

Safety Element
materials are often located near residential areas or near critical facilities, with the potential to impact
these areas if hazardous materials are released into the environment at concentrations of concern.
AVIATION HAZARDS
John Wayne Airport (JWA) generates nearly all aviation traffic above the City of Newport Beach. On
an average business day, 300 commercial and commuter flights (150 departures and 150 arrivals)
arrive at and depart from JWA. Newport Beach borders the southeastern portion of JWA. More than
95 percent of all airplanes take off and ascend over the City. Accidents with one or more fatalities
involving commercial aircraft are rare events. However, in the event of an aviation hazard, pilots are
instructed to follow Newport Bay away from residential or developed area. Any potential impact will
be significantly reduced by coordinated response operations of all available emergency services. The
airport is protected by an on-site airport fire service as required by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) regulations. This service is provided by Orange County Fire Station No. 33. In
addition, the Orange County Fire Services Area Plan Annex contains a Marine (Air/Sea) Disaster
Response Plan that establishes protocols for marine disasters in the harbor or ocean from either
aircraft or boating accidents. This plan, which includes a county-wide mutual aid response to a
disaster, would be implemented by the Newport Beach Fire Department.
Three areas found to be of increased vulnerability to aviation hazards in the City are Balboa Peninsula,
Balboa Island, and Upper Newport Bay. As previously discussed under Urban Fires, Balboa Island is
susceptible to fire hazards due to the fact that structures were built prior to implementation of
stringent fire codes. Additionally, access and egress is limited to a small bridge. In the event of a fire
caused by an aviation accident, it could spread quickly.
An aviation accident in Upper Newport Bay could create a significant ecological and economic hazard
to the environment. The recreational value of the City of Newport Beach with its more than 9,000
registered boats could be dramatically affected, and an aviation accident could significantly pollute the
waterways.
DISASTER PLANNING
Any potential hazard in the City resulting from a manmade or natural disaster may result in the need
for evacuation of few or thousands of citizens of Newport Beach. Homeland Security has brought
disaster awareness to the forefront of the minds of the community, safety officials, and City staff. The
City of Newport Beach is currently using the Standardized Emergency Management System for
emergency response in the City, where depending on the type of incident, several different agencies
and disciplines may be called upon to assist with emergency response. Agencies and disciplines that
can be expected to be part of an emergency response team include medical, health, fire and rescue,
police, public works, and coroner. Additionally, policies and plans from the Orange County
Operational Area Mutual Aid Plan, the state’s Mutual Aid Plan, and the state’s Fire and Rescue Mutual
Aid System would be implemented.
Within the Newport Beach Fire Department (NBFD), the Disaster Preparedness Coordinator has
updated the City’s Emergency Management Plan, including the development and implementation of
disaster training for employees. The Emergency Management Plan describes the different levels of
emergencies, the local emergency management organization, and the specific responsibilities of each

participating agency, government office, and City staff. A Citywide drill, which involves
implementation of the Plan, is conducted annually.
Currently, NBFD provides basic life support (BLS), advanced life support (ALS) and emergency
transportation utilizing the fire engines and ladder trucks housed in the Department’s eight fire
stations along with the paramedics housed in three of those stations. While the NBFD has the
immediate capability of providing ALS service at three simultaneous incidents, there is an occasional
need for additional ALS units. Additional ALS service is provided by nearby and adjoining public
agencies by means of cooperative automatic aid agreements. Emergency transportation beyond the
capability of the department is provided by private ambulance companies.
Mass casualty incidents, those incidents usually involving three or more critical patients require the
implementation of the Orange County Fire Services Operational Plan Annex “Multi-Casualty Incident
Response Plan.” This Plan is an organizational plan that aids in assigning treatment teams and quickly
moving patients off scene to appropriate receiving centers in an expeditious and organized manner.
The multi-casualty plan is intended to be implemented during any multi casualty incident, such as
multiple vehicle accidents, aviation accidents, hazardous materials incidents, high-rise fires, and so
forth. Although the system has been designed to be used with as few as three patients, it can be
expanded to an infinite number as it becomes necessary.
Lastly, in the event of a disaster, the City’s Emergency Operations Center can be opened. The center
has undergone a series of considerable upgrades and improvements. Training for the residents within
the City continues through the Community Emergency Response Team program. The continued
development of the community’s disaster preparedness efforts will aid the residents of Newport
Beach in an areawide disaster by fostering a citywide culture of “preparedness.
LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN
The most current Local Hazards Mitigation Plan (LHMP) is, and as updated from time to time will
continue to be, incorporated in the Safety Element. The Safety Element and the LHMP are
complementary documents that work together to achieve the ultimate goal to reduce the impacts on
the community from a disaster.

CHAPTER 12 Noise Elemen
Noise Element
                                                                        NOISE
                            Protecting Newport Beach Residents
Introduction
The Noise Element of a General Plan is a tool for including noise control in the planning process in
order to maintain compatible land use with environmental noise levels. This Noise Element identifies
noise sensitive land uses and noise sources, and defines areas of noise impact for the purpose of
developing policies to insure that Newport Beach residents will be protected from excessive noise
intrusion.
The Noise Element follows the revised state guidelines in Section 46050.1 of the Health and Safety
Code. The element quantifies the community noise environment in terms of noise exposure contours
for both near and long-term levels of growth and traffic activity. The information contained in this
document provides the framework to achieve compatible land uses and provide baseline levels and
noise source identification for local noise ordinance enforcement.
Background
Sound is created when objects vibrate and produce pressure variations that move rapidly outward into
the surrounding air. The main characteristics of these air pressure waves are amplitude, which we
experience as a sound’s “loudness” and frequency, which we experience as a sound’s “pitch.” The
standard unit of sound amplitude is the decibel (dB), which is a measure of the physical magnitude of
the pressure variations relative to the human threshold of perception. The human ear’s sensitivity to
sound amplitude is frequency-dependent and thus a modification is usually made to the decibel to
  12-2 N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n

                                                                                    Noise Element
account for this; A-weighted decibels (dBAs) incorporate human sensitivity to a sound’s frequency as
well as its amplitude.
Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound, aspects of which can negatively affect the physiological
or psychological well-being of individuals or communities. A typical noise environment consists of a
base of steady ambient noise that is the sum of many distant and indistinguishable noise sources.
Superimposed on this background noise is the sound from individual local sources. These can vary
from an occasional aircraft or train passing by to virtually continuous noise from, for example, traffic
on a major highway. Noise in excessive levels can affect our living environment and quality of life.
Several quantitative indicators are commonly used to gauge the likelihood that environmental noise
would have an adverse effect on a community. These indicators consider that the most disruptive
aspects of noise are strongly associated with the average acoustical energy content of the sound over
ELEMENT
from Excessive Noise Intrusion
the time it occurs and/or with the time of day when the sound occurs. The indicators used in the
Noise Element are as follows:
   ■ Leq, the equivalent energy noise level, is the average acoustic energy content of noise for a stated
       period of time. Thus, the Leq of a time-varying noise and that of a steady noise are the same if
       they deliver the same acoustic energy to the ear during exposure. For evaluating community
       impacts, this indicator is not affected by whether the noise occurs during the day or the night.
   ■ CNEL, the Community Noise Equivalent Level, is a 24-hour average Leq with a 10 dBA
       “weight” added to noise during the hours of 10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M., and a 5 dBA “weight”
       added during the hours of 7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M. to account for increased noise sensitivity in
       the evening and nighttime.
Noise environments and consequences of human activities are usually well represented by median
noise levels during the day, night, or over a 24-hour period. Environmental noise levels are generally
considered low when the CNEL is below 55 dBA, moderate in the 55 to 70 dBA range, and high
above 70 dBA. Examples of low daytime levels are isolated natural settings that can provide noise
levels as low as 20 dBA, and quiet suburban residential streets that can provide noise levels around 40
dBA. Noise levels above 45 dBA at night can disrupt sleep. Examples of moderate level noise
environments are urban residential or semi-commercial areas (typically 55 to 60 dBA) and commercial
locations (typically 60 dBA). People may consider louder environments adverse, but most will accept
the higher levels associated with more noisy urban residential or residential-commercial areas (60 to
75 dBA) or dense urban or industrial areas (65 to 80 dBA). Additional examples of sound levels and
loudness in indoor and outdoor environments are shown in Table N1.

Context
TRANSPORTATION NOISE SOURCES
The most common sources of noise in urban areas are transportation-related. These include
automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, boats, and aircraft. Motor vehicle noise is of concern because it is
characterized by a high number of individual events which often create a sustained noise level and its
proximity to areas sensitive to noise exposure. Residential land uses and other sensitive receptors
should be protected from excessive noise from these sources.

Freeway/Highway
Newport Beach has the Corona Del Mar Freeway (State Route 73) and San Joaquin Hills
Transportation Corridor (SJHTC) within its borders. State Route 73 runs in a northwest/southeast
direction through the City’s northern section. The portion of State Route 73 that cuts through the
northern portion of the City is below grade from the adjacent land uses. There are a few residences in
close proximity to this freeway.
The SJHTC runs in a northwest/southeast direction through the City’s northeastern boundary
connecting with the State Route 73 at Jamboree Road. SJHTC is considered a highway from Jamboree
Road south to Bonita Canyon, and then it becomes a toll road. At various locations, the highway will
be at grade with or elevated above the adjacent land uses. There are existing residences that are in
close proximity to this highway; however, these residences have already included noise mitigation
measures to sufficiently attenuate the noise from SJHTC.
Major and Minor Arterial Roadways
Traffic noise on surface streets is a significant source of noise within the community. The major
sources of traffic noise in Newport Beach are Coast Highway, Jamboree Road, and MacArthur
Boulevard. Many of the residential uses located along these roadways include some level of noise
attenuation, provided by either a sound barrier or grade separation. Other residential uses, primarily
                                                        older units, built near these arterial roadways do
                                                        not have any attenuation from noise other than
                                                        the distance between the roadway and the
                                                        residential structure. The noise attenuation
                                                        features for new residences are reviewed on a
                                                        project-by-project basis. This means that as
                                                        residential projects are proposed near the major
                                                        roadways within Newport Beach, future noise
                                                        levels are evaluated and noise mitigation
                                                        strategies are developed as necessary to meet City
                                                        standards.
                                                        Noise levels along roadways are determined by a
Traffic is a source of noise within Newport Beach       number of traffic characteristics. Most important
is the average daily traffic (ADT). Additional factors include the percentage of trucks, vehicle speed,
the time distribution of this traffic and gradient of the roadway.
Water Vehicles
Newport Beach has the largest small boat harbor in Southern California. Thousands of boats operate
near noise-sensitive residential uses that border much of Newport Bay, and noise associated with
these boats can be a problem to these residences. Of particular concern are the charter boats which
generate engine noise and noise from the occupants, as well as use loudspeakers or live entertainment.

Noise Element
Aircraft Operations
Many residents of Newport Beach are impacted by noise generated by commercial and general
aviation aircraft departing John Wayne Airport (JWA). Owned and operated by Orange County, JWA
serves both general aviation and scheduled commercial passenger airline and cargo operations. JWA
experienced a total of 349,936 aircraft operations (arrivals and departures) in 2005 and of those,
246,920 were general aviation operations, 87,130 were air carrier operations, 15,729, were air taxi
(commuter) operations and 157 were military operations. Newport Beach is located immediately south
of JWA and is under the primary departure corridor. Although aircraft noise can be heard throughout
Newport Beach, the highest noise levels are experienced just south of JWA, in the Airport Area, Santa
Ana Heights Area, Westcliff, Dover Shores, the Bluffs, and Balboa Island, and are generated by
aircraft departures.
Newport Beach has, since the mid-1970s, actively engaged in efforts to minimize the impact of the
airport on our residents and their quality of life. The City’s initial efforts focused on involvement in
route authority proceedings conducted by the Civil Aviation Board and litigation challenging County
decisions that could increase the level or frequency of noise events. In 1985, the City, County, Stop
Polluting Our Newport (SPON), and the Airport Working Group (AWG) entered into an agreement
(1985 JWA Settlement Agreement) to resolve Federal Court litigation initiated by the County. The
1985 JWA Settlement Agreement required the County to reduce the size of the terminal, cap the
number of parking spaces, limit the number of “average daily departures,” and limit the number of
passengers served each year at JWA (expressed in terms of “million annual passengers” or “MAP”) to
8.4 MAP after construction of the new terminal.
After two years of discussion among the parties to the Settlement Agreement, the City Council and
County Board of Supervisors approved Settlement Agreement amendments that eliminated noisier
aircraft, increased the maximum number of noise regulated and air cargo average daily departures,
increased the service level limit from 8.4 to 10.3 MAP until January 1, 2011, and then 10.8 MAP
afterwards, and increased the maximum number of passenger loading bridges from 14 to 20. The
2002 Amendments also eliminated the floor area restrictions on the terminal and the “cap” on public
parking spaces.
City Council approval of the 2002 Amendments was contingent on receipt of a letter from the FAA
confirming that the 2002 Amendments were consistent with the Airport Noise and Capacity Act (ANCA)
and other relevant laws, regulations and grant assurances made by the County. In December 2002, the
FAA sent a letter confirming compliance and in January 2003, a judge approved the stipulation of the
parties reflected by the 2002 Amendments. The FAA letter confirming the validity of the 2002
Amendments is a precedent for future amendments that increase air transportation service without
impacting airport safety or the quality of life of residents in Newport Beach and other affected
communities.
Other aircraft operations related to helicopter operations at Hoag Hospital are also a concern.
Helicopter flights are noisy, and there are residential uses located in close proximity to the hospital.
The helipad is located on the roof of the emergency area of the hospital. Finally, Newport Beach is
exposed to noise from airplanes towing banners along the beach.

NONTRANSPORTATION NOISE SOURCES (STATIONARY
NOISE SOURCES)
There are many stationary noise sources within the boundaries of Newport Beach. Some of these
stationary noise sources include restaurant/bar/entertainment establishments, mixed-use structures,
mechanical equipment, and use of recreational facilities. The impacts of nontransportation noise
sources are most effectively controlled through the enforcement and application of City stationary
noise ordinances or regulations.
Restaurant/Bar/Entertainment Establishments
Numerous restaurants, bars, and entertainment establishments in Mariners’ Mile, Corona del Mar, the
Peninsula, and Balboa Island have been subject to noise complaints in the past. Noise complaints
have been made due to the close proximity of these establishments to residential uses, the potentially
high noise levels that these establishments are able to produce, and the late hours of operation.
Mixed Use Developments (Commercial/Residential)
In a mixed use building, a portion of it may be used as commercial (i.e. office space, restaurant,
market, dry cleaner, etc.) and the remaining portion may be used for residential purposes. Such mixed
uses can range from a small retail structure with a residence unit on the second floor (as seen on parts
of Balboa Island and the Balboa Peninsula) to larger commercial properties that include a residential
component. Requiring that the commercial portion conform to the more strict residential noise
standards would make operating the commercial facility difficult. However, applying the commercial
noise standards to the entire project would make the noise exposure levels at the residential portion of
the building potentially too high. Mixed use projects represent a unique noise environment and it is
important that a program be developed that allows mixed use to operate with a minimum amount of
conflict.
Mechanical Equipment Noise
Various Heating Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) installations and occasional pool and spa
pumps can be noise intrusions. Noise intrusions from HVAC equipment has been a problem in the
past, especially in areas such as Balboa Island, Lido Island, and the Peninsula where the homes are
very close together, and in commercial areas as well when abutting residential areas. However, the
City’s Municipal Code now requires a permit before installation of new HVAC equipment. Permits
are only granted when a sound rating of the proposed equipment does not exceed standards, or is
installed with a timing device that will deactivate the equipment during the hours of 10:00 P.M. to
7:00 A.M. if the standards are exceeded.
Just because HVAC equipment sound ratings are reviewed during plan check, as well as tested in the
field after installation, it can still be problematic over time. As equipment ages and sometimes suffers
from lack of maintenance, noise from the equipment can increase. Because of this, the City still deals
with HVAC equipment noise on a complaint basis, in order insure ongoing compliance with the
standards of the Code.

Noise Element
Recreational Activities
Another source of stationary noise in Newport Beach is recreational activities such as league and
youth sporting games, as well as recreational rowers in Newport Harbor. These activities are
sometimes scheduled during early morning hours on the weekends and can be a source of noise
intrusion on nearby residences. Types of noise generated include people shouting and whistles/horns
blowing. Some sporting events also utilize loudspeakers.
Noise Disturbance
Residential party noise, boat party noise, barking dogs, and landscape maintenance tools are disturbing
to residents, but are difficult to attenuate, and difficult to control. Complaints about noise
disturbances are typically dealt with through code enforcement.
    ■ Residential Party Noise—Residential party noise, particularly on Balboa Peninsula and in the
       West Newport area has been an ongoing problem. There are many difficulties in trying to
       control party noise. If a noise limit is established for enforcement using a quantitative measure,
       the code enforcer would be required to make noise measurements of the intrusive noise. Often,
       the disturbing levels of noise that were generated by a party are reduced once a code enforcer
       arrives on the premises to make measurements. Therefore, party noise level measurements may
       be an impractical means of party noise enforcement since it is often not possible to accurately
       capture the loud noise levels being generated by the party. Historically, police officers use their
       judgment for identifying and controlling party noise problems. Additionally, a recently adopted
       ordinance addressing police services has been effective in curbing party-related noise.
    ■ Boat Party Noise—Charter boats, generally larger in size and carrying large numbers of paid
       passengers, have also been a source of noise. These boats can control on-deck noise by means
       of eliminating outside loudspeakers. The City recently amended its Municipal Code to provide
       greater regulations of charter boat operations.
    ■ Barking Dogs—Dog barks can be characterized as being impulsive and startling or continuous
       and sustained. In either event, it can be a major source of noise disturbance. When dogs are
       outdoors, it is very difficult to attenuate the noise.
    ■ Landscape Maintenance Tools—Tools used to maintain landscaping in Newport Beach can
       also be a source of noise. The most commonly-used tools, which are very difficult to attenuate
       the noise from, include edgers, blowers, and lawn mowers.
NOISE-SENSITIVE RECEPTORS
Newport Beach has a number of public and private educational facilities, hospitals, convalescent
homes, day cares, and other facilities that are considered noise sensitive. However, the primary noise-
sensitive use within the City is residential use. The noise exposure of these sensitive uses varies from
low, in quiet residential areas, to high, in areas adjacent to the freeway.
COMMUNITY NOISE CONTOURS
Noise contours for all of the major noise sources in Newport Beach, which include motor vehicles on
roadways and freeways, and aircraft at JWA, were developed for existing conditions and future
conditions. Existing noise contours were determined from the 2003 traffic levels and existing aircraft
  12-8 N e w p o r t B e a c h G e n e r a l P l a n

                                                                                    Noise Element
levels for these sources, and are expressed in terms of the CNEL. Existing noise contours are shown
in Figure N1 through Figure N3.
Future noise conditions for roadways are presented for the 20 year time period ending 2025 and were
derived from projected traffic levels for that horizon year. These noise contours are based on
complete buildout of the General Plan, and are shown in Figure N4 through Figure N6. These future
noise contours will assist in setting policies for establishing new land uses and appropriate mitigation
for properties that will continue to be exposed to higher noise levels.
The aircraft noise contours that are used for planning purposes by the County of Orange and Airport
Land Use Commission are found in the Airport Environs Land Use Plan (AELUP) and are derived
from the 1985 Master Plan for JWA and the accompanying EIR 508. These noise contours are based
on fleet mix and flight level assumptions developed in EIR 508, and are shown in Figure N5.
Noise contours represent lines of equal noise exposure, just as the contour lines on a topographic
map are lines of equal elevation. The contours shown on the maps are the 60, 65, and 70 dB CNEL
noise levels. The noise contours represent the maximum possible traffic noise levels at locations
within them (i.e., they do not account for building placement or traffic speeds, nor the attenuating
effects of walls, structures, and terrain features that might intervene between the roads and any
location of interest) and should be used as a guide for land use planning. The 60 dB CNEL contour
defines the Noise Referral Zone. This is the noise level for which noise considerations should be
included when making land use policy decisions that effect existing and proposed noise-sensitive
developments. The 65 dB CNEL contour describes the area for which new noise sensitive
developments will be permitted only if appropriate mitigation measures are included such that the
standards contained in this Element are achieved.
The JWA AELUP (last amended in 2002) only allows residential uses and other noise-sensitive uses
within a 65 dBA contour if the interior noise standard of 45 dBA CNEL can be maintained with an
accompanying dedication of a navigation easement for noise to the airport proprietor applicable to
single-family residences. The AELUP also strongly recommends that if any residential uses are
allowed within a 60 dBA CNEL contour that sufficient sound attenuating methods are used to
maintain a 45 dBA CNEL interior noise level.
TYPICAL NOISE ATTENUATION METHODS
Noise impacts can typically be abated using four basic methods: (1) reducing the sound level of the
noise generator, (2) interrupting the noise path between the source and receiver, (3) increasing the
distance between the source and receiver, and (4) insulating the receiver with building materials and
construction methods more resistant to noise intrusion.
Quieting certain noise sources may often be successfully achieved through design or the use of
mufflers. However, a local government has limited direct control of transportation noise at the source.
This control lies with the state and federal agencies that have this responsibility. The most effective
method available to the City to mitigate transportation noise and reduce the impact of the noise onto
the community is through comprehensive planning that includes noise as planning criteria, the
inclusion of noise mitigation in project planning and design, and improved building noise reduction
characteristics.
                                                          Newport Beach General Plan              12-9
Noise Element
Noise may also be minimized by strategically placing a noise barrier (wall, berm, or combination
wall/berm), the most common way of alleviating traffic noise impacts. Generally, effective noise
shielding requires a continuous, solid barrier with a mass which is large enough to block the line of
sight between source and receiver. Variations may be appropriate in individual cases based on
distance, nature, and orientation of buildings behind the barrier, and a number of other factors.
Garage or other structures may be used to shield dwelling units and outdoor living areas from non-
aircraft noise.
The effects of noise may also be minimized by separating or isolating the noise source from the
potential receiver. Wide buffers along freeways, for example, may reduce the noise level affecting
adjacent noise sensitive land uses. These buffer areas may be developed with less sensitive uses.
Building interior noise levels can also be reduced by protecting the receiver with acoustical structures,
enclosures, or construction techniques. Windows and doors are the most important paths for sound
to enter a structure. Use of sound insulating doors and double paned windows can provide substantial
reductions of interior noise levels. Because these features have little effect in reducing noise when they
are left open, installation of air conditioning for adequate ventilation may be required.
Noise exposure criteria should be incorporated into land use planning to reduce future noise and land
use incompatibilities. This is achieved by specifying acceptable noise exposure ranges for various land
uses throughout the City. These criteria are designed to integrate noise considerations into land use
planning to prevent noise/land use conflicts. Table N2 presents criteria used to assess the
compatibility of proposed land uses with the noise environment.
The noise/land use compatibility matrix presented in Table N2 presents broad ranges of compatibility
and are intended to be flexible enough to apply to a wide range of projects and environments. For
example, a project in a large undeveloped area may be evaluated differently than an infill project in a
densely developed area of the City. But in no case would it be desirable for any land use to have noise
exceeding the highest “normally compatible” noise level shown in the matrix. This matrix is intended
to be used as one of the many factors used in the land use planning process. It should be noted that
California requires that interior noise levels in multi-family residential uses not exceed 45 LDN (day-
night noise level); it is commonly used as an interior standard for all residential uses, but is not
required under the California Administrative Code, Title 24, and Part 2.
In addition to the noise/land use compatibility guidelines contained in the General Plan Noise
Element, the City of Newport Beach has adopted Community Noise Control policies and standards
as part of its Municipal Code in order to limit unnecessary, excessive and annoying noise in the City.
These noise standards are displayed in Table N3.
The most effective method to control community noise impacts from non-transportation noise
sources is through application of Municipal Code standards. The noise levels established by the
Municipal Code assure that noise from mechanical equipment, and other types of non-transportation
noise are not excessive in residential and other noise-sensitive areas.

Zone A: Clearly Compatible—Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal conventional
construction without any special noise insulation requirements.
Zone B: Normally Compatible**—New construction or development should be undertaken only after detailed analysis of the noise reduction
requirements and are made and needed noise insulation features in the design are determined. Conventional construction, with closed windows and
fresh air supply systems or air conditioning, will normally suffice.
Zone C: Normally Incompatible—New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new construction or development does proceed,
a detailed analysis of noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features included in the design.
Zone D: Clearly Incompatible—New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.

 a If the ambient noise level exceeds the resulting standard, the ambient shall be the standard.
 b It shall be unlawful for any person at any location within the incorporated area of the City to create any noise or to allow the creation of any noise on
 property owned, leased, occupied or otherwise controlled by such a person which causes the noise level when measured on any other property, to
 exceed either of the following:
   • The noise standard for the applicable zone for any fifteen-minute period;
   • A maximum instantaneous noise level equal to the value of the noise standard plus twenty dBA for any period of time (measured using A-
       weighted slow response).
   • In the event the ambient noise level exceeds the noise standard, the noise standard applicable to said category shall be increased to reflect the
       maximum ambient noise level.
   • The noise standard for the residential portions of the residential property falling within one hundred feet of a commercial property, if the intruding
       noise originates from that commercial property.
   • If the measurement location is on a boundary between two different noise zones, the lower noise level standard applicable to the noise zone shall
       apply.

                                                                           Noise Element
 Policies
N 1.1     Noise Compatibility of New Development
          Require that all proposed projects are compatible with the noise environment
          through use of Table N2, and enforce the interior and exterior noise standards
          shown in Table N3. (Imp 2.1)
N 1.2     Noise Exposure Verification for New Development
          Applicants for proposed projects that require environmental review and are,
          located in areas projected to be exposed to a CNEL of 60 dBA and higher, as
          shown on Figure N4, Figure N5, and Figure N6 may conduct a field survey,
          noise measurements or other modeling in a manner acceptable to the City to
          provide evidence that the depicted noise contours do not adequately account for
          local noise exposure circumstances due to such factors as, topography, variation
          in traffic speeds, and other applicable conditions. These findings shall be used to
          determine the level of exterior or interior, noise attenuation needed to attain an
          acceptable noise exposure level and the feasibility of such mitigation when other
          planning considerations are taken into account. (Imp 2.1)
N 1.3     Remodeling and Additions of Structures
          Require that all remodeling and additions of structures comply with the noise
          standards shown in Table N3. (Imp 7.1)
N 1.4     New Developments in Urban Areas
          Require that applicants of residential portions of mixed-use projects and high
          density residential developments in urban areas (such as the Airport Area and
          Newport Center) demonstrate that the design of the structure will adequately
          isolate noise between adjacent uses and units (common floor/ceilings) in
          accordance with the California Building Code. (Imp 7.1)
N 1.5     Infill Projects
          Allow a higher exterior noise level standard for infill projects in existing
          residential areas adjacent to major arterials if it can be shown that there are no
          feasible mechanisms to meet the exterior noise levels. The interior standard of
          45 dBA CNEL shall be enforced for any new residential project. (Imp 2.1, 7.1)
N 1.6     Mixed-Use Developments
          Encourage new mixed-use developments to site loading areas, parking lots,
          driveways, trash enclosures, mechanical equipment, and other noise sources
          away from the residential portion of the development. (Imp 7.1, 8.1)

Noise Element
      N 1.7           Commercial/Entertainment Uses
                      Limit hours and/or require attenuation of commercial/entertainment operations
                      adjacent to residential and other noise sensitive uses in order to minimize
                      excessive noise to these receptors. (Imp 2.1, 8.1, 8.2)
      N 1.8           Significant Noise Impacts
                      Require the employment of noise mitigation measures for existing sensitive uses
                      when a significant noise impact is identified. A significant noise impact occurs
                      when there is an increase in the ambient CNEL produced by new development
                      impacting existing sensitive uses. The CNEL increase is shown in the table
                      below. (Imp 2.1, 7.1)

Minimized motor vehicle traffic and boat noise impacts on sensitive noise receptors
        Policies
      N 2.1           New Development
                      Require that proposed noise-sensitive uses in areas of 60 dBA and greater, as
                      determined the analyses stipulated by Policy N1.1, demonstrate that they meet
                      interior and exterior noise levels. (Imp 2.1)
      N 2.2           Design of Sensitive Land Uses
                      Require the use of walls, berms, interior noise insulation, double paned
                      windows, or other noise mitigation measures, as appropriate, in the design of
                      new residential or other new noise sensitive land uses that are adjacent to major
                      roads. Application of the Noise Standards in Table N3 shall govern this
                      requirement. (Imp 7.1)

        N 2.3       Limiting Hours of Truck Deliveries
                    Limit the hours of truck deliveries to commercial uses abutting residential uses
                    and other noise sensitive land uses to minimize excessive noise unless there is
                    no feasible alternative. Any exemption shall require compliance with nighttime
                    (10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M.) noise standards. (Imp 2.1, 8.1)
        N 2.4       Interagency Coordination to Enforce Standards
                    Encourage the enforcement of State Motor Vehicle noise standards for cars,
                    trucks, and motorcycles through coordination with the California Highway
                    Patrol and Newport Beach Police Department. (Imp 14.16, 14.17)
        N 2.5       Boating Activities
                    Enforce compliance of all boating activities with the noise standards defined in
                    the Municipal Code. (Imp 26.1)
        N 2.6       Barrier Construction Funding
                    Establish a program to secure funding for the construction of noise barriers to
                    protect private outdoor yard areas along arterial roadways where existing homes
                    are exposed to noise levels above the City noise standards and develop a priority
                    program for the construction of such barriers. A potential source of such
                    funding may be a fee for new projects, which generate new traffic within the
                    City, as well as road improvement funds where road improvements are made.
                    The amount of these fees should be proportional to the amount of the new
                    traffic that is caused by the new project. It should be recognized that noise
                    barriers will not always be feasible mitigation to roadway noise. Noise barriers
                    are most feasible for single-family homes where the rear yards are adjacent to
                    the roadway. The feasibility of other situations should be evaluated on a case-by-
                    case basis. (Imp 30.2)
