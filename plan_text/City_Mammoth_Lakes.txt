INTRODUCTION
                                                   The General Plan for Mammoth Lakes
                       This plan establishes standards, guidelines and priorities that define the community now and
                       for the future, a future where Mammoth Lakes is a premier, thriving, sustainable community.
                       The community takes seriously our responsibility as stewards of the environment, protectors of
                       residents’ quality of life, and caretakers of visitors’ quality of experience. The “Community Vision”
                       for Mammoth Lakes embodies important values and principles that recognize the uniqueness of our
                       natural surroundings and our character as a village in the trees.
                                                              COMMUNITY VISION
                       Surrounded by uniquely spectacular scenery and diverse four-season recreational opportunities,
                       the community of Mammoth Lakes is committed to providing the very highest quality of life for our
                       residents and the highest quality of experience for our visitors.
                       To achieve this vision, Mammoth Lakes places a high value on:
                       1.	Sustainability and continuity of our unique relationship with the natural environment.
                       	As stewards, we support visitation and tourism as appropriate means to educate and share
                                 our abundant resources. We are committed to the efficient use of energy and continuing
                                 development of renewable resources.
                       2.	Being a great place to live and work.
                       	Our strong, diverse yet cohesive, small town community supports families and individuals
                                 by providing a stable economy, high quality educational facilities and programs, a broad
                                 range of community services and a participatory Town government.
                       3.	Adequate and appropriate housing that residents and workers can afford.
                       4.	Being a premier, year-round resort community based on diverse outdoor recreation, multi-
                                 day events and an ambiance that attracts visitors.
                       5.	Protecting the surrounding natural environment and supporting our small town atmosphere
                                 by limiting the urbanized area.
                        6.	Exceptional standards for design and development that complement and are appropriate to
                                 the Eastern Sierra Nevada mountain setting and our sense of a “village in the trees” with
                                 small town charm.
                        7.	Offering a variety of transportation options that emphasize connectivity, convenience and
                                 alternatives to use of personal vehicles with a strong pedestrian emphasis.
                                             “Vision without execution is a hallucination” -- Albert Einstein

NEIGHBORHOOD AND DISTRICT CHARACTER
                                    INTENT
                                    To enhance the unique character of Mammoth Lakes, development
                                    of individual sites and districts must be carefully planned.
                                    Mammoth Lakes may be comprised of approximately twelve
                                    districts and four mountain portals which will be further defined
                                    as district plans are created. District boundaries are based on the
                                    1987 General Plan Planning Districts and are defined by existing
                                    development, patterns of vegetation, topographic features,
                                    circulation patterns, and the pattern and relationships of land
                                    uses. Master planning of these specific districts provides a basis
                                    for future land use decisions incorporating the goals, policies and
                                    actions in the Land Use and Community Design Elements as well
                                    as the Neighborhood and District Character Element.

                                    community’s overall mix and composition of land uses, housing,
                                    employment, lodging and amenities should be considered in the
                                    planning of each district. While each district should be unique,
                                    all districts should provide a sense of place regarding structure,
                                    function and a district center.

Public Spaces
The most important places in a community are its public spaces.
In Mammoth Lakes, public spaces complement and are a part
of the town’s natural mountain setting. All public spaces should
be designed as functioning spaces with a high aesthetic value
in order to enhance the image of the town. Public spaces
should also be designed to support special events. A variety of
spaces should be programmed, including large, unstructured
open areas, ceremonial civic center spaces, active commercial
plazas, and most importantly streets, which serve as the town’s
greatest public space.

Landmarks
Landmarks are unique forms that create a memorable and
positive image about the community. Iconic architecture
should be sited at special points within the community such as
significant intersections, terminal viewpoints within town and at
places of high community value and importance.
Landmarks and the architecture of the community should
complement and be respectful of the natural setting. In most
cases, buildings should be at or below the height of the tree
canopy.
At the town’s landmark locations, the built environment should
be designed to reinforce the town’s sense of place. Landmarks
should be designed to create cherished memorable places that
people want to return to and visit again.

Civic Architecture
Civic building design in Mammoth represents rugged
mountain architecture and recognizes successful historic
patterns of the town. Civic buildings should be articulated,
elegant, and designed to create a sense of permanence
and strength. Civic buildings should include a building base
designed for pedestrians with a high level of detail and quality
materials. Landmark features should be integrated into civic
architecture and places.
The future Civic Center should embody the natural setting and
spirit of the town and be attractive, welcoming, accessible and
a symbolic center for the community. Places like the future
Civic Center should be designed as one cohesive element
with commonality in building form and appropriate building
placement and hierarchy. The Civic Center should reinforce
the site and civic function as a gateway to town.

Resort Character
Mammoth Lakes, a small and remote community, requires resort
facilities to be sustainably designed and have a low impact on
the environment. Resort areas and facilities should emphasize
a partnership of resources and allow joint-use for public and
private entities to the long-term benefit of the community.
Resort areas should also diversify the year-round recreational
opportunities for the community’s residents and visitors as
noted in the Parks, Open Space and Recreation Element.
Recreational opportunities include cross-country skiing,
snowshoeing, sleigh rides, horseback riding, fishing, tennis,
hiking, golf and many others.
Development proposals are expected to add value to the overall
community with shared programs serving guests and residents
that are integrated to form a seamless community. Development
will add to the commercial, cultural and recreational activities
and facilities that already exist within the community. Every
development proposal should be particularly well-designed in
context of:
•  setting
•  site planning
•  architectural design
•  building program
•  operations

exists wherever the amount of traffic approaching a point
exceeds the amount, which can traverse the point. Queues
form behind such locations. Operations within the queue
are characterized by stop-and-go waves, and they are
extremely unstable. Vehicles may progress at reasonable
speeds for several hundred feet or more, then be required
to stop in a cyclic fashion. LOS F is used to describe the
operating conditions within the queue, as well as the point
of the breakdown. It should be noted, however, that in
many cases operating conditions of vehicles or pedestrians
discharged from the queue may be quite good. Nevertheless,
it is the point at which arrival flow exceeds discharge flow,
which causes the queue to form, and LOS F is an appropriate
designation for such points.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1        HOUSING ELEMENT PURPOSE AND CONTENT
The Housing Element of the Town of Mammoth Lakes General Plan establishes the Town’s policy
relative to the maintenance and development of safe, decent, and affordable housing to meet the needs
of existing and future residents. It addresses the planning period 2014-2019, and meets the two
purposes identified by State law, including assessment of current and future housing needs and
constraints in meeting those needs; and providing a strategy that establishes housing goals, policies
and programs. The Housing Element addresses the statewide housing goal of “attaining decent
housing and a suitable living environment for every California family.”
The Housing Element has been structured to meet the needs of State Housing Element law, and
includes the following major components:
         An analysis of housing needs, including a community and housing profile (demographics,
          housing characteristics, and affordable housing needs analysis).
         An inventory of resources and constraints that are relevant to meeting the identified housing
          needs, including analysis of governmental and non-governmental constraints, units “at risk”
          of conversion, and an inventory of land zoned for residential uses.
         A statement of the Housing Plan, including goals, policies and a schedule of actions the Town
          is undertaking or intending to take to implement those goals and policies.
1.2        COMMUNITY CONTEXT
The Town of Mammoth Lakes is a resort community with a permanent population of approximately
8,307, located in Mono County in California’s Eastern Sierra region. The Town incorporated in 1984
to become Mono County’s only incorporated community. Mammoth Lakes contains over half
(approximately 57 percent) of the County’s resident population, and is the County’s primary
employment and service center. The Town’s boundaries encompass approximately 24 square miles; of
Town of Mammoth Lakes Housing Element Update                                                                                 1-1

                                                                                                                  HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                           CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
this, all but approximately four square miles, defined by an Urban Growth Boundary, are public lands
administered by the US Forest Service. The local economy is driven by recreation-based tourism, with
visitors drawn to the area’s spectacular natural setting and summer and winter outdoor recreation
opportunities, including Mammoth Mountain Ski Area (MMSA), a major California ski resort and
local employer.
Mammoth Lakes has a total housing stock of around 9,600 units. Based on the 2010 Census, an
estimated 51.7 percent of the entire housing stock is dedicated to seasonal, recreational or occasional
use, reflecting the popularity of the Town as a location for second-home ownership. This trend also
has an impact on housing affordability, since housing prices are driven by relatively affluent second-
home buyers; the rental market is also affected by the higher prices commanded for seasonal and
nightly rentals of homes and condominiums. Meanwhile, many local residents work in the service
sector, creating a considerable gap between housing affordability and housing costs. In addition,
Mammoth Lakes has a large seasonal workforce of winter employees who service the ski area and
associated influx of visitors, and summer construction labor.
This context creates a number of housing issues that must be addressed through the Housing Element
period, including:
         Meeting demands for housing by ensuring adequate sites are available.
         Allowing for a range of housing types at a variety of affordability levels, particularly housing
          for the local workforce and seasonal employees.
         Preserving existing affordable housing units and improving the condition of other units.
         Removing governmental and other constraints to affordable housing.
         Promoting fair and equal housing opportunities.
1.3        CONSISTENCY WITH STATE PLANNING LAW
The State of California has mandated that all cities and counties prepare a housing element, intended
to support the statewide housing goals of “attaining decent housing and a suitable living environment
Town of Mammoth Lakes Housing Element Update                                                                                    1-2

for every California family.” The housing element is one of the seven State-mandated elements of the
General Plan, with specific direction on its content set forth in Government Code Section 65583.
One of the most specific requirements of the Government Code is the clear responsibility it places on
local jurisdictions to accommodate a fair share of the regional housing need, as identified in the
Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA). The State Department of Housing and Community
Development provided the RHNA for Mono County and Mammoth Lakes; the county’s only
incorporated community. The RHNA is for the period January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2019.
1.4       GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
The Town of Mammoth Lakes General Plan, which was updated in 2007, includes eleven elements
that guide conservation, growth, and development within the Town. The elements of the General Plan
encompass the seven elements required by State law, as well as optional elements adopted by the
Town to address issues of local importance and concern. The eleven elements of the Town's General
Plan are:
        Economy
        Arts, Culture, Heritage and Natural History
        Community Design
        Neighborhood and District Character
        Land Use
        Mobility
        Parks, Open Space and Recreation
        Resource Management and Conservation
        Public Health and Safety
        Noise
        Housing

As one of these eleven elements, and as required by State law, the Housing Element’s goals, policies
and programs relate directly to, and are consistent with all other elements of the Town of Mammoth
Lakes General Plan. During the Annual Planning Report process, the Town will review the Housing
Element to ensure consistency with the other General Plan elements. The provision of an adequate
supply of affordable, livable housing within the Town of Mammoth Lakes further supports the
community’s overall economic, social, and environmental goals by maintaining a local population that
patronizes local businesses, promoting family stability and security, and reducing carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions through reduction of long-distance home to work commutes. Appendix A
summarizes policies from other General Plan Elements that are related to housing issues. At this time,
the Housing Element does not propose to modify other elements of the General Plan.
1.5       DATA SOURCES AND AGENCIES CONSULTED
The Town consulted with various agencies during the preparation of this Housing Element, including,
Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. and Inyo Mono Advocates for Community Action. A number of data
sources were used in preparing this Housing Element. Specific sources are referenced throughout the
document.
1.6       PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The Town of Mammoth Lakes encouraged participation from all sectors of the community in the
preparation of the Housing Element Update. Public participation activities included a public workshop
and questionnaire for residents and stakeholder agencies. The questionnaire was available in English
and Spanish and was accessible through the Town’s website. The questionnaire was also available in
public places throughout the Town, including the Police Station, the Latin Market, the Public Library,
and at the offices of Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. and the Town. It was also delivered to stakeholder
groups upon request, and was available at the Public Workshop of the Planning and Economic
Development Commission, held on April 9, 2014.
The questionnaire consisted of 16 questions designed to gain a deeper understanding of resident
housing needs. A total of 145 individuals submitted a completed questionnaire. Participants submitted
109 questionnaires in English and 44 in Spanish. The vast majority of participants live (80%) and

work (84%) in Mammoth Lakes. Approximately a third of the respondents (38%) felt that the cost of
housing limits their ability to live closer to work. The majority of respondents (53%) stated that they
drive or carpool to work, 31 percent walk or bike, and 16 percent take public transit.
Housing issues that questionnaire respondents are facing, in order of response frequency, include
affordability of housing (32%), home or apartment in need of repair (26%), availability of housing
(21%), housing size (16%), and ADA accessibility (5%). Weatherization or energy efficiency
programs (33%) and home and apartment repairs (32%), followed closely by homeownership
programs (27%) are the housing related programs of most interest to respondents. The housing related
services of most interest to the questionnaire participants are amenities (grocery store, etc.) and
affordable child care. A large majority of respondents (74%) don’t think there are ample available and
affordable units for households of all sizes.
Respondents were fairly evenly split on the type of housing that is most lacking, between apartments
(34%), efficiency units (29%), and larger homes (29%). As Mammoth Lakes grows, participants feel
that the housing types that will be most important to provide are affordable housing (34%), apartments
(25%), efficiency units (19%), and larger homes (14%). Two-thirds (67%) of respondents feel that the
cost of utilities impacts the ability to afford quality housing. According to respondents, the priority for
housing programs in Mammoth Lakes should include reducing cost of rent or mortgages (45%),
weatherization or energy efficiency programs (18%), homeownership programs (17%), and reducing
the cost of utilities (12%).
Questionnaire participants also had the opportunity to provide additional comments. The major themes
from additional comments included: rent costs are too high and there should be financial assistance
programs to offset high rent costs, lack of rental and homeownership properties targeted toward
middle class families, and not enough small- or medium-sized single family homes available to rent or
purchase.
A public workshop was held on April 9, 2014 at the Planning and Economic Development
Commission. The workshop addressed the Housing Element Update and its relationship to the overall
General Plan update process, identified special housing populations with acute housing needs,
presented the housing needs analysis, and reviewed the progress made from the prior Housing
Element. During the group discussion portion of the public workshop, housing needs and housing
strategy priorities were discussed. The Planning and Economic Development Commissioners

expressed the need for additional larger homes, affordable housing, efficiency apartments, and a need
to repair and update the existing housing stock. In terms of housing strategy priorities, the
Commissioners said that there needs to be a variety of strategies to meet all of the needs and
conveyed that while there are many residents who want to purchase homes and become invested in the
community, many could not afford to purchase a home in Mammoth Lakes. One public comment was
provided, which stressed the need for providing affordable housing in a variety of locations, but that
there also needs to be a balance of affordable and market rate housing.
1.7       SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS AND HOUSING PROGRAM
This section summarizes the key issues and findings related to the availability and maintenance of
housing adequate to meet the needs of all sectors of the Mammoth Lakes population. The issues listed
below are discussed in greater depth in the various chapters of this Housing Element.
        Housing Affordability
        Housing Production to Meet Regional Need Allocation
        Housing Rehabilitation and Conservation
        Governmental Constraints to Affordable Housing
        Energy Conservation
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
The housing market in Mammoth Lakes is substantially driven by demand for vacation units and
second homes from Southern California buyers, with close to 52 percent of the housing stock as
seasonal or occasional use units. Although the 2008 Recession has resulted in a significant decline in
home prices, housing in Mammoth Lakes is typically significantly more expensive than in
neighboring communities such as Bishop. Utility costs are also high, related to the need to heat homes
in Mammoth's cold winter climate and exacerbated by an increase in the number of older, outdated
and less energy efficient housing stock.

                                                                                                        CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Based on 2007-2011 data, more than half of Mammoth Lakes' households are in the extremely-low,
very-low, and low-income categories, and cannot afford market rate rental or owner-occupied housing
in the town. Many moderate income households (80% to 120% of AMI) also have fewer options of
affordable owner-occupied homes. Fifty-six percent of renters and those owning homes in Mammoth
Lakes experience some degree of cost burden related to housing; these impacts are more severe in
families of five or more. Although the downturn in the housing market has made some units more
affordable, this trend has been accompanied by other effects of the economic recession, such as an
increase in the unemployment rate and associated reduction in income that may counter these positive
effects. Unpredictable weather conditions in Mammoth Lakes can also impact seasonal employment
contributing to fewer hours and fewer jobs which further exacerbate home affordability. Mammoth
and June Mountain are experiencing a third consecutive year of drought. According to Mammoth
Mountain Ski Area (MMSA), a major California ski resort and local employer, skier visits are down
37 percent and revenue is down $17 million due to the current drought. 1 Housing affordability is
expected to be an ongoing issue in the Town of Mammoth Lakes through this Housing Element
Update period.
To address this issue, the Housing Element Update includes a number of policies and programs to
facilitate the production and preservation of affordable housing. In particular, programs include:
         Through updates to the Town's Zoning Code and Housing Ordinance, policies and regulations
          will be enacted to guide the development of housing to serve extremely low-income and
          special needs populations, including seniors, the disabled, homeless, at-risk youth, seasonal
          employees, and female-headed households.
         Updating the Town's workforce housing mitigation requirement for new development to
          ensure it appropriately meets the demand it generates for workforce housing.
         Continuing funding (including dedication of Transient Occupancy Tax monies), partnership,
          and support for the work of Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. who have successfully built,
          rehabilitated, or preserved several dozen income-restricted housing units in the past several
          years, and other housing organizations (e.g., IMACA).

HOUSING PRODUCTION
The Town's adopted Urban Growth Boundary, reflecting the extensive public lands immediately
surrounding its urbanized area, limits Mammoth Lakes' ability to expand geographically. Thus,
dedicating sufficient land within the UGB for residential uses at appropriate densities, and
encouraging efficient use of land resources will remain critical over the housing element period. In
addition, the Town has a number of properties that are planned for affordable and workforce housing;
ensuring that these sites develop appropriately will be important to meeting Mammoth Lakes' fair
share of the regional housing need. Programs to ensure that sufficient sites are available for housing
include:
        Continuing the use of State and Town density bonuses for affordable housing, as well as
         studying ways housing production can be facilitated.
        Ensuring that large new development provides on-site workforce housing in conjunction with
         market rate units, through implementation of the Town's Housing Ordinance.
        Encouraging the renovation and conversion of existing non-workforce units, such as
         condominiums currently used as second homes, to become part of the workforce housing
         supply.
        Reducing governmental constraints to housing production and affordability through the
         periodic review of fees, codes, and ordinances
        Allowing housing development as part of infill and mixed-use development within
         commercial zoning districts.
HOUSING REHABILITATION AND CONSERVATION
Compared to many California communities, Mammoth Lakes’ housing stock is relatively new, with
85 percent of the Town’s housing stock having been built since 1970. However, there are an
increasing number of older units, which will require continued investment, repair and upgrade to
remain in good condition. Housing units may also not be well-maintained due to absentee landlords or
homeowners. As noted below, improving energy efficiency of older housing units is an important
component of reducing housing costs in Mammoth's climate. Some of the community's most

affordable units are older rental apartments, mobile homes, and condominiums, and preserving these
units is an important goal of this Housing Element. Policies and programs that support this goal
include:
         Investigating opportunities to acquire, rehabilitate, and dedicate existing housing units as
          affordable housing.
         Monitoring construction and rehabilitation of housing to meet the needs of the extremely low-
          income (ELI) population.
         Continuing code enforcement efforts, and encouraging local homeowners and
          owners/managers of rental housing properties to upgrade and improve older units, particularly
          those that do not meet current standards and codes.
         Continued application of Municipal Code standards that preserve the existing housing supply
          of non-transient rental housing units.
         Improved quality and enforcement of deed restrictions to avoid conversion of existing deed-
          restriction units to market rate units.
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
The Town's property development standards, fee programs, and other regulations and requirements
regulate new development are intended to ensure it meets standards for public safety and welfare; to
uphold neighborhood and community character; and to ensure that development pays its fair share of
costs to mitigate demands on infrastructure and services. Although some development standards, such
as those for on-site parking, lot coverage, and setbacks may be more stringent than in other
communities, they are appropriate in the Town's local context, particularly the need to deal with large
amounts of winter snowfall.
The analysis of governmental constraints found that the Town's permitting, development review
processes and fees represent actual staff costs and time to process applications, and are not unduly
restrictive to new residential development. Recently, the Town undertook a review of its development
impact fees, including housing mitigation in lieu fees, and, as a result, lowered fees substantially in
2009. One area where improvements are underway is the Zoning Code, which had not been updated

since adoption of the General Plan update in 2007; which may have added potential complexity to the
interpretation of policies and standards. The Zoning Code Update will be effective on May 2, 2014,
prior to the adoption of the Housing Element Update. The Zoning Code Update will help to reduce
regulatory constraints to housing development by ensuring that the Zoning Code is consistent with the
General Plan, reducing ambiguity and making for a more efficient review process. Programs identified
to reduce governmental constraints to housing production include:
        Conducting regular reviews and updates to the Zoning Code to incorporate mandates and
         other appropriate revisions.
        Periodically review and update permit and development fees to ensure that they appropriately
         reflect the cost of processing applications and providing services to new development,
         without unduly increasing costs to build housing.
        Continuing to allow secondary housing units by right in Rural Residential and Residential
         Single Family zones.
ENERGY CONSERVATION
Energy efficiency is a significant contributor to lowering housing costs, particularly in Mammoth
Lakes with its extreme winter climate. The Housing Element identifies programs to support additional
energy conservation including:
        Working with local non-profits that offer low-cost retrofits to improve program participation
         among qualified homeowners.
        Reviewing all projects for energy efficiency in site design and planning, and for conformance
         with State and Town building codes.
        Encouraging residential development that promotes energy-efficient and sustainable building
         practices, including the use of alternate energy sources such as geothermal and solar.
         Encourage energy efficient programs such as Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) and
         others.

2 HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The Housing Needs Assessment serves as the foundation for developing the Town of Mammoth
Lakes’ housing goals, policies, and programs outlined in Chapter 5, Housing Program, of this
Housing Element. This chapter analyzes relevant population and housing aspects to determine the
specific housing needs of Mammoth Lakes’ residents. Important characteristics include:
demographics, household characteristics, special housing need populations, and housing
characteristics. Housing includes single family homes, condominiums, townhomes, apartments, and
other livable unit types. The information provided in this chapter covers the breadth of analysis
suggested by HCD in its Housing Element guidelines; additional information or detail has been
provided in some areas to reflect Mammoth Lakes’ local characteristics and housing needs.
In order to examine population and housing characteristics, this chapter references the most recently
updated official government data and private market data. The U.S. Decennial Census and the
American Community Survey 2007-2011 are the primary sources for the majority of the data
collected. Other data sources were cited where appropriate, such as the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD), California Department of Finance (DOF) for 2013
population household estimates, and the California Employment Development Department (EDD) for
local employment trends. Most of the data in this chapter were compiled by AECOM, the consultant
firm retained by the Town to assist with preparation of the Housing Element.
2.1        REGIONAL POPULATION AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT
The Town of Mammoth Lakes is a resort-oriented community and experiences large seasonal
fluctuations in population. During the peak ski season, the Town estimates that on any given weekend
the influx of visitors to Mammoth Lakes can result in a total "Population at One Time" (PAOT) 2 that
is up to five times the year-round resident population. This fluctuation in population also results in
2
   Although the Town is now implementing Population Impact Evaluation Criteria (PIEC) to precisely evaluate population impacts,
   PAOT is used here since the number of people in town directly impacts the availability of housing units.

significant seasonal variation in employment and housing demand, leading to unique housing
pressures.
In 2007-2011, approximately 4,932 people were employed within the town. Services and visitor-
oriented businesses related to the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area (MMSA) employ the most persons
annually, but this employment demand varies seasonally, with the peak occurring during the winter
ski season. Furthermore, wages in Mammoth Lakes’ primary employment sector, hospitality and
leisure, tend to be fairly low. Despite low local wages, many high income persons own homes (often
seasonal vacation homes) and recreate in Mammoth Lakes. Of the over 9,600 homes in Mammoth,
approximately 52 percent are vacation homes that are not made available for permanent residents to
rent. This results in an inflated housing market that is not tied to local incomes and employment.
2.2       POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
The town’s population characteristics help to inform the nature and extent of its housing needs. Be it
age distribution, population growth, employment, or education, these factors indicate the type and
amount of housing needed as well as residents’ ability to pay. This section describes the most recent
population characteristics available from the California Department of Finance (DOF 2013), U.S.
Census (Census 2000 and 2010), American Community Survey data which uses data from 2007
through 2011 (ACS 2011), and the California Employment Development Department (EDD). Where
possible, the Town has used data provided by the California Department of Housing and Community
(HCD).
POPULATION TRENDS
Mammoth Lakes, a town of roughly 8,307 full-time residents, is the only incorporated area in Mono
County and makes up a significant share (roughly 57 percent) of the County’s population. As
previously discussed, the Town of Mammoth Lakes experiences large fluctuations in its population,
with the peak occurring in the winter ski season. During this time, the population of Mammoth Lakes
on any given weekend is known to quintuple, reaching an estimated peak of around 35,000 to 40,000
people.

As shown in Table 2-1, from 2000 to 2010, the Town of Mammoth Lakes grew more than four times
as fast as Unincorporated Mono County annually. In comparison, between 2010 and 2013 the
population of Mammoth Lakes increased at approximately only one-third the average annual rate of
Unincorporated Mono County, decreasing from 1.61% to .30% annually. California Department of
Finance projected population growth is not available for the Town of Mammoth Lakes. However, the
Department of Finance anticipates Mono County to grow at an average annual growth rate of .54
percent, reaching a total population of approximately 14,913 people by the end of this Housing
Element planning period in 2019 (Table 2-2). If Mammoth Lakes grows by its Regional Housing
Need Allocation (RHNA) of 74 units, or 185 people (at an average household size of 2.5), its average
annual growth rate will be .37 percent during the planning period, slightly less than the growth rate
predicted for Mono County by the California Department of Finance.

AGE
Housing needs are also impacted by the population’s age characteristics since needs and preferences
change as people age. Different age groups also have housing needs dependent on a variety of factors,
including family type and size, income, and housing preference. Understanding these characteristics is
essential in determining Mammoth Lakes’ appropriate housing needs.
Evident by Mammoth Lakes’ median age (Table 2-3), the town has a younger population than the
County overall and a slightly younger population than California as a whole; the median age of
California residents was approximately 35 years of age in 2007-2011.

As shown in Table 2-4, a large proportion of Mammoth Lakes’ and Mono County’s population are
children; approximately 23.5 percent of Mammoth Lakes’ residents and 21.1 percent of Mono County
residents are under the age of 18. Both the Town’s and Mono County’s largest age group is 25 to 34.
However, the Town’s slightly larger percentage of persons aged 25 to 34 is likely influenced by the
presence of the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, which employs younger adults during the ski season.
The town’s active outdoor environment is also attractive to younger adults. Mono County has a larger
proportion (9%) of persons age 65 and older than Mammoth Lakes (6.8%), perhaps attributable to the
fact that the town’s climate, with heavy annual snowfall, is less attractive to seniors than other
communities in the county.

As seen in Table 2-5, the most significant population increases in Mammoth Lakes and Mono County
between 2000 and 2011 occurred in residents aged 55 years and above. In Mammoth Lakes, this age
group comprised 11.5 percent of the town’s population in 2000, but rose significantly, reaching
19.2 percent in 2011. A likely explanation for this increase lies in Mammoth Lakes’ relatively close
proximity to the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, and the increasing number of aging baby-
boomers choosing the town for retirement.
EDUCATION
Educational attainment is often positively correlated with type of employment and level of income
earned and, therefore, the type of housing residents are able to afford. In 2011, 13.7 percent of Mono
County residents and 19.1 percent of Mammoth Lakes’ residents had less than a high school degree, a
slightly higher proportion than that of California as a whole (Table 2-6). At the upper end of the
educational attainment spectrum, over one-third of the population of Mammoth Lakes and just over 30
percent of Mono County has a bachelor’s or graduate degree; this proportion is similar to that of
California (30.3%).

Residents with the uppermost levels of educational attainment are likely to receive the highest wages
in the town. It is important to keep in mind that these percentages address the resident population of
Mammoth Lakes and do not take into account the seasonal workers that were not in Mammoth Lakes,
or did not respond to the U.S. Census or American Community Surveys.
EMPLOYMENT
According to the American Communities Survey, 2007 through 2011 (ACS 2011), there are 4,932
Mammoth Lakes’ residents in the workforce. However, the size of the total workforce (including non-
residents) fluctuates with seasonal demand (seasonal employment is discussed in more detail on page
27). As shown in Table 2-7, arts, recreation, and hospitality service occupations employ the largest
proportion of Mammoth Lakes’ residents at 34 percent, compared to Unincorporated Mono County at
18.2 percent. Office services and management/professional occupations are the second and third
largest employment sectors in Mammoth Lakes. These sectors likely employ a substantial portion of
Mammoth Lakes’ and Mono County’s college graduates.
EMPLOYMENT GROWTH
Unlike the above section which discusses the type of employment held by town residents, this section
discusses the type of employment available within Mammoth Lakes. The California Employment
Development Department (EDD) provides data on labor markets. However, it does not report data for
the Town of Mammoth Lakes separately from the rest of Mono County. Therefore, data for the
County were used as a proxy for the industrial make-up and employment growth trends for the town.
While not all industry groupings are identical to those provided by the U.S. Census for occupations
held by residents, it is still a good indicator of employment growth trends within the area within
certain types of industry.
As seen in Table 2-8, the majority of jobs in Mono County are found in the Leisure and Hospitality
sector, primarily due to the large employment needs generated by the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area
and other jobs that service the town and county’s recreation and tourism-based economy. According to
data from EDD, leisure and hospitality accounts for roughly 45 percent of employment in Mono
County. Other major employment generators in the County are government (24%), retail trade (9%),
professional and business services (6%), and financial activities (5%).

Source: HCD Table 2 (ACS 2011)
Over the last twenty years, the Leisure & Hospitality sector has remained the largest employment
sector with a 1.4 percent average annual growth rate. Though much smaller sectors comparatively,
Transportation, Warehousing and Utilities, Professional & Business Services and Government sectors
have seen the greatest amount of growth at 5.5 percent, 2.5 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. The
average annual growth rate in both the Financial Activities and Retail Trade sectors, while both seeing
job growth between 1992 and 2002, have remained fairly flat over the last twenty years.
With the exception of education and health services, all identified industries listed in Table 2-8 have
either remained stable or have seen positive annual growth rates between 1992 and 2012. Despite its
more modest growth rate, what is significant is that the leisure and hospitality sector added 700 jobs to
the County between 1992 and 2012; that’s the same number of jobs added in, Warehousing, and
Utilities, Professional and Business Services, and Government sectors combined. Government also
added a significant number of jobs (500) during the same period.

Transportation, Warehousing, and Utilities has expanded the fastest, at an average rate of 5.5 percent
per annum, but still makes up less than 2 percent of total employment.
As the economy continues to recover from the 2008 recession, employment levels are expected to
have improved since 2012. Looking at the unemployment rate over the last 10 years, Mono County’s
annual unemployment rate was approximately 5 percent in 2002 but plateaued around 10 percent
between 2010 and 2012. In comparison, while Mammoth Lakes’ annual unemployment rate was also
approximately 5 percent in 2002, it has hovered around 7 percent between 2010 and 2012. While
unemployment numbers are still preliminary for the month of December, the 2013 annual
unemployment rate for the Town of Mammoth Lakes is estimated to have dropped to 5.5 percent.

JOBS AND EMPLOYED RESIDENTS
Mammoth Lakes’ employment dynamics are unique in contrast with most cities in California, as there
is a predominance of leisure and hospitality jobs. There are a large number of seasonal and part-time
jobs in the town that can necessitate residents taking multiple jobs over a year. As a result, a more
balanced recreation community would likely have a higher ratio of jobs per employed residents to
counteract the effect of part-time and seasonal labor. According to the Mammoth Lakes Housing
Needs Assessment released in September of 2011, there are approximately 1.28 jobs per employed
person in Mammoth Lakes, depending on the season. Based on the most recent data available, the
inverse is true for Unincorporated Mono County overall, estimated to have approximately 0.84 jobs
per employed resident. This ratio implies that the County exports a portion of its employed residents
to surrounding communities and neighboring counties.
SEASONAL EMPLOYMENT
The employment opportunities in Mammoth Lakes vary significantly by season with employment
demand peaking during the snow season (Table 2-9).
As shown in Table 2-9 and Chart 2-1, the largest seasonal employment fluctuations occur in the
Leisure and Hospitality Services Industry, dipping to approximately 2,400 jobs in the off-season and
increasing to almost 3,400 jobs at its peak.
Retail trade and professional and business employment also fluctuates slightly (Chart 2-2). Real estate,
rental and leasing activity likely falls within the category of Professional and Business Services and is
tied to visitors and temporary workers arriving at various times of the year, peaking just prior to the
winter ski season. Retail employment follows a similar pattern to leisure and hospitality employment,
but its fluctuations are less severe. Financial activities and manufacturing jobs remain fairly stable.
Overall, employment fluctuated from a high of 6,990 in December to a low of 5,980 in May, 2012
(Table 2-9). Although more than half the population of Mono County resides in Mammoth Lakes, due
to the town’s large resort-oriented industry, seasonal variations are likely more profound, especially in
leisure and hospitality, when separated out from the rest of the County.

The unemployment rate in Mammoth Lakes is inversely related to seasonal employment fluctuations,
as shown in Chart 2-3. According to the California Employment Development Department (EDD), the
average annual unemployment rate for Mammoth Lakes was 7 percent in 2012, with a high of 8.7
percent in May of that year. However, the unemployment rate does not include the number of
underemployed (people who would like to work full-time and / or year-round) or those who have
given up looking for work and are no longer counted as part of the labor force. Therefore, the official
unemployment rate understates the extent of underemployment within the potential labor pool
(individuals age 16 to 64).
2.3       HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Household characteristics, including household type and size, income levels, as well as other
characteristics, determine the type of housing needed and desired by Mammoth Lakes’ residents. For
example, family households, particularly those with children, have less flexibility in their housing
needs and typically require larger units. This section describes prevailing household characteristics in
Mammoth Lakes and how those characteristics impact housing needs.
HOUSEHOLD TYPE
According to data from the American Community Survey (ACS 2011), the Town of Mammoth Lakes
has an estimated 2,807 households. As shown in Table 2-10, Mammoth Lakes has a lower percentage of
family households (59.5%), compared to Unincorporated Mono County (63.6%). In comparison, in
California as a whole, family households make up 68.6 percent of all households. Data from the 2010
U.S. Census also indicates the average household size in Mammoth Lakes is 2.5 and in Unincorporated
Mono County, 2. 3. Mammoth Lakes’ larger share of non-family households and larger household size is
likely a result of the large number of younger recreation employees either living alone or in shared
housing.

HOUSEHOLD INCOME
Income is a critical characteristic in determining residents’ housing opportunities and affordability.
Income affects a household’s decision when it comes to tenure, type, and location of housing.
According to data from the U.S. Census and the American Communities Survey (ACS 2011), Mono
County and California have a higher median household income than the town of Mammoth Lakes
(Table 2-11). Furthermore, adjusting for inflation, median household incomes have declined, a likely
result of recent economic conditions. This indicates that incomes have not kept pace with the cost of
living.
HOUSEHOLD INCOME DISTRIBUTION BY INCOME CATEGORY
The State requires each jurisdiction to address its housing needs by the following income categories:
        Extremely low-income, defined as annual household incomes of 30 percent or less of Area
         Median Income (AMI).
        Very low-income, defined as annual household incomes of 31 to 50 percent or lower of AMI.
        Low-income, defined as annual household incomes 51 to 80 percent of AMI.
        Moderate-income, defined as annual household incomes 81 to 120 percent of AMI.
        Above moderate-income, defined as annual household incomes above 120 percent of AMI.
Certain housing subsidies and housing policies use these categories to set income limits or to qualify
certain segments of the population, adjusting for household size. It is also used to allocate housing
needs to local jurisdictions as part of the housing element update process.
As Mammoth Lakes’ home prices tend to exceed the affordability of above moderate-income
households, this Needs Assessment also evaluates middle and upper income categories, which are
defined specifically for evaluating their ability to afford housing in Mammoth Lakes. For the purposes
of this Housing Element, “middle” income households are those households with incomes between
121 and 150 percent of AMI, and “upper” income households are those households with incomes
greater than 150 percent of AMI.

Table 2-12 displays the household income distribution for the Town of Mammoth Lakes and Mono
County consistent with the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
income categories and the Town-defined categories. Mammoth Lakes has a slightly higher proportion
of households in the lower income categories; 57 percent of Mammoth Lakes households and 49
percent of Unincorporated Mono County households have incomes in either the extremely low, very
low, or low income categories, while 43 percent of Mammoth Lakes residents and 51 percent of
Unincorporated Mono County households have incomes in either the moderate or above moderate
income categories. As will be discussed later in the chapter, lower-income households often have
difficulty finding decent and affordable housing within Mammoth Lakes.

2.4       SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
Special need populations often have unique housing needs beyond affordability. Their specific
condition can require on-site services, specific housing design, or both to meet their day to day
household needs. For example, disabled persons often require accessible ground floor units, and

seniors sometimes need on-site care. Homeless persons often require transitional housing and may
require treatment services before placement in more stable permanent housing.
State Housing Element Law defines “special needs” groups to include the following: senior
households, female-headed households, large households, persons with disabilities (including
developmental disabilities), homeless persons, and agricultural workers. This section describes the
housing needs of each of these groups in Mammoth Lakes. Table 2-13 summarizes the estimated
number of special needs households in Mammoth Lakes.

SENIOR HOUSEHOLDS
Senior households are defined as households with one or more persons over the age of 65 years. The
special needs of senior households are due to three primary concerns: seniors generally live on a fixed
income, have higher health care costs, and are more likely to have some form of disability. According
to the American Community Survey (ACS 2011), 6.8 percent of Mammoth Lake’s residents were

                                                                                                          CHAPTER 2: HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
seniors. Approximately 43 percent of Mono County’s senior residents live within Mammoth Lakes.
Mammoth Lakes contains a lower proportion of seniors compared to the State overall, which had
approximately 11 percent of its population 65 years and older. This is likely due to the harsher
weather conditions in Mammoth Lakes.
The “frail elderly,” defined as persons over age 75, are a particularly important group of seniors to
assess, as older seniors are more likely to face mobility issues and higher medical costs than their
younger counterparts. Mammoth Lakes has a small percentage (2%) of frail elderly, in contrast with
Mono County (2.9%) and the state of California (5.3%).
There are special concerns for senior citizens that need to be considered during project design review.
The most significant concerns include:
        Senior citizens are less mobile than younger age groups; consideration for accessibility should
         be given a high priority.
        Senior citizens generally prefer to be autonomous and maintain independent living lifestyles.
         In order to support this lifestyle choice, seniors need convenient and close access to services,
         including shopping and health care facilities, social service and activity centers, and public
         transportation.
        Senior citizens generally prefer to be a part of a community.
        Senior citizens are concerned about physical and psychological security, more so than
         younger age groups.
        Senior citizens are often on fixed incomes and require stable housing arrangements without
         the risk of significant increases in rent.
According to the American Community Survey (ACS 2011), there are no households in Mammoth
Lakes with a 65 year old or older householder with a household income below the poverty level.
Poverty is defined as an individual or household lacking a socially acceptable amount of money or
material possessions to take care of basic needs. Currently in California, the poverty threshold for a
single-person household is $11,173, and $14,081 for a two-person household without children, where

the householder is 65 years of age or older. 3 However, of the 267 households with a householder 65
years of age or older, approximately 112 (42%) of these are low income (between $25,000 and
$44,999 per year). Severely cost-burdened senior households are most at risk of being displaced from
their housing and often have to make tough decisions on whether to pay for rent and utilities or
essential needs like food and medical care.
FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
Female-headed households need special consideration and assistance to accommodate their housing
needs. Female-headed households are those households with no male adult present and contain
multiple related persons. National statistics indicate that female-headed households are significantly
more likely than the population overall to be in poverty. These households often struggle with
balancing full-time employment while providing quality care for their children. As such, their needs
often include affordable housing and accessible day care.
Based on the American Community Survey (ACS 2011) data, there are 227 female-headed households
in Mammoth Lakes, 8 percent of all households, and of those female-headed households, more than
half (183) were households with children. These families with children are most likely to require on-
site affordable child care, thereby reducing barriers to full-time employment. According to the ACS
2011, there are no female-headed households living in poverty in Mammoth Lakes.
LARGE HOUSEHOLDS
Large households are family households with five or more people. Large households are considered a
special needs group for housing because there is typically a limited supply of adequate and
appropriately sized housing that is also affordable. Large households on a limited budget may be more
at risk of overcrowding in the home. These households may choose a smaller home in an effort to save
money to pay for other necessities including transportation, food, and clothing. According to the
American Community Survey (ACS 2011) data, there are 385 large households in Mammoth Lakes,
approximately 13.7 percent of all households (Table 2-14). This is more than in Unincorporated Mono
County with 9.6 percent of all households considered large.

Again, Mammoth Lakes’ has fewer family households proportionally than Unincorporated Mono
County but also has a larger average household size. Mammoth Lakes’ large number of younger
recreation employees likely contributes to a higher percentage of non-family members living in shared
housing. HUD and the U.S. Census define overcrowding as having more than one person per room,
excluding kitchens, bathrooms, garages, and hallways. Thus, a large five-person household would
require at least a three-bedroom unit if it also had a dining room and a living room. According to the
American Community Survey (ACS 2011), approximately 40 percent of Mammoth Lakes’ total
housing units (both owned and rental) have three or more bedrooms, significantly less than
Unincorporated Mono County’s portion of large units (56%) (Table 2-15). Of this 40 percent, less
than half of these larger units (42% or 330 units) were rental, indicating that some large families that
rent may have difficulty finding an appropriately sized unit. Furthermore, single family homes offered
for rent can be sold, and the new owner may choose to no longer rent the unit. As single family homes
typically have more bedrooms than apartment units and other multi-family housing options, the
number of large rental units has the potential to be reduced even further.

DISABLED PERSONS
Disabled persons may have special housing needs for several reasons, such as living on a fixed
income, lack of housing choices that are both affordable and accessible, and higher health care costs.
There are primarily five different types of disability:
        Sensory and Physical Limitation: Difficulty seeing, difficulty hearing, or difficulty walking
         (even with glasses and hearing aids)
        Mental Disability: Difficulty in learning, remembering, or concentrating
        Going Outside Home Limitation: Difficulty going outside the home alone to shop or visit a
         doctor’s office
        Employment Limitation: Difficulty working at a job or a business
        Self-Care Limitation: Difficulty dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home
According to the 2000 Census (because the ACS has replaced the decennial long-form as a source for
small area statistics, there is no disability data in the 2010 Census), approximately 6.5 percent (433
residents) of the population of Mammoth Lakes and 12 percent (624 residents) of the population of
Unincorporated Mono County (1,057 residents or 8.9% in Mono County overall) classified themselves

There is a broad range of conditions that are considered a disability, and housing needs can vary by
disability type. According to the 2000 Census, 433 persons in Mammoth Lakes had a disability. The
Census classifies the disability as, sensory (blindness, deafness), physical (condition that substantially
limits one or more basic physical activities), or mental (difficulty with learning, remembering or
concentrating).The Census also tracks if the person had a disability that could limit self-care (dressing,
bathing, getting around the home), going outside the home (shop or doctor visits), and employment.
Table 2-17 below shows information derived from the 2000 Census for the Town of Mammoth Lakes
with regard to age group, disability status and type of disability. Note that individuals may have

The Inyo-Mono Association for the Handicapped (IMAH) operates an adult daycare in Bishop and
provides other services for the handicapped including independent living assistance. Additionally, the
Inyo-Mono Advocates for Community Action (IMACA) has a senior housing complex, Valley
Apartments located in Bishop, which also services those with disabilities. As of January 14, 2014,
Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. has one permanently disabled person on its waitlist and has had
conversations with parents who would like to find housing for their disabled children. Otherwise,
neither this agency nor the Mono County Department of Social Services is aware of any other
handicapped persons in Mammoth Lakes currently in need of housing assistance.
The Town of Mammoth Lakes adopted a Reasonable Accommodations ordinance to help facilitate the
construction of special facilities for persons with disabilities. In order to ensure accessibility by all
persons, the Town of Mammoth Lakes requires that all new developments and rehabilitations of
housing units meet the requirements of Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations (Building
Code). The Zoning Code Update, codified in 2014, allows large residential care and assisted living
facilities in the Old Mammoth Road and Mixed Lodging/Residential districts with a ministerial or
administrative permit. The Zoning Code Update also permits small (six or fewer residents) residential
care facilities as it would any similar residential use.

DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code a "developmental disability" is
defined as a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be
expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which
includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term shall also include disabling
conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that
required for individuals with mental retardation, but shall not include other handicapping conditions
that are solely physical in nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where
supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally
disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community based services
to persons with developmental disabilities (cognitive disability, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, etc.)
and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers. The Kern Regional Center (KRC)
is one of those 21 regional centers in the State of California that provides a point of entry to services.
A private, non-profit community agency, the Center contracts with local businesses to offer a wide
range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. KRC serves about
6,300 people in the Kern, Inyo, and Mono Counties. In the zip code serving Mammoth Lakes (93546),
KRC provides services for 20 residents (Table 2-18).
The number of people with developmental disabilities is increasing in California, the population is
getting younger, and the number of people desiring to live in their own home in the community is
increasing. According to the Regional Center Agencies, housing needs for persons with
developmental disabilities include universal design concepts; individual rooms for each tenant in
community care homes; a range of housing types, size, and locations; and the open opportunity for
tenants of a residential facility to obtain services from other, unrelated providers.

HOMELESS
The State of California’s 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan and 2010-2011 Annual Plan states that the
2008 Annual Homeless Report to Congress reported approximately 157,277 homeless individuals
living in California (.43 percent of the population) – meaning one out of every 230 people in
California is homeless. Approximately one-quarter of the homeless are families. In the 2008-2009
school year, nearly 150,000 school-aged children experienced homelessness. The exact number of
homeless individuals in Mammoth Lakes is unknown, but is estimated at 5 to 10 individuals. Due to
the harsh winter conditions, very few, if any, homeless persons stay in Mammoth Lakes year-round,
yet it can be assumed that a small portion of California’s homeless (and potentially the nearby state of
Nevada’s homeless) live in Mammoth Lakes at some point during the year. The Mammoth Lakes
Police Department and Fire Protection District have reported instances of individuals illegally
occupying vacant buildings. However, the majority of those without permanent shelter are transients
who (legally or illegally) camp during the summer but then relocate to a warmer climate during the
winter months. Because camping is popular, even within Mammoth Lakes, it is difficult to determine
who is in need of emergency shelter and who is camping for recreation. However, a Continuum of
Care is just now being formed for Inyo, Mono, and Alpine Counties and in the future will be required
to perform an annual homeless count.

At this time, development of an Emergency Shelter is not a priority and alternate resources can be
accessed in the community if a family or an individual needs help with temporary shelter. Wild Iris, a
community-based non-profit agency, runs an Emergency Shelter for individuals who are leaving an
abusive situation. Inyo Mono Advocates for Community Action (IMACA), located in Bishop, also
provides emergency food and shelter services for Mono and Inyo Counties. IMACA’s hotel/motel
voucher program, created in partnership with the Salvation Army, pays for individuals without shelter
to stay in a local hotel or motel for a few nights. This program is used by between 60 and 100
individuals each year. IMACA was also recently awarded a $100,000 grant for a Homeless Prevention
Program.
FARM LABOR
Farm workers are considered by the State to have special housing needs due to their limited income,
restricted housing choices, seasonal nature of employment, and an increased likelihood of housing
problems such as overcrowding and substandard housing conditions. The Town of Mammoth Lakes
has no farm employment, though farm workers may reside in Mammoth Lakes and work elsewhere in
the region. With that said, farm employment for the mountain region is also negligible. According to
the California Employment Development Department (EDD), Mono County had approximately 40
persons working in the industry in 2012, or less than one percent of the County’s labor force.
SEASONAL WORKERS
Due to the unique fluctuations in employment needs within Mammoth Lakes, seasonal workers are a
special needs population in the town, though not a state-identified special needs group. The California
Employment Development Department (EDD) provides data on labor markets. However, it does not
report data for the Town of Mammoth Lakes separately from the rest of Mono County. Therefore, data
for the County were used as a proxy for employment trends for the Town of Mammoth Lakes. As seen
in Table 2-9, in Mono County employment peaked in December 2012 at approximately 6,990 workers
and dropped to a low of 5,980 employees in May. The difference is approximately 1,000 jobs from
peak employment to low employment months. Assuming 2.0 jobs per household, housing need
fluctuates by approximately 500 housing units, representing approximately 5.2 percent of the total
housing stock. Qualitative information from the Town indicates that many workers live in
overcrowded conditions during the peak employment season due to the high costs and lack of

available housing. Compounding the seasonal housing need is that the peak months of employment
coincide with higher vacation rental occupancy, which means vacation homes are normally not
available for seasonal workers.
According to a survey carried out on behalf of Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc., seasonal employment
fluctuations in Mammoth Lakes have direct implications on housing needs 4. The survey indicated that
an extremely tight rental market, meaning few units are vacant, is offering little choice or availability
for households trying to rent in town, and has resulted in employees residing in inadequate housing
conditions and/or has forced employees to seek housing options located at a significantly far distance
from their place of work in Mammoth Lakes. Employers also report unfilled jobs, high turnover, and
unqualified applicants as frequent problems.
In 2010, the average annual income for the Leisure and Hospitality industry in Mammoth Lakes was
approximately $22,360, which places most of those workers in the very low-income household
income category. Consequently, seasonal employees are often heavily burdened by housing costs and
must either seek more affordable accommodations outside of Mammoth Lakes or are forced to over-
crowd local housing units. According to the Mammoth Lakes Housing Needs Assessment, 2011,
significantly more low income households are cost-burdened by their rent payment than higher
income earners. With an extremely low vacancy rate, persons with lower incomes must compete with
higher income households for available rentals, forcing them into payments they cannot afford or
overcrowded conditions to make their payments. Approximately 82% of renter households with
incomes in the 30% to 60% AMI range are cost burdened.
As of the 2013/2014 ski season, the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area (MMSA) provides approximately
485 beds for its workforce within 175 units 5. Housing options range from hotel-type rooms to
apartments and condominiums, with rental rates (including utilities) that vary from $13 to $21 per
night6. Employees request housing from their hiring manager and rent is deducted from the
employee’s paycheck. All housing is shared accommodations and most units have twin beds. The
majority of units provided are dorm-style, suitable for the typically younger and single seasonal

workforce. All housing units are furnished, have cable TV, and units with kitchens are supplied with
pots, pans, dishes and silverware. Sheets, blankets and pillows are available upon request for a $35
rental fee. MMSA owns between six and eight condominiums that they will rent to older seasonal
workers and couples. While most of the units serve seasonal employees, 16 apartments have been
occupied for two years by year-round families. MMSA reports an occupancy rate typically ranging
between 50 to 80 percent. In the 2010/11 ski season, 425 beds were rented at the peak, for an
occupancy rate of 79 percent7.
2.5       HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
Mammoth Lakes’ housing stock contains a large number of vacation or second-home units that reduce
housing opportunities for the local workforce, who often have incomes significantly lower than
second-home owners. The result is inflated home prices that do not match local employment
opportunities. At the same time, the large share of vacation homeowners is a main economic driver for
the town, injecting external dollars into the community. Given that about half of all rental vacation
units are occupied in the winter months and the typical occupancy of transient units is four persons per
unit, the town’s population increases by approximately 10,000 persons, more than doubling the
population and likely having a greater proportional impact on local retail and recreation spending. 8
Furthermore, the Town estimates the typical winter weekend population to be approximately 35,000 to
40,000 people, almost five times the year-round resident population.
A recreation-oriented community has to balance the demands of visitors with the needs of its
workforce. Ideally, a town’s housing stock should align with the needs of its local and visitor
population, be able to supply both small and large units, and offer housing affordable to its workforce
and special needs populations, while allowing for second home purchasing opportunities. Market and
political realities often result in housing supply outcomes that do not meet the needs of the local
population or the part-time tourist population. This section describes housing stock characteristics in
Mammoth Lakes and Unincorporated Mono County (Mono County excluding the Town of Mammoth
Lakes).

HOUSING TYPE
The Town of Mammoth Lakes has a greater percentage of multifamily housing than Unincorporated
Mono County (Table 2-19), primarily because of the large number of vacation condominiums present
in Mammoth Lakes. The majority (71%) of the housing stock in Mammoth Lakes is comprised of
multifamily housing, whereas Unincorporated Mono County’s proportion of this housing type is less
than 10 percent. Single family units make up 28 percent of the housing stock in Mammoth Lakes and
70 percent of the stock of Unincorporated Mono County.

OCCUPANCY
Due to Mammoth Lakes’ resort-oriented economy, approximately 52 percent of all housing units in
Mammoth Lakes were categorized as being for recreational, temporary or occasional use in 2010
(Table 2-20). Additionally, these units accounted for nearly 78 percent of the town’s vacant housing
units. Accounting for approximately 4,980 units of Mammoth Lakes’ total housing supply, vacation
homes exceed those occupied by full-time residents. Mammoth Lakes also had a larger share of
vacation units compared to the Unincorporated County, accounting for 52 percent of Mammoth
Lakes’ housing supply versus 33 percent for the Unincorporated County overall. As mentioned
earlier, the disproportionate number of second homes for non-residents and vacation rentals has a
large impact on Mammoth Lakes’ home affordability, as vacationers increase the demand for housing
in Mammoth Lakes beyond what would be typical for a non-resort-oriented town of its size and
income levels.

TENURE
As shown in Table 2-21, approximately 47 percent of full-time Mammoth Lakes’ households own
their property while 54 percent rent. The proportion of owner-occupied homes is significantly higher
among Unincorporated Mono County full-time households, representing 68 percent of total occupied
dwellings. The higher proportion of renter households in Mammoth Lakes is likely a reflection of its
seasonal workforce, which may not desire to or cannot afford to purchase a home in the town, and the
high proportion of second homeowner units, whose owners may choose to rent to longer-term tenants.

HOUSING GROWTH
According to data provided by the Department of Finance, there were approximately 2,155 additional
housing units added in Mono County from 2000 to 2010. Approximately 77 percent of these units
(1,666 units) were in Mammoth Lakes. These units consist of a variety of housing types, including
visitor-oriented condominiums, townhomes, and apartments. This is an average of approximately 167
units per year and increasing Mammoth Lakes’ total housing supply by 21 percent. While data is not
available for the proportion of additional homes that were occupied by permanent residents, based on
the population increase between 2000 to 2010 (Table 2-1) and an average household size of 2.5,
approximately 457 new homes (27 percent of all new units) are occupied by full-time residents. This
underlines the trend of second homes constructed from 2000 to 2010; housing constructed was
predominantly in second homes during this time period, with an estimated ratio of nearly three second

second homes for every one primary residence.
In Mono County, 98 percent of all multi-family units built were in Mammoth Lakes increasing the
number of multi-family units by 46 percent. Just two percent of all multi-family units built were in
Unincorporated Mono County. In Unincorporated Mono County, the number of single family homes
increased by 11 percent. In comparison, Mammoth Lakes lost 433 single family and 46 mobile homes,
decreasing the number of these units by 14 percent and 23.8 percent, respectively. This is likely more
an indication of the availability and price of land, as there are few single-family parcels available in
Mammoth Lakes and land prices remain high compared to the County overall. Table 2-22 compares
housing production for the Town of Mammoth Lakes and Unincorporated Mono County.

HOUSING AGE AND CONDITIONS
Housing age is often an indicator of housing conditions in a given community, particularly in
communities with a high percentage of lower-income households and / or older rental housing. As
units age, they require maintenance and modernization. Without proper maintenance, homes will
deteriorate and in certain cases, negatively impact the values of surrounding properties. A general rule
of thumb in the housing industry is that structures older than 30 years begin to show signs of
deterioration and require reinvestment to maintain the initial quality. Homes older than 50 years often
require major renovations to keep the home in good working order unless they have been properly
maintained. Further compounding housing conditions are severe weather conditions, which help to
speed the need for housing rehabilitation.
As shown in Table 2-23, approximately 4.3 percent of the housing stock in Mammoth Lakes was built
before 1960 (and now at least 51 years of age) and over half (61.1%) was built before 1980 (and now
at least 31 years of age). Unincorporated Mono County’s housing stock is similar to Mammoth
Lakes’, with approximately 58.7 percent of its housing stock built before 1980, but with a
significantly higher concentration of units built prior to 1960 (23%).
Those homes constructed prior to 1980 represent the maximum potential housing population in need
of rehabilitation. While considering high land values and equally high home prices likely means many
homes have been renovated and/or are consistently maintained; however, with the severe weather
conditions and low inventory and high demand giving less incentive to update units, as well as the
recent recession, many may only be in average to poor condition.
In 2005 and 2006, the Town undertook a visual survey of property conditions in Mammoth Lakes
focusing on neighborhoods with a higher concentration of older properties, including the Old
Mammoth area, Sierra Valley Sites, Main Street and Shady Rest Tract area. Based on the survey of
exterior conditions, an average of five to seven percent of properties was identified as dilapidated or
deteriorated. If applied community-wide, this would indicate that 500 to 600 homes in Mammoth may
be in need of some degree of rehabilitation. However, since the visual inspection is not all inclusive,

2.6       HOUSING COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
The cost of housing relative to the income of residents in a given area serves as an indicator of the
extent of housing problems in a given community. For example, if housing costs are high relative to
median household income, there tends to be a prevalence of excessive cost burden and overcrowding.
As mentioned earlier, the town struggles to find a balance with accommodating second homeowners
and vacation homeowners while meeting the needs of its workforce. Natural market forces have
placed significant cost burdens on local residents, limiting opportunities to both rent and own in
Mammoth Lakes. This section summarizes the costs and affordability of the housing stock to
Mammoth Lakes’ residents.

HOME SALES TRENDS
Table 2-24 indicates home sales price in Mammoth Lakes for one year (November 2012 to October
2013) and Table 2-25 compares the median home sales price in Mammoth Lakes to Bishop for the last
three months of that same period (August 2013 to October 2013). Median home sales prices were
determined from sales data available on www.zillow.com. This sales data was also consistent with the
data available on the Multiple Listing Service for Mammoth Lakes. During the one year period, the
median price for homes sold within Mammoth Lakes containing 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-bedrooms was
$160,000, $250,000, $412,000 and $555,000, respectively. The median price for all homes sold in

Mammoth Lakes during this one year period was $300,000. To compare the median sales price in
Mammoth Lakes to Bishop, Table 2-25 shows the median sales price in Mammoth was $320,000
during August 2013 to October 2013. The median sales price for a home in Bishop, 42 miles southeast
of Mammoth Lakes, was $300,000. This is $20,000 (or 6.3%) less than in the town of Mammoth
Lakes. With home prices contracting during the 2008 recession in most locations throughout
California, the cost difference is not as significant as in years past. With improved economic
conditions since 2008, recent home sales prices have stabilized and have started to gradually increase
as indicated with an increased median home sales price in Mammoth Lakes of $320,000 between
August 2013 and October 2013 (compared to $300,000 over the entire year). It is likely that prices
will continue to gradually rise steering some employees to live in Bishop which historically has seen
significantly lower median home prices (in 2008, the median home price in Bishop was approximately
38 percent less than the median price for a home in the town of Mammoth Lakes). Many residents also
commute from other nearby communities such as Crowley Lake (approximately 15 miles east of
Mammoth Lakes) and June Lake (21 miles north of Mammoth Lakes), for similar reasons.

FORECLOSURES
Subprime mortgages—granted to borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit histories— have played a
major role in the over inflation of housing prices and have led to an increase in foreclosures in the
United States over the last year when initial “teaser” lending terms 9 began to expire and housing
prices began to decrease, or readjust. While many homebuyers and speculators were able to make
mortgage payments under initial loan terms and banked on the continued appreciation of their homes
to insulate them from future rate increases, many homeowners struggled to make ends meet when
their mortgage payments doubled or tripled and the housing market began to slow. As a result, many
homeowners found themselves unable to pay rising mortgage payments and were forced to begin the
foreclosure process, flooding the market with homes for sale at below market rate prices. Furthermore,
lenders began adjusting their lending practices, making credit less available to those with blemished
credit or little down payment. Rather than being sold or rented to permanent residents, some
financially strained properties, especially second homes, are being rented nightly to visitors, which
puts further strain on the available housing stock for Mammoth Lakes’ residents. Based on current
cases, new leads and projections, a conservative estimate of 150-200 single family homes are illegally
providing nightly rental (units in zones that do not permit nightly rental).
Despite these macroeconomic factors, foreclosure is currently not a major issue in Mammoth Lakes.
As of January 18, 2014, there were 69 homes in zip-code 93546 (Mammoth Lakes) facing one of the
three stages of foreclosure, accounting for over 63.8 percent all properties in Mono County facing
foreclosure (Table 2-26) and 0.7 percent of the total number of homes in Mammoth Lakes.

   Some “teaser” terms included little or no down payment, and/or low interest rates. Often these low interest rates would expire and
   become adjustable rates, resulting in a doubling or tripling of initial mortgage payments.

This is a relatively small number of properties in contrast with the many other communities in
California. This is consistent with the foreclosure activity occurring statewide. According to the
CoreLogic National Foreclosure Report from December 2013, California has foreclosure inventory of
0.7 percent. The foreclosure inventory represents the number of mortgaged homes that have been
placed into the process of foreclosure by the mortgage servicer.10
RENTAL HOUSING COST
Rental housing in Mammoth Lakes is also relatively more expensive than the neighboring City of
Bishop. As shown in Table 2-27 and Table 2-28, a loft/studio averages $775 per month in Mammoth
Lakes while a similar unit in Bishop is $688 per month. Furthermore, rents for average 1, 2 and 3-
bedroom units in Mammoth Lakes are significantly higher than in Bishop, at an additional $409, $554,
and $732 more, respectively.
A large portion of Mammoth Lakes’ rental stock are furnished homes intended for seasonal vacation
renters, significantly increasing the average rents in town for units of all sizes. Mammoth Lakes’ rents
also tend to vary throughout the year; rents tend to be higher in the winter months due to increased
demand from seasonal employees and visitors.

UTILITY COSTS
Utility costs can add a substantial amount to monthly housing costs, particularly in locations with cold
winter climates like Mammoth Lakes. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) provides public housing authorities with utility allowances, the amount of money necessary to
cover a resident’s reasonable utility costs. Table 2-29 presents the utility allowance for Mono County.

According to HUD, monthly electricity costs (assuming electricity as the source for heating, cooking,
air conditioning, and water heating) in Mono County in 2013 varied from $50 for a studio to $230 for
a 5-bedroom unit. Utility costs are likely even higher in Mammoth Lakes than the average utility cost
in Mono County due to the severe weather conditions of Mammoth Lakes. With an aging housing
stock and more extreme climate, these costs are significantly more than those in more temperate
climates in California. For example, HUD’s utility allowance for all electric utilities in Monterey
County varied from $25 per month for a studio to $77 for a 5-bedroom unit, less than half that of
Mono County. The high utility costs in Mammoth Lakes can be an enormous burden to households,
particularly lower income households who may already have difficulty finding affordable housing in
town.

HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
A community’s housing affordability can be measured by evaluating market rate prices for homes
compared to the home price residents are able to afford based on their income level. For purposes of
the Housing Element and the California Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD), a home is affordable if it is suitably sized and costs the household 30 percent or less of its
gross monthly income. In other words, suitable affordable housing should not result in a cost burden,
requiring more than 30 percent of a household’s gross monthly income, nor overcrowding (more than
one person per room). 11 Housing affordability typically varies by income group, with extremely low-
income households having greater challenges in accessing housing versus above moderate-income
households who are able to spend significantly more on housing. This analysis evaluates housing
affordability by HCD income group (extremely low-, very low-, low-, moderate-income), as well the
Town-defined income groups (middle, upper, and above upper-income).
Family median household income levels are estimated annually by HCD, based on HUD updates to its
Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, to provide updated income limits which are then used to
set rents and qualify households for income-restricted housing. From the median household income
estimates, HCD calculates income limits for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. These
income limits form the basis for evaluating housing affordability by income group.
To evaluate the affordability of the housing stock in Mammoth Lakes, housing costs information
collected from November 2012 to October 2013 (described in the previous section) was compared to
household income limits in 2013. Table 2-30 presents the maximum amount that a household can pay
for housing each month (e.g., rent, mortgage and utilities) without exceeding the 30 percent income-
housing cost threshold. 12
11
   Rooms include living rooms, dining rooms, bedrooms, study, and other rooms, but does not include kitchens, hallways, or
   bathrooms.
12
   HCD and HUD defines cost burdened as paying more than 30 percent of a household’s gross monthly income towards housing. The
   30 percent standard is also applied to set affordable rents for income-restricted units.

This amount can be compared to average market prices for single-family homes, condominiums, and
apartments to determine what types of housing opportunities a household can afford. As previously
discussed, from November 2012 to October 2013, the median prices of 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-bedrooms were
$160,000, $250,000, $412,000 and $555,000, respectively, and average rents ranged from $775 for a
loft/studio to $2,115 and up for 3 or 4-bedroom.
In general, extremely low-, very low-, and low-income households cannot afford market rental or
owner-occupied housing in Mammoth Lakes. With home prices contracting during and after the 2008
economic recession, many moderate-income households, as well as middle and upper income
households, can now afford market rates rents and home ownership. In Mammoth Lakes, the median
home price has dropped significantly while incomes have increased over the past few years, making
homes more affordable to a wider range of residents. 13 Table 2-30 summarizes affordable rents and
home prices by income category.
AFFORDABILITY BY HOUSEHOLD INCOME
This section describes housing affordability by income group in more detail. As previously discussed,
the median sales price for a home in Mammoth Lakes was $300,000 between November 2012 and
October 2013, and on average, Mammoth Lakes residents pay between $775 and $2,050 (and up) to
rent. These prices are compared to affordable home prices and rents for each income segment
summarized in Table 2-30. Essential to these assumptions is the ability of very low-, low- and
moderate-income households’ ability to secure home financing, which is still difficult given the recent
recession and current financial climate. Households with poor credit histories or unsteady employment
will struggle to secure home financing, regardless of whether they can afford to make payments on the
home. It is assumed that financial markets will ultimately stabilize and supply reasonable home loans,
akin to lending practices in the late 1990s.
Extremely Low-Income Households. Extremely low-income households in the town of Mammoth
Lakes have incomes of 30 percent or less of the Area Median Income (AMI). Based on calculating the
13
   After adjusting for inflation, household median income increased from $53,216 to $59,972 between 2009 and 2012. (American
   Community Survey 2005-2009 and 2008-2012)

                                                                                                     CHAPTER 2: HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
qualifying home prices with a five percent down payment and six percent interest, the maximum
affordable home price for an extremely low-income household ranges from $63,381 for a one-person
household to $75,495 for a four-person household. With 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-bedroom homes in Mammoth
Lakes selling for median prices of $160,000, $250,000, $412,000 and $555,000, respectively,
extremely low-income households cannot afford homeownership in Mammoth Lakes, regardless of
household size.
In addition, market rents exceed the affordable housing payment for an extremely low-income
household, which can afford to pay $411 to $588 in rent and utilities per month. In practical terms,
this means that a one-person household cannot afford an average priced studio or 1-bedroom without
assuming a cost burden or doubling up. The problem is exacerbated for larger extremely low-income
households.
Very-Low-income households. Very low-income households in the town earn between 31 and 50
percent of the AMI. Assuming loan terms of six percent interest and a five percent down payment, the
maximum qualifying home price for a very low-income household ranges from $111,663 for a one-
person household to $143,967 for a four-person household. Thus, similar to extremely low-income
households, market rate homes in Mammoth Lakes are not attainable for most very low-income
households without a significant down payment.
A very low-income household can afford to pay $686 to $979 in rent and utilities per month,
depending on the household size. With the median rents in Mammoth Lakes ranging from $775 for a
studio/loft to $2,050 (and up) for a 3-bedroom (Table 2-27), the average very low-income household
cannot afford to pay the average rental price for a home beyond two people in a studio. In practical
terms, this means that most very-low-income households cannot afford an average market rate unit
without assuming a cost burden or over-crowding.
Low-income households. Low-income households earn between 51 and 80 percent of the AMI. Based
on a six percent interest rate and a five percent down payment, the maximum qualifying home price
for a low-income household ranges from $183,998 for a 1-person household to $247,203 for a 4-
person household. While smaller households (one to two people) may qualify for a studio or one-
bedroom unit, as with extremely low- and very low-income households, these prices are below
prevailing market prices in Mammoth Lakes for larger homes and households.

A low-income household can afford to pay $1,098 to $1,566 in rent (including utilities) per month,
depending on the household size. With the median rents in Mammoth Lakes ranging from $775 for a
studio/loft to $2,050 (and up) for a 3-bedroom, low-income households cannot afford to pay the
average rental price for unit in Mammoth Lakes beyond a 2-bedroom making it challenging for
households with 4 or more people. However, rental prices for apartments in Mammoth Lakes were
found to range widely, with some 3-bedrooms as low as $1,300 per month, indicating that some larger
low-income households can find affordable rental units in Mammoth Lakes, assuming their monthly
utility costs are not excessive.
Moderate-Income Households. Moderate-income households earn between 81 and 120 percent of the
AMI. Based on a down payment of 10 percent and an interest rate of 6.5 percent, the maximum
qualifying home price for a moderate-income household ranges from $284,955 for a one-person
household to $392,011 for a 4-person household. Thus, large (four or more persons) moderate-income
households cannot afford to purchase a median priced home in Mammoth Lakes without further
increasing their down payment. However, as shown in Table 2-24, home prices in Mammoth Lakes
range widely, with 2-bedrooms homes found at prices as low as $102,500 and 4-bedrooms homes as
low as $255,000, indicating that some larger moderate-income households may be able to find a home
to purchase at the lower end of the price range.
A moderate-income household can afford to pay $1,671 to $2,388 in rent plus utilities per month,
adjusting for household size. With the median rents in Mammoth Lakes ranging from $775 for a
studio/loft to $2,050 (and up) for a 3-bedroom, moderate-income households are able to afford the
average rental price for a home in Mammoth Lakes, as long as their utility costs are not exorbitant.
However, as seen in Table 2-27, prices in Mammoth Lakes can vary widely, with larger homes
ranging between $1,300 and $3,000, likely making it a challenge for some larger households to find
adequate sized housing.
Middle-Income Households. Middle-income households earn between 121 and 150 percent of the
AMI, based on the Town’s definition of this income category. Assuming a down payment of 10 to 20
percent and an interest rate of 6.5 percent, the maximum qualifying home price for a middle-income
household ranges from $358,000 for a one-person household to $559,078 for a 4-person household.
With 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-bedroom homes in Mammoth Lakes selling for median prices of $160,000,
$250,000, $412,000 and $555,000, respectively, many middle-income households may be able afford

to purchase a median priced a 3-bedroom home in Mammoth Lakes without further increasing their
down payment, with prices ranging between $153,000 and $650,000.
A middle-income household can afford to pay $2,089 to $2,985 in rent (including utilities) per month,
adjusting for household size. With the median rents in Mammoth Lakes ranging from $775 for a
studio/loft to $2,050 (and up) for a 3-bedroom, middle-income households are able to afford the
average rental price for a home in Mammoth Lakes, as long as the utility costs for large households
are not exorbitant.
Upper-Income Households. Upper-income households earn between 151 and 200 percent of the AMI,
based on the Town’s definition of this income category. Assuming a down payment of 20 percent and
an interest rate of 6.5 percent, the maximum qualifying home price for an upper-income household
ranges from $540,883 for a one-person household to $755,851 for a 4-person household. With 1-, 2-,
3- and 4-bedroom homes in Mammoth Lakes selling for median prices of $160,000, $250,000,
$412,000 and $555,000, respectively, all upper-income households can afford to purchase a median
priced 3 or 4-bedroom home in Mammoth Lakes without further increasing their down payment. An
upper-income household can afford to pay $2,785 to $3,980 in rent plus utilities per month, adjusting
for household size. With the median rents in Mammoth Lakes ranging from $775 for a studio/loft to
$2,050 (and up) for a 3-bedroom, upper-income households are able to afford the average rental price
for a home in Mammoth Lakes.
Table 2-31 provides a representative summary of the gap between actual median home purchase
prices and median rental costs, based on 2013 data. Because this table shows median values which
represent a range of actual costs, as discussed above it may be possible for households in certain
income categories to afford to purchase or rent homes that are available below the median costs.
Furthermore, as discussed elsewhere in this chapter prices of single family homes and condominiums
have dropped with the significantly since 2008, likely making a larger number of units more
affordable to local households.

OVERCROWDING
A limited supply of affordable housing affects lower-income households as they attempt to double-up
or find smaller units to reduce their housing costs. Overcrowding can result in unhealthy living
conditions, accelerated housing deterioration, and greater pressures placed on infrastructure sized for
smaller households. Overcrowding varies with income, size and type of household, but large families
and lower-income households usually have the highest incidence of overcrowding.
The California Department of Housing and Community Development defines overcrowding as more
than 1.01 occupants per room, and severe overcrowding as more than 1.5 occupants per room. Perhaps
due to the fact that there are fewer rental housing units available for large households, overcrowding
appears to be less of a problem in owner-occupied households in Mammoth Lakes, as 100 percent of
those households had at most one occupant per room. In renter-occupied households, 82 percent had at
most one occupant per room and eight percent of households had 1.01 to 1.5 occupants per room
(Table 2-32). There is also a high incidence of severe overcrowding among renter-occupied
households in Mammoth Lakes, as 10 percent of all renter households had more than 1.51 occupants
per room.
The town of Mammoth Lakes has a larger percentage of severely overcrowded renter-occupied
households (10%) than Unincorporated Mono County (2%). However, two percent of Unincorporated
Mono County’s owner-occupied households have 1.01 to 1.5 occupants per room, while none of the
owner-occupied households in Mammoth Lakes experience severe overcrowding. It is also important
to note that the incidence of overcrowding reported by the American Communities Survey, 2007-2011
does not take into account the seasonal workforce that were not in Mammoth Lakes during the time of
the monthly surveys, particularly during the winter season. Furthermore, the Town expects higher
rates of overcrowding than reported here because the Hispanic population often does not provide
survey data and typically have larger families in one unit. The incidence of overcrowding in
Mammoth Lakes is likely more prevalent than presented in Table 2-32.

COST BURDEN
Though housing affordability by household income has already been discussed, another way to
evaluate housing needs in Mammoth Lakes is reviewing the incidence of cost burden. Housing cost
burden is defined as a household paying more than 30 percent of their gross monthly income towards
housing, including utilities. Further, severely cost burdened is defined as a household spending more
than 50 percent of their gross monthly income on housing.
According to the HCD, renters and owners in the town of Mammoth Lakes were similarly cost
burdened, with 63.5 percent of renters and 49.8 percent of owners paying more than 30 percent of
their income on housing (Table 2-33).

2.7       ANALYSIS OF ASSISTED HOUSING PROJECTS AT RISK
The Housing Element is required to provide an analysis of existing multifamily rental housing that
receives governmental assistance, since the loss of such units reduces the availability of housing to
very-low and low-income households. At risk units are those whose funding programs would expire or
be discontinued, allowing the units to convert to market-rate rents. As shown in Table 2-34, none of
the assisted rental projects in town have periods of affordability that would expire within the next 10
years, or even before 2038. Therefore, none are currently considered at risk of conversion, and no
analysis of the cost of maintaining the affordability of, or replacing, these housing units is needed.

presents the RHNA for the Town of Mammoth Lakes for the current housing element period (2014 –
2019).
As shown in Table 2-35, the Town of Mammoth Lakes should plan for 74 new housing units between
2014 and 2019. Approximately 23 percent of these units should be for very low-income households,
16 percent for low-income households, 19 percent for moderate-income households, and 42 percent
for above moderate-income households.

3 HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
The provision of adequate and affordable housing is an important goal of the Town of Mammoth
Lakes. As a result, the Town has proactively implemented a variety of programs, incentives, and
development standards to encourage the development, maintenance, and improvement of affordable
housing. Even so, a variety of factors, including environmental, market mechanisms, and government
regulations, influence or constrain the development of housing. This section identifies existing
constraints that inhibit the production of affordable housing in the community.
3.1         MARKET CONSTRAINTS
Land costs, construction costs, and market financing contribute to the cost of housing reinvestment
and can potentially hinder the production of new affordable housing. Although many constraints are
driven by market conditions, jurisdictions have some leverage in instituting policies and programs to
address these constraints.
LAND COST
A key component of residential development costs is the price of raw land. Land costs in Mammoth
Lakes can vary considerably, depending on the location of the parcel. Using tax assessor records for
2014, the value of residential land in Mammoth Lakes also varied by zoning designation: an average
of $38.12 per square foot ($1,660,279 per acre) in Residential Multiple-Family 2 (RMF-2), $11.72 per
square foot ($510,351 per acre) in Residential Multiple-Family 1 (RMF-1), $10.31 per square foot
($448,904 per acre) in RR (Rural Residential), and $18.05 per square foot ($786,419 per acre) in
Residential Single Family (RSF). The average value of all residential land in 2014 was $18.25 per
square foot ($794,757 per acre). There have been very few lots sold within the last couple of years.
However, as additional land cost examples, a parcel zoned RR sold for $21 per square foot in August,
2011 and a lot zoned Resort (near Mammoth Mountain Ski Area) sold for $77 per square foot in
March, 2012. RR residential lots currently on the market for sale are averaging $29 per square foot. 14

After dropping significantly during the recession, these increasing lot prices may indicate that land
costs are starting to rise.
SITE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
The costs to develop new housing involve both land improvement costs, expenses to prepare the site
for housing construction, and the actual construction cost. A portion of the total cost to develop new
housing is associated with governmental fees that mitigate the impact of new development on local
infrastructure and services. In Mammoth Lakes, a portion of those development costs are those
associated with required mitigations for affordable and workforce housing.
As may be expected, residential development costs vary greatly depending on location, land costs,
construction type, amenities, and other variables. Costs associated with developer fees and other local
government imposed costs are discussed in detail later in this chapter.
As shown in Table 3-36, based on the listed assumptions, a single-family unit on a 7,500 square foot
lot would cost approximately $480,000 to build (including land)—taking into account the temporary
reduction in Development Impact Fees for 1 – 4 unit projects (see Fees and Exactions discussion
below). An 8-unit multiple-family apartment complex on a 0.66-acre lot would cost approximately
$3.4 million to build, with each 1,100 square foot unit costing approximately $425,000.15
The Mammoth Lakes Main Street Plan (Plan) accepted by Town Council on February 19, 2014
outlines real estate market characteristics and conditions in relation to future development

development cost information. The median sales price for all vacant land in 2012 (including
commercial) was $250,000 ($31.06 per square foot). Additionally, direct construction costs for
multiple family residential was estimated at $295 per square foot and for-sale residential

   This analysis assumes that a single developer would purchase raw land, provide the necessary infrastructure and improvements for
   home construction, and build the homes. In many cases, the development process is performed by two separate entities: the land
   developer, who purchases, entitles, and makes site improvements, and the homebuilder who purchases the lots and builds the
   homes. In this scenario, overall costs may increase, as both the land developer and the homebuilder expect to achieve profits.

While developer profit is a cost to the home purchaser, development profit is not included in Table 3-
36 because of its variability and volatility. Normally, developers attempt to determine the potential
profit that could be generated from a project before moving forward. In general, developers target
projects that can earn profit of ten percent above total development costs but can move forward with
lower projected profit depending on the strength of market, project financing, and a developer’s
willingness to take on higher risk.

MORTGAGE AND REHABILITATION FINANCING
The availability of financing impacts a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. As a result of
more lenient lending practices during the early to mid-2000s, changing economic conditions in the late
2000s, and falling home prices, many homeowners faced difficulties in making their mortgage
payments and have been unable to refinance their home loans or sell their homes to pay off their
mortgages. In response, lenders tightened their loan standards, returning to practices that prevailed
prior to 2000. This has led to an increase in loan denials as lenders more closely scrutinize household
income, credit history, and the overall risk of the loan. Thus, while interest rates have not climbed
dramatically, access to home financing has reduced the pool of buyers able to purchase a home.
Furthermore, the lack of credit not only affects homebuyers and homeowners but also developers and
property owners who want to improve their properties. In particular, financing for projects perceived
as "higher risk" by financial institutions, including housing projects, has become much harder to
obtain since 2008. Although a bowling alley/restaurant will be completed in early 2014 and a hotel is
set to start construction in summer, 2014, a number of other local development projects, including
housing, are likely stalling given ongoing financing challenges.
In 2006, the average 30 year fixed mortgage was approximately 6.4 percent compared to 8 percent in
2000. Since then, interest rates have declined even further to historic lows. In 2013 the average rate
for a 30 year fixed rate was 4 percent. 17 While interest rates have remained historically low, averaging
below 5 percent since 2010, and the increased supply of housing on the market at comparatively
affordable prices has created new home ownership opportunities, tighter loan standards and financing
availability continues to affect a potential homebuyer’s ability to purchase a home.
Home Loan Mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) have increased as a
result of the shoring up of available credit and more stringent loan requirements. Currently, many
lending institutions require a 20 percent down payment, in addition to meeting income and credit
history requirements. Lenders’ stricter adherence to mortgage qualifications has decreased the
opportunity for people to take out loans on those terms, and FHA-backed loans have become a popular
alternative. In fiscal year 2012-2013, the California FHA funded 6,311 loans totaling $37.7 million for
the California Homebuyer’s Downpayment Assistance Program, marking the largest-ever number of

down payment (recent figures cite as little as 3.5 percent) and a good credit score is not essential. 19
However, condominiums do not qualify for FHA financing unless the complex or building is FHA-
approved. With the Mammoth Lakes’ Housing stock consisting largely of condominiums (71%), this
may present a problem for many buyers, limiting program use primarily to single family home
purchases.
3.2         GOVERNMENTAL OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS
Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing and, in particular, the
provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and
exactions, permit processing procedures, and various other issues may present constraints to the
maintenance, development, and improvement of housing. However, other governmental policies or
actions can also facilitate or encourage opportunities for the development of housing that meets the
diversity of the community’s needs. This section discusses potential governmental constraints, as well
as policies that encourage housing development in Mammoth Lakes.
LAND USE CONTROLS
Land use controls can have a direct impact on the affordability of housing. The zoning regulations of
the Town are designed to allow flexibility in design and permit a wide variety of residential uses and
structures.
Zoning
The Town of Mammoth Lakes has eleven zones that permit residential uses, and which are intended to
accommodate existing and future housing development. They include four residential zones, a mobile
home park zone, three commercial zones (in which residential uses are also permitted), a resort zone

intended for larger scale master planned residential and commercial development, as well as two areas
designed as Specific Plans, principally intended for mixed lodging, commercial and residential
development. Beyond these eleven zones, the Town includes land zoned for non-residential uses
including public facilities, industrial development, and open space.
Rural Residential (RR). This zone is intended as an area for single-family rural residential
development with larger lots and lower density than the residential single-family zone. Uses permitted
are those that are complementary to and can exist in harmony with a rural residential neighborhood.
This zone permits a maximum density of two units per acre.
Residential Single-Family (RSF). This zone is intended as an area for single-family residential
development. Only those uses are permitted that are complementary to, and can exist in harmony with,
a residential neighborhood. This zone permits a maximum density of four units per acre.
Residential Multiple-Family 1 (RMF-1). This zone is intended as an area for the development of
mixed residential uses (single-family dwellings, apartments, and other multiple-family developments).
Only those uses are permitted that are complementary to, and can exist in harmony with, such
residential developments. This zone permits a maximum density of 12 units per acre.
Residential Multiple-Family 2 (RMF-2). This zone is intended as an area for the development of
primarily multiple-family developments. Transient occupancy, such as motels or hotels, shall be
permissible in this zone, subject to the issuance of a use permit. Only those uses are permitted that are
complementary to, and can exist in harmony with, such residential developments. This zone permits a
maximum density of 12 units per acre.
Mobile Home Park (MHP). The mobile home park zone is intended for the exclusive development of
mobile home parks. Mobile homes parks are intended to offer an alternative mode of housing to the
residents of the community. The Town currently has two developed mobile home parks.
Downtown (D). This district is intended to provide a mix of multi-family residential, non-residential
(e.g. office, retail, live/work units), and lodging uses, with a focus on ground-level commercial uses
and active frontages. The development standards are intended to concentrate development along Main
Street with a focus on shop front buildings. The maximum FAR is 2.5. Lodging development has a
maximum density of 80 rooms per acre. Multiple-family residential development has a maximum

density of 12 units per acre. The D zoning district is consistent with the Commercial 2 (C-2) land use
designation of the General Plan.
Old Mammoth Road (OMR). This zone is intended as an arts and culture pedestrian-scaled district
oriented toward medium scale commercial development along Old Mammoth Road, with a mix and
intensity of uses (e.g. office, retail, live/work units) appropriate to its neighborhood context and
adjacent residential uses. The maximum FAR is 2.5. Lodging development has a maximum density of
80 rooms/acre. Multiple-family residential development is permitted with maximum density of
12 units/acre. The OMR zoning district is consistent with the Commercial 2 (C-2) land use
designation of the General Plan.
Mixed Lodging/Residential (MLR). This district is intended to allow one or more of a variety of
lodging, multiple-family residential, and non-residential (e.g. office, retail, live/work units) uses, a
mix emphasizing transient occupancy. The maximum FAR is 2.5. Lodging development has a
maximum density of 80 rooms per acre. Multiple-family residential development has a maximum
density of 12 units per acre. The MLR zoning district is consistent with the Commercial 1 (C-1) land
use designation of the General Plan.
Multiple-family residential units are allowed in all three commercial districts by right, and single room
occupancy units are allowed in the OMR and MLR districts with a use permit. The OMR zone permits
emergency housing by right. Transitional and supportive housing constitute a residential use and are
subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same
zoning district. The permitted maximum residential density of 12 units per acre may constrain the
development of affordable housing units; however, the Town has developed affordable workforce
housing and has provisions for density bonuses or an increase in density, which has made previous
development of affordable housing possible.
Resort (R). The Resort zone is intended to allow for large-scale coordinated planning of properties,
accommodating a range of different uses including single-family residential developments, multiple
housing projects, professional and administrative office uses, hotels including attendant support
commercial activities, recreational facilities, and public or quasi-public uses, or combination of such
uses.

A development plan (which has typically been in the form of a Master Plan) is required for all Resort
zoned properties, allowing for greater flexibility and creativity in their planning. However, the Resort
zone limits maximum density to eight units per acre, and requires the application of similar
performance and environmental standards as similar uses in other zones. A number of master plans
have been adopted for Resort-zoned properties. These include the Lodestar Master Plan, Greyhawk
Master Plan, Altis Master Plan, Snowcreek Master Plan, and the Juniper Ridge Master Plan, which
have variously included visitor-oriented lodging and housing associated with major recreational
facilities such as golf course (Snowcreek and Lodestar Master Plans), or base lodges for Mammoth
Mountain. In compliance with the Town's Housing Ordinance, development of these Master Plans has
required mitigation of workforce housing demand, which has occurred through designation of sites
within the Master Plan area, donation of land, and direct construction of housing units.
North Village Specific Plan (NVSP). The objective of the NVSP is to create a set of land use
designations and development standards that will facilitate the development (or renovation) of “North
Village” a 64-acre area in the northwest part of the town. The NVSP focuses on the creation of visitor
services and attractions, while emphasizing pedestrian access and mobility; the Specific Plan
designates a "pedestrian core" and series of land use zones of varying intensity, focused around a
mixed use village and gondola station.
Clearwater Specific Plan (CSP). The Clearwater Specific Plan zone was created with the adoption of
a Specific Plan for a 6-acre site on Old Mammoth Road in early 2009. The Specific Plan allows for a
mixed-use development including a major hotel, with ground floor commercial uses and on-site
workforce housing.
Affordable Housing Overlay Zone
The Town of Mammoth Lakes Municipal Code includes an Affordable Housing Overlay Zone. The
Affordable Housing Overlay is intended to facilitate the development of lower income units. In this
zone, all units must be affordable to households with incomes ranging from very low-income up to
moderate-income. The underlying zone sets density but increases are allowed per the density bonuses.
Additionally, the Town Council may waive any or all fees normally imposed by the Town on
development projects. Development standards for parking are relaxed in this zone and additional
zoning concessions may be requested, consistent with the State Density Bonus Law.

Currently, this code provision has only been applied to one approximately 25-acre parcel known as the
Shady Rest site. The underlying zone of this property is zoned RMF-1, with a maximum density of 12
units per acre. The land exchange of this parcel with the US Forest Service and its designation as an
Affordable Housing Overlay zone was a mitigation requirement for the development of the Trails
subdivision. A Master Plan was adopted for the site in 1991, designating the property for 172 units of
housing limited to very-low, low- and moderate-income households.
Planned Residential Development Zone
The Town’s Municipal Code allows for planned residential development regulations, which are
intended to facilitate development of areas designated for residential use on the General Plan by
permitting greater flexibility and, consequently, more creative and imaginative designs for the
development of such residential areas than generally is possible under conventional zoning or
subdivision regulations. Historically, the Town has not utilized this section of code, instead utilizing
Master Plans or Specific Plans to provide coordinated planning of larger residential and resort areas.
Residential Development Standards
As shown in Table 3-37, minimum lot sizes in residential zones range from 7,500 square feet in the
RSF zone to 40,000 square feet in the RMF-2 zone. The relatively large minimum lot size in the
RMF-2 zones is due to the fact that this zone is primarily used to build larger scale projects including
transient rental and multiple-family residential units. The RMF-1 zone also has a relatively large
minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet. Lot coverage limits range from 30% in the RR zone to 60%
in the RMF-1 zone. While these minimums may increase land costs, they result from constraints
imposed by an alpine climate, and encourage development of multiple units on each lot. The minimum
lot size requirements, coupled with relatively restrictive lot coverage requirements are necessary to
maintain setbacks, accommodate snow storage on-site, and to minimize impermeable surfaces. The
Town’s minimum lot coverage requirements are sufficient to achieve the allowable densities in each
zone and do not constrain development.

For projects built above maximum density, some obtained density bonuses by providing affordable
housing units pursuant to State law and Town code; a number of other projects took advantage of a
provision then in place in the Town's zoning code (since repealed for residential zones), that allowed
small residential units (one bedroom or studio units) to count as a half, rather than a full unit of
density. Table 3-38 summarizes the average density of all existing multiple-family projects by zone.
As shown in the table, existing multiple-family projects have, on average, been built at densities that
meet or exceed the zoning standard of 12 units per acre in these zones.

Density bonuses are provided in accordance with the provisions of the State Density Bonus law. The
Town also provides an additional density bonus that allows up to twice the permitted density where a
project provides a higher percentage of qualifying affordable housing units, subject to use permit
approval. As permitted by State Density Bonus law, the Town also grants concessions in the form of
reduced development standards for projects that include affordable housing units. Please see Chapter
4 for an additional discussion of the Town's Housing Ordinance, which incorporates these and other
provisions that are intended to facilitate the production of affordable housing units.
Parking Requirements
Single-family residences must have a minimum of three spaces for each residence, at least 50 percent
of required parking shall be enclosed and one of which must be unenclosed, unless otherwise
approved by the review authority. One additional space is required for residences with a floor area of
3,000-4,999 square feet (exclusive of garages and decks), two additional spaces for residences with a
floor area of 5,000-6,999 square feet and 3 additional spaces for residences 7,000 square feet or
greater. The requirement of three parking spaces for single-family residences within the RR and RSF
zone, in addition to snow storage requirements discussed next, may be a constraint to development on
substandard sized or shaped lots.

Multiple-family residential projects must provide a minimum of one parking space for each studio or
one-bedroom unit, two spaces for each two- or three-bedroom unit, and three spaces for unit with four
or more bedrooms. At least 50 percent of the required parking is required to be enclosed. In addition
to the spaces required per unit, each multiple family project must provide a minimum of two guest
parking spaces for each four units up to twelve units, one space for each four units for the thirteenth to
the forty-eighth unit, and one space for each additional six units above forty-eight.
Notwithstanding this potential constraint, the Town’s parking requirements are intended to ensure that
adequate on-site parking is provided such that cars will not park on the street and interfere with winter
snow removal operations. The parking requirements also reflect the resort-oriented nature of the
community, where many of the housing units in town are rented to several vacationing individuals or
families who travel to Mammoth Lakes in multiple vehicles. The guest parking requirements ensure
there is adequate parking for Mammoth Lakes’ ample number of visitors and decreases the tendency
for visitors to park in areas designated for snow storage.
Recognizing the high cost associated with the provision of parking, the Town has routinely granted
concessions in the form of reduced parking requirements for projects that incorporate affordable
housing units, including application of the State-mandated ratio of parking spaces per unit. Parking
concessions have been made in almost all of the recently constructed affordable and workforce
housing projects constructed by Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. and other private developers.
The Zoning Code allows for reduced parking standards for the areas of town with mixed-use
development and multi-modal accessibility. Three parking zones have been established for non-
residential use classifications. Parking zone 1 includes the Downtown and Old Mammoth Road
Commercial Zoning Districts, which represent the areas of town with the highest concentration of
mixed-use development and multi-modal accessibility, thereby reducing parking demand. Therefore,
parking requirements in this zone are the lowest. Parking zone 2 includes the Mixed Lodging
Residential Zoning District and portions of the Lodestar Master Plan area and Juniper Ridge Master
Plan area, which represents areas of town with some mixed-use and/or multiple-family development
that is served by transit, thereby reducing parking demand moderately. Therefore, parking
requirements in this zone are the second lowest. Parking zone 3 represents all other areas within town,
except where parking standards have been established through a Master Plan or Specific Plan.

Snow Storage
Given Mammoth Lakes winter conditions, with an average of over 300 inches of snowfall annually,
providing adequate space for snow storage is an important development requirement. The Town
requires an area equal to a minimum of 75 percent of all uncovered required parking and driveway
areas to be provided for storage of snow in residential zones, 40 percent in industrial zones, and 60
percent in commercial zones. Furthermore, all designated snow storage areas must be at least 10 feet
in any direction, be located near the sides or rear of parking areas and driveways, readily accessible
and substantially free and clear of all obstructions, as well as meet all other requirements outlined in
Municipal Code Section 17.36.110. The review authority may reduce or waive commercial zone snow
storage area(s) under certain conditions (Municipal Code Section 17.36.110.B.3.a). Alternative
methods of compliance may help reduce the potential cost impact and constraint of having to set aside
land for snow storage, but may also increase maintenance costs. As noted in the above discussion,
similar to the parking requirements, snow storage requirements may be a constraint to development on
substandard sized or shaped lots.
ZONING CODE UPDATES AND AMENDMENTS
The current Zoning Code was originally adopted in 1984 and has undergone a number of amendments
since adoption, reflecting relatively minor changes to development standards. The Town undertook a
comprehensive Zoning Code Update, which will be effective May 2, 2014, in order to ensure better
consistency with the 2007 General Plan. The purposes of the Zoning Code are listed in Zoning Code
Section 17.04.020. This Housing Element reflects the 2014 Zoning Code Update.
Previous Zoning Code Amendments for Development Standards
Two previous zoning code amendments pertaining to development standards applied to residential
units do not appear to be constraints to residential development, as they provide greater clarification in
definition and density calculations or better conformance to the Town’s General Plan.
Zoning Code Amendment 2008-02 removed the definition of one-bedroom or studio units up to 850
square feet as half a dwelling unit in residential zones to instead count each of these as one full unit.
The original provision had been intended to provide an incentive to developers to build smaller and
more affordable units within the multiple-family residential zones; in practice it lead to "overbuilding"

of some smaller parcels with an excessive number of units that created conflicts with parking, lot
coverage and other Town standards, negatively affecting neighborhood character.
Zoning Code Amendment 2008-01 clarified the definition of lot area, which is used to calculate density
and removed the terms “net” and “gross” as they had been found throughout the Code. Various sections
of the Zoning Code had used these terms interchangeably, although in practice the Town used a single,
standardized calculation method. The deletion of these terms reduced various points of ambiguity in the
Code and reinforced the existing and prevailing method of calculating lot area.
Additionally, in 2010, Zoning Code Amendment 2010-003 was approved, which allowed time extension
requests of up to six years for use permits, design reviews, and variances. This allowed residential
developments, such as apartments, which do not require a tentative map, to be valid for up to eight years
instead of a maximum of three years.
These three amendments are included in the 2014 Zoning Code Update.
Comprehensive Zoning Code Update
The Town adopted its General Plan update in 2007. The General Plan includes a number of new
policy directives and concepts that were not reflected in the Municipal Code, which had not been
comprehensively updated in many years. As a result, some areas of conflict and ambiguity existed
between the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance in particular, which added additional complexity to
some permit applications. To address this, the Town completed a comprehensive Zoning Code Update
in 2014. The Zoning Code Update incorporates the goals and policies of the 2007 General Plan,
modernizes the Town’s zoning regulations, and creates a more user-friendly code that supports the
community vision expressed in the General Plan. The new Code includes regulations that promote
sustainability, development quality and design, and encourage feet-first mobility. Objectives of the
Zoning Code Update include:
Implement the General Plan. Encourage the land use goals, policies, and actions designated the
General Plan to create a comprehensive and stable use pattern upon which to plan transportation,
water supply, and other public facilities and utilities.
Promote Sustainability. Incorporate standards that promote sustainable development and incorporate
the goals, policies, and actions outlined in the General Plan.

Promote Quality and Design. Incorporate standards that improve development quality and design,
enhance visual character, avoid conflicts between land uses, and preserve the scenic qualities of the
town by maintaining adequate open space.
Improve Readability and Usability. Use charts, graphics, and illustrations to make the Code easier to
read and to reorganize the material to group similar and related regulations together.
The Zoning Code Update also included review of administrative procedures, as well as development
standards, and incorporated ways in which the Code could be made more user-friendly and processes
more streamlined.
Original Affordable Housing Mitigation Ordinance (2000-2009)
Mammoth Lakes adopted its first Affordable Housing Mitigation Ordinance in 2000, with updates and
amendments made in 2004 and 2006. This Affordable Housing Mitigation Ordinance was
instrumental in facilitating the production of moderately priced housing in Mammoth Lakes from
2000 to 2009, by placing strict requirements on new development to mitigate its demand for
affordable and workforce housing units. The Housing Ordinance was updated in 2015 (see Updated
Housing Mitigation Ordinance 2015, below).
The driving principle of the original Ordinance was that development must provide housing for the
workforce it generates. Formulas were applied in the Ordinance to match the type of development
with its characteristic job generation to determine the number of Full Time Employee Equivalent
(FTEE)20 housing units that must be provided. Table 3-39 shows the FTEE generation table by project
type, which was then used to calculate the total number of FTEEs generated by new development.
This number was then used either to determine the number of units to be constructed or the in-lieu fee
a developer owed the Town for the project.

   The Full Time Equivalent Employee (FTEE) is a full time employee or combination of part time employees. When the employee
   generation calculation results in seasonal or part time employees, those employees are grouped together to form FTEEs. Full time
   year round employees equal one FTEE, part time year round employees and full time seasonal employees equal one-half FTEE,
   and part time seasonal employees equal one quarter FTEE.

Certain projects including small residential developments of less than five units, small lodging and
commercial developments, and all developments in the industrial zone were permitted to pay an in-
lieu fee. When units were built the Ordinance includes a formula by which those units of different
sizes (number of bedrooms and living area) may satisfy FTEEs. When in-lieu fees were paid, they
were calculated by multiplying the total FTEE by the in-lieu fee, which is established by ordinance
and periodically updated. The Ordinance stated that on-site housing units were preferred and should
be developed on-site unless it can be demonstrated that the location is undesirable for the community
or infeasible, or there is an alternative that would better achieve community affordable workforce
housing goals. In such cases, the Ordinance allowed for Alternate Housing Mitigation Plans (AHMPs)
that can include construction on a different location, land dedications, and housing acquisition and
rehabilitation within town boundaries, or when the Planning and Economic Development
Commission, based upon substantial evidence, that an on-site or off-site alternative is undesirable for
the community or infeasible as determined by the Commission or Community and Economic
Development Director, may the Town then approve payment of in-lieu fees. An AHMP required
approval by the Planning and Economic Development Commission.
Because many of the development projects in Mammoth in recent years have been less conducive to
including on-site housing (lodging, luxury condominiums, etc.), it has not been unusual for the Town
to negotiate with developers and propose win-win alternatives instead of requiring on-site
construction. The Town has been able to reach agreements on AHMPs that include measures such as
land dedications or in-lieu fees that result in more flexibility regarding the types and location of
housing being produced. For these alternative proposals to work, it is essential that a local developer
be in place to utilize the resources (e.g., fees and land) provided. For this reason, Mammoth Lakes
Housing, Inc. (MLH), a non-profit housing development agency, was established in 2003, and has
since been pivotal in facilitating the production of new affordable housing units in Mammoth Lakes.
Since 2010, the MLH has converted 22 market rate units to affordable deed restricted units. MLH and
its accomplishments are described in additional detail in Chapter 4.
Additionally, the Town’s Housing Ordinance is not a constraint to market rate housing development.
Although development has been slow since the 2008 recession, two multi-family structures were
constructed between 2010 and 2014, adding 6 additional market rate units. As discussed in Table 2-30
in Chapter 2 the median priced home or condominium is affordable to most moderate-income families
in Mammoth Lakes. Despite its obvious merits and importance, the Town also recognizes that the

Housing Ordinance, alongside other development fees, contributes to increased costs for developers of
future homes. In light of this, and recent economic conditions, the Town completed a review of the
Ordinance as part of a broader review of development fees. This review resulted in a recommendation
that the Ordinance be significantly revised, including a restructuring and reduction of the housing
mitigation requirements. These revisions are discussed further in the following sections.
Interim Affordable Housing Mitigation Policy
In late 2008 and 2009, the national economy entered a serious downturn. In 2008, the Town Council
approved a temporary reduction in development fees, including Development Impact Fees (DIF) and
housing in-lieu fees, as a "stimulus package" to continue investment in residential and other
construction.
In mid-2009, as the recession continued, the Town began a process to thoroughly review development
costs, including the DIF program, Housing Ordinance and associated in-lieu fees. A Town-
commissioned study completed by an independent economic consultant found that the existing DIF
and housing fees were a significant impediment to new development, and reflected a disproportionate
burden to new development in the funding of new facilities and infrastructure. Overall, the report
concluded that fees appeared to be set at levels which are likely to impede new investment, and result
in reduced development activity, associated fee revenues, and workforce and market-rate housing
production.
Based on the study, the Town adopted interim policies for development impact fees and for housing
mitigation and in-lieu fees in November 2009, which reduced fees for most development types by
around 50 percent from previous levels. More recently, to help stimulate the local economy, the Town
Council extended a temporary reduction to DIF for one to four unit residential projects, commercial
projects, and remodel projects to July 31, 2014.
The Town and Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. developed the Interim Affordable Housing Mitigation
Policy cooperatively, to include the following provisions:
        An inclusionary housing requirement of 10 percent for all new residential and lodging
         developments larger than nine residential units or 19 lodging units, at a target income level of
         120% of AMI or less.

        An in-lieu fee requirement for small residential and lodging projects, commercial and
         industrial development.
        Exemptions from housing mitigation requirements for small single-family residences (under
         2,500 square feet), rental apartments and deed-restricted units, and retail and restaurant
         development in certain zones.
        Projects required to provide on-site units may propose an Alternate Housing Mitigation Plan,
         if findings can be made that providing units on-site would be undesirable for the community
         or infeasible, and that substantial additional housing benefit would result in terms of
         providing a greater number of units, earlier provision of units, or providing units that better
         meet priorities established by the Town or Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc.
The Town amended the Housing Ordinance in 2015 to reflect feedback regarding the Interim
Affordable Housing Mitigation Policy and this Housing Element Update.
Updated Housing Mitigation Ordinance 2015
The Town adopted a comprehensive update to the Housing Ordinance in 2015. The updated Chapter
17.136 includes a menu-based format that allows developers to choose a desired method for housing
mitigation (i.e., fee, on-site housing, off-site housing, conveyance of land, or other). A housing fee
will be established once a nexus study for such fee is approved by Town Council. A copy of the
current Housing Ordinance is included in Appendix C.
Urban Growth Boundary
The Town adopted an Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) in 1993 to ensure a compact urban form,
protect natural and outdoor recreational resources, and prevent sprawl. Of the total 24.4 square miles
within the Town’s municipal boundary, approximately 4.6 miles lie within the UGB. The land outside
of the UGB but within the municipal boundary consists largely of public lands administered by the
Inyo National Forest, as well as 80 acres of patented mining claims on top of the Sherwin ridge, the
Valentine Reserve of the University of California, Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, which is leased
from Inyo National Forest, and the City of Los Angeles’ Camp High Sierra. Lands beyond the
municipal boundary consist primarily of public lands administered by the USDA Forest Service, Inyo

The 2007 General Plan assumes the total number of residents, visitors, and workers on a winter
weekend could grow up to 52,000 People at One Time (PAOT) by the year 2025. PAOT is used as a
buildout measurement for the Town because of the large number of seasonal visitors and workers,
which is significantly higher than the full-time population. Ultimately, the General Plan land
designations could result in a build-out population over 52,000 but less than 60,000 if all land is built
to its expected capacity.
The estimate of PAOT at buildout is based on a number of assumptions, which are detailed in the
General Plan:
         Development on individual parcels will be controlled by lot coverage limits, building height
          restrictions, floor area ratio limits, and implementation of community benefit and
          performance standards and policies in the various master and specific plans;
         The permanent population will grow at a rate of between 1.4 percent and 2.4 percent per year;
         The capacity of the ski area will remain constant over the next twenty years;
         The number of people engaged in activities other than skiing will increase as the town
          matures from 25 percent to between 35 percent and 45 percent; and
         Permanent resident units are assumed to accommodate 2.4 people per unit on average and all
          other units to accommodate 4 people per unit on an average winter Saturday.
Other assumptions used may be found in the General Plan’s Land Use Element on page 37. The Town
has developed and maintains a GIS-based model, which can be used to track progress towards
buildout of residential and lodging development and PAOT, and is reported along with all
discretionary or legislative project approvals requesting modifications to allowable density.
The UGB does not appear to be a constraint, as the General Plan’s land use designations take into
account the UGB and allows for growth in the town in the next 25 years. The Town’s land inventory,
described in Chapter 4 of this Housing Element, is also completely within the UGB. Therefore, the
UGB does not adversely impact the Town’s ability to accommodate its regional housing need
allocation.

PROVISIONS FOR A VARIETY OF HOUSING
Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available
through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of various types
of housing for all economic segments of the population. This includes single-family housing, multiple-
family housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, housing for the disabled, emergency shelters,
and transitional housing, among others. Table 3-40 summarizes housing types permitted within the
various zones.
The Town offers a diversity of housing types for all economic segments of the community, including
more vulnerable members of the community, those earning lower incomes, seniors, the disabled,
seasonal workers, and the homeless, among others.
Multiple-Family Units
The Municipal Code permits multiple-family housing in the residential multiple family zones (RMF-1
and RMF-2), as well as the Downtown (D), Old Mammoth Road (OMR), and Mixed
Lodging/Residential (MLR) Commercial Zoning Districts by right. These zones allow a maximum of
12 dwellings per acre for multiple-family developments. Approximately 71 percent of Mammoth
Lakes’ housing stock consists of multiple-family residences.21
Condominiums
The Town permits condominium developments in both the commercial and residential zones
(multiple-family zones). However, condominiums require tentative and final map approval. A use
permit and subdivision approval (i.e., tentative map and final map) are required for the conversion of
an existing apartment unit for sale, transfer, or conveyance as a condominium. Due to the resort-
oriented nature of Mammoth Lakes, the Planning and Economic Development Commission must
determine if the resultant ownership pattern is appropriate for the proposed use(s) and that the
proposed development of the property conforms to all requirements of the Municipal Code.

                                                                                                          CHAPTER 3: HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
The use permit requirement does not adversely affect the cost or availability of ownership housing for
moderate-income households since it represents a minimal portion of the overall costs to develop a
project, most of which are contributed by the typically high land and construction costs in Mammoth
Lakes.
The Town's Municipal Code Chapter 17.52.110 includes provisions regarding conversion of rental
housing units to condominiums, with the intent of preserving the rental housing stock. No conversion
of existing rental apartments is permitted where the average vacancy rate over the prior three years is
five percent or less; projects proposing to demolish existing rental apartments and replace them with
condominium units may be required to directly mitigate the loss of those units, in addition to any other
required housing mitigation. Where condominium conversions can be approved, the applicant is
required to provide a relocation plan for existing tenants, as required by the Subdivision Map Act and
State law.
Live/Work Units
A live/work loft is an integrated housing unit and working space, occupied and utilized by a single
household in a structure, either single-family or multiple-family, that has been designed or structurally
modified to accommodate joint residential occupancy and work activity, and where the residential use
is secondary and accessory to the primary use as a place of work. Live/work units are permitted in D,
OMR, and MLR Commercial Zoning Districts. Live/work units must meet the requirements and
design standards outlined in Section 17.52.150 of the Municipal Code. The residential space within
the live/work unit is to be occupied by at least one individual employed in the business conducted
within the live/work unit.
Second Dwelling Units
Consistent with Government Code Section 65852.2, secondary residential units are permitted in all
residential zones. A secondary unit must meet specified development standards, Municipal Code
17.52.270, and may be either attached to the primary dwelling or separate from the primary dwelling.
A manufactured or modular unit placed on a permanent foundation may also be used as a secondary
unit. Secondary units may be rented separately, unless the primary dwelling is rented, and the sale of a
secondary unit separate from the primary unit is prohibited.

Mobile Homes
Mobile and manufactured homes offer an affordable housing option to many low and moderate-
income households. Mobile homes are defined in the Municipal Code as a single-family dwelling and
are permitted in all residential zoning districts in the Town, according to the same development
standards applied to site-built single-family homes. According to the California Department of
Finance, 147 mobile homes were located in Mammoth Lakes in 2013.
Mobile Home Parks
The Zoning Code also includes a "Mobile Home Park" (MHP) zone, which specifies various
development standards for mobile home parks. Mammoth Lakes has two mobile home parks, both of
which were created before the Town was incorporated, and which are zoned MHP. Development
standards for the MHP zone include:
        A minimum park area of ten acres;
        A minimum park street frontage: 200 feet;
        A minimum site area per unit of 5,000 square feet;
        Minimum setback of 20 feet adjoining a street, and ten feet adjoining another lot line
        Maximum height of 35 feet; and
        Minimum of 50 square feet of recreation area for each mobile home space.
A zoning map amendment is required to rezone property to MHP. In addition, Design Review is also
required. The Town estimates that review of the rezoning application could take a year or more,
depending on the complexity of the project, and requires Town Council approval of the rezoning
request (Table 3-41).
The Town has not received any applications for a mobile home park since incorporation; it is
uncertain why this is the case, but likely reasons are a shortage of large undeveloped residentially –
zoned properties within the Urban Growth Boundary, and high local land costs, rather than the burden
of the development review process. The re-zoning process reflects reasonable processes intended to
ensure compatibility of any proposed mobile home park with surrounding uses, and that such a use

would be designed and operated in a manner consistent with community standards and policies,
similar to any other similar large-scale residential development.
Manufactured Homes
Per Section 65852.3 of California’s Government Code, a town or a city shall allow the installation of
modular housing units, constructed in compliance with the Uniform Building Code (UBC), and
manufactured homes certified under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety
Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. Secs. 5401 et seq.), on an approved permanent foundation system,
pursuant to Section 18551 of the California Health and Safety Code, on lots zoned for conventional
single-family residential dwellings.
The Town of Mammoth Lakes has approved several housing developments that have been constructed
with modular buildings. Pursuant to Section 17.144.020 of the Municipal Code, single detached
family units for occupancy by one household, and located on a separate lot from any other unit (except
second living units, where permitted) includes individual manufactured housing units. Manufactured
housing is expected to follow the same permitting process and regulations as buildings with traditional
construction.
Group Living Quarters and Single Room Occupancy Units
Shared living quarters without separate kitchen or bathroom facilities for each room or unit, are
offered for rent for permanent or semi-transient residents on a weekly or longer basis. This
classification includes clean and sober facilities, rooming and boarding houses, dormitories and other
types of organizational housing, private residential clubs, and extended stay hotels intended for long-
term occupancy (30 days or more) but excludes hotels and motels, and residential care facilities.
Group living quarters are allowed in the multi-family residential zones with a use permit.
Single room occupancy facilities contain housing units that may have kitchen and/or bathroom
facilities and are guest rooms or efficiency units as defined by the State Health and Safety Code. Each
housing unit is occupied by no more than two persons and is offered on a monthly rental basis or
longer. Single room occupancy facilities are allowed with a use permit in both the OMR and MLR
commercial zone districts.

Farmworker Housing
The Town of Mammoth Lakes does not have any farm or agricultural land within its jurisdictional
boundaries, or farmworkers living in the town. Furthermore, there is not significant agricultural
activity within the vicinity of Mammoth Lakes. Therefore, farmworker housing is not a need for this
community.
Emergency Shelters, and Supportive & Transitional Housing
As noted in Chapter 2, Mammoth Lakes does not have a large homeless population, due in large part
to the harsh winter climate. The Inyo Mono Advocates for Community Action (IMACA), located in
Bishop, provides emergency food and shelter services for Mono and Inyo Counties. IMACA’s hotel/
motel voucher program, created in partnership with the Salvation Army, pays for individuals without
shelter to stay in a local hotel or motel for a few nights. The Mammoth Lakes Police Department also
assists homeless individuals in securing emergency shelter for both domestic violence or stranded
individuals (snowed-in, hotels booked). Wild Iris, a community-based non-profit agency, will find
shelter or provide a safe haven in Mammoth Lakes for individuals who are leaving an abusive
situation.
Described in Section 17.144.020 of the Municipal Code, emergency housing is a temporary, short-
term residence where occupancy is limited to six months or less. Transitional housing is limited at no
less than six months and supportive housing units have no limit on length of stay. Pursuant to Section
17.52.290 of the Municipal Code, transitional and supportive housing constitute a residential use and
are subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same
zoning district. Emergency shelters are permitted in the OMR Commercial Zoning District. The
Town’s zoning regulations pertaining to emergency shelters and supportive and transitional housing
therefore, complies with SB 2 by permitting these uses in at least one zoning district by right without
discretionary action, subject to the same development and management standards that apply to other
uses within these districts. Analysis of available land use capacity in the OMR Commercial Zoning
District indicates there are nine vacant parcels that could be available for the construction of an
emergency shelters. At least one emergency shelter should be adequate to accommodate Mammoth
Lakes' relatively small population in need of such services.

As with other projects, Design Review is required for new construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
alteration, or other projects involving improvements to exterior of a structure, site, or parking area.
However, certain projects are exempt from the Design Review requirements which are enumerated in
Chapter 17.88 of the Municipal Code, including the exemption for new construction of emergency
shelters or renovation of an existing building to create an emergency shelter (Section 17.88.020.A.5)
which also complies with SB 2. Per the Zoning Code temporary emergency shelters shall be permitted in
any zoning district for a chapter maximum of 30 days in any 90-day period, provided that the facilities
are approved by the Building Department and Mammoth Lakes Fire Protection District prior to use.
Seasonal Worker Housing
Because of the shortage of rental units during the winter months, some seasonal workers have slept in
cars or RVs as alternatives to living in cramped living quarters or leaving the area. Anecdotal evidence
suggests that some seasonal workers have illegally occupied vacant buildings or camped on Forest
Service land around the town (this is likely more common in summer than in winter, due to severe
weather conditions). As previously discussed, in order to sufficiently mitigate the increased workforce
housing demands created by new development, the Town’s Municipal Code, and the adopted Interim
Affordable Housing Mitigation Policy include provisions to require workforce housing as part of new
development. In 2011, Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. commissioned a Housing Needs Assessment.
The Housing Needs Assessment included employee and employer surveys, a trends analysis of
demand for housing, and discussions specific to issues and demand for seasonal employee housing in
Mammoth Lakes.
Given the resort-nature of the community, leisure and hospitality is the largest contributor to seasonal
jobs in both the winter and summer season, which includes many of the seasonal jobs provided by
Mammoth Mountain Ski Area. These jobs account for large fluctuations in the demand for housing,
with peak demand during the winter ski season. As noted in the Mammoth Lakes Housing Needs
Assessment (2011), when competing for accommodations with visitors who are also leasing units
during the ski sea, this can make it not only challenging for seasonal employees to find available
housing, but second-home renters also help drive up rents.22

DEVELOPMENT PERMIT PROCEDURES
Development permit procedures are designed to facilitate orderly residential development to ensure
public health, safety, and general welfare. The Town can encourage the ongoing construction,
maintenance, and improvement of housing by reducing, to the extent possible, the time and
uncertainty involved in gaining approvals for various development permits. This section outlines the
target time frames for planning entitlement review and approval of new residential projects.
The Town has a streamlined application process to reduce impediments to the provision of housing.
Residential development, as a primary permitted use in the appropriate zones, may be permitted
ministerially through staff design review, if required, and plan check. Table 3-40 indicates the
permitted and conditional uses for residential development in the various residential and commercial
zones.
The timeframe for development review in the Town of Mammoth Lakes depends mostly on the
complexity of the project. In particular, projects seeking zone code changes or that propose Specific
Plans or Master Plans require legislative approval and therefore have a longer timeframe for review.
Furthermore, as the Town is approaching build-out and available sites for development are more
limited, the complexity of many projects may also be due to site constraints. As shown in Table 3-41,
the planning, engineering, and design review phase, which usually runs concurrently with the CEQA
process, often requires the most time during the entitlement and planning phase but, typically takes
less than a year. The building review phase, necessary to start construction of the structure(s) and
subsequently achieve a certificate of occupancy, requires a maximum of two months. The
Development Review Process is outlined in The Town of Mammoth Lakes Development Review
Process Flowchart, Chart 3-1. Typically, processing time for an application to build a single-family
home is two to four months, depending on whether design review is required; a multiple-family
project requiring a Major Design Review permit may take four months up to over a year, including
cumulative time to approve the use permit and building permit.

DISTRICT PLANNING
In June 2007, the Town Council adopted a policy that established district planning. District planning is
a structured process that studies the wider geographic area and conditions relevant to a project
application and its site, project alternatives, and how it fits into the General Plan Vision Statement,
goals, and polices for the Town. The goal of planning by district is to provide the best and most
current information to the community, Town staff, Commissions, and Town Council to assist with
decisions and recommendations. This includes setting goals, policies, programs, and review of
development applications. Achieving greater public participation through this process was also
important to the Town.
Major steps of district planning were the following, with public workshops held with each phase:
         Definition of the district boundaries and scope of work.
         Selection of a consultant to undertake the work to develop the district plan.
         Plan preparation (typically) in four phases:
              o    Existing Conditions, Opportunities and Constraints Analysis.
              o    Alternatives Development.
              o    Alternatives Analysis and Selection.
              o    Plan Development and "acceptance"
Prior to 2007, district plans were principally associated with major projects that requested an
amendment to their existing zoning. Since the policy adoption, district planning has been completed,
with Town Council’s acceptance of the Townwide Neighborhood District Planning document in 2012.
The accepted district plan represents a refinement of General Plan policies, and articulation in more
detailed form of land use, mobility and urban design goals for individual areas. The district plan helps
to clarify community expectations for development as projects move forward, including those related
to the production of housing. District plans have been incorporated and codified through the Zoning
Code Update and will not create an additional "layer" of review outside of the typical application of
zoning and development standards.

                                                                                                          CHAPTER 3: HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
DESIGN REVIEW
The Town’s Design Guidelines apply to all commercial and multiple-family development and single-
family development within certain master plan areas and/or visually sensitive areas of town. These
Design Guidelines have been written to provide a greater level of detail regarding the design of
development that promotes the Town's Vision Statement, General Plan and Municipal Code. Many of
the above-mentioned development projects are subject to review by staff, Planning and Economic
Development Commission, and/or the Advisory Design Panel (ADP) based on location and the
regulations and guidelines set forth by the Town. As was shown in Table 3-41, the design review
process is part of the overall planning review process. The overall planning process can take
anywhere from 30 days to just over a year, depending on the size and complexity of the project.
On a long-term basis, the Town's raised expectation for project design that has accompanied adoption
of the existing Design Review procedures and the Design Guidelines may have resulted in some
overall increases in the cost to develop in Mammoth Lakes. For example, an articulated or pitched
roof, which is preferred in the Design Guidelines, may be more expensive to design, engineer and
construct than a flat roof. However, the Design Guidelines do not prescribe specific materials or
design but detail a variety of options that the Town prefers. Historically, therefore, staff, the ADP and
Planning and Economic Development Commission has been able to work constructively with
applicants through the design review process to reach mutually acceptable design solutions that do not
typically result in significant increases in construction costs. Typical findings for a design review
approval are that the proposed project would be consistent and harmonious with the design of adjacent
development, that the project would not cause excessive or unsightly grading or tree removal, to
ensure that the design is visually harmonious with surrounding development and natural land forms,
and that the project would maintain and enhance the image, attractiveness, and environmental qualities
of the town.
USE PERMITS
In the various zones, certain uses are permitted subject to the granting of a use permit. Because of
their unusual characteristics, these uses require special consideration so that they may be located
properly with respect to their effects on surrounding properties. In order to achieve this purpose, the
Town of Mammoth Lakes Housing Element Update                                                                                        3-34

                                                                                                                           HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                             CHAPTER 3: HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Planning and Economic Development Commission (Commission) is empowered to grant or deny
applications for use permits and to impose reasonable conditions upon the granting of such permits.
Within 21 days following the closing of the public hearing on a use permit application the
Commission shall act on the application. In approving a use permit, the Commission may impose
specific development conditions relating to the construction (both on- and off-site improvements),
establishment, maintenance, location, and operation of the proposed activity, as it finds are reasonable
and necessary to ensure that the approval will be in compliance with the findings (see below).
Examples of appropriate conditions include but not be limited to buffers, hours of operation,
landscaping and maintenance, lighting, off-site improvements, parking, performance guarantees,
periodic review of the permit with authority to modify or add new conditions based on the results of
the review, property maintenance, signs, specified duration for the permit, surfacing, traffic
circulation, etc.
The Commission shall make the following findings before granting a use permit:
        That the proposed use is consistent with all applicable sections of the General Plan and Title
         17 of the Municipal Code and is consistent with any applicable specific plan or master plan;
        That the proposed use and conditions under which it would be operated or maintained will not
         be detrimental to the public health and safety, nor materially injurious to properties or
         improvements in the vicinity; and
        Other findings as the Commission deems necessary to support approval or denial of the
         proposed use.
Among the uses for which the Town requires a use permit are condominium conversions, single room
occupancy units, group living quarters, assisted living facilities, and large residential care facilities in
multiple-family residential zones. Because the Town has not received any applications for special
needs housing, it is not possible to provide details on typical conditions that may be applied to these
types of projects. However, the Town would treat such projects as uses "similar to and no more
detrimental than" existing permitted uses in any (residential or commercial) zone; i.e. generally
similar to other multiple-family or condominium uses: Typical conditions applied to condominium
projects include:

        "Standard" planning and engineering conditions such as requirements for dedication of public
         access or easements, such as sidewalks and trails, and installation of required infrastructure.
        Conditions related to environmental mitigation (e.g. storm water managements, CEQA-
         required traffic or infrastructure improvements).
        Life safety and health-related conditions including requirements from the Mammoth Lakes
         Fire Protection District for provision of fire access.
        Special planning conditions related to occupancy and operation (for example, whether
         transient use is permitted), and terms of deed-restricted units, if any.
        Special conditions related to site development standards, parking etc.; in most cases, such
         conditions are only applied where an applicant has requested a reduced standard, which
         necessitates detailing the conditions that ensure the reduction will not result in negative
         impacts to neighboring uses.
A discussion of requirements for licensed residential care facilities is provided later in this chapter
under the discussion of "Housing for Persons with Disabilities." To comply with State Law, the
Zoning Code allows residential care facilities (with six or fewer residents) by right in both residential
and commercial zones.
ZONING ADJUSTMENTS AND VARIANCES
Applicants may make requests for minor modifications or adjustments to certain requirements of the
Town’s Zoning Code when such requests constitute a reasonable use of property which is in the best
interest of the Town but not permissible under a strict literal interpretation of the zoning regulations.
These adjustments are permitted under Chapter 17.76 of the Municipal Code, and include a decrease
of the required lot area, width or depth; a decrease of the required front, side, or rear yard setback; a
decrease in the required distance between structures on the same parcel; an increase in allowable
projections into a setback; an increase in the permitted height of a structure, fence or wall; an increase
of the permitted height or area of signs; a decrease in the number of required parking spaces; and, an
increase in the maximum allowable lot coverage. Chapter 17.76 specifies specific degrees for each of
Town of Mammoth Lakes Housing Element Update                                                                                         3-36

                                                                                                                      HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                        CHAPTER 3: HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
the above permitted increases or decreases, with the exception of signs which is covered under Section
17.48.110 and parking which is covered under Chapter 17.44.
In compliance with Chapter 17.124 (Public Hearings), the Planning and Economic Development
Commission conducts a public hearing on an application for a variance. All requests for variances
must meet specific findings prescribed in California Government Code Section 65906 and must be
approved by the Planning and Economic Development Commission.
Variances from the terms of the Town’s zoning requirements shall be granted only when, because of
special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location or
surroundings, the strict application of the Zoning Code deprives such property of the privileges
enjoyed by other property in the vicinity or under identical zoning district; the approval does not
constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the
vicinity or within the same zone; granting the variance would not authorize a use or activity which is
not otherwise expressly authorized by the zone governing the property for which the application is
made and would not be detrimental to public health, safety, or welfare, or injurious to the property or
improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which the property is located; the variance is
consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan and is in compliance with CEQA;
and, is the minimum departure from the requirements of this Zoning Code necessary to grant relief,
consistent with Chapter 17.72 (Variances).
FEES AND EXACTIONS
The Town collects fees and exactions from developments to cover the costs of processing permits
("planning fees") and providing the necessary services and infrastructure related to new development
("development impact fees").
Planning fees are calculated based on the average cost of processing a particular type of application.
Table 3-42 summarizes planning, development, and other fees charged for residential development.
Town policies do allow the waiving of processing fees upon application in special circumstances; the
Town Council has typically waived planning fees for workforce and affordable housing projects.
Impact fees are collected and, where necessary, to provide an adequate level of infrastructure,

The Town also levies fees on new development that are intended to mitigate the impacts of that
development on community services and facilities. Historically, the number and amount of the Town-
imposed Development Impact Fees (DIF) have been large, adding substantially to the cost to develop
in Mammoth Lakes. In 2009, the Town commissioned an independent assessment of the DIF program,
which concluded that fees should be reduced substantially for all categories of development on a
permanent basis. The Town adopted an interim fee policy in November 2009, which reduced DIF by
between 48% and 55% from its previous levels, depending on category. This fee schedule was
adopted in May, 2010, and is substantially similar to the interim fee program. More recently, to help
stimulate the local economy, the Town Council extended a temporary reduction to DIF for one to four
unit residential projects, commercial projects, and remodel projects to July 31, 2014.
Fees are based on an analysis of the cost of future improvements and facilities needed to
accommodate growth and development, and an assessment of the fair share of that cost that should be
borne by new development. The Municipal Code provides that DIF and other fees are to be regularly
reviewed and updated to ensure that they are accurate and fair.
Table 3-43 provides a hypothetical comparison between fees charged per unit to develop an eight unit
single-family development versus an eight unit multiple-family (condominium) development. 23 The
fees charged for multiple-family residential development are less than those charged for single-family
for building permits and plan check, water and sewer connections, and school fees. However, they are
higher for fees associated with a tentative tract map and design review, as well as a housing in-lieu fee
of $23,222 per unit.
The above considerations result in a fee cost per unit that is greater for the 8-unit multiple-family
development than an 8-home single-family development. However, a significant portion of this is
associated with the housing fees that would apply to the multiple-family condominium development.
If the 8-unit multiple-family project were rental units, rather than condominiums, neither the
affordable housing “in lieu” fee, nor the costs to process a tentative tract map would be incurred,
which would reduce the total fee amount from a little over $53,000 per unit to about $30,000 per unit.
23
   This comparison is hypothetical only to provide a "per unit" comparison between single family and multiple-family development.
   In practice, few opportunities exist in Mammoth Lakes to develop eight single-family lots as a single project.

It should also be noted that without the temporary reduction in development fees for 1-4 residential
development, the project fee for a single family unit would be approximately $40,000. As noted
elsewhere in this chapter, recent revisions to the Development Impact Fee and Housing Mitigation Fee
program have resulted in significant reductions in fees over previous levels, particularly for smaller
residential projects.
BUILDING CODES AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT
The Town has adopted and enforces the Uniform Building Code. This ensures that all housing units
are built to specific standards. The building code is developed by the International Conference of
Building Officials and the State. The Town updates its Code according to Conference updates with
some minor amendments to reflect local conditions, including seismic activity, wind, and snow loads.
Some of these local amendments may result in additional construction costs, since they require
additional engineering and structural elements to ensure that buildings will withstand heavy snow
loads and other stresses.
The Building Division of the Community and Economic Development Department enforces building
codes at the time of construction. Compliance actions after construction are addressed by the
appropriate Town staff typically on a complaint basis. The identification and response to code
violations is a cooperative effort within the community. Residents and visitors play an important role
helping to identify a wide range of possible code violations such as illegal dumping or spillage of
garbage and debris.
HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Review for Reasonable Accommodation Procedure
It is the policy of the Town of Mammoth Lakes to provide reasonable accommodation for persons
with disabilities seeking fair access to housing in the application of its zoning and building
regulations.
Any disabled person who requires reasonable accommodation in the application of a zoning or
building regulation that may be acting as a barrier to fair housing opportunities may do so on a form
provided by the Community and Economic Development Department. The applicant is required to

                                                                                                           CHAPTER 3: HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
provide the information identifying the individual’s disability under the Fair Housing Act and why the
accommodation is necessary to make the specific housing available to the individual. No fee is
required for a reasonable accommodation request. After the application is deemed complete, the
Director shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the reasonable accommodation request based
on the findings in Section 17.80.040 of the Municipal Code.
The Town of Mammoth Lakes makes information about requesting reasonable accommodation with
respect to zoning, permit processing, or building laws readily available at the Town Community and
Economic Development Department Office and accommodation is discussed as an option during pre-
application consultations in appropriate situations. In an effort to remove constraints on providing
housing for persons with disabilities, the Town has adopted reasonable accommodation regulations to
allow zoning and building flexibility as needed on a case-by-case basis to facilitate retrofitting to meet
accessibility requirements. As the Town of Mammoth Lakes does not have any special permitting
requirements for residential care facilities of six or fewer residents, the approval process is similar to
that of a primary permitted use. Please see the discussion of "Licensed Residential Care and Assisted
Living Facilities" below for additional information on this topic.
Review Zoning and Land Use Policies and Practices
The Town periodically reviews its zoning laws, policies, and practices to ensure compliance with fair
housing law. The Zoning Code states that handicapped parking spaces shall be provided on site in
compliance with California Building Code Standards. Parking spaces required for the disabled count
toward compliance with the number of parking spaces required in Chapter 17.44 (Parking and
Loading Standards). The Town does not have special residential parking standards for persons with all
disabilities, but the Town Code does allow for the reduction of parking requirements for special needs
housing if a project proponent demonstrates the need for a reduction in parking, per the Town's
reasonable accommodation provisions.
Neither the Land Use Element of the General Plan nor the Municipal Code impose special
requirements for the siting of special needs housing, and thus minimum distances between two or
more special housing needs developments are not required. However, setbacks and separations are
applied according to zone and would apply to special needs housing development in accordance with
the zone in which it is developed.

The Town Municipal Code does not currently have occupancy standards that apply specifically to
unrelated adults and not to families.
Licensed Residential Care and Assisted Living Facilities
The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Sections 5115 and 5116) of the California
Welfare and Institutions Code declares that mentally and physically disabled persons are entitled to
live in normal residential surroundings. This classification includes facilities that are licensed by the
State of California to provide permanent living accommodations and 24 hour primarily non-medical
care and supervision for persons in need of personal services, supervision, protection, or assistance for
sustaining the activities of daily living. It includes hospices, nursing homes, convalescent facilities,
and group homes for minors, persons with disabilities, and people in recovery from alcohol or drug
addictions. The use of property as a licensed residential care facility for the care of six or fewer
persons is considered a residential use that is permitted in all residential zones. No local agency can
impose stricter zoning or building and safety standards on these homes than otherwise require for
homes in the same district. The Town has never received an application for this type of project. To
comply with California law, the Town’s Zoning Code permits licensed residential care facilities
serving six or fewer residents by right in zones that permit single-family and multi-family residences.
Residential facilities with six or more residents are allowed with a use permit in the multiple-family
residential zones and with an administrative permit in the OMR and MLR commercial zone districts.
Assisted living facilities are a housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the residents, or the
resident’s guardians, conservators, or other responsible persons where 75 percent of the residents are
at least 62 years of age, or if younger, have needs compatible with other residents; and where varying
levels of care and supervision are provided, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined
necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal. Assisted living facilities may include kitchenettes within
individual rooms. Assisted living facilities are permitted in both the OMR and MLR commercial zone
districts. Convalescent homes, provide a higher level of care with 24-hour medical, convalescent or
chronic care to individuals who, by reason of advanced age, chronic illness or infirmity, are unable to
care for themselves, are allowed with a use permit in the OMR commercial zone district.

Evaluation of the Permit and Processing Procedures
The Town of Mammoth Lakes does not have substantive barriers within its planning, zoning, and
building permit processing procedures that effect the development of facilities for persons with
disabilities.
The Town processes requests to retrofit homes for accessibility through a standard building permit.
Reasonable accommodation is granted for requests that may require an accommodation of the zoning
or building code for the retrofit project.
The Town does not have any special conditions or use restrictions for residential care facilities with
six or fewer residents. This allows for the conversion of an existing residence to a residential care
facility without any special permits or approvals, other than a building permit which could be required
for retrofit construction. If a residential care facility is in a zone where it is a permitted use that does
not require Commission approval, public input is not sought. Residential care facilities that provide
on-site services are treated the same as any other residential development so there are no special
zoning or building permits required. Permits that may be required by the State or the Department of
Health and Human Services are the responsibility of the residential care facility owner/operator, and
not an issue of planning and zoning.
Review of Building Codes
The Town of Mammoth Lakes adopted the Uniform Building Code most recently in 2013 and
continues to update its Code according to the International Conference of Building Officials and the
State updates. Although the Town of Mammoth has amended its Municipal Code to reflect local
conditions, including seismic activity, snow loads, wind design, and cold weather construction, it has
not made any amendments to the California Building Code (CBC) and the International Building
Code (IBC) that would diminish the ability to accommodate persons with disabilities.
The Town’s Reasonable Accommodations ordinance does provide for accommodation for persons
with disabilities in the enforcement of building codes and issuance of building permits. The process
for requesting reasonable accommodation in the enforcement of building codes and issuance of
permits is the same as it is for zoning, as mentioned above. In making a determination regarding the
reasonableness of a requested accommodation, the following factors are considered:

        Special need created by the disability;
        Potential benefit that can be accomplished by the requested modification;
        Potential impact on surrounding uses;
        Physical attributes of the property and structures;
        Alternative accommodations that may provide an equivalent level of benefit;
        In the case of a determination involving a one-family dwelling, whether the household would
         be considered a single housekeeping unit if it were not using special services that are required
         because of the disabilities of the residents;
        Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative
         burden on the town; and
        Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature
         of a program.
ON/OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS
Public improvements for new residential developments are integral to the planning and development
process. Developers are required to provide public improvements to ensure the health, welfare and
safety of the community and future residents of new developments. Minimum improvement standards
are applied to ensure that new public improvements are adequate to serve new development. While the
cost of providing public improvements, as well as specific construction standards and details
regarding how they are built, may influence the cost of housing, they are a necessary component of
providing quality and sustainable residential development.
Currently, the Sidewalk Master Plan and the Storm Drain Master Plan mandate on/off site
improvements within the Town of Mammoth Lakes.
Street standards outlined in Section 17.16.260 of the subdivision regulations requires that the width of
the right-of-way for an arterial or collector street or highway shall be a minimum of 80 feet, and the
width of the local street shall be a minimum of 60 feet, with a minimum of 30 feet of pavement as
determined by the Public Works Director. The Public Works Director may approve modifications

including: a minimum dedicated right-of-way width of 40 feet, a minimum of 24 feet of paving, a
minimum of 20 feet of snow storage easement, with 10 feet on each side of the street, within RR, RSF,
and R zones.
Curb and gutter requirements are outlined in the Town of Mammoth Lakes Sidewalk Master Plan,
Storm Drain Master Plan, and the Street Standards detailed above.
Sidewalk requirements are detailed in the Sidewalk Master Plan, Trail System Master Plan, and other
environmental and development mitigation documents.
Storm drainage requirements are outlined in the Master Storm Drain Plan, and when determined
necessary due to the intensity and/or type of proposed development.
Sewer and water infrastructure development requirements are determined on a site-by-site basis as
determined necessary to serve the needs of the project or as otherwise required by the Mammoth
Community Water District.
Review of any project and improvements required will also be based upon applicable master or
specific plans, environmental documentation, Caltrans and other agency review, district planning, and
other adopted policies.
The Town is fully served with water and sewer infrastructure. The Mammoth Community Water
District (MCWD) adopted an Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) in 2010 and is due to
complete an update to this document in 2015. According to the UWMP, under current conditions
(2010), MCWD has adequate water supply to meet community needs under the full range of water
year types, including both the severe one year and sustained multi-year droughts. This is primarily due
to the availability of local groundwater resources, which provide 40% of supply under average
conditions, nearly 90% of the supply in a severe one year drought, and 60% of the supply over a three
year sustained drought. In 2013, the MCWD settled a dispute with Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power that limits the amount of water MCWD can use to 4,387 acre-feet annually. This amount is
consistent with expected build-out in the UWMP and the Town’s General Plan. The 4,387 acre-feet
includes delivered potable water, process water, recycled water, and other non-revenue water uses.
Furthermore, MCWD grants priority to proposed development that includes housing affordable to
lower-income households consistent with Senate Bill 1087.

MCWD also identified some deficiencies in sewer capacity during its 2005 connection fee study and
several improvements/upgrades needed to the system including a new sewer trunk line along Meridian
Boulevard from Old Mammoth Road to the treatment plant; increase in sewer line capacity along
Center Street for Manzanita Road to Main Street; and a new relief sewer through the Shady Rest site.
Collection of connection fees from future development would fund these improvements and ensure
that they would not prove to be a constraint to future development.
There is adequate capacity in existing wastewater treatment and solid waste disposal facilities to
accommodate future housing development.

4 HOUSING RESOURCES
4.1        REGIONAL GROWTH NEEDS 2014-2019
In accordance with Government Code Section 65584.06, the Department of Housing and Community
Development prepared a Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) Plan to determine the projected
housing needs for Mono County and the Town of Mammoth Lakes (Town). As seen in Table 4-44, the
Town's share of the entire County RHNA is 62 percent; this allocation is based on demographic
projections developed by HCD.

The Plan allocates the projected Countywide housing need between the unincorporated County and
the Town across the various income categories, based on demographic data and a “fair share” policy
adjustment. The RHNA plan covers the 5 ½ year planning period of January 1, 2014 through
June 30, 2019. No new units have been constructed since the beginning of the planning period of
January 1, 2014.

4.2        AVAILABLE LAND TO ACCOMMODATE HOUSING
As part of the Housing Element Update process, Town staff inventoried all lands within Mammoth
Lake’s Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) suitable for future residential development. As discussed in
Section 4.3, expansion of the UGB is not anticipated to be necessary to accommodate the RHNA.
State law requires that the community provide an adequate number of sites to allow for and facilitate
production of the Town’s regional share of housing. To determine whether the Town has adequate
sites to accommodate its share of regional housing needs for all income groups, the Town must first
identify “adequate sites.” Under State law, (California Government Code section 65583(c)(1)),
adequate sites are those with appropriate development standards and with services and infrastructure
needed to facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of housing for all income levels.
The State suggests a two-part analysis to determine if a locality’s sites are adequate:
     a) Analysis of the realistic development capacity of suitable land, that is or will be served by
          infrastructure, to produce Mammoth Lake’s total new construction need for each income
          group over the next five years.
     b) Analysis of relevant zoning standards for a variety of housing types, including single-family,
          multifamily, and mobile homes, and at appropriate densities to meet the Town’s regional
          housing need by income category, including very low and low-income households.
The residential sites identified and discussed in this chapter meet the criteria above, and are within the
definition of adequate sites as provided by State law. As discussed in greater detail below, all of the
sites have, or will have access to public facilities over the next five years.
4.3        LAND INVENTORY
The Town of Mammoth Lakes encompasses approximately 24 square miles, with the majority of that
area comprising public lands administered by Inyo National Forest. Only about 4 square miles,
defined by the Town’s Urban Growth Boundary (UGB), is under private ownership, and therefore
developable. The Town does not anticipate that the UGB will be modified or expanded in the
foreseeable future.
Two major components make up the Town’s inventory of suitable sites.

     1) Resort designated and Master Planned areas that include land allocated for affordable
         housing, approved housing projects, sites entitled for or otherwise committed to residential
         development, including affordable housing, and larger (>0.5 acre) vacant and underutilized
         sites in the Residential Multi-Family zone. Many of these are sites that will be required to
         provide housing as a result of the Town’s inclusionary housing requirements, or are subject to
         the Affordable Housing Overlay zoning.
     2) Other vacant land that is currently zoned for residential uses, as well as underutilized
         properties that are not developed to their full zoning capacity.
RESORT DEVELOPMENT, MASTER PLANNED AREAS AND OTHER APPROVED PROJECTS
A number of sites within the Town of Mammoth Lakes have approved development plans that would
include a range of housing types, including affordable housing. These include projects that are within
approved Master Plans and Specific Plan areas, which are subject to an approved use permit, and/or
which are otherwise committed to providing additional affordable housing units. The locations of
these projects are shown in Figure 4-1, and the projects are summarized in Tables 4-45 and 4-46.
Table 4-45 summarizes the reasonable estimate of each site's ability to accommodate a share of the
regional housing need during the Housing Element Planning Period; Table 4-46 includes additional
detail of the anticipated affordability levels of those units, based on actual approvals or on the Town's
inclusionary housing requirement. It should be noted that several of the projects include a combination
of lodging and residential units; in those cases, only the residential units are summarized in Table 4-
46.
Each of the sites is described below. The discussion for each site includes an analysis of the realistic
and viable development opportunities offered by each site, based on zoning and infrastructure
conditions, as well as the status and timing of needed development approvals. Please also refer to
Chapter 3, which provides a detailed discussion of applicable zoning and development standards, and
their ability to facilitate or constrain the production of housing. As noted in that chapter, the Town's
zoning densities and development requirements were found to be appropriate and not to unduly
constrain residential development for any given sector of the population, including low- and very-low
income residents.

1. Holiday Haus
The Holiday Haus project is located on Main Street in the Mixed Lodging/Residential (MLR) Zone,
which permits both residential and commercial uses. A use permit for the Holiday Haus project was
approved in October 2008, and an extension was granted until October 22, 2016. A State automatic
extension (AB 116) further extended the Holiday Haus approvals to October 22, 2018. The project
includes a 120-room condominium hotel, and in conformance with the Town’s on-site affordable
housing mitigation requirements, 14 moderate-income affordable housing units, including one unit
reserved for the hotel manager. The project was awarded a State housing density bonus to allow for
the 14 affordable housing units to be included on-site. The site currently houses an existing hotel, and
utilities and infrastructure are therefore fully available for a future development. Construction costs
for the affordable housing units would be borne by the project developer; as permitted by the 2009
interim fee and housing policies, the affordable units would not be subject to Development Impact or
Housing Mitigation fees, thus reducing their cost. Affordability of the units would be assured through
deed restriction; which would be developed prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the
units. It is anticipated that, similar to past projects, a minimum 55-year deed restriction would be
applied.
2. Shady Rest Master Plan
The Shady Rest Master Plan was approved in 1991, and allows for up to 172 units of housing on the
approximately 25-acre site, with those units to include 120 units of very-low and low-income, and 52
units of moderate income housing. The site is also zoned RMF-1, with an Affordable Housing (AH)
overlay that requires the site to be developed with very-low, low- or moderate income housing. The
site was obtained from the US Forest Service as part of a land exchange. The land exchange, and
preparation of the 1991 Master Plan were treated as mitigation for the affordable housing demand of
the Trails Subdivision. Without amendment of both the Municipal Code and the Master Plan, any
development on this site would have to include this prescribed number of affordable housing units.
The relatively low number of units assigned to this large parcel (an effective density of 6.88
units/acre) is reflective of some of the environmental and other constraints associated with this site,
including somewhat limited site access, the presence of a wetland area (approximately 7 acres), and its
Town of Mammoth Lakes Housing Element Update                                                                                       4-7

                                                                                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                          CHAPTER 4: HOUSING RESOURCES
currently forested character, which the Town and community have an interest in retaining to a
reasonable extent. At the same time, it reflects a realistic and conservative assessment of total
development capacity.
The Town was in discussions with the current property owner in 2007 and 2008 regarding an
application to update the existing Master Plan and to increase the number of allowed units on site.
Although this application is withdrawn, due to the economic downturn, there is a continuing active
interest in developing the site as a workforce-housing neighborhood. Since the creation of the Master
Plan, the community has reaffirmed its support to see this site developed as anticipated in the plan,
including the defeat of a 1996 voter initiative to modify the existing Master Plan.
The site is presently undeveloped, however, as an infill site, surrounded by existing development,
extension of infrastructure on to the site would not be a significant constraint to its development, and
extension of water, sewer and storm-drain infrastructure is contemplated in Town and Mammoth
Community Water District infrastructure plans. Since the site is subject to a Master Plan and to the
AH overlay, it would require a formal action of the Town to alter its zoning. Although unlikely to
occur, any re-zoning would likely be to restore the property to its underlying RMF-1 zoning, which
would continue to allow multi-family residential development at up to 12 units per acre. This would
allow for a minimum of 300 housing units, which exceeds the 172 currently allocated in the Master
Plan.
In order for development of the Shady Rest Site to move forward, the Town will require the 1991
Master Plan to be updated to reflect the General Plan and new planning considerations that have arisen
since adoption of the Master Plan. Although the Town has no control over when the site's owner may
choose to proceed with the site's development, it recognizes the substantial opportunity presented by
the site and expects to work closely with the property owner to facilitate the Master Plan update. The
Town of Mammoth Lakes Downtown Neighborhood District Plan Report (DNDP) was completed in
June, 2010 and accepted by the Town Council on September 1, 2010. The DNDP describes the major
planning concepts for Shady Rest and identifies it as a livable workforce neighborhood. The DNDP
also provides a development concept and a series of images showing the types of housing and open
space that might be included on the site and will act as the basis and facilitate the Master Plan update.
The Town's typical process would allow for the Master Plan update to be complete within 18 months
of its initiation. It is expected that, in establishing zoning requirements for the property, the Master

                                                                                                                     HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                        CHAPTER 4: HOUSING RESOURCES
Plan would provide for streamlined and simplified review of future projects that conform to its
requirements. To support this, the Housing Element includes a policy for the Town to work with the
applicant to incorporate development standards, policies and procedures that will create a balanced
mix of housing types and range of affordability for the local workforce; can create a livable workforce
neighborhood; and streamline the approval process for subsequent projects brought forward under the
Master Plan.
Because of the need for the Master Plan to be updated, it is probable that the entire 172 units allowed
on this site would not be constructed during the Housing Element period. Therefore, Tables 4-45 and
4-46 conservatively assume that only about one-third of the units would be constructed by 2019,
including a mix of very low, low and moderate income units.
Since no specific development proposal has been brought forward for this site, details of how
construction of the units would be funded are yet to be determined. Given the affordability levels
required by the existing Master Plan, it is likely that some form of partnership would be necessary to
facilitate the construction of at least a portion of the units. The Town would be supportive of such a
partnership, potentially with cooperation from Mammoth Lakes Housing Inc., to develop this site as
intended.
3. Clearwater Specific Plan/Old Mammoth Place
The Town adopted a Specific Plan for the 6.09 acre Clearwater site, located along Old Mammoth
Road, in January 2009. The site currently houses a 156-room motel and two restaurants. The Specific
Plan allows for the construction of a more intensive mixed-use project than the existing on-site
development, that includes a hotel, ground level commercial space, and which requires that all of the
project's workforce housing demand be accommodated on site. The Specific Plan allows that the on-
site workforce housing would be exempt from the density calculation for the site. Following adoption
of the Specific Plan, tentative tract map and use permit applications for the Old Mammoth Place
project were approved in March 2010, with an extension granted until April 21, 2018. Demolition,
grading and building permits would be required prior to construction, which may take two to three
months to complete for a project of this size and complexity. As a redevelopment site, the Specific

proposed development intensity on this site; the Specific Plan also includes modified development
standards for height, setbacks and lot coverage that would permit the proposed density on the site to
be achieved. The Use Permit applies these standards to the proposed Old Mammoth Place project.
Consistent with the Specific Plan, the Old Mammoth Place project includes a proposed eight units of
workforce housing that would be built in conjunction with the project. The Town's housing mitigation
policy requires that these units be targeted at income levels of 120% AMI or less; therefore half of the
units are assumed to be low-income and half for moderate income households.
The property is within the North Old Mammoth Road district, which the General Plan and the North
Old Mammoth Road District Study cite as an opportunity area for focused redevelopment as
Mammoth's "town center", incorporating exactly the type of higher intensity infill and redevelopment
as anticipated in the Specific Plan and included in the Old Mammoth Place entitlements.
Affordability of the units would be assured through deed restriction; which would be developed prior
to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the units. It is anticipated that, similar to past projects, a
minimum 55-year deed restriction would be applied.
4. MMSA Arrowhead Road Site
Mammoth Mountain Ski Area (MMSA) owns this 1.24 acre site, which is included in its current land
inventory as a site for a future employee housing project. As remaining MMSA properties build out
over the next 5 to 7 years, housing mitigation will be required; this is likely to include development of
the Arrowhead Road site. Given the location of this site, the profile of other properties owned by
MMSA, and the fact that it adjoins a similar MMSA-owned employee housing project, it is highly
unlikely that MMSA will elect to develop this site with anything other than employee housing units.
An estimated 15 units have been assigned to this site, based on the maximum zoning density in the
RMF-2 zone of 12 units per acre. The units are projected to be in the extremely low, and very low -
income categories, based on the typical wages for MMSA's seasonal workforce and current rental
rates for existing MMSA employee housing units, which range from $400 to $650 per person per
month.24 Historically, and with similar projects developed by MMSA, including both dormitory-style

and more traditional apartment-style developments, this maximum density has proven to be
achievable. The site is surrounded by existing development and therefore has access to utilities and
infrastructure. Since, as seasonal employee housing the units would be rental apartments or rooms, the
Town would only require a design review of a future project. A stand-alone design review requires a
Planning and Economic Development Commission approval, and typically takes three to five months
to complete.
Affordability of the units would be assured through deed restriction; which would be developed prior
to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the units. It is anticipated that, similar to past projects, a
minimum 55-year deed restriction would be applied.
5. Lodestar Housing Site
The Lodestar Housing site is located within the Lodestar Master Plan area, also zoned Resort. This
site is north of the Tallus project and south of the San Joaquin Villas housing project, and located in
Area 2 of the Lodestar Master Plan. The Resort Zone permits residential uses, including workforce
housing, consistent with the adopted Master Plan. The Lodestar Master Plan allows a variety of
residential uses, including affordable housing, throughout the Master Plan area. The South Districts
Neighborhood District Plan, which was accepted by Town Council in 2011, describes the vision for
the Lodestar Master Plan area (Sierra Star). It recommends workforce housing on the Lodestar
Housing site. San Joaquin Villas located within the Master Plan Area, immediately to the north of the
site was successfully developed with 40 units of affordable and workforce housing in 2007/8, at a
density of approximately 18 units per acre. Therefore, the development of this site with affordable
housing is consistent with both the zoning and Master Plan designations for this site.
Some development constraints, including the presence of a golf flyway easement, do limit the
maximum developable area of the site, as do Town development standards for lot coverage, height,
setbacks and snow storage requirements. Thirty units of housing are projected for this 3.6 acre site (an
effective density of 8.3 units per acre) and represent a realistic and conservative estimate of the total
potential units that the site could yield. It takes into account the above constraints, although more may
ultimately be possible. The site is proximate to other development and to water, sewer and other
infrastructure, and extending utilities on to this site would not be a constraint to development. Based

on similar recent projects, 10 of the 30 units are projected to be for extremely low and very low-
income households, 10 for low-income households and 10 for moderate-income households.
Depending on whether the proposed units were rental apartments or for-sale units, the Town may
require a Use Permit to be approved, or simply a Design Review permit. A Use Permit would typically
take four to eight months to complete; a design review takes approximately three months to five
months to complete. Following the design review or use permit process, grading and building permit
submittals would be required, which may take two to three months for approval, assuming that more
than one round of plan check comments would be needed.
Affordability of the units would be assured through deed restriction; which would be developed prior
to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the units. It is anticipated that, similar to past projects, a
minimum 55-year deed restriction would be applied.
6. Snowcreek Master Plan
The Snowcreek Master Plan update was approved in July 2009. The Master Plan site is also zoned
Resort, which permits a range of lodging and residential uses. The update includes a total of 790
residential units, of which a proportion is specified to be dedicated to workforce housing to meet the
Town's workforce housing mitigation requirements. A Use Permit, Administrative Permit, and/or
Design Review Permit would be required for each phase of the project's development, with an
estimated processing time of three to eight months, based on the complexity of this project. The
Snowcreek Development Agreement was approved by the Town Council in June, 2010. The
Development Agreement included 47 on-site affordable housing units that will be dispersed
throughout the project, and it is anticipated that half of these units will be sold at 175% of the AMI
and the other half of the units will be sold at 200% of the AMI.
Although the site is currently undeveloped, the project EIR and Master Plan identified no constraints
to development of the site in terms of extending infrastructure or services. The Master Plan includes
preliminary infrastructure plans that demonstrate the feasibility of providing utility services. The
Mammoth Community Water District has indicated its ability to serve the entire project with water,
including the affordable housing units.

7. Ettinger Project
The Ettinger project is a 10 unit town-home project, located on Old Mammoth Road, for which a Use
Permit and Tract Map were approved in October 2007, with an extension granted until October 24,
2016. The site is zoned Residential Multi Family 1 (RMF-1), which permits a maximum density of 12
units per acre and is intended for non-transient residential development. Ten units have been approved
in the Use Permit for this 1.09-acre site. In its findings to approve the project the Planning and
Economic Development Commission concluded that there was adequate infrastructure available and
the site was able to accommodate the proposed number of units. All of the units would be for-sale at
market rate (i.e. in the above-moderate category), with no deed restriction. A grading and construction
permit would be needed prior to construction, which may take two to three months to complete. Since
the Use Permit and Map continues to be valid, it is reasonable to assume that the project would be
built in the Housing Element period.
8. Tihana Townhomes
The Tihana Townhomes project had a Use Permit and Tract Map approved in January 2008, with an
extension granted until January 23, 2017. The project is approved to construct 9 town-home
condominium units on a 0.53-acre site on Old Mammoth Road. The site is zoned Residential Multi
Family 1 (RMF-1), which permits a maximum density of 12 units per acre and is intended for non-
transient residential development. The nine units were approved based on a previous Zoning Code
provision that allowed small residential units under 850 square feet to be counted as one half unit of
density. In the use permit approval, adequate infrastructure was found to be available and that the site
was able to accommodate the proposed number of units. All of the units would be for-sale at market
rate (i.e. in the above-moderate category), with no deed restriction. A grading and construction permit
would be needed prior to construction, which may take two to three months to complete. Since the
Use Permit and Map continues to be valid, it is reasonable to assume that the project would be built in
the Housing Element period.

9. Saraf Apartments
The Saraf Apartments are a six-unit rental project located on Manzanita Road, for which the Planning
and Economic Development Commission approved a Design Review in 2008, with an extension
granted until October 10, 2015. The site is zoned RMF-1, which permits non-transient residential uses
at a maximum density of 12 units per acre. The six units approved for the site is consistent with the
zoned density allowed for the half-acre site. There are currently two units on the site, so the project
would result in the net addition of four housing units. As a rental project, only a design review
approval was required; demolition, grading and building permits will be required to develop the
project. Findings for the design review approval included that the site could accommodate the
proposed development and that adequate infrastructure exists.
10. Hill Duplex
The Hill Duplex project includes two units located on a .23 acre RMF-1 site on Lupin Street.
Administrative Design Review 12-005 for a new duplex was approved in November 2012 and the
building permit plan check for this project is underway.
11. Other Large Residential-Zoned Properties
In addition to the ten sites listed above, staff performed an analysis of other suitable sites within the
Residential Multiple 1 (RMF-1 Zone). The RMF-1 allows for higher density residential development
at up to 12 dwelling units per acre, but does not permit transient or nightly rental, thus making it more
likely that units developed within this zone will be available to meet the housing needs of local
residents, rather than nightly visitors or second homeowners. The analysis considered properties that
were either vacant or included only a single-family residence. As evidenced in the Saraf site listed
above and for a number of other projects, it is reasonable to assume that such sites will redevelop
more intensively in the future.
The inventory of sites is shown in Table 4-47, below. The maximum permitted density in the RMF-1
zone is 12 units per acre, and this density has been shown to be realistic and achievable based on
similar multifamily projects in this zone. Table 3-38 in Chapter 3 includes a summary of existing
residential density, showing that the average density of multi-family projects in the RMF-1 zone is 9.2
units per acre. Furthermore, a number of affordable housing projects have been built within this zone

in the past decade, including three MMSA employee housing developments and Mammoth Lakes
Housing Inc.’s Jeffreys apartment complex, showing that this zone is capable of accommodating
housing affordable to lower-income households. Nonetheless, in order to reflect a realistic
development capacity, the analysis incorporates a more conservative assumption that the sites will
develop at 75% of their maximum density (i.e. at an average of nine units per acre), which allows that
some site constraints may limit the ability of all properties to develop at their maximum density.
All of the sites are infill sites within an established residential neighborhood, are served by
infrastructure that would allow for their development or intensification. As shown in the Table above,
based on these conservative assumptions, large vacant and underutilized sites have the potential to
yield an additional 48 housing units during the Housing Element period.
While many of these projects would be for-sale condominiums, a certain proportion is likely to be
developed as rental housing. As discussed in Chapter 2, some rental units are affordable to low-
income and most to moderate-income and above households. Therefore, Table 4-46 assigns 24 of the
projected 48 units to the moderate-income category and 24 to the above-moderate income category.

OTHER VACANT LAND ZONED FOR HOUSING
The Town defines four exclusively residential zones within its limits, and three other zones that allow
for mixed resort, commercial and/or housing uses. Applicable development standards for these zones
are outlined in Chapter 3, above.
The Residential Single Family (RSF) and Rural Residential (RR) Zones are intended for single-family
residential development on large lots with a density range of 1-2 and 1-4 units per acre, respectively.
Two higher density residential zones, Residential Multiple Family 1 (RMF-1) and Residential Multiple
Family 2 (RMF-2) allow for densities of up to twelve units per acre. The potential yield of units from
large sites within the RMF-1 zone is described in more detail in the sites inventory above. The Town
also has two sites zoned Mobile Home Park (MHP), which include existing mobile home developments.
In addition, all three of the Town’s Commercial Zones (Downtown District, Old Mammoth Road
District, and the Mixed Lodging/Residential District) permit multi-family residential uses, at up to 12
units per acre. Conservatively, the analysis in this section does not assume that any residential uses
will be developed in the Commercial Zones, although in practice they may, particularly in the form of
mixed-use projects. As noted above, several areas within the Town are zoned Resort (R) and two are
zoned Specific Plan (SP). Although oriented towards recreation oriented and visitor-serving uses such
as ski base lodge and golf-course facilities, lodging, and commercial development, residential uses
including condominiums and single-family residential developments are also permitted. Because the
Town's Housing Ordinance calls for projects to provide on-site housing mitigation, several of the
adopted Master Plans include requirements for on-site affordable housing units.
Figure 4-2 shows vacant parcels in the town’s Urban Growth Boundary that are zoned for residential
development; these include a number of parcels within designated Master Plan and Specific Plan
Areas, some which have approved entitlements associated with them; this is also the case for several
of the vacant properties shown in other zones.
The inventory of vacant land is summarized in Table 4-48, and includes an estimate of the total
number of residential units that might result from development of those sites. To avoid double
counting, none of the units counted in the inventory of "Resort Development, Master Planned Areas
and Other Approved Projects" above, are included in Table 4-48. In the case of the residential zones,
adjustments have been made to provide as realistic an assessment of development capacity as possible.

In particular, it is assumed that not 100 percent of vacant sites will develop, nor that those sites will
develop at their maximum density (see footnotes in Table 4-48 for specific assumptions applied).
These assumptions derive from a detailed study of vacant land capacity completed by the Town in
2009 and updated to reflect 2014 conditions, used to develop a more refined buildout model to be used
for estimates of future population. The inventory also excludes residentially zoned land that is not
available for development, such as Town-owned property that has been identified as open space areas,
condominium common areas, and properties subject to conservation easements.
As shown in Table 4-49, based on these conservative assumptions, there is the potential for up to 983
additional residential units. Conservatively, the table shows all of these units as falling into the above-
moderate category. However, the Interim Housing Policy incorporates an inclusionary set-aside of
10 percent of all market rate units as workforce housing units, limited to an affordability level no
greater than 120% AMI. Therefore, it may be reasonable to expect a portion of these residential units
to be dedicated for workforce housing. Assuming that approximately 25 percent of projects will
comply with the inclusionary requirement by building units on-site, an additional 25 affordable
housing units might be produced, in the extremely low, very low, low and moderate income
categories.25
SUMMARY
As described in the above sections, and summarized in Table 4-49, the Town of Mammoth Lakes has
a sufficient inventory of suitable sites to accommodate the remaining 74 units within the Regional
Housing Needs Allocation that remain to be built over the Housing Element period. Based on the
inventory of sites that are committed to development of affordable and workforce housing units,
entitled projects with approved use permits, and capacity of large vacant and underutilized parcels in
the RMF-1 zone, the Town can meet its fair share of the regional housing need in the extremely-low,
very-low, low, moderate and above-moderate income categories.
25
   This estimate is based on the fact that the Housing Policy exempts certain residential project types from the inclusionary
   requirement, and the likelihood that a proportion of projects will satisfy their mitigation requirements through payment of in-lieu
   fees.

  Includes remaining unbuilt units within Master Plan Areas. The Snowcreek Master Plan is also zoned Resort, but is included among the estimated development amounts in
Table 4-45 and 4-46 so is not included here.
3
  The North Village Specific Plan has an estimated remaining development capacity of 1,594 “rooms” (equivalent to approximately 797 residential units). Of these, 633 rooms
are existing or entitled lodging rooms. The majority of the remaining properties expected to be developed as hotel or lodging uses; only an estimated 10 percent are assumed in
this table to develop as residential uses (condominiums or rental housing).
4
  Estimate of total residential potential assumes that half of available sites will develop with residential, rather than lodging, uses and that those parcels will develop at an
average density of 9 units per acre (75% of maximum density) due to potential physical development constraints. Total excludes 15 units for Arrowhead Road site shown in
Table 4-45 and 4-46.
Other suitable sites planned for and dedicated to residential uses, including approved Master Plan
areas, properties with existing use permits, and vacant residentially-zoned parcels, can easily
accommodate the allocated number of above-moderate and market rate units. As discussed above, the
Town's recently adopted interim housing policy would require at least a portion of these to be deed
restricted below-market rate, thus contributing to the potential affordable housing supply.

In recent years, Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. (MLH) has proved successful in developing units to
meet the needs of lower-income households, principally by constructing new housing units. Recently,
MLH received grant funding to rehabilitate a triplex with an illegal fourth unit located on Old
Mammoth Road, making the fourth unit legal, and make it available as affordable housing. This
Housing Element includes policies and programs that support the on-going work of MLH and others
to develop affordable housing opportunities, through allocation of substantial funding, and imposition
of housing in-lieu fees intended to fund affordable housing programs and projects, including those
aimed at extremely low income (ELI) households. Furthermore, this Housing Element includes a
number of policies and programs aimed at providing housing for ELI households, including housing
types such as mobile homes, supportive and transitional housing, seasonal employee housing
(dormitory and SROs) and other groups that are most likely to fall within the ELI category. Programs
also include changes to the Zoning Code that remove regulatory barriers to the production of second
units, emergency shelter and transitional and supportive housing, and which allow for development
concessions that support infill and mixed-use housing.

4.4       FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
A number of different resources are available to landowners and developers seeking to provide
housing in the Town of Mammoth Lakes, with certain of those resources targeted towards the
provision of affordable and workforce housing. This section describes those various resources,
including local non-profit agencies and State or federal programs.
LOCAL RESOURCES
The most important local financial resources available for housing are those associated with the
Town's Housing Ordinance, which requires projects to mitigate their workforce housing demand
through direct provision of workforce housing units, or payment of in-lieu fees, and the Town’s
allocation of a proportion of Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) revenues to housing. It should be noted
that none of the projects listed in Table 4-45 are assumed to rely upon allocation of TOT or in-lieu
housing fees to construct the affordable housing units that are shown, since (with the exception of
Shady Rest), all are required mitigation units that would be built by their respective developer without
input of Town or other non-private financial resources.
Affordable Housing Mitigation Ordinance and In-Lieu Fees
The Town updated the existing Housing Ordinance (Municipal Code 17.136) in 2015. This update
complies with legal mandates (the "Palmer and Patterson" cases) regarding inclusionary housing
programs. The updated Housing Ordinance is included as Appendix C.
The Town requires new development to mitigate a share of its workforce housing demand through
payment of in-lieu fees that support workforce housing programs, provision of on-site or off-site
workforce units, conveyance of land for workforce housing, or other means.
As directed by the Ordinance, housing in-lieu fees are deposited in the Housing In-Lieu Fund that may
be used for the purposes of planning for, administering, subsidizing or developing workforce housing.
As of February, 2015, the total funds available were $240,913.
With the recent economic downturn, development activity, and thus, fee revenues associated with that
development have slowed dramatically. It is particularly difficult to quantify how much residential
and commercial growth might be expected over the Housing Element Update period, given the degree

                                                                                                                     HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                        CHAPTER 4: HOUSING RESOURCES
of uncertainty in the development community overall. In the period 2010 to 2014, the Town collected
a total of $62,424 in housing in-lieu fees, an average of $15,606 annually during the four-year period.
Assuming this trend will continue, this annual average would amount to roughly $78,000 total over
the course of the five year planning period.
Transient Occupancy Tax Allocation
One percent of 13 percent Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) revenues was designated towards the
development of workforce and affordable housing within the Town. As a resort community, TOT in
Mammoth Lakes represents a significant portion of local revenues. Between 2009 and 2014, the Town
collected an average of $10.5 Million annually in TOT, translating to an average of over $814,793
annually for housing. Due to the Town’s Mammoth Lakes Land Acquisition (MLLA) settlement, this
amount has been reduced, and it is anticipated that an average of $724,549 annually will be allocated
to housing over the next five years. TOT will continue to be used as a local resource for the provision
of workforce and affordable housing.
As noted below, these monies are principally dedicated to funding the work and programs of
Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. (MLH), a non-profit organization formed by the Town with other
participants in 2003. MLH has used these funds to leverage additional State and Federal grant funds to
construct and acquire affordable housing units, to provide down payment assistance to qualifying
households, and to provide assistance to qualified families to find and move into affordable housing
units. The Town may also work with other providers of affordable housing through direct funding
and/or grant programs.
In 2011, the Town initiated a significant transient occupancy tax (TOT) enforcement program. The
program incorporates a substantial outreach component to inform locals and second homeowners of
the Town’s short term rental regulations. The program addresses transient rentals in unpermitted zones
and transient rentals in permitted zones that are not remitting the required tax. A TOT Committee was
established to assist and provide direction in the Town’s TOT enforcement efforts. The Town Council
adopted Municipal Code revisions to facilitate this program. The Town continues to refine and
improve the TOT enforcement program, including conducting audits and assessments and automating
the TOT payment system to streamline the remitting process.

Non-Profit Organizations
Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc.
Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. (MLH) is a private, not for profit, organization that was established in
2003 by the Town of Mammoth Lakes. The agency received its initial start-up funds in 2003 through
equal contributions from the Town of Mammoth Lakes, Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, and Intrawest
Mammoth. Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. receives the majority of its current operating funding from
the Town of Mammoth Lakes, which in turn derives this money from an allocation of Transient
Occupancy Tax revenues politically committed to workforce housing.
MLH’s Board of Directors currently includes the Mayor of the Town of Mammoth Lakes, a Mono
County Board of Supervisor, a community development professional and a former Councilmember
and retired school teacher.
MLH has been successful in providing housing through a variety of programs. Utilizing state, federal,
and local funding sources Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. has developed and/or rehabilitated 189
housing units in Mammoth Lakes and another 13 in neighboring jurisdictions. MLH currently operates
a down payment assistance program to help homebuyers into homeownership. Recently, the
organization completed the acquisition and rehabilitation of a four-unit affordable rental development.
MLH has worked closely with the Town of Mammoth Lakes to implement the Housing Element and
the housing requirements of the Town’s Municipal Code. This contractual relationship has effectively
secured grant and other funding, developed a more effective deed restriction program, and spurred the
development of affordable units to meet the Regional Housing Needs, determined by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development.
Inyo Mono Advocates for Community Action (IMACA)
IMACA is a private non-profit organization active that provides a range of social services functions,
including some aimed at housing. IMACA manages the Glass Mountain Apartments, a 25 unit
affordable housing project in Mammoth Lakes. IMACA administers the Housing Choice Voucher
Program, with housing vouchers (Section 8) available in Mono County, distributes vouchers for
emergency housing, and provides free weatherization and energy conservation services (such as
heating upgrades) to qualifying households in Inyo and Mono Counties.

OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES
The Town and Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. have actively pursued and been awarded grant funding
for housing-related projects. These applications are expected to continue over the course of the
Housing Element period. State and Federal grants available to the Town include low-income housing
tax credits, multifamily housing program grants, Affordable Housing Program (AHP) grants, HOME,
CDBG, and others.
The Town and Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. have been awarded federal HOME funds for housing
development over the past several years. HOME is a federally funded program that assists in the
production and preservation of affordable housing for low and moderate-income families and
individuals. The program funds a broad range of activities including new construction, acquisition and
rehabilitation of rental properties. It is anticipated that additional applications will be made during the
Housing Element Update period both for new construction and of rehabilitation of existing units.
MLH and the Town also apply regularly for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds,
which are applicable to a range of activities including housing acquisition and rehabilitation and
homebuyer assistance, among others. MLH also funds its down payment assistance program through a
variety of grant funded sources including HOME, CalHome, Workforce Housing Program, BEGIN,
and CalHFA HELP.
Although these applications are becoming increasingly competitive, it is anticipated that the Town and
MLH will continue to apply for and receive these funds, approximately every other year.
HOUSING STRATEGY
As discussed elsewhere in this Housing Element, the Town of Mammoth Lakes faces a complex and
diverse series of local housing challenges. As the Town's non-profit housing organization, Mammoth
Lakes Housing, Inc. plays a critical role helping to identify the community's housing needs, and
develop targeted approaches and programs to address them. In 2011, MLH completed a Housing
Needs Assessment that evaluated the available supply of housing to local housing needs. Through
employee and employer surveys, interviews, and trend analysis, data were collected which will be
used to influence the Housing Strategy which continues to be a priority of both the Town of Mammoth

of the Housing Strategy so that it can complement and effectively implement the Housing Element
Update and Town’s updated Housing Ordinance which is anticipated to be adopted in 2014. The
Town will work with MLH to develop and adopt the Housing Strategy, in order to more effectively
guide its work and allocation of resources towards development of workforce housing.
MLH and the Town anticipate that the Housing Strategy will be a guide for the Town and MLH in the
administration and implementation of variety of housing programs conducted by MLH, and
administration of regulations with which MLH has been assigned a review or advisory role, including
the evaluation of workforce housing proposals, or Alternative Housing Mitigation Plans. The Housing
Strategy will clearly outline the roles of Town staff as well as MLH staff so that the partnership can
continue to function effectively and best serve the community.
4.5       ENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES
Energy conservation is important to housing affordability, since energy costs can constitute a
significant proportion of housing costs. In Mammoth Lakes, with its harsh winter climate, homes that
are poorly insulated or that have inefficient heating systems can drive up energy costs. Techniques
such as use of passive solar construction (orienting buildings properly to gain solar heat energy),
insulation treatments, and installation of energy efficient appliances such as on-demand water heaters
can result in dramatic energy savings.
Energy efficiency and conservation are embedded in the Town’s General Plan and Zoning Code
Update. The Town’s General Plan includes a goal that the Town “be a leader in use of green building
technology.” The following policies and actions are outlined in the General Plan and further addressed
in the Zoning Code Update with the goal of reducing the per capita residential energy consumption:
        Encourage site design that uses green building techniques.
        Establish incentives for green building practices and LEED (Leadership in Energy and
         Environmental Design) certified buildings.
        Support development of a geothermal heating district for the Town including seeking grant-
         funding sources for geothermal heating projects.
        Establish regulatory framework to encourage and facilitate use of geothermal heating.

        Encourage building design and orientation for passive solar heating.
        Develop and implement standards that enable and encourage the application of passive solar
         in new and existing public and private development.
        Support energy efficiency opportunities through available resources such as Property
         Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program.
The California Green Building Standards Code, Title 24, Part 11 of the California Code of
Regulations (CALGreen) became effective January 1, 2014 and is California’s first green building
code. The purpose of CALGreen is to improve public health, safety and general welfare through
enhanced design and construction of buildings using concepts which reduce negative impacts and
promote those principles which have a positive environmental impact and encourage sustainable
construction practices. CALGreen addresses: planning and design, energy efficiency, water efficiency
and conservation, and environmental quality. It is the responsibility of builders and homeowners to
comply with Title 24 standards, and for the Town to enforce those standards through plan check and
code compliance inspections.
Southern California Edison (SCE), the local energy utility, offers a number of programs aimed at
energy conservation to Mammoth Lakes' households, including home energy audits and rebates for
energy efficient appliances. SCE also offers an energy rebate program for residential developers and
customers, and an Energy STAR new home program. The utility also publicizes other programs
available to its customers such as the Federal Income Tax energy credit program.
The High Sierra Energy Foundation (HSEF) is a non-profit that is dedicated to promoting and
supporting energy conservation in Mono and Inyo Counties. Among other sources, HSEF receives
funding from the Town and from SCE. HSEF's programs have included publications on energy
efficient practices and building strategies suitable for the Eastern Sierra climate, rebate programs, as
well as an on-going public communication campaign to educate local residents about energy saving.
As noted above, IMACA, a local non-profit, offers low cost weatherization and retrofit programs for
qualifying households in Mono and Inyo Counties.
In addition to the above, Mammoth Lakes is situated in an area of high geothermal activity. Although
not significantly utilized at present, geothermal resources present a tremendous opportunity for future

heating needs. In anticipation of ground source heating being available in the foreseeable future, the
Town has installed piping in several of its recent sidewalk construction projects that would allow them
to use geothermal heat for snowmelt.
In 2010, Mammoth Pacific, LP, a subsidiary of Ormat Technologies, Inc., initiated the permitting
process to expand its current geothermal operations in the Mammoth Lakes area. Preparation of an
EIR is currently underway, and a draft document was released in winter of 2012, on which the Town
provided comments. The Town will continue to be engaged in the process in 2014. In addition, the
Town continues to work with the developers of the Mammoth View project who plan on drilling a
geothermal injection well in 2014, for project’s use of geothermal energy. The Mammoth View
project is also anticipated to start grading work in 2014.

5 HOUSING PROGRAM
This chapter includes the Town’s strategy for meeting housing needs as described in Chapter 2 of this
Housing Element, specifies the use of resources available to the Town, and the reduction of
constraints to the availability of housing for all residents as described in Chapters 3 and 4. As required
by State law, this chapter also contains quantified objectives for housing construction, housing
rehabilitation, and the preservation of affordable housing. It specifies a five year action plan, that,
among other aspects, identifies resources and strategies to support the development of affordable
housing for all sectors of the community; to reduce governmental constraints to the provision of
housing, conserve and improve the existing housing stock, and promote fair housing.
As described in Chapter 4, the Town’s limited urban area, which is surrounded by public land, means
that a decreasing amount of vacant land is available for new housing development. Much of that land
is located within Master Plan areas that are intended for resort-oriented development, with the
remainder consisting of infill development. The Town’s requirement for affordable housing to be
placed on-site with new development has meant that a sizeable number of workforce and affordable
housing units are planned as part of the development of these Master Plan areas, or will be built in
conjunction with major projects (totaling 183 acres). In addition to these resources, there are 6 acres of
vacant residentially zoned property with the potential to supply a significant number of new affordable
housing units.

SUMMARY OF ACHIEVEMENTS
During the period of the previous Housing Element (2007-2014) the Town implemented a number of
actions to plan for, accommodate, and facilitate the construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of
affordable housing. Among these actions were:
        Ongoing financial support for Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc. and its extensive program of
         services for direct provision and facilitation of workforce and affordable housing, through
         allocation of Transient Occupancy Tax revenues and housing in-lieu fees.
        Completed construction of three affordable housing projects:
              o   Manzanita Apartments - 14 rental units restricted to households earning 60% or less
                  of AMI. The project includes two 2-bedroom units and 12 3-bedroom units.
              o   Aspen Village Phase 2 Condominiums – 24 for-sale units. The project includes eight
                  units restricted to moderate income or less (120% of AMI or less) and 16 market rate
                  units.
              o   Jefferys Apartments – 14 rental units restricted to households earning 60% or less of
                  AMI. The project includes six 2-bedroom units and eight 3-bedroom units in addition
                  to an existing duplex with two 2-bedroom units, which is also restricted to 60% or
                  less AMI.
        Acquired a multi-tenant property at 1829 Old Mammoth Road, the Star Apartments, which
         contained an illegal fourth unit. This structure was rehabilitated, with energy efficient
         upgrades, and the fourth unit was made into a legal unit. These four rental, three 1-bedroom
         and one 3-bedroom, units are restricted to households earning no more than 80% AMI
         (extremely low, very low, and low income).
        Deed restriction completed for 17 rental units, the Kitzbuhel Apartments, which was an
         uninhabitable building for years. The structure has been renovated and made available for
         tenants at or below 100% AMI (moderate income and below).
        A total of 13 very low income, 76 low income, 34 moderate income, and 45 above moderate
         income deed restricted housing units were achieved during the 2007-2014 period.

        Adoption of an Interim Housing Policy in 2009 to provide more reasonable requirements for
         private developers to provide housing or otherwise meet the housing demand generated by
         new development.
        Completion of a Housing Needs Assessment in 2011. This included employee and employer
         surveys, interviews, trend analysis, and data collection. This assessment informed this
         Housing Element and continued housing actions undertaken by the Town and Mammoth
         Lakes Housing, Inc.
        Creation of a Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) to utilize the Housing in-lieu fee account for the
         preservation of deed restricted ownership housing stock. Since establishment of the RLF in
         2013, three units have already been preserved.
        Assistance to 35 households, amounting to $2,674,361, for zero to low-interest loans for
         purchase of local homes for primary residences.
        Coordination with developers and Mammoth Lakes Housing, Inc., including its Board of
         Directors, regarding proposed Alternate Housing Mitigation Plans (AHMP). These AHMP
         reviews include an evaluation of whether there would be substantial additional affordable
         housing benefit derived from the AHMP.
        Ongoing monitoring of deed-restricted housing units.
        The adoption of the Zoning Code Update, which incorporated the goals and policies of the
         2007 General Plan, modernized the Town’s zoning regulations, and enacted policies that
         support the development of housing for all segments of the population.
Table 5-50 shows the Town’s progress towards achieving the various actions (summarized here for
ease of review) specified in the 2010 Housing Element.

                                       neighborhoods are safe, attractive and livable. The Town hired a code compliance officer in 2013.
                    Policy H.3.C.      Improve livability, infrastructure public safety, and mobility conditions within the Sierra Valley
                                       Sites neighborhood and other neighborhoods with a high proportion of older structures. The Town

                                       reflect the cost of processing applications and providing services to new development, without
                                       unduly increasing costs to build housing. The Town is required to conduct annual reviews of
                                       development impact fees, and typically analyzes permit fees annually during the budget process.

                    Policy H.4.B.      Consider reduction or waiver of permit and development impact fees for projects that dedicate
                                       some or all of their units to affordable housing. Consider waiving development impact fees only
                                       when significant impacts (e.g. circulation) can be avoided.
                                       Action H.4.B.1.       Adopt a resolution waiving a proportion of the application processing fees
                                                             for developments in which at least five percent of units are affordable to
                                                             extremely low-income households. To be eligible for fee waiver, the units
                                                             shall be affordable by affordability covenant. The waiving or reduction of
                                                             service mitigation fees may also be considered when an alternative funding
                                                             source is identified to pay these fees. The Town anticipates amending the
                                                             Municipal Code fee waiver section to include this program concurrently
                                                             with the Housing Ordinance update.
                    Policy H.4.C.      Ensure that the Zoning Code continues to meet State Law requirements and does not unduly
                                       restrict certain types of housing to be developed. The Town is targeting regular reviews and
                                       updates to the Zoning Code to incorporate mandates and other appropriate revisions.
                    Policy H.4.D.      Continue to allow secondary housing units by right in Rural Residential and Residential Single
                                       Family zones. This was included in the Zoning Code Update.
                    Policy H.4.E.      Periodically review and update Town codes, ordinances, fee programs and procedures to ensure
                                       that they do not unduly constrain housing development, while ensuring development impacts are
                                       adequately mitigated through development impact fees and/or other appropriate measure(s). The
                                       Interim Housing Policy adjusted housing fees and exempted additional residential uses from
                                       payment of housing fees. A temporary DIF resolution waived DIF for 1-4 unit residential projects
                                       through July 31, 2014.
                                       Action H.4.E.1.       Continue to monitor the Town’s DIF ordinance to assure that impact fees do
                                                             not create an economic impediment that deters construction of housing
                                                             needed to meet the Town’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation or

                                           INTRODUCTION
 I
   1.1 Purpose and Scope
   The Noise Element of the General Plan is a planning document which provides a policy
B  framework for addressing potential noise impacts encountered in the planning process.
   The content of a Noise Element and the methods used in its preparation have been determined by
 I the requirements of Section 65302 (0 of the California Government Code and by the State of
   California General Plan Guidelines published by the California Office of Planning and Research
 B in 1990. The Guidelines require that major noise sources and areas containing noise-sensitive
   land uses be identified and quantified by preparing generalized noise exposure contours for
 B current and projected conditions.
 B According to the Government Code requirements, noise exposure information should be included
9
   in a Noise Element for the following major noise sources;
 B       1.  Highways and freeways
         2.  Primary arterials and major local streets
 B       3.  Railroad operations
         4.  Aircraft and airport operations
B        5.  Local industrial facilities
         6.  Other stationary sources
"  Noise-sensitive uses identified by the Government Code and by the Town of Mammoth Lakes
   include the following:
         1.  Residential development
I        2.
         3.
             Schools
             Hospitals, nursing homes
I        4.  Churches

        5.        Libraries
B The Noise Element is directed at minimizing future noise conflicts. A noise ordinance, on the
  other hand, is directed at resolving existing noise conflicts. A noise ordinance may be used to
B address noise levels generated by existing industrial and residential uses, which are not regulated
  by federal or state noise level standards. The regulation of noise sources such as traffic on public
  roadways, railroad line operations and aircraft in flight is preempted by existing federal and/or
I state regulations, meaning that such sources generally may not be addressed by a noise
  ordinance. The Noise Element addresses the prevention of noise conflicts from all of these
B sources.
B 1.2 Relationship to Other Elements of the General Plan
B The Noise Element is related to the Land Use, Housing, Circulation and Open Space Elements of
  the General Plan. Recognition of the interrelationship of noise and these four mandated elements
  is necessary to prepare an integrated general plan and to initiate changes which will reduce noise
I exposure to acceptable levels in areas where noise may presently exceed the levels set forth by
  the adopted policies of the Noise Element. The relationship between these elements is briefly
| discussed below:
B  I.    Land Use: An objective of the Noise Element is to provide noise exposure information
         for use in the Land Use Element. When integrated with the Noise Element, the Land
B        Use Element will show acceptable land uses in relation to existing and projected noise
         levels.
I  2.    Housing: The Housing Element considers the provision of adequate sites for new
         housing and standards for housing stock. Since residential land uses are noise-
1        sensitive, the noise exposure information of the Noise Element must be considered
         when planning the locations of new housing. The State Noise Insulation Standards
I        may influence the locations and construction costs of multi-family dwellings, which
         should be considered by the Housing Element.
   3.    Circulation:               The circulation system, which is a major source of noise, must be
         correlated with the Land Use Element. This is especially true for roadways which
I        carry significant numbers of trucks. Noise exposure will thus be a decisive factor in
M     M*iniBBtL*tciNi>itEltBCBlBfllieGnicT*in,in
I
I
B        the location and design of new transportation facilities, and in the mitigation of noise
         produced by existing facilities upon existing and planned land uses.
B  4.     Open Space: Excessive noise adversely affects the enjoyment of recreational pursuits in
_
I
          designated open space, particularly in areas where quiet is a valued part of the recreational
          experience. Thus, noise exposure should be considered in planning for this kind of open
          space use. Conversely, open space can be used to buffer noise-sensitive uses from noise
          sources by providing setbacks and visual screening.
   1.3 Noise And Its Effects On People
i  Appendix A provides a discussion of the fundamentals of noise assessment, the effects of noise
B  on people and criteria for acceptable noise exposure, and is a reference for use by the Town
   during the review of documents or proposals which refer to the measurement and effects of
   noise.
   1.4 Definitions
    1.    A-Weighted Sound Level (dBA’): Except as specified, all sound levels referred to in this
I         policy document are in A-Weighted decibels. A-weighting de-emphasizes the very low and
          very high frequencies of sound in a manner similar to the human ear. Most community
B         noise standards utilize A-weighting, as it provides a high degree of correlation with human
          annoyance and health effects.
B   2.    Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL’i: The average equivalent sound level during a
          24-hour day, obtained after addition of approximately five decibels to sound levels in the
I         evening from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and ten decibels to sound levels in the night before
          7:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m.
i   3.    C-Weighted Dav/Night Average Sound Level CL^I: The average equivalent sound level
B         during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of ten C-Weighted decibels to sound levels in
          the night after 10:00 p.m. and before 7:00 a.m.
9   4.    C-Weighted Sound Level (dBC): C-weighting is essentially flat in response except in very
          low and very high frequencies. C-weighting is often used to judge human response to sonic
 |        booms, blasting and artillery fire.

                    ^^ ^        ^’-^ P-"1- an^ before 7:00 a.m.
 B 6.    Equivalent Sound Level (L^): The sound level containing the same total energy as a
         time varying signal over a given sample period. Leq is typically computed over 1, 8
B        and 24-hour sample periods.
   7.    Maximum Sound Level <1^): The maximum sound level recorded during a noise event.
   8.    New Development: Projects requiring land use approval or building permits, but
I        excluding remodelling or additions to existing structures.
B  9.    Noise-Ser’sitive                Land Use: Residential land uses, transient lodging, schools, libraries,
         churches, hospitals and nursing homes,
9  10. Outdoor Activity Areas: Patios, decks, balconies, outdoor eating areas, swimming pool
         areas, yards of dwellings and other areas which have been designated for outdoor activities
|        and recreation.
B  11. Stationary Noise Source: Any fixed or mobile source not preempted from local control by
         existing federal or state regulations. Examples of such sources include industrial and
B        commercial facilities, and vehicle movements on private property.
   12. Transportation Noise Source: Traffic on public roadways, railroad line operations and
1        aircraft in flight. Control of noise from these sources is preempted by existing federal or
         state regulations. However, the effects of noise from transportation sources may be
B        controlled by regulating the location and design of adjacent land uses.

 I                               EXISTING AND FUTURE NOISE ENVIRONMENT
 I 2.1 Overview of Sources
 B Based on discussions with Town staff, the requirements of the Government Code and field
   studies conducted during the preparation of this document, it was determined that the following
   noise sources should be addressed in the Noise Element:
              Traffic on State Route 203 and Major Town Roadways
 |            Aircraft Operations at Mammoth/June Lakes Airport
              Helicopter Operations at Mammoth Hospital
 |            Snowmaking Operations
              Snow Removal Activities
 B            Avalanche Control
              Industrial Activities near State Route 203 and Meridian Boulevard
   Figure 1 shows the locations of some of these sources.
 B 2.2 Methods Used to Develop Noise Exposure Information
 B According to the Government Code and General Plan Guidelines, noise exposure contours
   should be developed in terms of the Day-Night Average Level (L^ or Community Noise
 B Equivalent Level (CNEL). Both of these descriptors represent the weighted energy noise level
   for a 24-hour day after including a 10 dB penalty for noise levels occurring at night between the
   hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. The CNEL descriptor additionally includes a penalty of about
 I 5 dB for noise levels occurring during the evening hours of 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. The CNEL
   descriptor was developed to quantify aircraft noise, and its use is required when preparing noise
 | exposure maps for airports within the State of California. The CNEL and L^ descriptors are
   generally considered to be equivalent to each other for most community noise environments
   within +/-1.0 dB. The L^ descriptor has been used in this Noise Element to quantify noise from
   the above-described major noise sources.

B To supplement the L^ noise descriptor, the hourly L^q and L,^ descriptors have been used to
  characterize noise levels from stationary noise sources that are addressed in this Noise Element.
I Because many stationary noise sources operate sporadically, the hourly Leq and L^ are more
  useful for predicting noise conflicts from such sources than is the L^. The L^, by definition, is a
I modified average noise exposure over 24 hours. If a noise source operates only a few hours a
  day, averaging the noise over 24 hours may under-estimate its nuisance potential. Since the L^
  descriptor is required by the Government Code for Noise Elements, noise exposure from
I stationary noise sources also has been described using this descriptor.
B Analytical noise modeling techniques were used to develop generalized noise contours for
  existing and future conditions. Analytical noise modeling techniques generally use source-
_
B  specific data, including descriptions of noise-generating equipment or activities, hours of
   operation, seasonal fluctuations, and average levels of noise from source operations. Analytical
I methods have been developed for many environmental noise sources, including roadways,
  railroad line operations, railroad yard operations, industrial plants and aircraft/airport operations.
    Such methods will produce reliable results as long as data inputs and assumptions are valid for
  the sources being studied.
I The noise exposure information developed during the preparation of the Noise Element does not
   include all conceivable sources of industrial or commercial noise within the Town of Mammoth
I Lakes, but rather focuses on the existing sources of noise which have been identified by the
   Town as being significant. As the policies of this Noise Element are applied in the future, it is
B  likely that other potentially significant sources will be identified.
   2.3 Roadways
   The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model
B  (FHWA-RD-77-108) was used to develop L^ contours for State Route 203 and major Town
   roadways. The FHWA Model is the analytical method currently favored by most state and local
I  agencies, including Caltrans, for highway traffic noise prediction. The model is based upon
   reference energy emission levels for automobiles, medium trucks (2 axles) and heavy trucks (3 or
B  more    axles), with consideration given to vehicle volume, speed, roadway configuration, distance
*  to the receiver, and the acoustical characteristics of the site., The FHWA Model was developed
   to predict hourly Lgq values for free-flowing traffic conditions, and is generally considered to be
I  accurate within +/- 1.5 dB. The model assumes a clear view of traffic with no shielding at the
f      M-mniolliLitoNiintElnneilloflMGcMUtn^i
I

B receiver location. To predict L^ values, it is necessary to determine the hourly distribution of
  traffic for a typical day and adjust the traffic volume input data to yield an equivalent hourly
I traffic volume. The Calveno traffic noise emission curves were used as recommended by
  Caltrans to more accurately calculate noise levels generated by California traffic.
  Existing (1994) and future (2009) traffic volumes used to calculate traffic noise levels were
  based on the traffic study performed by Robert Kahn, John Kain & Associates, Inc.’ The winter
I weekend daily volumes from Reference 1 were adjusted by 60%2 to more accurately reflect
  annual average conditions. Truck volumes were estimated by the Town. The Day/Night
I distribution of traffic was based on assumptions used by BBA for comparable streets, since these
  data were unavailable from any other source. Vehicle speeds assumed during the traffic noise
I modelling process were the posted vehicle speeds.
I Table I lists the distances of the existing and future 60 and 65 dB L^ contours from roadway
  centers, along with input data used in the FHWA Model. Maps on file with the Town of
  Mammoth Lakes show the approximate location of the contours. Note that contour distances less
I than 50 feet are not shown on the maps.

  2.4 Snow Removal
  Snow removal is performed by the Town of Mammoth Lakes on city streets and by individuals
I on private property. During the winter, snow removal on city streets can occur 24 hours per day.
   The Town operates four loaders with blades, three loaders with blower attachments, one road
B grader with blade, and two plow/cinder trucks. Table II summarizes noise levels from some of
  this equipment measured under actual operating conditions with chains.

   2.5 Snow Making
B  According to Mr. Dennis Agee, Planning Director for Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, snow
   making equipment is located near Warming Hut II at the west end of Canyon Boulevard is
I  proposed for the base of Chair 15 at the west end of Meridian Boulevard. Snow making may
   occur during the day or night depending on weather conditions.
i  During the night, the SMI Silentstorm Snowmaker is used, which is an airless type of snow
I  maker. Airless snow makers are reported to produce lower noise levels than typical snow
   making systems that expel air and water through a nozzle at high pressure. During the day,

B  Based on measurements conducted by BBA of many air/water snow makers, noise levels at 50
   feet from the side of nozzles ranged from about 81 to 94 dBA. At the same distance from the
I  side of the SMI Silentstonn Snowmaker, the level measured by BBA was 71 dBA.
B  2.6 Business/Industrial Site Near Meridian Boulevard and Commerce Drive
   This facility includes the Town equipment yard, Mammoth Disposal, an asphalt batch plant and
I  concrete batch         plant. Sound level measurements were conducted at 323 Wagon Wheel, which
   represents a typical residential site adjacent to the industrial area. Figure 2 shows hourly sound
B  level measurements at this site during April and July 1995. The sound levels measured in April
   were during a stormy and windy period and therefore do not represent sound levels from the
B  business/industrial park. From July 25-27, 1995, however, the weather was calm and the levels
   shown in Figure 2 fairly represent the total noise environment, including activities at the
B  business/industrial site. The July hourly levels are generally under 45 dBA, L^q which would
"  satisfy most land use compatibility criteria.
B  2.7 Avalanche Control Noise Impacts
 B Mammoth Mountain Ski Area and the U.S. Forest Service uses various explosive devices to
   break-up excessive snow accumulations that may create avalanches near ski slopes in the
 B Mammoth Mountain area. Hand-thrown explosive charges and explosive shells propelled by 106
   m.m. recoilless rifles are mainly used for this purpose. During a season of heavy snow
 I accumulation, such as 1994-95, about 1700 hand charges and 800 propelled charges may be
   used. Avalanche control is normally done from about 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., before the ski lifts
 j are in operation. Three gun sites are located in the Mammoth ski area. Gun #2, that is located on
 I the south slope of Lincoln Mountain and fires shells into the north side of Mammoth Mountain
   and the Dragon’s Back, is responsible for most of the audible cannon fire in the Town of
 B Mammoth Lakes. Guns #1 and #3 are situated so that their muzzle blasts and shell detonations
   are not as   noticeable in the community.
   Test firings of Gun #2 were conducted on May 30, 1995 from about 7:00 a.m.-8:00 a.m. The
 B temperature was about 40-50F in the Town of Mammoth Lakes, with no wind and a clear sky.
 9 Three locations were selected in the community that represent sites where worst-case noise
   exposure would be expected due to proximity and almost unobstructed line-of-

I  sight to the gun and target area. These locations are south of Lake Mary Road and are shown in
   Figure 3. Results of test firings are shown in Table III.
   North of Lake Mary Road, muzzle blasts and shell detonations from Gun #2 are generally
B  shielded from residences by Lincoln Mountain. However, explosions from hand-thrown charges
   along the north and east slopes of Lincoln Mountain and near Lake Mary Road are reportedly
   quite noticeable in this area. Hand charges are also used by the Tamarack avalanche control
I  crew. Although more hand charges are used for avalanche control than gun firings, it is believed
   that individual noise impacts from hand charges are not as severe as those from gun firings.
   From the data in the Table HI and the estimated number of shells fired per day in the avalanche
I  season, it is possible to calculate the noise level in terms of the Day/Night Average Level (L^)
   using A-weighted decibels and the Day/Night Average Level using C’weighted decibels (L^.
B  C-weighted decibels and the Lc^ descriptor are often used by the military to characterize the
   annoyance from high-energy impulsive noise, such as sonic booms and artillery fire3.

   Based on Forest Service estimates, about 20-30 shells per day may be discharged from Gun #2
   during the avalanche season. Assuming half of the shells are fired before 7:00 a.m., the L^ and
   Lcdn values were calculated at the three test locations noted above. Table IV lists the calculated
 I values.

I  From Table IV, it can be seen that L^ values ranged from about 50-58 dB. According to
   research sponsored by the National Research Council4, between 3 and 9 percent of the populace
B  can be expected to be highly annoyed by L^ values ranging from 50 to 58 dB.
   2.8 Helicopter Noise Impacts
   Helicopters are occasionally used to transport patients to the Mammoth Hospital. The severity of
B  noise impacts due to the helicopters depends on their frequency of use, the time of day or night
   when flights occur, the types of helicopter used, and whether helicopters fly near noise-sensitive
   uses when approaching and leaving the hospital. The FAA requires that the Day/Night Average
   Level (LdJ be used to describe land use compatibility with respect to helicopter noise exposure.

   Additionally, the FAA recommends that the subjective impact of helicopter noise impacts may
   be determined by comparing Sound Exposure Levels (SEL’s) of helicopter flights to background
   noise levels at residential areas (The SEL measures the total sound energy of a single helicopter
   passby). More helicopter flights are allowed when background noise levels are high, accordino
    to the    FAA’s recommendations.
 i  Table V lists helicopter SEL’s measured by BBA during other studies at residential locations near
 I  hospitals. The residences generally were within a 1-mile radius of the hospital. The SEL’s in
    Table V should not be construed as those that would necessarily occur at residential areas near
 B  Mammoth Hospital.

                                                      COMMUNITY NOISE SURVEY
    3.1 Community Noise Survey
  I A community noise survey was conducted within the Town of Mammoth Lakes during the
  I winter (April 29-30, 1995) and summer (July 25-27, 1995) to document background noise levels
    in different seasons within areas where noise-sensitive land uses are located.          Short-term
    monitoring was conducted at three sites three times a day. Continuous noise monitoring was
  I conducted at two sites to record the variation of noise levels through a full 24-hour period. The
    data collected during the survey included the Leq and observed maximum noise levels. The
 B  measurement sites at 319 Grindelwald, 107 Sugar Pine and the end of Waterford Street are
    typical residential areas away from major noise sources. The house at 323 Wagon Wheel is near
 |  the industrial/commercial site which is described in Chapter 2.6. The knoll between Mammoth
    High School and Mammoth Hospital represents these two noise-sensitive, uses.                   The
 B  measurement site at the south side of lower Twin Lakes represents a recreational area.
    Noise monitoring sites, measured noise levels and estimated L^ values at each site are described
 I  in Table VI. Hourly variations in noise levels at the long-term monitoring site are shown in
    Figures 5-10. Monitoring site locations are shown on Figure 3.
    The April, 1995 community noise survey data shown in Table VI and Figures 5-10 were obtained
 I  during windy conditions and are more representative of wind noise than community sources.
    The July, 1995 measurements indicate relatively quiet conditions in the community. The most
 B  common and significant noise source in Mammoth Lakes is traffic. At residential locations away
    from major roads, the residual noise environment consists of local traffic, birds, running water
    and miscellaneous sounds from domestic use. To preserve quiet conditions in the community,
I   noise level standards and policies (see Chapter Four) have been adopted to prevent degradation
    of the existing noise environment as much as possible.

I                                      GOALS AND POLICIES
B 4.1 Goals
  The goals of the Town of Mammoth Lakes Noise Element are:
  L To protect the citizens of the Town from the    harmful and annoying effects of exposure
B         to excessive noise.
B 2. To protect the economic base of the Town by preventing incompatible land uses from
          encroaching upon existing or planned noise-producing uses.
  3. To preserve the tranquility   of residential areas  by preventing noise-producing uses
m         from encroaching upon existing or planned noise-sensitive uses.
  4. To educate the citizens   of the Town concerning the effects of exposure to    excessive
B         noise and the methods available for minimizing such exposure.
B 4.2 Policies
B The following specific policies have been adopted by the Town of Mammoth Lakes to
  accomplish the goals of the Noise Element:
  Prevent!^?   of Adverse Noise Impacts due to Transportation Noise Sources:
I Policy 4.2.1       New development of noise-sensitive land uses shall not be permitted in areas
                     exposed to existing or projected future levels of noise from transportation
B                    noise sources which exceed 60 dB L^ in outdoor activity areas or 45 dB   L^n in
                     interior spaces.
  Policy 4.2.2       Noise created by new transportation noise sources, including roadway
                     improvement projects, shall be mitigated so as not to exceed 60 dB L^ within
I                    outdoor activity areas and 45 dB L^ within interior spaces of existing noise-
                     sensitive land uses.

                                              IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
B To achieve compliance with the policies of the Noise Element, the Town of Mammoth Lakes
  shall undertake the following implementation program. The implementation program focuses on
  the prevention of new noise-related land use conflicts by requiring that new development be
I reviewed to determine whether it complies with the policies in Chapter 3.
B 5.1       The Town shall review new public and private development proposals to determine
            conformance with the policies of this Noise Element.
  5.2       The Town shall require an acoustical analysis in those cases where a project potentially
B           threatens to expose noise-sensitive land uses to excessive noise levels. The presumption of
            excessive noise levels shall be based on the location of new noise-sensitive uses to known
            noise sources (see Table I and Noise Contour Maps on file with the Town of Mammoth
I           Lakes), or staffs professional Judgement that a potential for adverse noise impacts exists.
            Acoustical analyses shall be required early in the review process so that noise mitigation
B           may be included in the project design. For development not subject to environmental
            review, the requirements for an acoustical analysis shall be implemented prior to the
B           issuance of building permits. The requirements for the content of an acoustical analysis
            are given in Appendix B.
  5.3       The Town shall develop and employ procedures to ensure that noise mitigation measures
            required pursuant to an acoustical analysis are implemented in the development review and
I           building permit processes.
I 5.4       The Town shall develop and employ procedures to monitor compliance with the policies of
            the Noise Element after completion of projects where noise mitigation measures have been
            required.
B 5.5       The Town shall enforce the State Noise Insulation Standards (California Code of
           Regulations, Title 24) and Chapter 35 of the Uniform Building Code (UBC) concerning
            interior noise exposure for multi-family housing, hotels and motels.

I 5.6      The Town shall request the California Highway Patrol, the sheriffs office and the police
|          department to actively enforce the California Vehicle Code sections relating to adequate
           vehicle mufflers and modified exhaust systems.
  5.7      The Town shall periodically review and update the Noise Element to ensure that noise
B          exposure information and specific policies are consistent with changing conditions within
           the Town and with noise control regulations or policies enacted after the adoption of this
           element.
  5.8      The Town shall revise its noise ordinance so that its noise limits are consistent with those
I          of the Noise Element, the language of the noise ordinance is clear and concise, and that
           potential noise nuisances that are unique to the Town, such as snow making equipment, are
I          appropriately regulated.

                                                 NOISE AND ITS EFFECTS ON PEOPLE
B Fundamenfflk nf Noise Assessment:
  Noise is often defined simply as unwanted sound, and thus is a subjective reaction to
I characteristics of a physical phenomenon. The descriptors of community noise in current-use are
  the results of many years of effort to translate objective measurements of sound into measures of
B subjective reaction to noise. Before elaborating on these descriptors, it is useful to discuss some
  fundamental concepts of sound.
  Sound is defined as any pressure variation in air that the human ear can detect. If the pressure
B variations occur frequently enough (at least 20 times per second), they can be heard and hence
  are called sound. The number of pressure variations per second is called the frequency of sound,
  and is expressed as cycles per second, now called Hertz (Hz) by international agreement.
  The speed of sound in air is approximately 770 miles per hour, or 1,130 feet/second. Knowing
  the speed and frequency of a sound, one may calculate its wavelength, the physical distance in air
  from one compression of the atmosphere to the next. An understanding of wavelength is useful
B in evaluating the effectiveness of physical noise control devices such as mufflers or barriers,
  which depend upon either absorbing or blocking sound waves to reduce sound levels.
  To measure sound directly in terms of pressure would require a very large and awkward range of
  numbers. To avoid this, the decibel (dB) scale was devised.
  The decibel scale uses the hearing threshold as a point of reference, defined as 0 dB. Other
B sound pressures are then compared to the reference pressure, and the logarithm is taken to keep
  the numbers in a practical range. Use of the decibel scale allows a million-fold increase in
  pressure to be expressed as 120 dB. Another useful aspect of the decibel scale is that changes in
  levels (dB) correspond closely to human perception of relative loudness.
  The perceived loudness of sounds is dependent upon many factors, including sound pressure
  level and frequency content. In the range of usual environmental noise levels, perception of
I loudness is relatively predictable, and can be approximated by weighting the frequency response

I
 B of a sound level measurement device (called a sound level meter) by means of the standardized
   A-weighting network. There is a strong correlation between A-weighted sound levels and
 I community response to noise. For this reason, the A-weighted sound level has become the
   standard tool of environmental noise assessment. Figure A-l illustrates typical A-weighted
 | sound levels due to recognizable sources.
 B It is common to describe community noise in terms of the "ambient" noise level, which is
   defined as the all-encompassing noise level associated with a given noise environment. A
   common statistical tool to measure the ambient noise level is the average, or equivalent, sound
 I level (Leq), which is the sound level corresponding to a steady-state A-weighted sound level
 - containing the same total energy as a time-varying signal over a given time period (usually one
   hour). The L^q is the foundation of the composite noise descriptors such as L^ and CNEL, and
   shows very good correlation with community response to noise.
   Two composite noise descriptors are in common use today: L<m and CNEL. The L^ (day-night
 B average level) is based upon the average hourly Lgq over a 24-hour day, with a +10 decibel
   weighting applied to nighttime (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) L^ values. The nighttime penalty is
   based upon the assumption that people react to nighttime noise exposures as though they were
I  subjectively twice as loud as daytime exposures. The CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent
   Level), like L^ is also based upon the weighted average hourly L^ over a 24-hour day, except
I  that an additional 4.77 decibel penalty is applied to evening (7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.) hourly L^q
   values.
   The CNEL was developed for the California Airport Noise Regulations, and is applied
B  specifically to airport/aircraft noise assessment. The L^n scale is a simplification of the CNEL
   concept, but the two will usually agree, for a given situation, within 1 dB. Like the Lgq, these
   descriptors are also averages and tend to disguise variations in the noise environment. Because
I  L^, and CNEL presume increased evening or nighttime sensitivity, they are best applied as
   criteria for land uses where nighttime noise exposures are critical to the acceptability of the noise
I  environment, such as residential developments.

   Noise in the community has often been cited as being a health problem, not in terms of actual
I  physiological damage, such as hearing impairment, but in terms of inhibiting general well-being
   and contributing to undue stress and annoyance. The health effects of noise in the community
 B anse ^Tom tne interference with human activities such as sleep, speech, recreation, and tasks
   demanding concentration or coordination. "When community noise interferes with human
 B activities or contributes to stress, public annoyance with the noise source increases, and the
   acceptability of the environment for people decreases. This decrease in acceptability and the
 B threat to public well-being is the basis for land use planning policies directed towards the
   prevention of exposure to excessive community noise levels. There are also economic affects of
   community noise: reduction in property values, inefficiency in the workplace and lost hours due
 I to stress.
 B To control noise from existing fixed sources, many jurisdictions have adopted community noise
   control ordinances. Such ordinances are intended to abate noise nuisances and to control noise
B  from existing sources. They may also be used as planning tools if applied to the potential
   creation of a nuisance, or to potential encroachment of sensitive uses upon noise-producing
B  facilities. Community noise control ordinances are generally designed to resolve noise problems
   on a short-term basis (usually by means of hourly noise level criteria), rather than on the basis of
   24-hour or annual cumulative noise exposures.
I  Criteria for Acceptable Nofse Exposure:
   The Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of the Noise Element of the General Plan
B  prepared by the State Health Department in 1976, includes recommendations for exterior and
   interior noise level standards to be used by local jurisdictions to identify and prevent the creation
I  of incompatible land uses due to noise. The Health Department Guidelines contain a land use
   compatibility table which describes the compatibility of different land uses with a range of
   environmental noise levels in terms ofL^ or CNEL. An exterior noise environment of 50 to 60
I  dB Ldn or CNEL is considered to be "normally acceptable" for residential uses according to those
   guidelines. The recommendations in the Health Department State Guidelines also note that,
I  under certain conditions, more restrictive standards may be appropriate. As an example, the
   standards for quiet suburban and rural communities may be reduced by 5 to 10 dB to reflect
I  lower existing outdoor noise levels.
B  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also prepared guidelines for community noise
   exposure in the publication Information on the Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to
1  Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety. These guidelines are
                        GOBI)
I
 I
 B based upon assumptions regarding acceptable noise levels which consider occupational noise
   exposure as well as noise exposure in the home. The guidelines recognize an exterior noise level
   of 55 dB Ldn as a goal to protect the public from hearing loss, activity interference, sleep
 I disturbance and annoyance. The EPA notes, however, that this level is not a regulatory goal, but
   is a level defined by a negotiated scientific consensus without concern for economic and
 | technological feasibility or the needs and desires of any particular community. The EPA and
   other governmental agencies have adopted suggested land use compatibility guidelines which
 B indicate that residential noise exposures of 55 to 65 dB L^ are within acceptable limits-
 B For control of noise nuisances, a community noise control ordinance is the most appropriate tool.
    The State Health Department has prepared a Model Community Noise Control Ordinance which
   contains recommended noise standards in terms of "time-weighted" sound levels. The time-
 I weighting concept allows discrimination of both short- and long-term noise exposures, and sets
   allowable levels for each. The Model recommends more stringent standards for residential land
 I uses than for commercial and industrial, with the most stringent standards recommended for
   "rural suburban" situations. The primary exterior noise standard for rural residential uses is 50
 I dB in the daytime hours (7 a.m. to 30 p.m.), and 40 dB at night. The standard is expressed in
   terms of the level exceeded for 30 minutes of an hour, equivalent to the median level, or      L5o.
 B This ordinance format is successfully applied in many California cities and counties.
   In addition to the A-weighted noise level, other factors should be considered in establishing
 I criteria for noise sensitive land uses. For example, sounds with noticeable tonal content such as
   whistles, horns, or droning or high-pitched sounds may be more annoying than the A-weighted
 B sound level alone will suggest. Many noise standards apply a penalty, or correction, of 5 dB to
   such sounds. The effects of unusual tonal content will generally be more of a concern at
|  nighttime, when residents may notice the sound in contrast to previously-experienced
   background noise.
   Because many rural residential areas experience very low noise levels, residents may express
   concern about the loss of "peace and quiet" due to the introduction of a sound which was not
I  audible previously. In very quiet environments, the introduction of virtually any change in local
   activities will cause an increase in noise levels. A change in noise level and the relative loss of
I  "peace and quiet" is the inevitable result of land use or activity changes in such areas. Audibility
   of a new noise source and/or increases in noise levels within recognized acceptable limits are not
B  usually considered to be significant noise impacts, but these concerns should be addressed and
   considered in the planning and environmental review processes.

I Table A-l is commonly used to show expected public reaction to changes in environmental noise
I levels. This table was developed on the basis of test subjects’ reactions to changes in the levels of
  steady-state pure tones or broad-band noise, or to changes in levels of a given noise source. It is
  probably most applicable to noise levels in the range of 50 to 70 dB, the usual range of voice and
  interior noise levels. It is probably not directly applicable to public perception of identifiable
B intrusive noise sources in very quiet environments because of the difference in frequency content
  between background noise sources and intrusive sounds, as well as the fact that the absolute
  amount of energy required to make a given change in sound pressure level is much smaller at
I low noise levels than at higher levels. Table A-l should therefore only be applied in a general
  manner to show the relationship between changes in sound energy, sound pressure levels and
B subjective reaction.
I The comparisons of subjective reaction outlined in Table A-l are not applicable to noise
  exposures which are very quiet or very loud. For example, a whisper which is increased by 10
B decibels, e.g., from 20 dB to 30 dB, remains a whisper, and would still be described as quiet. In
9 contrast, an increase in the noise level of a diesel locomotive from 90 dB to 100 dB would be a
  change from a loud noise to a very loud noise. Thus the subjective reaction to a 10 dB change in
I either case may be different, even though the change in level is the same.

PARKS, OPEN SPACE, AND RECREATION ELEMENT
(AS AMENDED FEBRUARY 1, 2012)
INTENT
More than three out of four Americans participate in active outdoor recreation each
year. Americans spend money, create jobs and support local communities when they
get outdoors. Simple healthy outdoor activities such as skiing, snowboarding, hiking,
biking or camping generate enormous economic power and a far-reaching ripple
effect that touches many of the nation’s major economic sectors.
Parks, open space and recreation create an attractive quality of life and contribute to
public health by encouraging physical activity and an appreciation of nature. We
emphasize a wide variety of outdoor winter and summer activities as outlined in the
goals and policies of this Element. Parks, open space, and recreational opportunities
in Mammoth Lakes are critical to our residents and to the success of our tourism-
