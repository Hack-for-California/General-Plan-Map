INTRODUCTION
The Sunnyvale General Plan
The General Plan responds to, and its authority derives from, California Government Code
Section 65302. It is the principal policy document that guides future conservation and
development of the city. Accordingly, the General Plan has a set of long-term goals and policies
and shorter-term “action statements” that guide local government decisions.
State law requires the General Plan to contain seven specific elements, including a housing
element. The 2015 Housing Element is consistent with the other six elements, also referred to as
chapters, of the General Plan. For example, the Community Vision Element establishes the
framework for many of the Housing Element’s goals and policies. The Land Use and
Transportation Element provides the basis for the residential sites inventory contained in the
Housing Element. The City will maintain consistency between the Housing Element and the
other General Plan elements so that policies introduced in one element are consistent with other
elements. Whenever any element of the General Plan is amended in the future, the Housing
Element will be reviewed and modified, if necessary, to ensure continued consistency.
The Housing Element
Under the requirements of California Housing Element law, local governments are required to
adequately plan for the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the
community. The law recognizes that in order for the private market to adequately address
housing needs and demand, local governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory systems
that provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing development. As a result,
State housing policy rests largely upon the effective implementation of local general plans and in
particular, local housing elements. Housing element statutes (Government Code §§ 65580-
65589.8, 65751-65761) also require the State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) to review local housing elements for compliance with State law and to
report its findings to the local government.
Housing element statutes require each city and county to develop local housing programs to meet
its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all income groups. The Association of
Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is responsible for developing and assigning these regional
housing needs allocations, or “RHNA”, to Bay Area jurisdictions. Pursuant to the current RHNA
planning period for the Bay Area, the Sunnyvale Housing Element is an eight-year plan for the
years 2015 through 2023.
Sunnyvale has long been a regional leader in addressing housing issues, enacting its Below
Market Rate (BMR) ordinance in 1980, followed by its Housing Mitigation Program in 1983.
Housing is one of the most difficult challenges facing cities in Silicon Valley. The need for more
affordable housing is critical: its symptoms surface in the shape of congested highways, the
number of homeless people, an exodus of young people and retirees from the area, and the
Housing Element                               Page 1

                                                                                       Introduction
challenges faced by local businesses in attracting new employees. Sunnyvale has also been active
in addressing issues of neighborhood quality. The continued vitality of the community depends,
in part, on the need to preserve and enhance its residential areas.
The City’s past achievements in housing and community revitalization have been recognized in
awards by the Bay Area Council, the Northern California Chapter of the American Planning
Association, and the California Chapter of the American Planning Association.
The policy basis for Sunnyvale’s current and future housing actions is this Housing Element of
the General Plan. The Element is divided into the following sections:
        Housing Needs Assessment – An evaluation of Sunnyvale’s demographic, household
         and housing stock characteristics, and existing and future regional housing needs
         (RHNA);
        Housing Constraints – An assessment of potential governmental and market constraints
         to the development and improvement of housing in Sunnyvale;
        Housing Resources – An evaluation of the availability of sites to address Sunnyvale’s
         regional housing growth needs. Financial and administrative resources for housing are
         also presented, as are opportunities for energy conservation and green building;
        Housing Plan – An evaluation of accomplishments under Sunnyvale’s adopted 2009
         Housing Element, and the City’s housing goals, policies, programs and quantified
         objectives for the 2015-2023 planning period.
Sunnyvale’s Housing Plan sets forth strategies and programs that focus on: 1) preserving and
improving housing and neighborhoods; 2) providing adequate housing sites; 3) assisting in the
provision of affordable housing; 4) removing governmental and other constraints to housing
investment; and 5) promoting fair and equal housing opportunities.

Public Participation
Opportunities for community stakeholders to provide input on housing issues and recommend
strategies are critical to the development of appropriate and effective programs to address
Sunnyvale’s housing needs. The City has solicited input from the public on housing issues
during development of the draft element and during public review of the draft element; and will
continue to do so during the adoption process.
The City solicited public input early in the stages of the development of the draft element in
several ways. On the City’s website, the City established a dedicated Housing Element Update
webpage. The webpage provided a current calendar of public meetings, as well as presentation
materials from each of the meetings, background information about the process, and a Housing
Needs survey for the public to fill out and submit to the City electronically or on paper.
The City held three public outreach meetings in July, August and October 2013 and conducted a
written public survey, both online and on paper in English and Spanish, to gather community
input for the needs assessment portion of the updated Housing Element. More than five hundred
survey responses were received, and the outreach meetings were well attended. The meetings
were promoted with articles in the city’s biweekly blog, posting on the City’s website, email
blasts to the Housing Division affordable housing subscribers, and direct outreach to a number of
local non-profit organizations, community and faith-based groups and other stakeholders.
Residents, housing developers, senior citizens, non-profit housing developers, community
groups, and various social service providers were also contacted directly by the City’s Housing
staff to encourage their attendance and input. The meetings focused on providing information to
the public about the housing element process and state requirements, the City’s demographics,
housing needs, current market data, and various housing programs currently offered by the city
and other regional agencies, as well as on soliciting input about current needs from those in
attendance. Questions raised by the attendees were answered to the extent possible, and
comments were noted.
The following issues were raised by members of the public at the community meetings and/or in
the public survey responses. A summary of public comments is contained in Appendix A. (Note:
These statements reflect the opinions of the individuals expressing them, not necessarily of
everyone in attendance at the meeting, or of City staff, consultants and/or officials):
     Rents have been increasing sharply and many long-time residents can no longer afford to
         rent here.
     Many people expressed a need for rent control.
     Concerns were raised about impacts of recent growth and development, such as increased
         traffic, noise, impacts on local schools.
     Lack of transportation infrastructure improvements accompanying new housing
         developments was a concern.
     Concerns noted about a shortage of affordable housing for people with developmental
         disabilities/autism. The number of young people with autism spectrum diagnoses has
         been increasing dramatically in recent years.

     Need to address increasing homeless population in the county, in particular the
        encampments along creeks and open space areas, particularly in San Jose and South
        County.
     Concerns were raised about the lack of adequate transitional shelters and supportive
        housing for homeless populations, including both families and those with mental health
        or substance abuse issues.
     Need to address affordability for people in the extremely low income group, earning
        annual incomes below $15,000, in particular developmentally disabled people, seniors on
        social security only, and homeless people.
     Evaluate opportunities for expanded infill, such as secondary dwelling units and/or
        redevelopment of older single-family homes with row housing
     Increased density throughout the City raises concerns about overcrowded schools, traffic,
        lack of open spaces and crime.
Following the community meetings, City staff revised the Needs Assessment portion of the
Housing Element and updated relevant data. A draft of the 2015 Housing Element was
published for public review and comment on May 23, 2014. The update process was discussed
at a joint study session with the Planning Commission and Housing and Human Services
Commission on May 12, 2014, and public hearings on the Draft 2015 Housing Element were
held by the Housing Commission on May 28, 2014; by the Planning Commission on June 9,
2014; and by Council on August 12, 2014. The purpose of these meetings was to inform the
City’s decision-makers of the major changes proposed to be made to the 2009Housing Element,
using the streamlined update process, and to get input from the commissions, and Council
approval of the updates, before submitting the Draft 2015 Housing Element to the State for initial
review. A summary of public input received during the public outreach phase and minutes of the
public hearings on the Draft are provided in Appendix A. Some of the topics discussed at the
joint study session on May 12th included:
   The challenge of creating new affordable rental units now that cities cannot impose
    inclusionary requirements on new rental projects, due to the Palmer court decision of 2009;
   The difficulty affordable housing developers face in trying to acquire new sites for affordable
    housing in the current very competitive real estate market;
   The possibility of charging impact fees on new rental housing to generate funds for
    affordable housing, and the required nexus study for any new fees;
   Potential options and strategies to address housing needs, such as secondary dwelling units or
    expanding inclusionary housing requirements;
   How Sunnyvale’s housing programs and accomplishments compare with those of
    neighboring communities;
   Possible anti-displacement policies to protect tenants of units to be demolished or renovated;
   Possible impacts of new development on schools, traffic, and other local resources.
Once the Draft 2015 Housing Element was published, it was also made available at public
locations throughout the community, including City Hall, the Sunnyvale Library, and on the
City’s website. It will also be sent to the State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) for review and comment following the public hearing at the August 12,
2014 Council meeting. After the State indicates the draft is in compliance with the law, public

hearings will be held before the Housing and Human Services and Planning Commissions and
Council before the new Housing Element is amended into the General Plan. A notice of public
hearing will be published in the local newspaper before each hearing, and interested groups and
individuals will be notified directly via mail or email, depending on request.

HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This chapter describes the characteristics of the City’s population and housing stock as a means
of better understanding the nature and extent of unmet housing needs. The Housing Needs
Assessment is comprised of the following components: Demographic Profile; Employment
Characteristics; Household Characteristics; Housing Stock Characteristics; and Regional
Housing Needs.
Demographic Profile
Population Trends
Table 1 presents population growth trends in Sunnyvale, and compares this growth to that of
neighboring cities and the County of Santa Clara as a whole. With a 2010 population of
140,081, Sunnyvale’s population grew by six percent between 2000 and 2010, comparable to the
county-wide growth rate during that decade. Between 2010 and 2013, the population grew by
four percent, to 145,973 in 2013, according to the California Department of Finance. Sunnyvale
continues to be the second most populous city in Santa Clara County, behind only San José,
which comprises over half the County’s population.

The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) produces population estimates as part of its
program of projecting future growth in the Bay Area. ABAG’s latest projections series,
Projections 2013, documents Sunnyvale’s 2010 population at 140,081, and projects a constant
eleven percent increase in population in each of the decades post-2010 (to 2020 and 2030),
resulting in an estimated 2030 City population of 174,700. ABAG projects the total county
population to grow at a similar rate to Sunnyvale, with an 11 percent increase projected between
2010 and 2020, and a 10.6 percent increase from 2020 to 2030. Two-thirds of the County’s
population growth in these decades is expected to occur within the City of Milpitas, just north of
San Jose.

Age Distribution
Table 2 summarizes the age distribution of the Sunnyvale population in 2000 and 2010, and
compares this with that of the County as a whole. While the City’s age distribution remained
relatively stable over the decade, like many communities nationwide, Sunnyvale’s population is
growing older. The median age, 34.3 in 2000, increased slightly to 35.6 years by 2010.
However, the proportion of the population aged 65 and older remained the same, at roughly
eleven percent of the total in 2000 and 2010. The population of seniors is projected to grow
during the planning period, as many of the “baby boomers” (the large group of people born
between 1946 and 1964) will have reached age 65 by 2023. This national demographic trend is
expected to affect Sunnyvale as well, although perhaps to a lesser extent, if the current trend of
recent retirees seeking more affordable and/or more desirable post-retirement housing
opportunities elsewhere continues.
Comparison of Sunnyvale’s age distribution with that of the County illustrates two distinct
differences. Young adults (25 to 44) comprise 36 percent of Sunnyvale’s population, compared
to only 31 percent Countywide. This predominance of young adults can largely be attributed to
the concentration of high tech and emerging technology industries in Sunnyvale, and the variety
of rental and ownership opportunities attractive to this age group. In contrast, school age children
(5 to 19) encompass only 16 percent of the population in Sunnyvale, versus 20 percent
Countywide. Sunnyvale’s lower proportion of family households, combined with the higher
incidence of single person households due to young local workforce, both contribute to the
slightly smaller proportion of children in the City’s population.

Ethnic Composition
Table 3 displays the racial composition of Sunnyvale’s population in 2000 and 2010, and
compares this with the distribution county-wide. Sunnyvale no longer has a single racial
majority, reflecting the increasing diversity of Santa Clara County and the greater Bay Area.
The Asian population increased to 41 percent of the City’s population by 2010. Table 3A shows
the percentage of the population of Hispanic ethnicity. Hispanic residents have grown to
comprise almost 20 percent of the City’s population, which is still less than the 27 percent
Hispanic population of the County.

Over half of Sunnyvale’s households speak a language other than English as the primary
language at home according to the 2012 American Community Survey. Of the 28 percent of
households (15,276 households) that primarily speak an Asian or Pacific Island language at
home, 38 percent of the adult members report that they speak English less than “very well”, and
are thus considered linguistically isolated. Of the 12 percent of households (6,478 households)
that speak primarily Spanish, 49 percent are linguistically isolated. Overcoming language and
cultural barriers to ensure that all residents have equal access to, and understanding of, available
housing opportunities is an important part of Sunnyvale’s comprehensive housing program.

Education
The overall educational level of Sunnyvale residents is very high and has been steadily
increasing (Table 4). Sixty percent of the City’s population aged 25 and older have a bachelor’s
degree or higher, compared to 47 percent in the County as a whole. In the past decade, the
number of Sunnyvale residents with post-graduate degrees increased from 21 to 27 percent, due
in part to the large number of highly educated immigrants and other skilled workers recruited to
fill high-tech or other knowledge-based jobs. While the number of non-English speaking
households increased during this period, the proportion of the adult population with no more than
a high school degree declined from 26 percent to 21 percent.

Employment Characteristics
Resident Labor Force
Evaluation of the types of jobs held by Sunnyvale residents provides insight into their potential
earning power and the type of housing they can likely afford. Information on the local workforce
and how it is changing over time can help estimate potential housing and employment needs in
the future.
According to estimates by the California Employment Development Department (EDD),
Sunnyvale had a labor force of 79,300 in 2013, with an average 5.8 percent unemployment rate
that year. In comparison, the unemployment rate averaged 6.8 percent in Santa Clara County
and 8.9 percent statewide in 2013. California’s average annual unemployment rate in 2013
dropped by 1.5 percent from the prior year (2012), reflecting the state’s continuing recovery
from the 2008-09 recession.
Table 5 presents the major occupational categories of employed Sunnyvale residents, according
to the 2010 Census. Residents employed in management, business, science and arts (57%)
accounted for the largest share of employed residents, followed by those employed in sales and
office occupations (21%). Together, these two categories accounted for nearly 80 percent of
resident employment.

Although the number of employed residents in the City nearly matches the number of jobs in the
City, as described in the following section, most employed local residents work outside of
Sunnyvale. According to recent Census estimates, nearly three out of four employed Sunnyvale
residents aged 16 years or older (74.4%) worked at a primary place of employment located
outside of Sunnyvale during the five-year period between 2006 and 2010. Slightly over 25% of
Sunnyvale employed adults worked within the city limits during this period, according to those
estimates. Table 6 shows the place of employment of all Sunnyvale residents in the workforce
during that time, according to the Census.

             (Workers 16 years and over). Sunnyvale data extracted and summarized by City staff.
The same Census data summarized in Table 6 also estimates that more than one thousand
Sunnyvale residents were employed within each of the following cities between 2006 and 2010,
listed in descending order of Sunnyvale residents employed within each city: Sunnyvale
(17,190), San José (11,900), Santa Clara (7,470), Mountain View (6,840), Palo Alto (4,980),
Cupertino (3,460), Redwood City (1,695), Milpitas (1,475), Menlo Park (1,450), Fremont
(1,100), and San Francisco (1,035). The remaining nearly 8,500 Sunnyvale adults in the
workforce were employed in other cities throughout the State, primarily within the Bay Area.
Given the very fast pace of change of office locations and jobs in the Silicon Valley, and the
number of job losses and then new hiring that occurred during and after the recent recession,
the city-specific numbers may already be outdated. However, the general proportion of
Sunnyvale residents working within versus outside of the City or the County from year to year is
likely to be more stable over time than the precise city of employment, and reflects a regional
pattern of commuting across jurisdictional boundaries which is highly typical of the Bay Area, as
evidenced by local and regional traffic flows.
Local Employment Base
During the last two decades of the twentieth century, Sunnyvale’s local employment base shifted
from one of primarily blue-collar industrial jobs to one of primarily white-collar jobs. Between
1980 and 2000, the City lost 23,000 manufacturing and wholesale jobs, while the number of
service-sector jobs grew by 140 percent. Much of the service-sector growth occurred during the
high-tech boom of the 1990’s, when Sunnyvale became known as the Heart of the Silicon
Valley. The number of jobs located in the City peaked in 1999-2000, at 99,290 jobs according to
ABAG estimates, as shown on Figure 2 below.
The rapid increase in jobs in the Silicon Valley abruptly reversed direction in late 2000 with the
“dot-com bust.” The job market recovered somewhat between 2004 and 2006, and then declined
sharply again in late 2008 and 2009 during the major national recession. Substantial job losses
were widespread throughout the Silicon Valley during both of these downturns. In 2005, an
estimated 73,630 jobs were located in Sunnyvale (ABAG Projections 2009).
By 2010, the number of jobs in Sunnyvale increased slightly to 74,610, according to ABAG
estimates. Recent Census data indicates that there were 82,030 jobs in the City in 2011, of which

                                                                             Housing Needs Assessment
78,309 were primary jobs (U.S. Census Bureau, Longitudinal-Employer Household Dynamics
Program, 2013). ABAG recently projected that the number of jobs in Sunnyvale will grow
slightly to 86,740 by 2020, an increase of 16 percent over ten years, and then increase by 4
percent over the next decade, to 90,160 by 2030 (ABAG Projections 2013).

Translating ABAG’s long-range projection to an average annual growth rate of approximately
690 jobs per year, Sunnyvale’s local employment base could reasonably be expected to grow by
about 5,500 jobs during the eight-year housing element planning period of 2015-2023. This is a
very rough estimate, however, given that employment generally rises and falls sharply with
periodic economic boom and bust cycles, as was clearly the case between 2000 and 2010, rather
than increasing at a steady annual rate.
Major Employers in Sunnyvale
As is typical in larger cities in the Silicon Valley, most of the largest employers in Sunnyvale are
technology firms, although the single largest company remains a defense/space industry
company, Lockheed Martin Space Systems, reflecting the region’s historic defense industry
cluster, attracted by proximity to military and NASA facilities such as Moffett Field and the
now-decommissioned Onizuka Air Force Station, as well as a steady supply of highly educated
engineers from nearby universities. The largest industry clusters today are in software, computer
hardware, innovation services, biomedical, and electronic components. The ten largest employers
in Sunnyvale are shown in Table 7 below, according to employment data gathered in August

Despite the presence of many high-wage jobs, wages for the most common occupations in the
county vary widely. Median annual wages for all occupations with at least 10,000 employed
within the county, and their respective household income levels, are shown in Table 8.

Jobs and Housing
Employment trends affect planning for housing. If a city or region such as the Silicon Valley
does not have enough housing units to house the workers employed in the city or region, the cost
of housing is pushed up as people compete for the limited number of units. Workers who can’t
afford local housing prices must find housing elsewhere and commute longer distances to work,
increasing traffic congestion on major freeways and arterials, and contributing to air quality
degradation. As a means of mitigating the impact of job growth on the demand for affordable
housing, Sunnyvale requires intense job-producing commercial and industrial development to
pay into a Housing Mitigation Fund.
Jobs/housing balance is defined as the ratio of number of jobs to number of housing units in a
given area. Although the term “jobs/housing balance” is still often used, the more precise
relationship is between jobs and the number of employed residents (because some households
have no workers, while others have multiple workers). Jobs and housing are considered to be
balanced when there are an equal number of employed residents and jobs within a given area,
with a ratio of approximately 1.0. In 2010, ABAG estimates indicate that Sunnyvale had a
balanced jobs-to-employed residents ratio at 1.0, similar to the county-wide ratio of 1.1 (Table
8). However, the high jobs-to-employed residents ratio in neighboring cities (2.9 in Palo Alto,
1.9 in Santa Clara, and 1.8 in Los Gatos) can also impact the demand for housing in Sunnyvale.
Over the next three decades, ABAG projects Sunnyvale’s jobs-to-employed residents ratio will
remain fairly stable. However, as Table 9 indicates, although the ratio may be 1:1, the majority
of City residents work outside of the city, and the majority of local workers commute in.
However most of this commuting appears to be within the county, so distances are not that great.

Sunnyvale has a goal within its Housing Element Plan to maintain a local balance of jobs and
housing. Policies designed to implement this goal include maintaining data on the jobs/housing
ratio, continuing to require office and industrial developers to mitigate the demand for housing

created by their projects, and continuing to encourage a mix of residential and employment-
generating land uses.
ABAG Jobs-Housing Connection
As mentioned above, in May 2012 the ABAG Executive Board adopted a Jobs-Housing
Connection Strategy which projects the amount of housing and job growth anticipated to occur
throughout the Bay Area between 2010 and 2040. The Executive Summary of the ABAG Jobs-
Housing Connection Strategy is provided in Appendix D.

Household Characteristics
Household type and size, income levels, and the size and types of special needs populations all
affect the type of housing needed by residents. This section describes the various household
characteristics contributing to housing needs in Sunnyvale.
Household Type
A household is defined as all persons living in a housing unit. Families are a type of households
and include people related by blood, marriage, or adoption who live together. A single person
living alone is also a household. “Other” types of households are unrelated people residing in
the same dwelling unit. People living in group quarters, such as dormitories or convalescent
homes, are not counted as households, but are counted as a separate category
According to the 2010 Census, 53,384 households reside in Sunnyvale, with an average
household size of 2.61 persons. This represents a smaller average household size than that of the
County overall (2.90), and reflects Sunnyvale’s higher incidence of single-person households
and lower proportion of family households.
As shown on Table 10 below, families comprise the majority of households in Sunnyvale (66%),
including families with children (33%), and those without children (33%). During the 2000s, the
proportion of households in Sunnyvale comprised of families with children increased by five
percent. Over three-quarters of the City’s household growth between 2000 and 2010 resulted
from an increase in family households. Nonetheless, Sunnyvale continues to have a higher
proportion of single-person households (25%) than the County (22%), largely related to the
City’s employment base of high technology and emerging industry firms which employs many
younger single adults. These household data support the need for smaller, higher density and
mixed-use units close to transportation and services, as well as larger housing types suitable for
families.

Household Income
Household income is the most important factor affecting housing opportunity, as it determines a
household’s ability to afford its preferred type and location of housing, and to balance housing
costs with other basic necessities of life. Income levels can vary considerably among households
based on age, number of workers per household, education level, type of employment, and/or
race and ethnicity, among other factors.
The State and Federal government classify household income into several levels based upon the
relationship to the County “Area Median Income” (AMI), adjusted for household size. The State
of California utilizes the income levels presented in Table 11. However, certain federal (HUD)
housing programs utilize slightly different income levels and definitions, with the highest income
level eligible for HUD programs limited to 80% AMI. For purposes of the Housing Element, the
State income definitions are used throughout, except where data has been compiled by HUD and
is specifically noted.

Based on projections from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) for the year 2013,
the median household income of Sunnyvale residents was estimated at $93,292 for all
households. As illustrated in Table 12, median household income in Sunnyvale was just slightly
higher than that of the County, and similar to that of Mountain View and Milpitas.

Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of Sunnyvale households in the lower income groups
(0% to 80% AMI) increased from 25 to 28 percent of the total. As shown in Table 13, the City’s
household income distribution has remained relatively stable over the past decade, with only a
slight increase in the proportion of very low income households, and a slight decrease in the
proportion of low and moderate, and above-moderate income households.

Table 14 shows the estimated income levels of Sunnyvale households by housing tenure. As
could be expected, a higher percentage of renter households (33%) were lower income (<80%
AMI) compared to residents who owned their homes (22%). The presence of approximately
6,820 extremely low and very low income renter households is of particular significance as
market rents in Sunnyvale exceed the level of affordability for these households. A high level of
housing overpayment is verified by the 2010 census which estimated that 69 percent of very low
income renters spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing in 2010. The Census
estimates the median income of Sunnyvale’s renter households was $86,252, compared to
$119,214 for homeowners.

While renters were more likely to have very low incomes than owners, there is also significant
variation in income levels by household type, as presented in Table 15. Well over half (57%) of
elderly households in Sunnyvale have lower incomes, with one-quarter having extremely low
incomes. As seniors are typically on fixed incomes, an increase in rents can have a considerable
impact on extremely low income senior renters. Senior homeowners with extremely low incomes
- many of whom reside in Sunnyvale’s mobile home parks – also face significant needs related to
maintaining their homes. One factor that is not reflected by household income estimates is total

net worth, which includes assets, which many homeowners, particularly long-time senior home
owners, have in the form of substantial equity in their homes. Many single family homes in the
City are worth more than $1 million. This equity can be tapped into to meet some household
needs through mechanisms such as reverse mortgages or downsizing to smaller housing such as
condominiums.

Special Needs Populations
State law recognizes that certain households have more difficulty finding decent and affordable
housing due to special circumstances. Special needs populations defined by HUD include the
elderly, persons with disabilities, female-headed households, large households, homeless persons
and farmworkers. Table 16 summarizes the number of special needs households in Sunnyvale.
Each of these population groups, as well as their housing needs, is described below.

Senior Households
Senior citizens have several major concerns which impact their housing needs:
      Income: People over 65 are usually retired and living on a limited income;
      Health Care: Because the elderly have a higher rate of illness and dependency, health
         care and supportive housing is important;
      Transportation: Many seniors use public transit. However, some seniors with severe
         mobility limitations, or very frail seniors, may require para-transit or taxi services such as
         Outreach.
      Housing: Many seniors live alone and rent. Homeowners may have a difficult time
         maintaining their homes.
Seniors (age 65 and above) comprise 11 percent of Sunnyvale’s residents, and represent a
growing segment of the City’s population. About 17 percent of all households are headed by a
senior, three-quarters of which are homeowners. Nearly forty percent of the City’s households
headed by a senior consist of one senior living alone. Over one third of elderly residents in
Sunnyvale have some type of disability for self-care or mobility, which may limit their ability to
live independently. There are at least 7,000 persons above the age of 75 in Sunnyvale who may
soon need supportive housing, assisted living, or in-home services such as a live-in aide.
The possibility of rising rents is of particular concern to senior renters, due to the fact that most
seniors are on limited incomes. Of Sunnyvale’s 2,224 senior renter households, over 70 percent
are lower income. Three-quarters of these lower-income senior renters pay more than 30 percent
of their incomes on housing. As shown in Table 25, Sunnyvale has four senior housing projects
providing 423 rental units affordable to very low and low income households. A new senior
apartment complex was developed by Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition in 2011, known as the
Fair Oaks senior housing project, located next to the County’s Valley Health Center. The State of
California Community Care Licensing Division identified 35 residential care homes for the
elderly in Sunnyvale, which provide nearly 800 beds for seniors age 60+ who require 24-hour
care. As of May 15, 2014, 346 lower income seniors in Sunnyvale received Section 8 rental
subsidies from the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Clara. Of that total, 224 seniors
received portable, tenant-based vouchers and 122 were living in rental units assisted with
project-based vouchers.
For those seniors who live on their own, many have limited incomes and, due to lack of funds,
frailty or physical limitations, some seniors may not be able to maintain their homes or perform
minor repairs. Furthermore, the installation of grab bars and other assistance devices in the
home may be needed. The City provides a Housing Rehabilitation Program that provides low
interest loans and grants to assist lower income homeowners in making needed repairs or
accessibility improvements. Mobile homes are also eligible for rehabilitation assistance, a large
number of which are occupied by seniors.
In 2003, Sunnyvale consolidated its various community programs for seniors into a single,
23,000 square foot state-of-the art senior center. The center was designed to promote physical,
mental and emotional health, independence and socialization to meet the needs of individuals
aged 50 years and older. More than 3,000 members participate in a wide variety of activities,
Housing Element                                 Page 22

                                                                          Housing Needs Assessment
including over 200 recreational classes, a daily lunch program, health services, and case
management services in collaboration with the Silicon Valley Council on Aging.
In addition to services offered through the Senior Center, the City funds a variety of programs
which provide housing-related supportive services for seniors, including:
     Long Term Care Ombudsman Program. Provides ombudsmen who advocate for elderly
        residents of skilled nursing facilities and residential board and care homes.
     Adult Day Care. Provides day care for elderly and dependent seniors.
     Senior Adult Legal Assistance. Provides legal assistance and advocacy services to lower
        income seniors.
     Senior Nutrition. Provides subsidized hot meals five days per week at the Senior
        Nutrition site at First Methodist Church.
     Meals on Wheels. Provides hot meals and supportive services to homebound seniors.
Persons with Disabilities
A disability is defined as a long lasting condition that impairs an individual’s mobility, ability to
work, or ability to perform self-care. Persons with disabilities include those with physical,
mental, developmental, or emotional disabilities. Severely disabled people often have special
housing needs because they often have limited incomes, there is a shortage of affordable and/or
accessible housing, or they may have higher health care costs due to their disability.
According to the 2012 American Community Survey, an estimated 7 percent of Sunnyvale’s
residents (9,553 persons) have one or more disabilities. Approximately 6,300 of the City’s
disabled residents have a physical disability, 3,300 have a mental disability, and 2,162 residents
have a mobility/self-care limitation that requires assistance in daily living. Of the City’s senior
population, approximately one-third have one or more types of disabilities. According to the San
Andreas Regional Center, as of October 2013 there were 773 adults with developmental
disabilities living in Sunnyvale.
The living arrangements for people with disabilities depend on the severity of the disability.
Many disabled persons live at home in an independent environment with the help of other family
members. To maintain independent living, disabled persons may require some assistance. This
can include special housing design features for the physically disabled, income support for those
who are unable to work, and in-home supportive services for persons with serious medical
conditions. The Silicon Valley Independent Living Center, a countywide agency that conducts
housing referrals for disabled people, receives more than 300 requests per year for help securing
accessible housing for disabled people. However, only about 20 percent of these people can
actually be placed because of the shortage of appropriate units. A significant percentage of the
disabled population is of lower income and cannot afford market rate rents. The Santa Clara
Housing Authority reported in 2008 that 124 Sunnyvale residents with disabilities receive
Section 8 rent vouchers, with an additional 202 disabled residents on the waiting list for
assistance.
Housing Element                                 Page 23

                                                                         Housing Needs Assessment
Sunnyvale provided capital funding some years ago for two apartment complexes, Page Mill
Court in Palo Alto and Stoney Pine Apartments in Sunnyvale, that provide accessible and
affordable housing for developmentally disabled adults; together these two complexes provide
45 units. Another facility, Greater Opportunities, houses 12 to 15 developmentally disabled
adults. In addition, the Pacific Autism Center for Education (PACE) operates two facilities
which house six autistic adults and six autistic children. The State Community Care Licensing
Division identifies six adult residential facilities in Sunnyvale that provide 24-hour non-medical
care for adults ages 18-59 who are unable to provide for their own daily needs; these six facilities
together provide capacity for 60 adults.
Other resources available to Sunnyvale residents with disabilities include:
      City of Sunnyvale Home Access Program: grants for residential accessibility
         improvements
      Silicon Valley Independent Living Center: case management, legal counseling, service
         and housing referrals
      Abilities United: services for persons with developmental disabilities
      Senior Nutrition Program: serves low-income disabled adults and seniors
      Meals on Wheels/The Health Trust: serves hot meals to homebound frail or disabled of
         all ages
      Housing Choices Coalition: helps people with developmental disabilities obtain housing
Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households typically need services as childcare and affordable health care.
Female-headed households with children in particular tend to have lower incomes than two-
parent families, which limits their housing options and access to private services such as nursery
schools, day care, and recreational activities for their children. The 2010 Census reported 4,629
female-headed households in Sunnyvale, over a third of which have children. Of the 1,960
female-headed households with children, 49 percent lived in poverty, the highest poverty rate for
any population group in Sunnyvale, compared to a poverty rate of 4.5 percent for the entire City
population. In addition, female-headed households may encounter subtle forms of housing
discrimination.
Two programs currently available in Sunnyvale specifically help to address the housing needs of
female-headed households. The fair housing and landlord-tenant mediation programs operated
by Project Sentinel helps female-headed households obtain and maintain housing in the
community, particularly important as child-related discrimination complaints represent a large
proportion of the fair housing complaints reported in Sunnyvale.
The Santa Clara Housing Authority offers a Family Self-Sufficiency program for Section 8
participants to help low-income, single parents achieve economic independence from
governmental assistance. Through public and private agency participation, beneficiaries have
access to resources such as housing subsidies, childcare, education, job training, transportation,
and a variety of other benefits. NOVA, the North Valley Workforce Investment Board, also
offers free career development and job-seeking assistance and training that may be accessed by
lower-income women.

Large Households
Large households are defined as households with five or more members. These households are
typically identified as a group with special housing needs based on the limited availability of
adequately sized, affordable housing units. The shortage of large units is especially evident
among rental units. Large households often live in overcrowded conditions, due to both the lack
of large enough units, and insufficient income to afford available units of adequate size.
Sunnyvale is home to 5,058 large households, 52 percent (2,624) of which are renter households.
According to HUD’s CHAS calculations, 85 percent of Sunnyvale’s large renter households face
one or more housing problems, including housing overpayment, overcrowding and/or
substandard conditions. Future housing studies will attempt to address these issues as best as
possible.
RealFacts documented approximately 412 rental units with three or more bedrooms in large
apartment complexes of 50 or more units. In general, these units are the appropriate size for large
households with five or more members. Additional rental units with three or more bedrooms are
available among the City’s many townhomes and single-family homes, many of which are rented
out. The City has 2,624 large renter households, indicating that Sunnyvale has an adequate
supply of rental units to house its large families. However, many of the City’s large rental units
are in single-family homes, and with 3-bedroom apartments commanding median rents of
$3,100, the affordability of Sunnyvale’s large rental units remains an issue.
Homelessness
In January 2013, the cities of Santa Clara County and the County jointly sponsored a two-day
homeless census to assess the size of the homeless population. The 2013 Santa Clara County
Homeless Census and Survey involved two components: 1) a point-in-time count of street and
sheltered homeless, both youth and adults, and 2) a qualitative homeless survey, which resulted
in 856 completed surveys of a representative sample. The comprehensive, two-day homeless
count identified approximately 5,674 homeless people on the streets, and an additional 1,957
homeless persons in emergency shelters, transitional housing, and domestic violence shelters.
Key findings of the homeless count and supplementary surveys include:
     More than half of homeless survey respondents had been homeless for more than one
        year, with 20% homeless for more than 3 years.
     Just over half of the County’s homeless were living in vehicles and encampments.
     40% of survey respondents indicated the primary cause of their homelessness was due to
        the loss of a job, with 17% indicating alcohol or drug use was the primary factor.
     Over 60% of the unsheltered homeless people were men, and 1% were families.
     Approximately 25% of respondents indicated they were experiencing a physical
        disability. 25% indicated they were experiencing mental illness.
Within the City of Sunnyvale, the 2013 Homeless Survey identified 425 homeless people,
including 283 unsheltered people in street locations or cars/RV’s/vans or encampments, and 142
people in shelters. The vast majority of homeless in Sunnyvale were individuals, with only 18
persons in families. The Countywide Homeless Survey conducted in 2011 identified 374
Housing Element                               Page 25

                                                                         Housing Needs Assessment
homeless people in Sunnyvale.           Local service providers acknowledge an increase in
homelessness in recent years. The Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety reported making 259
arrests during FY 2012/2013 of persons who provided a residence of “transient” (this includes
the number of arrests, with some persons arrested more than one time).
There are three major types of facilities that provide shelter for homeless individuals and
families: emergency shelters, transitional housing, and permanent supportive housing. These
types of facilities are defined below:
         Emergency Shelter: provides overnight shelter and fulfills a client’s basic needs (i.e.
            food, a place to sleep, shower and/or restroom facilities) either on-site or through off-
            site services. The permitted length of stay can vary from one day to two months,
            depending upon whether the shelter is short-term or long-term. Current best practices
            for addressing homelessness include shifting away from the use of emergency
            shelters and toward homelessness prevention and rapid-rehousing. This shift has
            been occurring within the County.
         Transitional Housing: a residence that provides housing for up to two years.
            Residents of transitional housing are usually connected to rehabilitative services,
            including substance abuse treatment, mental health care, employment services,
            individual and group counseling and life skills training.
         Permanent Supportive Housing: refers to permanent service-enriched affordable
            housing that is linked with on-going supportive services (on-site or off-site) and is
            designed to allow formerly homeless clients to live at the facility on an indefinite
            basis.
A number of regional service providers serve homeless people throughout the County and in
Sunnyvale, including HomeFirst of Santa Clara County (formerly EHC), InnVision-Shelter
Network, West Valley Community Services, Sunnyvale Community Services, and Downtown
Streets Team. The City of Sunnyvale provides funding to most of these agencies through its
CDBG and human services grant programs. The City has also provided funding in prior years to
create a number of transitional housing facilities, including two group homes in Sunnyvale
operated by Momentum for Mental Health (Arbor and Duane Houses), a group home in
Sunnyvale for youth aging out of foster care operated by Bill Wilson Center (Socorro House), a
mid-size apartment complex for young adults in Santa Clara operated by Bill Wilson Center
(Peacock Commons), and a four-plex in Cupertino for survivors of domestic violence (Maitri).
The City recently awarded funds to rehabilitate a maternity group home in Santa Clara. The City
has also been funding a transitional Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) program for two
years that primarily serves homeless and at-risk households to help them secure permanent
housing. Additional facilities located in North County and San Jose are shown in Table 17
below. Two permanent supportive housing projects with a total of 117 units are currently under
development in Sunnyvale with over $10 million in financing from the City. In addition, a
coalition of faith-based groups operates a rotating shelter program that provides shelter, food and
case management to 15 homeless men at a time. The shelter rotates among various houses of
worship in Sunnyvale and Cupertino.

The City of Sunnyvale participates in the local continuum of care, the Santa Clara County
Collaborative on Affordable Housing and Homeless Issues, in its efforts to end homelessness.
The Collaborative is staffed by the County and comprised of local jurisdictions, shelter and
service providers, housing advocates and non-profit housing developers. This group serves as an
effective forum for attracting additional funding sources and creating affordable housing for
homeless and persons at risk of homelessness. Recently the continuum has merged with
Destination:Home in an effort to find a more formal organizational structure. The City of
Sunnyvale provides financial support to the following activities that help homeless people
housed, employed, or obtain other income sources:
     WorkFirst Sunnyvale: This program, funded primarily by the City’s CDBG grant, is a
        partnership of Sunnyvale Community Services and Downtown Streets Team. It provides
        a volunteer work-readiness program, job-search training, supportive services and case

Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
seasonal agricultural labor and have special housing needs because of their relatively low
incomes and the unstable nature of their work. The 2011 American Community Survey
identifies 226 Sunnyvale residents employed in agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting and mining
occupations. It is unlikely most of these residents are farmworkers. No parcels in the City are
currently zoned for agricultural use, nor are there farms known to currently employ farmworkers
(i.e., workers other than the land owner’s family members or volunteers). It is possible a
significant portion of these residents work in the nearby quarry in Cupertino which is one of the
few mining operations in the area.
The City owns two orchards which are farmed on the City’s behalf by a local resident as part of a
City demonstration orchard (park). The former “Corn Palace” farm has been subdivided, and
half of the acreage has been developed into approximately fifty homes, and the other half is
expected to be developed with housing within the coming planning period. Given that there are
so few persons employed in agricultural-related industries, the City can address the housing
needs of farmworkers through its general housing programs.

Housing Stock Characteristics
This section identifies the characteristics of Sunnyvale’s physical housing stock. This includes an
analysis of housing growth trends, housing conditions, housing prices and affordability.
Housing Growth
Table 18 displays housing production in the City, compared to neighboring cities and the entire
Santa Clara County region. Between 2000 and 2010, Sunnyvale’s housing stock increased by 4
percent, lower than the housing growth levels Countywide and within the City of Santa Clara. In
the 3 years since 2010, housing growth in Sunnyvale has been a modest 2 percent, slightly higher
than in most surrounding jurisdictions and Countywide.
Sunnyvale has a current (2013) housing stock of 56,898 units, which increased by approximately
3,200 units from 2000 to 2013. To address the need for additional housing in the community,
Sunnyvale has implemented several planning tools to provide expanded sites for development.
In 2003, the City adopted an update to its Downtown Specific Plan, providing land use
designations to accommodate up to 2,000 additional high density and mixed use units. As part of
its “Industrial to Residential” (ITR) program, the City has encouraged the redevelopment of
approximately 320 acres of industrial land to residential use, accommodating up to 7,700
housing units, with over 2,000 units already approved and/or built.

Housing Type and Tenure
Table 19 presents the mix of housing types in Sunnyvale. Of the City’s over 56,000 housing
units in 2013, 47 percent were single-family units, including single-family detached homes
(38%), and single-family attached units consisting of townhome style units (9%). A nearly equal
number of Sunnyvale’s housing consists of multi-family units (46%), including duplexes,
triplexes and apartments and condominiums. Sunnyvale also has 16 mobile home parks with
approximately 4,000 mobile home units, comprising 7 percent of the City’s housing.

Housing tenure refers to whether a housing unit is owned, rented or is vacant. Tenure is an
important indicator of the housing market of a community, reflecting the relative costs of
housing opportunities, and the ability of residents to afford housing. Tenure also influences
residential mobility, with owner-occupied units generally considered to have lower turnover rates
than rental housing, although this is not always the case. The homeownership rate in Sunnyvale
declined from 51 percent in 1980, to 48 percent in 2000, to 45% in 2012. This rate of
homeownership is lower than Santa Clara County as a whole (57%) and the state (55%).
Approximately 20 percent of Sunnyvale’s single-family attached and detached homes are renter-
occupied.
Vacancy Rate
A vacancy rate measures the overall housing availability in a community and is often a good
indicator of how efficiently for-sale and rental housing units are meeting the current demand for
housing. A vacancy rate of five percent for rental housing and two percent for ownership
housing is generally considered healthy and suggests that there is a balance between the demand
and supply of housing. A lower vacancy rate often leads to rising rents and sales prices, and can
contribute to household overcrowding.
Current apartment vacancy rates in Sunnyvale were obtained from RealFacts, a service providing
contract rents in properties containing 50 or more units. A total of 14,654 rental units are
included in the survey, comprising over half the apartment units in Sunnyvale. RealFacts
documents the following vacancy rates in Sunnyvale over the past five years:
                           4th Quarter:          Vacancy Rate:

As evidenced by this data, apartment vacancies have fluctuated since 2009, and with a 5.4
percent rate as of 4th quarter 2013, vacancy rates are just above the ideal 5 percent needed for
adequate mobility.
Housing Age and Condition
The age of a community’s housing stock can provide a general indicator of overall housing
conditions. In general, housing units over 30 years in age are likely to exhibit signs of
rehabilitation needs, such as new roofing, foundation work, and new plumbing. Table 20
displays the age of Sunnyvale’s housing stock, and indicates that approximately 40,000 housing
units have reached the 30-year age threshold. Older housing represents a significant portion of
the housing stock in Sunnyvale. However, many of these homes have been remodeled,
expanded, rebuilt and/or renovated by their owners, as the City frequently issues building
permits for such projects. The historic low interest rates prevalent since 2008 have allowed
many homeowners to self-finance such projects, and the amount of resale activity also generates
a significant amount of housing rehabilitation and upgrades as sellers wish to improve their
homes to achieve the best possible price, or new buyers wish to upgrade their homes. Most
homes in Sunnyvale appear well-maintained and in good condition despite their age.

Housing Conditions Survey
The most recent formal city-wide survey of housing conditions was conducted in the summer of
2008; although this information is somewhat dated, it still provides a generally accurate picture
of the relative condition of housing throughout Sunnyvale, and as mentioned above, a significant
amount of renovation activity has occurred since that time. The windshield survey rated housing
stock conditions by recording the number of properties in each neighborhood with code
violations pertaining to maintenance standards.
Housing Element                                Page 32

                                                                         Housing Needs Assessment
Compared to many cities, the condition of housing in Sunnyvale is very good. The survey found
that 457 out of 4,294 homes, or 13% of properties assessed, had two or more code violations and
did not meet standards for property maintenance. The majority of the violations were landscape
maintenance violations, followed by structural violations such as illegal car ports, sheds, room
additions or patio covers.
Based on observations made by the City’s Neighborhood Preservation staff, housing conditions
in Sunnyvale have generally improved since the 2008 conditions survey. Since Neighborhood
Preservation is no longer required to do the housing conditions survey, staff uses The National
Citizen Survey to document citizen concerns. According to the 2013 National Citizen Survey,
81% of respondents felt the overall appearance of Sunnyvale was “excellent” or “good”, and
only 3% thought run-down buildings, weed lots or junk vehicles were a “major” problem. These
results put Sunnyvale above the national benchmark. In addition, the City began implementing
the Neighborhood Enhancement Program in 2002, focusing on code compliance and housing
rehabilitation improvements in single-family neighborhoods showing signs of distress. The City
targets one new neighborhood per year under this program, averaging between 200-230 homes.
To assist lower-income homeowners to make major repairs to their homes, the City offers
housing rehabilitation loans for owner-occupied homes, including mobile home, as well as some
small grants and loans for minor improvements including paint, accessibility, and emergency
repairs, and also provides rental rehabilitation loans to owners of affordable rental housing.
The Neighborhood Enhancement Action Team (NEAT), a program which began in 2009,
similarly targets certain neighborhoods each year in an effort to improve the quality of life for
residents. The City surveys property owners, business owners and residents of the neighborhood
to identify priority concerns including issues such as lighting, property maintenance, sidewalk
conditions, public safety, and vehicle storage. The Neighborhood Preservation staff finds that
the main issues identified in recent years tend to be related to crime or crime prevention, not
home maintenance issues.
Housing Costs and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems in a community. If
housing costs are relatively high in comparison to household income, there will be a
correspondingly higher prevalence of overpayment and overcrowding. This section summarizes
the cost and affordability of the housing stock to Sunnyvale residents.
Sales Prices and Rent Trends
For purposes of the Housing Element, it is important to evaluate housing cost data over a longer,
one-year time frame. Information on all sales of existing and new single-family homes and
condominiums in Sunnyvale from calendar year 2013 is provided in Table 21. A total of 572
single-family home sales were recorded during this period, commanding a median sales price of
$1,012,500. 401 condominiums were sold in Sunnyvale in 2013 with a median price of
$643,500. Condominiums help to fill a need for smaller or less expensive ownership housing in
the City. Although new condominiums tend to be priced in the above-moderate range at this
point in time, smaller, older resale condominiums often fall in the moderate price range, and

                                                                               Housing Needs Assessment
during the recession years, many new condominiums were also affordable to moderate-income
buyers.
Home foreclosures had a major impact on housing sales throughout the State beginning in late
2008 and lasting through approximately 2011. In Sunnyvale, the impacts of the foreclosure crisis
were much less severe than in other parts of the State or even other parts of the county. Demand
remained strong during the recession, and although there were some foreclosures and prices
softened across the board, particularly in 2009-10, most distressed homes were purchased by
investors or other buyers relatively quickly. By December of 2013, Realtytrac.com identified 89
homes in various states of distress: 8 bank-owned properties, 57 defaults, and 24 trustee sales.
This represents approximately two percent of all properties in the County in foreclosure. In
contrast, ReReport.com, based on multiple listing service data on closed and active sales,
reported that in all of calendar year 2013, only 9 homes in Sunnyvale were foreclosed upon, 21
homes were sold through short sale, and two active short sale listings were on the market as of
the end of the year. These numbers represent essentially a return to historic normal rates of
foreclosure which are no longer dampening home prices, as evidenced by the current situation in
which Sunnyvale condominiums are selling for an average of nearly 10% over asking price and
Sunnyvale single-family homes are selling for 14% over asking price. (Rereport.com, Sunnyvale
sales price vs. listing price ratios, April 2014).

The City obtained data from RealFacts on average asking rents for over 14,000 apartment units
in Sunnyvale. As indicated in Table 22, during the 4th quarter of 2013, the average asking rents
in these complexes ranged from $1,481 for a studio, $1,950 for a one-bedroom, $2,104 for a two-
bedroom, and $3,092 for a three-bedroom unit. In comparison to the rent survey conducted in
these same apartment complexes one year earlier (4th quarter 2012), rent levels had increased by
an average of 11 percent. Similarly during the 2011-2012 period, rent levels increased by an
average of thirteen percent, reflecting the current very competitive rental market across the Bay
Area.

Housing Affordability
The affordability of housing in Sunnyvale can be assessed by comparing market rents and sales
prices with the amount that households of different income levels can afford to pay for housing.
This information can reveal who can afford what size and type of housing.
Standards for affordable owner and rental housing costs as follows:
        Affordable Home Ownership
             Housing costs consist of mortgage payments, homeowner association dues,
                insurance, utility allowance and property taxes.
             Housing costs are considered affordable for homebuyers if they do not exceed
                35% of the defined household income.
             Affordable costs for moderate income households are based on standard of 120%
                of Area Median Income (AMI), where the household is assumed to have one more
                person than the number of bedrooms in the unit.
        Affordable Rental Housing
             Housing costs include rent plus utilities paid for by the tenant.
             Rents are considered affordable if they do not exceed 30% of the defined
                household income.
             Affordable rents are based on a standard of 50% of AMI for very low income
                households; 80% of AMI for low income households; and 120% AMI for
                moderate income households, assuming the household size equals one more
                person than the number of bedrooms in the unit.
Based on these definitions of income and affordable housing cost, Table 23 presents the
maximum affordable purchase price for moderate income households (120% AMI), and
compares this with market sales prices for single-family homes and condominiums in Sunnyvale
as previously documented in Table 20. As illustrated by this table, median single-family home
prices in Sunnyvale are well beyond the level of affordability for moderate income households.
For example, the maximum affordable purchase price for a moderate-income, four-person
household was $547,400 in 2013, whereas the median price of a single-family home in
Sunnyvale was $1,012,500 at that time, an affordability gap of $465,100.
Condominium sales prices, on the other hand, are within closer reach of many moderate income
households. As shown in Table 22, the maximum affordable purchase price for a four person
household is $547,400, whereas the median priced condominium in Sunnyvale sold for $643,500
in 2013, an affordability gap of $96,100. Sunnyvale’s first-time homebuyer loan program and
similar programs offered by the Housing Trust of Silicon Valley help to close this affordability
gap for moderate income purchasers. In addition, the homes provided through the City’s
inclusionary zoning ordinance, the “Below Market Rate Home Ownership Program,” are priced
to be affordable to moderate income households, with prices set at a level affordable to buyers
with median incomes (100% AMI).

Table 24 presents the maximum affordable rents for very low, low and moderate income
households by household size, and compares with median apartment rents in Sunnyvale, as
documented in Table 21. As the table below indicates, Citywide median rents are well above the
level of affordability for very low income households, with an affordability gap ranging from
approximately $500 per month for one person households to over $1,700 for four person
households. Low income households, with the exception of single person households, also have
trouble affording the median apartment rent, with affordability gaps ranging from approximately
$250 to $970. Households earning moderate incomes are able to afford median market rents in
Sunnyvale. The rent statistics shown here represent only those units in apartment complexes
with 50+ units in Sunnyvale, and do not include single-family detached, condominiums, or other
unit types.

Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
State Housing Element law requires an analysis of the potential for rent-restricted low income
housing units to convert to market-rate housing, and to propose programs to preserve or replace
any units at risk of conversion, also known as “at-risk units.” This section presents an inventory
of all rent-restricted housing in Sunnyvale, and identifies those units at risk of conversion during
the 2015-2023 planning period.
Assisted Housing Inventory
Rent-restricted housing in Sunnyvale includes both publicly subsidized affordable housing,
generally assisted with any combination of federal, state, local, and/or private subsidies, and
deed-restricted rental units provided through the City’s historic inclusionary rental housing
program, the Below Market Rate (BMR) Rental Housing program. This program, which
operated between 1980 and July 2009, produced well over 900 affordable rental units during that
time. The vast majority of those units have expired already.
When the BMR program was originally established in the 1980s, the affordability term was for a
period of 20 years, similar to many inclusionary ordinances developed at that time.
Unfortunately, this relatively short term of affordability allowed many of the rent-restricted units
in these early BMR rental projects to expire, while the need for affordable rental units
unfortunately has not diminished. As presented in Table 25, a total of 178 rental units are
currently rent-restricted under the BMR program; 72 of these units will expire and convert to
market-rate by 2023.

Table 26 presents the inventory of affordable rental housing in Sunnyvale which has received
some form of public assistance. As evidenced by the over 1,300 units identified, Sunnyvale has
actively supported affordable rental housing utilizing a variety of local, State and Federal funds,
and works extensively with non-profit housing developers in the ownership and management of
its projects.

* HMF: Housing Mitigation Funds
One assisted rental project is theoretically at risk of losing its affordability restrictions within the
next eight year period: Life’s Garden. However, this project is considered to be at very low risk
of conversion.
     Life’s Garden is a 208-unit senior housing complex built by Sunnyvale Presbyterian
        Church. It is owned by Sunnyvale Life, Inc., an affiliate of the church. A project-based
        Section 8 contract currently ensures affordability of 150 of the units in the project. The
        property management has confirmed that it intends to maintain the property as long-term
        affordable housing well beyond 2017.
Preservation of At-Risk Rental Units
This section evaluates the affordable rental units in Sunnyvale at risk of converting to market-
rate rents by 2023. As presented in Tables 24 and 25, Sunnyvale has 72 BMR rental units
projected to expire during this period. Preservation and replacement options typically include
provision of tenant rental assistance; acquisition or construction of replacement units; or transfer
of ownership to a non-profit. Each of these options is described below.
1. Rental Assistance: One preservation option theoretically possible for preserving the BMR
    units would be to provide monthly subsidies to make up the difference between BMR rents
    and market-rate rents. In addition to cost, the feasibility of this alternative depends upon the
    willingness of property owners to accept such a subsidy and continue renting to lower-
    income tenants. Table 27 estimates the cost of providing rent subsidies to the 72 at-risk BMR
    units. As indicated by this table, the total cost would be nearly $700,000 annually, or $14
    million for an additional 20 years of affordability, assuming market rents stayed flat for the
    entire 20 years, which is highly unlikely.

   The only assisted rental project identified as being at risk of conversion (Life’s Garden),
   albeit a low risk, has a project-based Section 8 contract currently subject to annual renewal
   by mutual consent of the property owner and HUD. If Section 8 subsidies were terminated at
   the federal level, rent subsidies using alternative State or local funding sources could be used
   to maintain affordability of the 150 units in this project. Subsidies could be structured similar
   to the Section 8 program, where HUD pays the owners the difference between what tenants
   can afford to pay (30% of household income) and what HUD estimates as the Fair Market
   Rent (FMR) on the unit. Table 28 shows the total cost of subsidizing the rents of these 150
   units currently assisted through the Section 8 program, estimated at about $408,000 annually,
   or $8.2 million for a 20-year term. Again, these estimates assume no increases in fair market
   rent during that time.

   Another way rent subsidies could be structured is as a rent buy-down. This would involve
   the City providing a one-time assistance loan to the property owner to cover the present value
   of the decrease in rents associated with the extended affordability term compared with
   market rents achievable on the units. This approach offers a benefit to the owner in that they
   receive cash upfront from the loan, providing funds for rehabilitation improvements. This is
   probably a more likely scenario, based on past preservation/rehabilitation projects assisted by
   the City, and given that the property is owned by a non-profit agency.
2. Acquisition or Construction of Replacement Units: The construction or purchase of a
   replacement building is another option to replace at-risk units should they be converted to
   market-rate units. The cost of developing housing depends upon a variety of factors,
   including density, size of the units, location, land costs, and type of construction. Based on
   recent sales data obtained in early 2014, local apartment properties have been selling in the
   range of $240,000 to $280,000 per unit for properties that are often old and in need of
   rehabilitation. At such prices, it is unlikely the City would be able to provide sufficient
   assistance for acquisition of the number of units projected to expire. It is more likely the City
   would assist in development of new units in a project of 50-120 units, where tax credits can
   be used to leverage any available City funds.
3. Transfer of Ownership: Transferring ownership of an at-risk project to a non-profit housing
   provider is generally one of the least costly ways to ensure that the at-risk units remain
   affordable for the long term. By transferring ownership to a non-profit, low-income
Housing Element                                 Page 40

                                                                           Housing Needs Assessment
    restrictions can be secured indefinitely and the project becomes eligible for a greater range of
    governmental assistance. This preservation option is, however, not feasible for Sunnyvale’s
    at-risk BMR projects since only 10-15 percent of the units in each project are rent-restricted,
    and it is not likely the for-profit companies would be willing to sell these properties. The
    assisted rental project at risk of conversion, Life’s Garden, is already owned by a non-profit
    agency, Sunnyvale Life, Inc..
Qualified Entities
A list of entities qualified to rehabilitate, acquire, own and/or manage affordable rental properties
is provided in the last section (Administrative Resources) of the Housing Opportunities chapter
of this Housing Element. This is not an exhaustive list of all agencies that might be qualified to
undertake such preservation projects, however it includes some of the non-profit housing
agencies which have partnered with the City in the past on major affordable housing projects. In
addition, Sunnyvale Life, Inc., the entity which currently owns the single at-risk project in the
inventory, Life’s Garden, is also a qualified entity.
Comparison of Preservation Options:
The above analysis estimates the cost of preserving the at-risk units under various options. The
cost of preserving the 72 BMR units for an additional 20 years would be $14 million, under the
very unlikely assumption that rents would stay flat for 20 years. This is option is not highly
realistic given the greater likelihood that rents will increase steadily over time, and the
probability that the property owners are not likely interested in extending the term of
affordability. For these reasons, Sunnyvale’s preservation efforts to date have focused on
publicly-assisted units at risk of conversion, rather than on expiring BMR units. Several factors
have influenced the City’s preservation strategy: most of the City’s current stock of assisted units
are now owned by non-profit agencies, which tend to be more willing partners in preservation
efforts; these subsidized units are affordable to very low and extremely low income households,
which is a type of unit not provided by market-rate or mixed-income housing developers and
therefore in shorter supply; and most of these units were built decades ago and are in need of
financing for rehabilitation, which becomes an effective leveraging tool for negotiating extended
terms of affordability.
There is essentially no cost-effective mechanism by which the City can preserve only a few
BMR rental units within otherwise market-rate rental properties. The City instead provides
outreach to tenants of expiring BMR rental units to make sure they are aware of other affordable
housing programs, such as First-Time Homebuyer loans and/or BMR homes for sale, and BMR
units in other developments with longer terms of affordability.
Conservation of Existing Affordable Units
The conversion of rental housing to condominiums is an issue of ongoing concern in Sunnyvale,
although developer interest in this possibility varies, largely in parallel with the cycles of the for-
sale housing market. Although converting apartments to condominiums provides additional
opportunities for low-cost home ownership, it does not increase the overall supply of housing,
and may interfere with City goals to provide a range of housing types and tenures. Reducing the
supply of rental housing limits opportunities for lower-income households who cannot afford the
costs of home ownership and also limits the options for those who prefer to rent.

To meet these concerns, Sunnyvale adopted a Condominium Conversion Ordinance (Zoning
Code Chapter 19.70) that prohibits conversion unless the vacancy rate for rental housing exceeds
3 percent for one year. Additional provisions protect the elderly and require that a percentage of
the units be set aside for low- and moderate-income households. Because mobile homes are an
important part of the affordable housing stock, the City has adopted a policy to maintain at least
400 acres of mobile home park zoning. The City has also enacted a Mobile Home Park
Conversion Ordinance, Zoning Code Chapter 19.72. While this ordinance neither encourages nor
discourages conversions, it does provide mitigation measures to provide residents with some
assistance in the event of a conversion.

Regional Housing Needs
State law requires all regional councils of governments, including the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG) to determine the existing and projected housing need for its region and
determine the portion allocated to each jurisdiction. This is known as the “Regional Housing
Needs Allocation” (RHNA) process.
Existing Housing Needs
Overcrowding
Overcrowding occurs when housing costs are so high relative to income that families double up
and/or take in roommates (boarders) and/or extended family members to share their housing
costs, or to take in an elderly or disabled family member who can no longer live independently,
or additional children (nieces, nephews, foster children) for various reasons. Overcrowding can
often result in accelerated deterioration of homes, a shortage of street parking, and additional
traffic. Therefore, maintaining a reasonable level of occupancy and alleviating overcrowding are
critical to enhancing the quality of life in the community.
The Census defines overcrowding as an average of more than one person per room in a housing
unit (excluding kitchens, porches, and hallways). The incidence of overcrowded housing is a
general measure of whether there is an available supply of adequately sized housing units. Table
29 shows the incidence of overcrowding in Sunnyvale by owner and renter tenure, as measured
by the 2012 American Community Survey.

In 2012, there were 3,840 households living in overcrowded conditions in Sunnyvale,
representing 7 percent of all households. Approximately 11 percent of renter households were
overcrowded; a decrease from 2000 levels when 20 percent of the City’s renters were
overcrowded. Household overcrowding levels in Sunnyvale are only slightly lower than that for
Santa Clara County as a whole. Severe overcrowding, which is defined as more than 1.5 persons

per room, has decreased significantly in Sunnyvale since 2000, when nearly 3,400 renter
households (12%) experienced severe overcrowding.
Overpayment
Overpayment is critical issue for many households of various income levels. Housing
overpayment, also known as housing cost burden, occurs when households spend more than 30
percent of gross monthly income on housing. Severe overpayment or cost burden occurs when
housing costs represent more than 50 percent of gross monthly income. Table 30 shows the
number of Sunnyvale households estimated to be affected by housing cost burdens between 2006
and 2010, according to the Census. Extremely low and very low income homeowners and renters
represented the largest group of Sunnyvale households affected by severe overpayment, while
above-moderate income homeowners were the largest group affected by moderate housing cost
burdens, followed by moderate income renters in second place and low income renters in third
place. The total number of all households affected by overpayment, 16,645 households,
represented 31% of all Sunnyvale households during this period (2006-2010), which was 53,430.

Five-Year Projected Housing Needs
California housing element law requires that each city and county develop local housing
programs to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all income groups, as
determined by the jurisdiction’s Council of Governments. This “fair share” allocation concept
seeks to ensure that each jurisdiction accepts responsibility for the housing needs of not only its
resident population, but also for the jurisdiction’s projected share of regional housing growth
across all income categories. Regional growth needs are defined as the number of units that
would have to be added in each jurisdiction to accommodate the forecasted number of
households, as well as the number of units that would have to be added to compensate for
anticipated demolitions and changes to achieve an “ideal” vacancy rate.
In the Bay Area region, the agency responsible for allocating these regional housing needs to
each jurisdiction is the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). The regional growth
allocation process begins with the State Department of Finance’s projections of population and
associated housing demand for the planning period. The State, in consultation with ABAG, has
identified a total housing need for 187,990 housing units in the Bay Area during the 2015-2023
period.
ABAG is responsible for allocating the region’s projected housing needs among its jurisdictions
by income category. This is referred to as the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
process. The RHNA represents the minimum number of housing units each community is
required to provide “adequate sites” for through zoning, and is one of the primary threshold
criteria necessary to achieve State approval of the Housing Element.
Future housing needs refer to the share of the region’s housing need that has been allocated to a
community. In allocating the region’s future housing needs to jurisdictions, ABAG is required to
take the following factors into consideration:
                 Water and sewer capacity
                 Land suitable for urban development or conversion to residential use
                 Protected open space – lands protected by state and federal government
                 County policies to protect prime agricultural land
                 Distribution of household growth
                 Market demand for housing
                 City-centered growth policies
                 Loss of units in assisted housing developments
                 High housing cost burdens
                 Impact of universities and colleges on housing needs in a community
In 2013 ABAG finalized the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) based on its
Projections 2013 forecast, which projected the number of jobs, housing units, and population
that would be added to the nine-county Bay Area between 2010 and 2040. ABAG has provided
detailed explanations of its forecasting methods and its methodology for developing the 2015-
2023 RHNA on its website. Due to the complexity of the allocation formula used by ABAG for
this cycle, it is not provided here, but is summarized briefly below:
Housing Element                                  Page 45

                                                                                    Housing Needs Assessment
ABAG’s goals in developing the RHNA included: 1) directing housing units to areas where local
governments are planning growth; 2) planning for housing in tandem with jobs growth and
addressing existing jobs-housing imbalances; 3) directing housing to communities with transit
infrastructure; and 4) minimizing housing growth in outlying areas, thereby reducing pressures
on open space and agricultural lands.
Sunnyvale was allocated a need of 5,452 new units, distributed among the four income
categories, as shown in Table 31. Although the RHNA only uses four income levels, recent
changes in state law require jurisdictions to presume that half of the projected need for very low
income units is needed for extremely low income households, which are households with
incomes of up to 30 percent of Area Median Income (AMI). Based on this requirement, the
projected housing need for extremely low income households is 820 units (half of the 1,640 very
low income units). Through this Housing Element, the City will demonstrate the availability of
adequate sites to accommodate the projected need for these new units.

CONSTRAINTS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF
HOUSING
The provision of adequate and affordable housing opportunities is an important goal of the City.
However, there are a variety of factors that can encourage or constrain the development,
maintenance, and improvement of housing stock in Sunnyvale. This section addresses potential
governmental and market constraints to the provision of housing in Sunnyvale.
Governmental Constraints
Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing and in particular,
the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and
exactions, permit processing procedures, and various other issues may present constraints to the
maintenance, development and improvement of housing. This section discusses potential
governmental constraints in Sunnyvale.
Land Use Controls
The Land Use and Transportation Element of the City of Sunnyvale’s General Plan sets forth the
City’s policies for guiding local development. These policies, together with existing zoning
regulations, establish the amount and distribution of land allocated for different uses. Sunnyvale
provides for a mix of residential developments with densities ranging from less than 7 dwelling
units/acre up to 78 dwelling units/acre in the Downtown Specific Plan area. Table 32 presents the
City’s primary General Plan land use categories permitting residential uses, and correlates these
with the associated implementing zoning categories.

Residential Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily
through the Municipal Code. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote health,
safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the City’s General
Plan. The Code sets forth the City’s specific residential development standards, which are
summarized in Table 33. These development standards serve to preserve the character and
integrity of existing neighborhoods and at the same time offer flexibility in providing a wide
range of residential opportunities and dwelling unit types. Building heights range from 30 to 55
feet and can accommodate a range of building stories. The R1.5 and R1.7/PD zones allow
development of single-family homes on smaller lots. The higher density R-3, R-4 and R-5 zones
do not have a floor area ratio requirement, allowing greater flexibility in unit sizes.

Provisions for Small Lot Development
Sunnyvale has two zoning districts which provide for small lot developments. The R-1.5 zoning
category allows lots ranging from 4,200 to 6,000 square feet in size, and the R-1.7/PD allows lots
from 2,600 to 4,000 square feet in size. Both zoning districts allow a maximum Floor Area Ratio
of up to 50 percent. By providing greater development flexibility and allowing smaller lot sizes,
the City’s zoning provides for opportunities for development of lower cost single-family homes.
Downtown Specific Plan
The Downtown Specific Plan provides for over 2,000 new multi-family units in close proximity
to transit. The plan divides the approximately 135-acre downtown core into four main districts
and 23 blocks and implements land use guidelines and development standards for each of the
individual districts and blocks. The land use vision for the four districts can be summarized as
follows:
    Commercial Core District: The area contains a mix of high intensity uses with ground-level
    activity, plazas and open space, and connections to mass transit.
    Sunnyvale/Carroll District: This district contains medium to high density residential uses,
    supplemented with a small amount of service retail.
    South of Iowa District: This is a lower density residential district that integrates historic
    architectural styles to provide a buffer between the single-family neighborhood to the south
    and the higher density development in the commercial core.
    West of Mathilda: This district consists of high density residential uses, intended to
    complement the commercial development occurring on the east side of Mathilda Avenue
    with 4-story buildings and corner retail spaces.
Table 34 provides an overview of the primary residential standards contained in the Downtown
Specific Plan, as well as the dwelling unit potential of each block within the DSP area. The DSP
concentrates on developing higher densities focused in the Commercial Core District (with
densities up to 78 units/acre), surrounded by lower to medium densities around the perimeter
(Sunnyvale/Carroll and South of Iowa Districts). The zoning allows for higher density residential
development of up to 58 units per acre along the side of Mathilda Avenue, one of the City’s
primary arterial roadways.
Heights are regulated in the new development in a similar manner as the density, with the
commercial core allowing the greatest heights (up to 6 stories), gradually stepping down to 2
stories along South of Iowa and Mathilda Avenue. Parking is required to be provided on site for
most of the blocks, as discussed in the next section.
Landscaping and open space requirements have been established for different blocks within the
DSP area, with a minimum of 20 percent of the lot area to be landscaped for all residential uses.
Minimum usable open space requirements differ depending on the density of the residential area.
Low and Low-Medium density residential uses are required to provide 500 square feet of usable

open space per unit, whereas Medium, High and Very High density residential uses are required
to provide 50 square feet of usable open space per unit, ensuring a good balance of open space
within the Downtown area.

Parking Requirements
Sunnyvale’s residential parking requirements vary by housing type, and by number of bedrooms
for multi-family units. Multi-family developments, such as townhomes, condominiums and
apartments, are required to provide at least one covered assigned space per unit. Additional
unassigned spaces are also required because multi-family developments typically do not have
private driveways for additional parking or public street frontage. The number of unassigned
parking spaces required is different based on the type of covered assigned space provided. The
City permits carports in lieu of fully-enclosed garages for all housing units, which can serve to
reduce development costs. Carports also have the lowest required parking ratio. Table 35
enumerates the City’s residential parking requirements.

 City of Sunnyvale Municipal Code, 2014.
Reduced parking requirements for affordable housing developments and housing for seniors or
persons with disabilities were adopted in 2011. The modified parking ratio that Mid-Pen Housing
Corporation was allowed to use for the 124-unit Fair Oaks Senior Housing project served as the
basis for the adopted parking standard for affordable housing for seniors or persons with
disabilities. The City also adopted provisions to allow development applications for senior
housing, housing for persons with disabilities or housing affordable to lower income households
to include requests for further reductions in the parking requirements. The request can be granted
if the approving body finds that the applicant’s proposed parking standard is adequate through a
combination of any of the following considerations: location or proximity to transportation,
variety or forms of transportation available, accessibility, services and programs offered, or
population served by the proposed housing development.
The City continues to explore modified parking standards for housing sites near transit. Existing
parking requirements in the Downtown Specific Plan District are reduced due to the area’s
proximity to transit. Shared parking has been considered in mixed-use proposals where uses have

different peak parking demands. Shared parking is also encouraged for trip reduction programs
such as car sharing or other transportation demand management programs. As part of the Mixed-
Use Toolkit that is currently in progress, the City is also developing other parking management
strategies or modified standards for mixed-use developments, especially those in proximity to
transit hubs.
Flexible Development Standards
Sunnyvale has adopted several provisions in its Zoning Code that facilitate a range of residential
development types and can lower the cost of developing housing. These mechanisms include
mixed-use development provisions, Industrial to Residential (ITR) zoning, the Below-Market
Rate (BMR) Program, density bonuses, and other provisions for small lot development.
Mixed-Use Development
Sunnyvale has adopted several specific and precise plans which encourage mixed use
development:
     The Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) comprises roughly 135 acres and provides for over
         2,000 higher density residential units in close proximity to transit. A major focus of the
         DSP is to integrate connections between residential and mixed use development with
         existing transit facilities, including the multi-modal Caltrain Station.
     The 2007 update of the Precise Plan for El Camino Real encourages compact mixed-use
         development along Sunnyvale’s oldest transportation corridor along the commercial
         spine of the City.
     The 101/Lawrence Site Specific Plan aims at creating a self-supporting urban village with
         a mix of uses that includes high density residential.
     The Lakeside Site Specific Plan, an almost nine acre site adjacent to the 101/Lawrence
         Site Specific Plan area, allows the redevelopment of a hotel site into a mixed use high
         density residential and hotel/conference facility near the intersection of two major
         transportation corridors.
     The City is developing the Lawrence Station Area Plan (LSAP), which could provide
         more transit-oriented, higher density residential and commercial development
         opportunities within a half mile radius of the Caltrain Lawrence Station.
     In conjunction with the LSAP, the City is also creating a Mixed-Use Toolkit to further
         promote and guide mixed-use development citywide.
Sunnyvale’s DSP area, Lawrence Station Transit Village and the El Camino Real corridor have
all been designated as “Priority Development Areas” (PDAs) by ABAG and MTC, as supported
by the City Council. PDA designation renders these areas eligible for certain capital
infrastructure funds, planning grants and technical assistance to facilitate transit-oriented
development.
In December 2008, the City established a Mixed Use (MU) Combining District and provisions
for live/work units. The new MU district may be combined with the R-3, R-4 and R-5 zoning
districts in areas within ½ mile of a public transit stop or major expressway. The combining

                                                        Constraints to the Development of Housing
district requires between 10-25 percent of the lot area to be developed with commercial/office
uses, and allows residential uses to be developed either adjacent to, or above commercial uses.
An allowance is provided for an increase in 10 feet, or one-story above the base zoning
maximum and shared parking is permitted as supported by a parking study. Live/work units are
now defined in the Zoning Code, and are specifically permitted in the Mixed Use Combining
District.
Rezoning Industrial to Residential (ITR)
Sunnyvale has recognized that as industrial and R&D uses have become more land intensive (i.e.
multi-story buildings with less floor area per employee), underutilized industrial land can be
freed up for other uses. The Futures Study (July 1993) looked at some of the City’s older
underutilized industrial sites to evaluate planned redevelopment of these sites with residential
uses, while directing higher intensity industrial development to other areas more suitable over the
long-term for such uses. As a result of this study, eight industrial areas were rezoned with an
Industrial to Residential Combining District (ITR). The ITR district allows industrial, office,
commercial, and residential uses to exist within the same district while gradually converting to
residential use. Sites with an ITR designation can be combined with any residential zoning
designation and follow the residential standards of the zone that they are combined with. Most of
the ITR sites are combined with the R-3 zoning designation, with a few R-4 sites. In 2007 an
additional ITR area was added; the ITR Combining District now includes approximately 320
acres, accommodating up to 7,700 dwelling units. By January 2009, approximately 1,700 units
had either been constructed or permitted for development within the ITR areas.
Below Market Rate (BMR) Housing
Sunnyvale’s Below Market Rate (BMR) Program is authorized under the Sunnyvale Municipal
Code, Chapter 19.67 (Ownership) and 19.69 (Existing BMR Rental Properties). Chapter 19.67 is
applicable to new developments of eight or more ownership units, and requires that 12.5 percent
of units in ownership developments be sold at prices affordable to moderate-income purchasers
(up to 120% AMI). The homes are priced to be affordable to buyers at 100% of AMI. There are
no longer any BMR requirements for new rental developments, due to the 2009 Palmer vs. Los
Angeles court case, however a number of existing rental properties remain subject to BMR
requirements imposed pre-Palmer based on recorded developer agreements with terms of 20-55
years. The City revised its BMR ordinance in 2012, replacing the earlier Chapter 19.66 with the
two new chapters, 19.67 and 19.69 to address both the Palmer decision and to make
improvements and add flexibility to the BMR ownership program. Changes made to the BMR
ownership program as part of Chapter 19.67 included providing a more concrete definition of
affordable sales price, as well as adding additional flexibility to allow developers to opt to pay
in-lieu fees, provide units off-site, or partner with non-profits to provide a greater number of, or
more deeply targeted affordable units in lieu of the moderate income ownership units (the
“standard option”). Developers must obtain Council approval prior to being able to utilize any of
these options, and to date no developer has done so, although several have indicated interest in
these options. Another change was to allow developers to pay fractional in-lieu fees rather than
rounding up the BMR requirement to the next whole unit. This has created a new revenue
stream that will be used in future years to create more affordable units.

                                                        Constraints to the Development of Housing
The current period of affordability is 30 years for owner-occupied units and 55 years for existing
BMR rental units, although there are still a few rental properties permitted prior to 2003 with 20-
year restriction terms. Since Sunnyvale initiated the BMR program in the early 1980s, hundreds
of affordable units have been created, although many have expired already. There are currently
close to 330 active BMR ownership units (homes) and fewer than 200 active BMR rental units,
as listed in the at-risk inventory. Density bonus incentives consistent with State density bonus
law are available to developers to help offset the cost of providing affordable units, as well as to
encourage deeper income targeting.
The balance of the BMR sub-fund was slightly over $2 million as of FY 2013-14. This fund
includes revenues from BMR administrative fees, fines for violations of the BMR codes, as well
as BMR in-lieu fees. The BMR in-lieu-fees, once sufficient funds accumulate in the fund, will be
used to fund development of affordable units, with a small portion of the funds used to cover
BMR program administration.
Affordable Housing Density Bonus
One incentive available to the City to support development of affordable rental housing is State
density bonus law. Section 65915 of the California Government Code provides a system for
granting a density bonus to qualified residential projects. It provides a tiered system ranging
from 20-35 percent and up to three development incentives/concessions, depending on the
proportion of affordable units in the proposed project, and the level of income targeting.
As part of the package of code amendments adopted in 2012 related to the BMR program, the
City also updated its density bonus codes to be consistent with State law. The new density bonus
codes are provided in Chapter 19.18.025 of the Municipal Code. In addition, the BMR Ordinance
allows the BMR units to count toward a density bonus as long as they meet the applicable State
affordability requirements. To further assist developers in pursuing a density bonus and
evaluating the numerous options available under state law, staff created a density bonus
calculator spreadsheet which automatically calculates the number of bonus units available based
on the acreage of the site, the existing zoning, and the developer’s choice of affordable unit
percentages and affordability level. Developers have responded positively and have been using
this tool to evaluate their options. In 2013, developers of three new rental projects (Ironworks
North and South and Summerhill Mathilda Apartments) took advantage of the density bonus
program. These projects will collectively provide a total of 19 very low income rental units. Staff
expects additional projects to take advantage of this incentive in the coming years.
The City also provides an additional density bonus of 5% for developments that meet certain
voluntary green building measures. This green building bonus may be combined with the
affordable housing bonus for a total maximum bonus of up to 40%. However, continued
evolution in state green building requirements may soon make the City’s green building density
bonus obsolete, as the required green building measures begin to equal or exceed the voluntary
measures currently used for this bonus program.

Provisions for a Variety of Housing
Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made
available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development
of various types of housing for all economic segments of the population. This includes single-
family homes, multi-family housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, single-room
occupancy housing, emergency shelters and transitional housing among others. Table 36
summarizes housing types permitted within Sunnyvale’s residential zone districts, and Table 37
identifies residential uses permitted in commercial districts and the Downtown Specific Plan.
Transitional and supportive housing may be permitted in any zoning district based on dwelling
type. For example, a 45-unit multi-family development linked to a range of on-site or off-site
services, such as vocational and employment services or independent living skills training, are
permitted in the R-4 Zoning District where multi-family developments are permitted.

Multi-Family Rental Housing
The City’s Zoning Code allows development of multi-family projects (defined as those with
three or more dwelling units) in its low-medium, medium and high density residential zones, as
well as commercial zones and in the Downtown Specific Plan. Multi-family developments of up
to 50 units are permitted by right as a use in the low-medium, medium and high density
residential zones, so long as the development complies with the density limits of the applicable
zoning district. Although the use itself is permitted by right, architectural and site review (design
review) by the Planning Commission is required. Multi-family housing projects of 50 units or
more require a use permit in those same residential zones, as listed in the Zoning Code
residential use table. However, any multi-family development would be reviewed through the
same process, which solely focuses on design and compliance with development standards,
regardless of the number of units. As long as the proposed development meets the applicable
density limitations of the zoning district, it is a permitted use of that property.

Accessory Living Units
The purpose of permitting accessory living units (often referred to as “granny units”) in single-
family zoning districts is to allow more efficient use of land and infrastructure in these zones to
provide the opportunity for the development of small housing units designed to meet the needs of
individuals or families, who may be rental tenants or extended family members, while preserving
the relatively low densities of single-family neighborhoods.
AB 1866, which became effective in July 2003, requires local governments to use a ministerial
process for second unit applications for the purpose of facilitating production of affordable
housing. AB 1866 does allow cities to impose development standards on second units addressing
issues such as building size, parking, height, setbacks, and lot coverage.
Sunnyvale currently allows accessory living units (ALUs) in the R-1, R-0 and R-2 zoning
districts and in certain residential blocks of the Downtown Specific Plan area with just a
Miscellaneous Plan Permit (MPP). All MPPs for ALUs are reviewed by the Director of
Community Development or his/her designee for compliance with the standards in Section
19.68.040 of the Zoning Code and City design guidelines. This permit type is issued by staff and
is considered ministerial. When the ALU application is in compliance with the relevant
standards, the permit is issued. If an applicant wishes to deviate significantly from these
standards, a zoning variance may be required. ALUs are treated no differently than single-family
homes in the same zoning district.
Sunnyvale’s Zoning Code (Section 19.68.040) establishes the following standards for accessory
living units:
          A minimum lot size of 9,000 square feet is required in the R-0 and R-1 districts, and
             5,000 square feet in the R-2 and DSP sub-districts 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
          Unit sizes are restricted to a maximum of 700 square feet and one bedroom.
          At least one on-site parking space shall be provided for each accessory unit, in
             addition to the minimum number required for the primary dwelling. The additional
             space may be uncovered, but may not be in tandem with another space.
          A deed restriction is required that stipulates that only one of the two units on the
             property may be rented at any one time.
          All setbacks, lot coverage, building height, open space and other applicable
             requirements of the underlying zone district shall be satisfied.
          Entrances and outside stairways serving ALUs shall not be constructed on any
             building elevation facing a public street.
          Exterior materials, colors and appearance of ALUs shall match the primary structures
             they adjoin.
The City usually processes several ALU applications annually, with a total of 17 ALUs
permitted between 2007 and 2014. The City’s ALU development standards are reasonable, less
restrictive than many jurisdictions, and do not serve as a constraint to their development.

Manufactured Housing/ Mobile Homes
Section 65852.3 of the California Government Code requires jurisdictions to administratively
allow manufactured homes on lots zoned for single-family dwellings if they meet certain
standards. Consistent with this requirement, Sunnyvale permits mobile homes on a permanent
foundation for use as a single-family dwelling in R-0, R-1, R-2 and R-3 zone districts.
Sunnyvale has 16 mobile home parks containing approximately 4,000 mobile home units. The
City has established a designated mobile home park zone district, and has adopted a policy to
maintain a minimum of 400 acres of mobile home park zoning. The City also has a general plan
land use designation of Mobile Home.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
SRO residences are small, one room units (generally 100-250 sq. ft.) occupied by a single
individual, and may either have shared or private kitchen and bathroom facilities. SROs can
provide an entry point into the housing market for extremely low income individuals, formerly
homeless and disabled persons.
In 1991, the City of Sunnyvale adopted an ordinance and related building code amendments
designed to make the development of SRO housing more feasible. The impact of the ordinance
(Zoning Code Section 19.66.160) was to increase the allowable density and lower the cost of
developing SROs by designating it a commercial development. As indicated in Tables 36 and
37, the City permits SROs with a Use Permit in the following zone districts: R-4, R-5, C-2, C-3,
MS, M-3, and some DSP sub-districts. Provisions of the City’s ordinance include:
       Requirements for a Management Plan outlining policies and procedures
       24-hour on-site management
       Options for both weekly and monthly tenancies
       Unit sizes of 150 - 400 square feet in size, with an overall average unit size not exceeding
        250 square feet (excluding closet and bathroom area)
     Maximum occupancy of two persons per unit
Following adoption of its ordinance in 1991, Sunnyvale issued a Request for Proposals for
construction of an SRO on a City-owned site in the downtown, to provide housing for workers in
service-sector jobs, as well as for seniors and disabled individuals. Mid-Pen Housing
Corporation was selected as the developer, and leveraged City funds with six other public and
private funding sources to achieve development of the 122-unit Carroll Inn. Twelve of the
Carroll Inn units are fully accessible, and rents, most of which range from $440 to $580, are
affordable to residents with extremely low incomes.
A second SRO, Borregas Court, was also developed under Sunnyvale’s SRO ordinance. This
193-unit SRO is located just outside of downtown. While rents are not quite as low as those of
the Carroll Inn, at $675 to $795 per month, the Borregas Court units are affordable to very low
income households. The property is managed by the non-profit EAH.

Residential Care Facilities
Section 1566.3 of the California Health and Safety Code requires residential facilities serving six
or fewer persons to be considered a residential use of property for purposes of local zoning
ordinances. No local agency can impose stricter zoning or building and safety standards on these
residential facilities – such as a use permit (UP), zoning variance or other zoning clearance - than
is required of a family dwelling of the same type in the same zone. The Sunnyvale Zoning Code
permits licensed Residential Care Facilities serving six or fewer persons by right in all low and
medium density zoning districts (R-0, R-1, R-1.5, R-1.7/PD, R-2), and does not subject such
facilities to a use permit, building standard, or regulation not otherwise required of single-family
homes in the same zone. Unlicensed Residential Care Facilities with six or fewer occupants are
permitted in all residential zones, subject to issuance of a use permit.
Due to the unique characteristics of larger (more than six persons) Residential Care Facilities,
most jurisdictions require a use permit to ensure neighborhood compatibility in the siting of these
facilities. As indicated previously in Tables 36 and 37, the Sunnyvale Zoning Code provides for
Residential Care Facilities with more than six occupants in all zoning districts where residential
uses are permitted, subject to approval of a Use Permit by the Planning Commission; unlicensed
facilities with more than six occupants are allowed with a Use Permit in medium and high
density residential zones and nonresidential zones which allow residential uses. The required
findings for approval of a Use Permit in Sunnyvale are directed towards ensuring compatibility
of the proposed use and not tied to the user, and therefore are not viewed as a constraint per se to
the provision of residential care facilities.
Sunnyvale has adopted Section 19.64.010 of the Zoning Code to regulate unlicensed care
facilities and facilities with seven or more occupants. As articulated in this section, the
Sunnyvale City Council finds that residential care facilities provide a cost-effective, humane and
non-institutional environment for elderly persons, persons suffering from chronic illness, persons
suffering from mental or physical impairments, and persons recovering from drug and/or alcohol
addiction. The City Council also finds that the public health, safety and welfare of City residents
is best served when such facilities are licensed by the California Department of Social Services,
the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, or other appropriate agency to ensure
compliance with applicable regulations and standards, but that in fact not all facilities are so
licensed. The City Council finds that over-concentration of Residential Care Facilities could
impair the integrity of residential neighborhoods, and thus has established a 500 foot spacing
requirement between Care Facilities with more than six occupants. Applicants may request a
waiver from the distance requirement, subject to Planning Commission findings that such a
waiver would not be materially detrimental or injurious to the property, improvements or uses in
the immediate vicinity.
The California courts have invalidated the following definition of “family” within jurisdictions
Zoning Codes: (a) an individual, (b) two or more persons related by blood, marriage or adoption,
or (c) a group of not more than a certain number of unrelated persons as a single housekeeping
unit. Court rulings state that defining a family does not serve any legitimate or useful objective
or purpose recognized under the zoning and land planning powers of the city, and therefore

violates rights of privacy under the California Constitution. A zoning ordinance also cannot
regulate residency by discrimination between biologically related and unrelated persons.
Sunnyvale’s Zoning Code currently contains the following definition of “family”:
         a) An individual living alone in a dwelling unit; or
         b) Two or more persons related by blood, marriage or legal adoption, or a group of two
             or more persons who need not be related, living together in a single dwelling unit as
             a group where the individual or group is in possession of the entire dwelling unit.”
The City’s zoning provisions for residential care facilities, as well its definition of family, both
provide reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities, as evidenced by the State
Community Care Licensing Division, which identified one group home, four adult residential
facilities, and 34 residential care facilities for the elderly in Sunnyvale.
Transitional and Supportive Housing and Emergency Shelters
Transitional housing is temporary housing (generally six months to two years) for a homeless
individual or family transitioning to permanent housing. Residents are also provided with one-
on-one case management, education and training, employment assistance, mental and physical
services, and support groups. Recent changes in State law (SB 2 - effective January 2008)
require transitional housing to be treated the same as any other residential use within the same
zone. Sunnyvale considers transitional housing the same as permanent rental housing, and thus
the review and approval process is the same. The Zoning Code defines transitional housing as a
dwelling, and depending on the physical characteristics of the facility as a single-family or multi-
family structure, permits transitional housing as a residential use within single-family zones, or
within multi-family and commercial zones.
Supportive housing is generally defined as permanent, affordable housing with on-site services
that help residents transition into stable, more productive lives. Services may include childcare,
after-school tutoring, career counseling, etc. Most transitional housing includes a supportive
services component. Similar to transitional housing, the Zoning Code regulates supportive
housing as a residential use, provided supportive services are ancillary to the primary use and for
use by the residents of the facility.
Pursuant to SB 2, jurisdictions with an unmet need for emergency shelters must identify at least
one zone where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use
permit or other discretionary permit. The identified zone must have sufficient capacity to
accommodate the shelter need, and at a minimum provide capacity for at least one year-round
shelter. Permit processing, development and management standards for emergency shelters must
be objective and facilitate the development of, or conversion to, emergency shelters. The
Sunnyvale Zoning Code allows emergency shelters as a permitted use in the City’s industrial
zones with the “place of assembly” overlay (“MS-POA” zones), based on code amendments
adopted in 2011. Shelters are also allowed in industrial zones without the POA overlay with a
use permit. Shelters are subject to the same development and management standards as any
other permitted uses in the zone.

                                                       Constraints to the Development of Housing
As discussed in the homeless section of the Housing Needs Assessment, the 2013 Santa Clara
Homeless Survey identified 425 homeless people in Sunnyvale, including 283 unsheltered
people in street locations or cars/RV’s/vans or encampments, and 142 people in shelters.
Sunnyvale conducted a review of its zoning districts in 2009 and determined that the industrial
zones with an overlay of 'place of assembly' (POA) are the best suited for emergency shelter
uses. In 2007, the City added the MS-POA overlay designation to a number of sites in the MS
zone. The POA designation essentially allows places of assembly and recreational uses, such as
places of worship, community centers, etc., in these POA overlay zones. SROs and residential
uses are also permitted in the MS-POA zone with a use permit. POA sites were selected based on
their proximity to major arterials and locations near the outer edges of larger industrial
neighborhoods, and given their direct and convenient access to public transit, would serve as
good candidates for the location of an emergency shelter. A map on the City’s website shows
the locations of all MS-POA sites within Sunnyvale. These sites have a combined area of 117
acres, which is more than sufficient acreage to locate 425 shelter beds, enough to house the entire
homeless population.
The MS-POA sites are characterized by larger buildings and warehouses, many of which are
suitable for conversion to a shelter. Numerous underutilized properties also exist which are
suitable for redevelopment. Most structures on MS-POA sites are Class C, single-story, tilt-up,
industrial buildings. The availability of these buildings for adaptive reuse and the relatively
lower property values in industrial areas serve to minimize, to the extent possible, the cost of
establishing an emergency shelter. The vacancy rate of research and development properties in
the City, which most closely corresponds to these zones, was approximately 9% percent in the
first quarter of 2014, according to Colliers International, as reported in the April 14, 2014 City
Manager’s Biweekly Report.
The City’s MS-POA development standards are appropriate to facilitate emergency shelters, and
can be summarized as follows:
       Minimum lot size: 22,500
       Building height: 75 feet
       Front yard setback: 25 feet
       Side yard setback: total 20 feet
       Rear yard setback: none
In addition to application of MS-POA development standards, pursuant to SB-2, the City can
also specify written, objective standards to regulate certain aspects of emergency shelters to
enhance compatibility. The zoning code does not specify any standards other than those listed
above, however it defines emergency shelter as follows: “any facility with on-site management
and security that provides temporary overnight sleeping accommodations for a maximum of
thirty days and minimal supportive services for homeless persons.”

                                                        Constraints to the Development of Housing
Farm Worker Housing
According to the 2011 American Community Survey of the Census Bureau, 226 Sunnyvale
residents were employed in farming, fishing, hunting, mining and forestry occupations between
2007 and 2011, representing less than two-tenths of one percent of the City’s population. It is
unlikely that most of these residents were employed as farm workers. No parcels in the City are
zoned for agricultural use, nor are there any farms in the City known to currently employ farm
workers (i.e., other than the land owner’s family members or volunteers). The City owns two
demonstration orchards which are farmed on the City’s behalf by a local resident (who has
adequate housing). Given the lack of any major agricultural institutions employing farmworkers
within the City, the City has not identified a need for dedicated farmworker housing, and can
address the housing needs of farm workers through its general housing programs.
Accessibility Accommodations
Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the
“Acts”) impose an affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodations
(i.e. modifications or exceptions) in their zoning and other land use regulations when such
accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and
enjoy a dwelling. For example, it may be a reasonable accommodation to allow covered ramps
in the setbacks of properties that have already been developed to accommodate residents with
mobility impairments.
It is the policy of the City of Sunnyvale to provide reasonable accommodation for persons with
disabilities seeking fair access to housing in the application of its zoning and building laws. The
City has conducted a review of zoning and building code requirements, and has not identified
any barriers to the provision of accessible housing. Sunnyvale accommodates most accessibility
modifications through issuance of a simple remodel permit. Handicapped ramps or guardrails are
permitted to intrude into the standard setbacks required under zoning to allow first floor access
for physically disabled residents. The Building Division has adopted the 2013 California
Building Code without amendment, and enforces the disabled access regulations delineated in its
chapters on Housing Accessibility and Accessibility of Publicly Funded Housing. New
apartment buildings with three or more units are subject to requirements for unit “adaptability”
on ground floor units, and accessibility to common use areas. Adaptable units are built for easy
conversion to disabled access, such as doorway and hallway widths, and added structural support
in the bathroom to allow the addition of handrails.
While Sunnyvale has not identified any constraints on the development, maintenance and
improvement of housing for persons with disabilities, the City adopted specific procedures in
2011 for requests that cannot be accommodated by existing exceptions or allowances in the
Zoning Code. The procedures adopted under Chapter 19.65 of the Zoning Code were based on
HCD’s Model Ordinance for Providing Reasonable Accommodation and tailored to Sunnyvale’s
existing processes. If the reasonable accommodation request is part of a project that requires
some other discretionary approval, such as a Design Review for a large single-family home
addition, the request is then reviewed by the decision-making body with that discretionary
approval. If the project does not require some other discretionary approval, the request is
reviewed by the Director of Community Development (or designee) through a Miscellaneous

Plan Permit application. There is no fee required for the review. The decision to grant a
reasonable accommodation request is based on certain findings consistent with the Acts.
In December 2004, Council created an Advisory Committee on Accessibility (ACA). The City
of Sunnyvale’s ACA advises and provides input to City staff on accessibility issues related to
City services, programs and facilities. The City also has a dedicated Americans with Disabilities
Act Coordinator, and identifies resources and local programs for persons with disabilities on its
website.
Sunnyvale administers a Home Access Grant program, providing up to $6,500 to lower income
disabled homeowners to retrofit their homes. Common accessibility retrofits funded through the
program include: ramps, hand railings, grab bars, hand-held showerheads, widening of doors,
modification of steps, and wheelchair lifts. The City also maintains an inventory of lifts it
provides to residents, and removes the lift when it is no longer needed.
Development Permit Procedures
Planning is an essential part of the development process. Good planning can mean the difference
between an average development and an excellent one that meets the community's expectations.
The planning process also provides anyone with an interest in a proposed development to get
involved. Before development can occur, it is necessary to obtain certain permits and
discretionary approvals. These procedures, although necessary to ensure that the development is
safe and in compliance with local, regional and state regulations and zoning code requirements,
can sometimes lead to delays in projects and increase costs. Moreover, excessive processing time
may act as a constraint on the production of affordable housing, because it increases carrying
costs for the developer for land and financing.
The City of Sunnyvale places a strong emphasis on customer service and satisfaction, and its
permitting processes are designed for expedited processing of all planning and building permits.
Recognizing the complexity of the development process for property owners and developers, the
City of Sunnyvale offers easy-to-read brochures to help developers and homeowners better
understand the planning and development procedures in Sunnyvale. The City is also committed
to an efficient review process.
In 1985, Sunnyvale established a One-Stop Permit Center to process building permits, building
inspections, use permits, business licenses, code compliance, housing services, plan checking,
planning permits, economic development, and other general services. The One-Stop Permit
Center is comprised of a team of City Staff from the Community Development, Public Works
and Public Safety Departments. The team effort results in fast and convenient service. Some of
the services provided are:
       Coordinated customer contacts with appropriate staff representatives
       Related development services in a central location
       Streamlined permitting process
       Computerized land use information and building permit tracking system
       Plan checks and permit issuance combined in one location

                                                       Constraints to the Development of Housing
Any interested person can visit the One Stop Permit Center to meet with various staff, with or
without an appointment, including a Building Inspector, Planner, Public Works Engineer,
Neighborhood Preservation Specialist, Housing Specialist, Traffic Engineer, Fire Prevention
Engineer, or a Structural Engineer. The One-Stop Permit Center is able to provide streamlined
plan review and building permit issuance, with over 90 percent of all building permits issued at
the counter. Review processes for some of the most common residential project types are
described briefly below.
Single-Family Home or Duplex: Applications for new single-family homes, duplexes or
additions that are designed in compliance with the code requirements and are less than the FAR
threshold for the zoning district are reviewed by staff through the Design Review (DR) process.
Applications are reviewed for conformance with applicable development standards and adopted
design guidelines. There are different timeframes for staff review, depending on the size of the
project. Single-story additions to single-family homes and duplexes that are less than 20 percent
of the existing floor area are reviewed over the counter as part of the building permit plan review
at the One-stop Permit Center. Projects that propose to add more than 20 percent of the existing
floor area are reviewed within a two-week timeframe. Second-story additions and new two-story
homes require neighbor notification and a two-week comment period, but are generally
processed within four weeks.
A single-family home, duplex addition, or new construction project that exceeds the total FAR
threshold for the zoning district is required to go through a public hearing process reviewed by
the Planning Commission. These projects are reviewed for conformance with the same standards
and design guidelines as those projects reviewed at staff level, but require a higher level of
review because of the proposed size and potential visual impacts. The Planning Commission DR
process typically takes two to three months.
Multi-Family Housing: The Community Development Director has decision-making authority
on minor use permits and special development permits, variances, site plan reviews, and zoning
clearances. Minor use and development applications (including variance applications) that are
categorically exempt pursuant to the terms of California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) are
reviewed through the Zoning Administrator (ZA) hearing process. An example of a multi-family
housing project that could be reviewed at the ZA level is the conversion of a laundry facility to a
dwelling unit within an existing apartment complex. It typically takes 30 days for a fully
complete application to be scheduled for a ZA hearing. Building permits may be issued for
approved projects after the appeal period, which is 15 days from the decision date.
New construction of multi-family housing requires site and architectural review by the Planning
Commission. Projects that are not categorically exempt per CEQA also require a public hearing
with the Planning Commission as the decision-making body. The Planning Commission review
process typically takes three months for projects that are deemed complete within the first month
of application submittal.
Sunnyvale offers an optional Preliminary Review (PR) process for applicants to submit
schematic plans for review by the Project Review Committee (PRC) and receive early feedback

                                                     Constraints to the Development of Housing
from City staff before submitting a formal entitlement application. The PR process is strongly
encouraged for complex projects, large projects or potentially controversial projects, and could
aid in helping applicants determine the most efficient path to project approval, thus helping to
save time and costs. The PRC consists of representatives from the City Departments of
Community Development (Planning and Building Divisions), Public Safety (Fire and Crime
Prevention Divisions), Environmental Services and Public Works. The PRC was created to
review development/improvement proposals for technical compliance with CEQA, City codes,
design guidelines, policies and other specifications. The PR process starts at application
submittal and ends at the PRC meeting with no formal decision made on the application.
Applicants are encouraged to attend the PRC meeting where they receive written comments from
the PRC and are given an opportunity to seek clarifications and ask questions. The PRC meeting
is typically held once every two weeks, offering several opportunities for applicants seeking
preliminary review of projects.

Source: Sunnyvale Planning Division Fees, August 26, 2013.
The Home Builders Association of Northern California conducts an annual Cost of Development
Survey. Eight South Bay cities participated in the 2006-2007 survey, including Cupertino,
Gilroy, Morgan Hill, Mountain View, Palo Alto, San Jose, Salinas and Sunnyvale. Each city
calculated total development fees, impact/capacity fees, and development taxes on five different
project prototypes, including a 50 unit single-family subdivision and a 96 unit multi-family
development. For the single-family prototype, Sunnyvale’s fees were documented at $27,014 per
unit, the second lowest of the eight jurisdictions surveyed. Similarly, for the multi-family
prototype, Sunnyvale’s per unit fees of $19,712 were also the second lowest. Sunnyvale’s
development fees are comparable if not lower than those charged in surrounding communities
and are not considered a constraint to housing development in this area.
The City’s current fees for two recent sample projects, one single family and one multi-family,
are provided in Table 39 on the following pages.

The total Planning, Building, Public Works and Impact fees (parks, traffic and art) associated
with development of two typical residential projects are presented in Table 39. The first project
of 18 single-family homes had per-unit development fees at just under $43,700 per unit, or ap-
proximately 2.6% of the lowest sales price of the homes in that project, which were listed for
sale in 2014 at prices from $1.7 to over $2 million. The second project was a 186-unit apartment
development, with per-unit fees at a total of $20,508. Staff does not have the developer’s total
costs for these units, but they were advertised for rents ranging from $3,300 to $4,100 per month
as of August 2014. The City waives park fees for affordable rental projects and for affordable
units in mixed-income rental projects, such as affordable units in density bonus projects.
Building Codes and their Enforcement
The City of Sunnyvale has adopted the California Building Code of 2013, the California
Residential Code of 2013, the California Green Building Code of 2013 (CalGreen), and the 2012
International Property Maintenance Code, and is subject to Title 24, the State Energy
Regulations. The City’s building code also requires new residential construction to comply with
the federal American with Disabilities Act (ADA), which specifies a minimum percentage of
dwelling units in new developments that must be fully accessible to the physically disabled.
Although these standards and the time required for inspections may increase housing production
costs and/or impact the viability of rehabilitation of older properties, which are required to be
brought up to current code standards, the intent of the codes is to provide structurally sound,
safe, and energy-efficient housing.
The City administers a Code Enforcement Program that aims to preserve and maintain the
livability and quality of neighborhoods. Code enforcement staff investigates violations of
property maintenance standards as defined in the Municipal Code as well as other complaints.
When violations are identified or cited, staff encourages property owners to seek assistance
through the rehabilitation assistance programs offered by the City.
Site Improvements
The Sunnyvale Zoning Code requires housing developers to provide off-street parking, wiring
for electrical and telecommunications, including undergrounding of utilities, and open space for
all residential development. For multifamily units, developers are also required to provide secure
storage space1 and landscaping. While these requirements all increase the cost of housing, they
are consistent with current market demand and similar to requirements in other Bay Area
communities. The Planning Commission and City Council may reduce parking requirements on
a case-by-case basis.
The Subdivision Code requires cross gutters; curbs and gutters; sidewalks; street name signs and
traffic control signs; street paving; street trees; ornamental street lighting system; sanitary
sewage collection and pumping system; water distribution and fire protection system; storm
1
  The City requires 300 cubic feet of secure storage space per dwelling unit which is typically located in a portion of
the carport, garage or balcony. This is an important amenity in apartment living, and does not substantially add to
the development cost or the rental cost of a unit.

water drainage system fences along lot line adjacent to proposed or existing surface water
drainage channels; fences and landscaping along rear lot lines of lots backing upon streets or
highways; off-tract improvements, wherever such improvements are required for the general
health, safety and welfare, and where conditions necessitating such improvements are caused or
aggravated by the subdivision; and the dedication of rights-of-way or granting of easements
when necessary for the proper layout and maintenance of facilities. All of these requirements,
with the exception of the requirement for “ornamental” street lighting, are necessary for the
health and welfare of those living in the subdivision or to mitigate impacts on the surrounding
community. Some of the requirements, such as those for street paving, street name signs and
traffic control signs would have little impact on housing construction, as the street network is
already completed in most areas of the city.

Market Constraints
Land costs, construction costs, and market financing contribute to the cost of housing
development and reinvestment, and can potentially hinder the production of new affordable
housing. Although many constraints are driven by market conditions, jurisdictions have some
ability to institute policies and programs to address the constraints.
Development Costs
Land and construction costs represent the most significant barrier to the construction of new
affordable housing. In 2011, land costs in Sunnyvale for sites suitable for residential
development were noted to be in the range of $3 to above $4 million per acre. A price of $3
million per acre results in land costs of $71,429 per unit at an assumed density of 42 units per
acre, based on a typical three- to four-story building over podium parking.2 Assuming a 950
square-foot apartment unit, this per unit land cost would translate to $75 per usable square foot
of living space. Most available sites also require demolition and site remediation expenditures, in
addition to acquisition and construction costs. Sunnyvale has a history of assisting with site
acquisition for affordable housing projects, providing low-interest acquisition and/or
development loans to non-profit housing providers and various other forms of assistance in
exchange for long-term affordability covenants. For example, the City provided a long-term
ground lease of City property to MidPen Housing in 2009 for development of the 124-unit Fair
Oaks Senior Housing project. In 2007 the City provided an acquisition loan of $2.1 million for
acquisition of a 20-unit rental property known as Garland Plaza, which has now been
rehabilitated and restricted as affordable housing, and more recently, in 2013, the City provided
Charities Housing and MidPen Housing each with a long-term ground lease of City property to
allow development of two affordable housing projects at the former site of the National Guard
armory in Sunnyvale.
Construction costs vary widely according to the type of development, with multi-family housing
generally less expensive per unit to construct than single-family homes. However, there is wide
variation within each construction type depending on the size of unit and the number and quality
of amenities provided. Single family construction costs were not considered in the affordable
housing fee study cited above, as it is not feasible at this point in time to provide single-family
homes as affordable housing due to the high land costs. However, that study estimated the total
development cost for a typical affordable apartment development at $436,621 per unit, inclusive
of land. These cost estimates are consistent with those reported by developers of multi-family
projects under development in Sunnyvale just prior to completion of that study. A reduction in
amenities and the quality of building materials (above a minimum acceptability for health,
safety, and adequate performance) could slightly lower the cost of development. In addition,
prefabricated factory-built housing could reduce construction and labor costs to some extent.
One of the affordable housing projects currently under construction at the armory site, the
Parkside Studios project, is using modular studio units that are fabricated entirely off-site, which
will save both construction costs and time.

Another factor related to construction costs is the number of units built at one time. As the
number increases, overall costs generally decrease as builders can benefit from economies of
scale.
Mortgage and Rehabilitation Financing
The availability of financing in a community depends on a number of factors, including the type
of lending institutions active in the community, lending practices, rates and fees charged, and
equal access to financial institutions. Through analysis of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
(HMDA) data on the disposition of residential loan applications, an assessment can be made of
the availability of residential financing within a community.
Table 40 summarizes HMDA data for both Sunnyvale and Santa Clara County as a whole,
providing information on the approval status of all home purchase and home improvement loan
applications during 2007. Of the total of 2,931 applications for conventional home purchase
loans in Sunnyvale, 76 percent were approved, 15 percent denied, and 9 percent withdrawn or
incomplete. In comparison to the County-wide average, mortgage loan approval rates were
higher in Sunnyvale (76%), than the County (70%). Approval rates for home improvement loans
were also higher in Sunnyvale than Santa Clara County as a whole, at 66 percent compared to
only 59 percent County-wide. Staff has been unable to obtain more recent HMDA data
aggregated to the city and county levels.

Review of mortgage loan denial rates by census tract identifies several areas in Sunnyvale with
denial rates at or nearly twice the city-wide average of 15 percent. These census tracts3 include:
tract 5048.05 (30% of total 198 loan applications denied); tract 5087.04 (30% of total 50 loan
applications denied); and tract 8086.01 (28% of total 85 loan applications denied).
To address potential constraints and expand homeownership and home improvement
opportunities, the Sunnyvale offers and/or participates in a variety of programs. These include
the City’s First Time Home Buyer Loan Program, as well as rehabilitation programs for single-
family homes and rental properties. Such programs assist lower- and moderate-income residents

Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints and hazards affect, in varying degrees, existing and future
development in Sunnyvale. Discussed below are the major environmental hazards in the City, as
summarized from the 2008 Seismic Safety and Safety Sub-element of the General Plan. The
City’s General Plan recognizes these hazards and identifies programs to minimize them.
Geologic and Seismic Hazards
Sunnyvale is subject to the effects of earthquakes due to its location in the Santa Clara Valley
which is traversed by several active earthquake faults, including the San Andreas Fault, the
Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault and the Calaveras Fault. Lying beneath Sunnyvale are thick
layers of sand, gravel and clay, known as alluvium, which amplify the effects of earthquakes. To
improve the seismic safety of buildings in the less stable soil areas of the City, geotechnical
reports are now required for all developments in the City. The City actively participates in the
State of California Seismic Hazards Mapping Program. All geotechnical reports received by the
City are forwarded to the State of California for additional review.
Un-reinforced masonry (URM) buildings are particularly susceptible to ground shaking. In
compliance with URM legislation enacted 1986, Sunnyvale is continuing to perform hazard
mitigation on URM buildings. Only ten URM buildings remain in Sunnyvale, all of which are
located in the South Murphy Avenue historical area which is exempt from the State URM
legislation; none of these URM’s are residential structures.
Flood Hazards
The majority of Sunnyvale is located within the 100 year floodplain, although a 100-year flood
event has never occurred in the City. The Santa Clara Valley Water District maintains Calabazas
Creek, Stevens Creek, and the Sunnyvale East and West flood control channels, and has made
numerous improvements to the channels to increase their capacity. These channels coupled with
the City's extensive 150 mile storm drain system take the majority of surface run-off to the Bay.
In addition, low lying areas in the northern areas of the City are assisted by two pumping
stations. Within the next few years, the Santa Clara Valley Water District has planned additional
improvements to local creeks to ensure they will be able to contain the runoff from a 100 year flood.
Sunnyvale enforces specific building code requirements in the flood prone areas to minimize
potential property damage, including minimum foundation pad heights above the projected flood
depth as specific on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (F.I.R.M.). The City participates in the
National Flood Insurance Program Community Rating System, and has maintained a Class 8
CRS rating, enabling property owners to obtain a discount on flood insurance premiums.
Without the present system of dikes and levees, parts of Sunnyvale would be subjected to
flooding by tides. Were these dikes and levees to fail or their banks overflow, tidal flooding
could occur. In 2006, the City’s Department of Public Works completed a capital improvement

project to repair and strengthen the levees surrounding the holding ponds, reducing the chance
that the levees would fail in the event of a major earthquake.
Fire Hazards
Sunnyvale has a relatively low risk factor for fire loss and past fire experience has demonstrated
Sunnyvale to be a relatively fire-safe community. The City maintains a trained and well-
equipped fire service to respond to fires and other incidents. While the potential for extraordinary
disaster always exists, and while the aging process of the City and its buildings will have some
adverse impact on fire loss, the overall environment is comparatively fire-safe.
Hazardous Materials
A decline in manufacturing facilities in Sunnyvale and changes in the manufacturing processes has
resulted in a lower overall volume of hazardous materials stored and used within the City. The
highest hazard facilities, those with larger quantities of hazardous materials or materials having
greater toxicity, are located in the industrial area in the northern part of the City. The primary risks to
the community are spills and releases of hazardous materials from an onsite accident, a transportation
accident, an act of terrorism, or a seismic event. Regulatory controls are in place to minimize the
probability of releases occurring as a result of these incidences.
Aviation Hazards
Sunnyvale lies in the landing pattern of Moffett Federal Airfield and, during south winds, planes take
off over heavily- developed areas. Risk of future accidents exists even though the Navy's usage of
Moffett Field as a Naval Air Station ended in 1994. Other than the potential for aircraft accidents,
noise is the most significant concern of residents. Allowable land uses around Moffett Field are
determined by accident potential and noise level.
Impact of Environmental Constraints on Development
In summary, while Sunnyvale is subject to the environmental constraints described above, the
City’s Seismic Safety and Safety Sub-element sets forth a series of actions to minimize these
constraints. Sunnyvale incorporates this knowledge of safety hazards into its land use planning
and development review processes.
Environmental impact reports (EIRs) were prepared for the two most significant areas of future
residential development in Sunnyvale – Industrial to Residential (ITR) sites and the Downtown
Specific Plan – and concluded these areas were suitable for residential use. One of the primary
criteria under the ITR program for designation of industrial sites for housing was suitability for
residential development. The findings in the ITR “Futures Study” EIR state that with the
recommended mitigation measures, development of housing on the identified sites would not have a
significant adverse impact on the environment.
EIRs prepared for both the Downtown Specific Plan and ITR sites are Program EIRs which are
based on the concept of “tiering”, which means that as project proposals are made on specific
sites, the need for additional environmental analysis will be determined. If a proposed project
has the potential for impacts which exceed those discussed in the Program EIR, additional
environmental analysis is required.

Availability of Sites for Housing
ABAG has determined the projected housing need for its region for the 2009-2014 Housing
Element cycle, and has allocated this housing need to each jurisdiction by income category. This
Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) represents the minimum number of housing units
each community is required to plan for by providing “adequate sites” through the general plan
and zoning. An important component of the Housing Element is the identification of adequate
sites for future housing development, and evaluation of the adequacy of these sites in fulfilling
the City’s share of regional housing needs (RHNA). Sunnyvale has a RHNA allocation of 5,452
units distributed among the following income groups: 1,640 very low income; 906 low income;
932 moderate income; and 1,974 above-moderate income units.
The City plans to fulfill its share of regional housing needs using a combination of the following
areas:
        Vacant and underdeveloped residential sites;
        Redevelopment opportunity sites in the Industrial to Residential (ITR) areas;
        Mixed use zones in the Downtown Specific Plan and Lakeside Specific Plan Areas; and
        Redevelopable Commercial/Mixed Use Zones in the El Camino Real Precise Plan Area.
Together, the above areas comprise the adequate sites inventory with capacity for development
of a total of 5,849 dwelling units. Among these sites, there is sufficient acreage zoned at the
default “Mullin” density of 30 units or more per acre to allow for development of 1,640 very low
income and 1,052 low income units; sufficient acreage zoned for 15 units or more per acre to
allow for development of 1,183 moderate income units; and sufficient acreage at lower densities
to allow for development of 1,974 above-moderate income units, as described in more detail in
the following narrative. Parcel-specific site inventories are included in Appendix B.
Vacant and Underutilized Residential Sites
The City staff has conducted a comprehensive review of all vacant and underutilized sites
currently zoned for residential use using the City’s GIS database. The results of this analysis are
presented in Table 41, with the parcel-specific inventory included in Appendix B.
Only one truly vacant residential site remains in Sunnyvale – the 9.27 acre site known as the
“Corn Palace” located along the Lawrence Expressway. This site, comprised of one parcel, is
currently used for a farm stand. Based on the existing land use designation (R-Low-Medium) and
an assumption that a significant percentage of the land area would go towards new public streets,
this site is estimated to have capacity for development of approximately 96 new homes.
Throughout most of Sunnyvale’s residential zoning districts, there are older, underutilized
properties developed with fewer units than are permitted under zoning. With the lack of vacant
land remaining in Sunnyvale, redevelopment of such lots is an important source for future
Housing Element                                Page 79

                                                                             Housing Opportunities
housing. For purposes of identifying underutilized parcels suitable for redevelopment within the
five year planning period of the Housing Element, the following criteria were used: 1) the net
increase in units achievable under a “realistic” zoning density is more than twice the existing
number of units; 2) the existing structure is over 30 years of age; and 3) the ratio of on-site
improvements (i.e. the structure) to the total value (the structure and the land) is generally less
than 50 percent. As presented in Table 41, a total of nearly 48 acres of vacant and underutilized
residential property have been identified. Given the high land cost in the Silicon Valley, the
market has supported residential recycling and intensification in Sunnyvale’s residential
neighborhoods for many years. For example, since 2010, the city has approved more than twenty
residential infill projects in various zones (see Table B-5 in Appendix B).
Several examples of development projects on underutilized sites (residential, mixed use, or
other) which are typical of current development trends include:
       A project approved in December 2013 consisting of the development of 105 apartment
        units on two parcels with a total of 1.6 acres, located at 455 South Mathilda Avenue, in
        Block 14 of the Downtown Specific Plan. This project involved parcel assemblage,
        demolition of occupied commercial structures, and a State density bonus for affordable
        housing. The occupied commercial buildings included a three-story occupied office
        building and a single-story, multi-tenant commercial building fronting on Mathilda, and
        several paved parking lots. All of the structures have now been demolished, a building
        permit has been issued, and construction of the project is expected to begin before the end
        of 2014.
       A project approved in December 2013 consisting of the development of 85 town homes
        on seven parcels with a total site area of 4.02 acres, located at 617 East Arques Avenue in
        north Sunnyvale. The existing structures to be demolished on the site included 54,000
        square feet of occupied structures including several light industrial uses, a commercial
        warehouse, a restaurant, and a nine-unit apartment building.
       A project approved in July 2013 for development of 117 apartments on two commercial
        parcels with a total site area of 2.3 acres, located at 457 East Evelyn Avenue in the
        Downtown Specific Plan area. The existing structures on the site included two occupied
        multi-tenant commercial buildings with a total of 31,000 square feet in floor area.
        Construction of the project began in May 2014 and is expected to be completed by Spring
        of 2016. This project involved parcel assemblage, a green building density bonus, a State
        density bonus for affordable housing, and demolition of two large commercial structures
        with various business tenants.
Examples of recent projects approved or recently proposed on primarily residential underutilized
sites, many of which included assemblage of several smaller sites by the developer, is provided
in Table B-6 in Appendix B. These projects, which are in various stages of completion or
pending City approval, could provide a combined total of 221 net new dwelling units in twelve
projects with a combined site area of just over ten acres. In addition, Table B-6 also provides
examples of infill projects on non-residential and/or mixed use sites which involved clearance of
various non-residential and/or residential structures, most of which were occupied at the time of
application, similar to the examples provided above. The development trends demonstrated by
Housing Element                                 Page 80

                                                                             Housing Opportunities
these examples are consistent with the City’s projections of future rates of development on the
underutilized sites in the Sites Inventory.
The City’s approach to assessing the number of units that can be achieved on underutilized
parcels is based on a realistic density of between 75 to 85 percent of the density allowed based
on the zoning or land use designation, whichever is higher. Sunnyvale’s General Plan states all
new residential development should be built to at least 75 percent of permitted zoning density as
a means of achieving the development form envisioned under the General Plan. Following the
City’s density policy, for the purpose of determining site development potential, realistic
densities have been assumed at 75 percent of maximum density for sites with low to medium
density residential zoning and/or land use designations.
Within high-density residential areas (R-4 and R-5 zones), the City encourages the greatest
residential densities and development trends evidence projects being developed at close to the
maximum zoned densities. For example, a high-density apartment development was completed
in 2012 at 1287 Lawrence Station Road. This 6.63 acre site is zoned R-5/PD/MU and was
approved for 338 apartments and live-work units in addition to 16,000 square feet of commercial
and retail space, resulting in a density of 51 units/acre. Therefore, the realistic densities for these
higher density zones have been increased and assumed at 85 percent of maximum density.
Utilizing these assumptions for realistic density, the 48 acres of vacant and underutilized
residential property suitable for near-term redevelopment can accommodate a net increase of 703
new units. The greatest opportunity for additional units lies in the medium-density R-3 zone and
high density R-4 zone where condominiums, townhomes and apartments are the preferred
development types. The areas with zoning and/or general plan land use designations which
allow at least 30 dwelling units to the acre, as shown on the “R-High” row of Table 41, meet the
densities required to facilitate the development of housing affordable to low or very low income
households.

Industrial to Residential (ITR) Sites
The 1993 Futures Study identified several of the City’s older underutilized industrial sites for
planned redevelopment with residential uses, while directing higher intensity industrial
development to other areas more suitable over the long-term for such uses. The result of the
Futures Study was the establishment of the Industrial to Residential Combining District (ITR),
the purpose of which is to allow industrial, office, commercial and residential uses to exist within
the same zoning district, and to encourage ITR areas to gradually convert to residential uses.
Sites were selected for ITR zoning based on their suitability for residential development (all are
located adjacent to residential neighborhoods); the probability of redevelopment based on a
predominance of older, underutilized light industrial uses; how well the site could support higher
density residential along existing and proposed transit lines; and how well the site helps create a
neighborhood with a mix of uses. In 2007 an additional ITR area was added; the ITR Combining
District at that time included approximately 320 acres, and could accommodate up to 7,700
dwelling units. By January 2009, approximately 1,700 units had either been constructed or had
received building permits within the ITR areas. For purposes of demonstrating the viability of
residential development in the ITR areas, the 2009 Housing Element included a series of maps
outlining the ITR boundaries and identifying the extent of residential development in each of
these areas (refer to Appendix B of the 2009 Element). The ITR sites provided the greatest
opportunity for additional residential development within Sunnyvale during the 2007-2014
planning period. Many of these areas were redeveloped with residential projects during that
period, so the current sites inventory in Appendix B includes just one map that covers all
remaining ITR sites.
In addition to market support for residential development, several other factors promote
residential development within the ITR areas. ITR zoning limits the intensity of industrial

                                                                          Housing Opportunities
development to 0.35 FAR, whereas a far greater intensity of residential development is permitted
– either 24 or 36 units per acre, depending on whether it is combined with an R-3 or R-4 zoning
district. Once residential uses are developed within an ITR area, the City’s Noise Ordinance
requires remaining industrial uses to comply with a more stringent noise standard based on their
adjacency to residential uses. In the nearly twenty years since ITR zoning has been in place, only
one site has been redeveloped with an industrial use. In various ITR projects approved since
2011, a total of 1,056 residential units have been completed or are in various stages of
development. The existing uses on ITR sites are predominately Class C industrial buildings,
defined as older properties that have not been renovated – their condition is typically fair but not
considered good. Given the under-investment in the older industrial buildings in the ITR areas,
combined with the significantly higher value of residential uses, the existing developed uses in
the ITR areas have not served as an impediment to residential development.
There are currently eight key ITR areas throughout the City, the majority of which are combined
with R-3 and R-4 zones and planned for condominiums, townhomes, and apartments. The
remaining residential sites in the ITR areas have been identified by removing sites that have
already been developed or entitled. The remaining sites available for development have been
reviewed and updated development assumptions made. As illustrated in Table 42, potential
remains for development of more than 2,900 additional multi-family units in ITR areas. Staff
estimates that 1,970 of these units will be developed on sites with allowable densities of at least
30 units to the acre.

Downtown Specific Plan
The Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) was originally adopted in 1993 and was updated in 2003.
The goal of the DSP is to rebuild downtown Sunnyvale as a traditional downtown, a vibrant,
pedestrian-friendly center for shopping, working, living and entertainment. Redevelopment has
been in progress for a number of years within the core area, including redevelopment of the
former low-rise Town and Country shopping center into two large apartment projects with
ground-floor retail, known as Solstice and Carmel Lofts. Together these two projects include
more than 400 apartments and 35,000 square feet of retail space. Occupancy of the Solstice

                                                                         Housing Opportunities
Apartments began in late 2013, and many of the storefronts have been leased and will open soon
with cafés, restaurants and shops. Carmel Lofts began leasing in spring of 2014.
Construction of a mixed use retail/office/residential project on the large center portion of
downtown, commonly known as the Town Center Mall, began in 2008. That project includes
292 residential condominiums, up to one million square feet of retail space and 320,000 square
feet of office space. The Target store was rebuilt and completed in 2009. The office buildings
were completed in 2010 and were occupied by Nokia and Apple in 2010 and 2012. Several
additional higher density developments have been approved more recently, including two
projects on Evelyn Avenue approved in 2013 with a total of 184 apartments. This project took
advantage of the density bonus, and will provide 14 units affordable to very low income
households. Another project of 105 apartments on the 400 block of South Mathilda Avenue,
approved in late 2013, also received a density bonus, and will include 5 units affordable to very
low income households. The development of downtown continues to be a priority for the City.
The DSP is organized into four main districts to promote a mix of uses to create a lively street
scene, increase walkability, reduce dependence on the automobile, and provide for higher-
density housing in proximity to mass transit. In addition, a DSP goal is to encourage below-
market-rate housing in all residential neighborhoods. The four DSP districts are: the Commercial
Core District, Sunnyvale/Carroll District, South of Iowa District and West of Mathilda Avenue
District. In addition to the nearly 300 units with exterior shells completed on block 18 in the
Town Center, the greatest opportunities for higher-density residential development are focused
on remaining blocks: Blocks 1A, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 20. Within these blocks, the
Specific Plan provides for the development of 1,019 net new units, as illustrated in Table 43 on
the following page. This residential development potential is in addition to the amount of
commercial development permitted in each block; in other words, development of commercial
uses does not reduce the amount of residential permitted under the Specific Plan.

 * Maximum residential units are in addition to the commercial development potential within each block.
Blocks 14, 15 and 16 are zoned for Very High Density Residential (51-58 dwelling units per
acre) and require a minimum lot size of 0.75 acres. Development on these three blocks is
projected to occur at densities at or above 30 units per acre, for a total of 479 units. A
development located on 1.6 acres within Block 14 has already been entitled for 105 units with a
density bonus, but building permits have not yet been issued, therefore it will be counted in the
2015-2023 cycle, so those units have been included in the 171 unit estimate shown above.
The purpose of the minimum lot size is to assure the desired density is achieved. Ideally, the
blocks would be developed with no more than three projects, however the Code would allow up
to four separate developments per block. Each block is approximately three acres in size, with
individual property ownership ranging from 3 to 50 percent of the land area per block. However,
each block has at least one property owner that could redevelop their site in accordance with the
specific plan without any further land assemblage. Most of the properties are commercially
owned and used or are rental dwellings (i.e., only three of the 30 properties are home-owner
occupied); this ownership pattern assists in the aggregation of land.
The City purchased 5 parcels in Block 15 many years ago (one-quarter of the land area) and has
been land-banking these properties since that time to facilitate future land assemblage and
development. A major residential developer has recently expressed interest in redeveloping
Block 15 and submitted a preliminary review application in 2014. The City will continue to
encourage site assembly in the Downtown by continuing to publicize the downtown
redevelopment potential made possible by the DSP through City channels such as the
“Downtown Redevelopment Information” webpage, KSUN, and public meetings regarding the
status of redevelopment.

Lakeside Specific Plan
In 2005, the City Council adopted the Lakeside Specific Plan to facilitate redevelopment of an
8.8 acre site currently developed with an older, low rise hotel with development of a mixed use
hotel and residential project. Given the site’s prime location adjacent the Lawrence Expressway
and Highway 101, as well as a number of City amenities and visitor attractions, redevelopment
of the site can provide significant economic benefits.
The addition of residential development as a component of the overall hotel development
program is recognized as having the beneficial effect of making the site attractive to hotel
visitors as well as to residents. The projected resident population will provide an increased level
of on-site activity through an extended period of the day and into the evening. Hotel visitor
amenities, such as the restaurant and support retail, benefit from and are an attraction for nearby
residents, who also are potential customers. Moreover, people using the open space associated
with the adjacent lake provide an increased sense of safety and interest for everyone.
The stated goals of the specific plan are as follows:
             Create a dynamic, economically viable hotel and residential development project
              that is beneficial to the City’s economic base and which will complement the quality
              and high intensity character of the neighborhood;
             Create housing that increases the diversity of unit types in tenure, type, size, and
              location to permit a range of choice for all current residents and those expected to
              become city residents. The mix of these higher density units, both in terms of size
              and affordability, shall provide for a variety of future residents. The project shall
              expand the City’s commitment to improving the jobs/housing ratio;
             Create a place that encourages quality architectural and landscape design, that
              improves the City’s identity, and that inspires creativity in utilizing opportunities to
              strengthen sensitive neighborhoods.
The residential development potential of the area, which includes approximately 5.5 acres for
residential use, is estimated at approximately 250 dwelling units, as shown in Table 43. The
specific plan allows for development of several residential buildings of up to seven stories in
height, with units ranging in size from one to three bedrooms. If the project is developed for sale
as condominiums, it will be required to sell 12.5 percent of the units as affordable, Below Market
Rate homes.
El Camino Real Precise Plan
El Camino Real is the primary commercial corridor of the City and is also State Highway 82. A
plan for the corridor, the “Precise Plan for El Camino Real,” was adopted in 2007 in order to
achieve the following goals:
     Establish a common vision for El Camino Real;
     Provide design guidelines for use by property owners, developers and the City in
        considering the redevelopment or rehabilitation of properties along El Camino Real;
Housing Element                                  Page 86

                                                                            Housing Opportunities
     Highlight development opportunities in certain locations known as “Nodes”, where more
        intense mixed-use development will be encouraged,
     Emphasize the importance of enhancing the street character of El Camino Real by
        developing a unifying design to provide a distinct aesthetic standard for the corridor.
A number of mixed use developments already exist within this plan area, such as the large
“Cherry Orchard” mixed use development, which includes a high density apartment complex as
well as a retail center with shops and restaurants. In recent years, several additional mixed use
developments have been approved or proposed along the corridor consistent with the Precise
Plan, including: a mixed use development of 103 town homes and a 145-room hotel, both of
which were nearing completion in April 2014; a mixed use project approved in December 2013
at 1095 W El Camino Real with 175 rental apartments in a four-story building and a three-story,
40,000 square foot office building; and an application submitted but not yet approved for 112
dwelling units and 32,500 square feet of retail space at 833 West El Camino Real. Table 44
provides a summary of the estimated residential development potential that remains within the
Precise Plan area, by node. There is no residential density limit for sites within this corridor, all
of which are zoned C2, which allows for commercial and mixed use development.

Residential Development Potential Compared with RHNA
As presented in Table 45, Sunnyvale’s regional housing need allocation (RHNA) for the 2015-
2023 period is for 5,452 new units. Table 45 compares Sunnyvale’s RHNA of 5,452 units with
the City’s residential sites inventory, which provides for a total of 5,849 units. This unit potential
is derived from the following:
     Capacity for 703 units on vacant or underutilized residentially zoned sites.
        Approximately 11 acres among these sites have allowable densities of thirty or more
        units per acre, which is presumed adequate to allow for development of 351 units
        affordable to low or very low income households;
     Capacity for up to 2,926 units within the ITR areas, including approximately 66 acres at
        densities sufficient to allow development of 1,970 units affordable to very low and low
        income households.
     Capacity for 1,019 units within the Downtown Specific Plan and Lakeside Specific Plan
        areas, including enough sites for 729 units at densities suitable for very low and low
        income housing;
     Capacity for up to 1,201 units within the El Camino Real Precise Plan area. Among these
        sites, densities are adequate to support development of 156 units affordable to low and
        very low income households.

                * 50% of Very Low units/sites are Extremely Low units/sites.
In terms of evaluating the adequacy of these sites to address the affordability targets established
by the RHNA, Housing Element statues use a concept known as the “default densities” to assess
affordability. Based on its population size, the default density for Sunnyvale is at least 30 units
per acre for providing units affordable to extremely low, very low and low income households.
Sites zoned R-4 and/or with land use designations of High Density Residential, and certain sites
identified within the Downtown Specific Plan, Lakeside Specific Plan, and El Camino Real
Precise Plan, as shown in Appendix B, allow densities in this range, and have been counted as
sites that can accommodate development of housing affordable to very low and low income
households. For moderate income households, the default density is 15 units per acre. Sites with
R-3 zoning or Medium Density Residential land use designations, as well as sites in the
Downtown Specific Plan that allow medium density residential development meet this density
threshold. Sites zoned R-0, R-1.5, and R-2 were counted as sites for above-moderate income
housing. Collectively, the sites identified in the Sites Inventory provided in Appendix B are
sufficient to meet the City’s RHNA in all the income categories.

                                                                          Housing Opportunities
Availability of Infrastructure and Public Services
All of the identified housing sites are surrounded by developed land and have the necessary
infrastructure and services in place to support development. In 2008, the city updated the Water
Resources Element of the General Plan, which confirmed the availability of water supplies to
serve projected growth. More specifically, the Element states that sufficient water supplies exist
to serve ABAG projections of an increase in nearly 20,000 residents in Sunnyvale by the year
2025. Any potential increase in water demand from new developments will be met from
contractual arrangements the City has with San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC),
Santa Clara Valley Water District and groundwater.
In 2009, the City entered into a 25-year individual Water Supply Contract with SFPUC which
includes an Individual Supply Guarantee (ISG) of 12.58 million gallons per day (MGD).
Although the Water Supply Contract expires in 2034, the ISG (which quantifies San Francisco’s
obligation to supply water to its individual wholesale customers) survives the contract’s
expiration and continues indefinitely. The Sunnyvale contract also includes a minimum purchase
amount of 8.93 MGD (10,003 acre-feet per year), which Sunnyvale agreed to buy, regardless of
whether sales drop below this level. The City also has seven active wells that could be utilized to
supplement increased demands.
Sunnyvale also has sufficient wastewater capacity within its collection system and treatment
plant to serve all development included in the General Plan build-out projections. The
City’s Wastewater Management Sub-element identifies a 2001 wastewater flow of 16.2 million
gallons per day (MGD), whereas capacity exists for 29.5 MGD. The shift in local industry
from primarily manufacturing, which used significant amounts of water, to knowledge-based
industries which do not use as much water, has resulted in a significant reduction in wastewater
flows. In addition, aggressive conservation programs targeting residential and industrial
customers have also resulted in decreased water demands and reduced flow to the wastewater
plant.
SB 1087, which took effect in January 2006, requires water and sewer providers to grant priority
for service allocations to proposed developments that include units affordable to lower income
households. Pursuant to these statutes, upon adoption of its Housing Element, Sunnyvale will
immediately deliver the Element to local water and sewer providers, along with a summary of its
regional housing needs allocation.

Financial Resources
Sunnyvale has access to a variety of existing and potential funding sources available for
affordable housing activities. They include programs from local, state, federal and private
resources. The following section describes the primary local and county housing funding
sources to be available in Sunnyvale during the planning period. These include Housing
Mitigation Funds, CDBG and HOME grants, BMR in-lieu fees, and others described below.
Table 46 provides a more comprehensive inventory of potential federal, State, County and
private funding sources.
Housing Mitigation Fund
Since 1983, the City has collected a Housing Mitigation fee from specified industrial and
commercial developments that exceed a floor area ratio of 0.35 as a means of mitigating the
impact of job-producing development on the demand for affordable housing. Funds may be used
for acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, preservation of at-risk housing, down payment
assistance, and related activities. Housing assisted with these funds is affordable to very low, low
and moderate-income households, although the emphasis is on subsidizing rental housing
affordable to very low income households. Some major uses of this funding in the 2007-2014
planning period included:
       $4.5 million for the development of the 124-unit Fair Oaks Senior Housing project;
       $2.1 million for acquisition of the 20-unit Garland Plaza Apartments;
       $5 million for rehabilitation of the 211-unit Homestead Park Apartments;
       $8.2 million for acquisition of sites for development of the Parkside Studios and Armory
        Family Apartments, which will include 47 units for homeless applicants
     Over $1 million in contributions to the Housing Trust of Silicon Valley
     Provision of nearly 50 First Time Home Buyer Loans
Redevelopment Agency Low/Moderate Income Housing Fund
The former Sunnyvale Redevelopment Agency (SRA) was created in 1975 to guide
redevelopment in the central core of the city. State redevelopment law, prior to dissolution of
redevelopment agencies in 2011, used to require these agencies to set aside 20 percent of the tax
increment funds they collected to increase and improve housing for low and moderate-income
households. These funds were deposited into a separate account known as the housing fund.
Because Sunnyvale’s former redevelopment agency was created before 1976, it was allowed to
defer payments into this fund as long as its pre-1986 debt service payments exceeded the tax
increment collected by the agency. The former RDA accounted for the amounts deferred from
the housing fund each year, and must repay the deficit in the fund if and when any tax increment
funds ever become available.
The dissolution of redevelopment agencies throughout California eliminated a significant source
of future funding for affordable housing. Due to pre-existing debt obligations, the SRA had to
defer payments into the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund (LMIHF). Between fiscal year
1994 to fiscal year 2011, a liability of approximately $14.7 million in deferred payments accrued
Housing Element                                Page 90

                                                                          Housing Opportunities
to the LMIHF. This liability is considered a housing asset to be administered by the City as the
Housing Successor to the former SRA. Based on the State’s repayment formula, it is currently
projected that the LMIHF could receive reimbursement over a 15-year period starting as soon as
fiscal year 2014-15. However, since the SRA still has a number of unresolved debts that could
ultimately delay the reimbursement to the LMIHF, these projections are just preliminary
estimates.
Below Market Rate (BMR) Housing In-Lieu Fees
Sunnyvale’s Below Market Rate (BMR) Home Ownership Program requires that 12.5 percent of
homes developed in residential subdivisions or condominium developments (homes for sale) be
sold as BMR units, at prices affordable to moderate-income home buyers. Developers of such
projects may seek Council approval to pay an fee in lieu of providing the BMR homes (the BMR
in-lieu fee). The BMR in-lieu fee, for developers of for-sale projects paying the fee rather than
providing any BMR units, is equal to 7 percent of the contract sales price of each home in the
development. During the thirty-plus year history of the BMR Program, less than a handful of
developers have opted to pay the fees, and thus these fees have not been a significant source of
revenue for housing. However, a code amendment enacted in 2012 also created an option for
developers to pay a fractional in-lieu fee rather than rounding their BMR unit obligation up to the
next highest whole number. Since that time, a small but steady stream of fractional in-lieu fee
revenue has been accruing in the fund, and is currently projected to fluctuate in the range of
several hundred thousand dollars annually, depending on the number of new developments
occurring. The current balance of the BMR sub-fund is approximately $2 million, which includes
more recent fractional in-lieu fee revenues, BMR administrative (transaction processing) fees,
and revenues from in-lieu fee payments received some years ago. These funds may be used to
develop additional affordable units and support administration of the BMR program.
Home Investment Partnership Act (HOME)
As a HOME entitlement jurisdiction, Sunnyvale receives an annual HOME grant directly from
HUD. HOME funds may be used for the construction, rehabilitation and acquisition of housing
affordable to lower-income households, as well as for tenant-based rental assistance, which is
similar to the Section 8 voucher program. The amount of these annual grants has declined
dramatically since 2010, due to congressional efforts to cut back on domestic discretionary
programs. The HOME grant awarded to the City for fiscal year 2014-15 is slightly over
$300,000, compared to grants of nearly $800,000 in the years just prior to 2010. Given the very
small amount of the grant at this time, these funds are no longer planned for use for major
housing developments. In the last two years, the City has budgeted all of its new HOME grant
funds for tenant-based rental assistance for homeless households. The City also received several
large HOME loan payments in excess of $1 million, which were almost immediately re-used to
assist the development of two affordable housing projects at the former site of the Sunnyvale
Armory: Parkside Studios and Armory Family Apartments. Such loan payments are received
somewhat sporadically, so it is difficult to project how much income of this type will be received
during the 2015-2023 planning period.

Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
The CDBG program provides funding for housing and housing-related activities such as:
property acquisition, housing rehabilitation, accessibility improvements, fair housing services,
and public services benefiting lower income households. Because CDBG funds cannot be used
for new construction, Sunnyvale has historically used most of its CDBG funds for housing
rehabilitation and home improvement programs. In the last several years the City has begun
using CDBG for employment development services for homeless people, as part of an effort to
help them obtain jobs and housing. Sunnyvale receives a CDBG grant as an entitlement city, but
the amount varies annually depending on how much is allocated to the program in the federal
budget. The federal allocations for CDBG have also been declining in recent years, although not
quite as sharply as those for HOME. The City has been allocated a CDBG grant of slightly over
$1 million for fiscal year 2014-15, a significant decline compared to the grant of over $1.3
million received in FY 2010. However, the City continues to receive program income from the
repayment of CDBG loans funded in prior years. These program income revenues typically
range from $150,000 to $250,000 per year.
Housing Trust of Silicon Valley (HTSV)
HTSV is a non-profit organization created in 2001 through a cooperative effort of the private and
public sectors, including the Collaborative on Homelessness and Affordable Housing, the Silicon
Valley Manufacturing Group, Santa Clara County, Community Foundation Silicon Valley, and
all 15 Santa Clara towns and cities. The purpose of the Trust is to increase the supply of
affordable housing in Santa Clara County within three program areas: first-time homebuyer
assistance, multi-family rental housing, and programs for homeless people with special needs.
Funds are available for acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, predevelopment costs and
supportive housing services. Since the Trust’s inception in 2001, it has raised $75 million and
leveraged over $1.88 billion to create more than 9,953 housing opportunities. During that time,
the Trust has provided down payment assistance loans to 183 Sunnyvale home buyers and
provided development financing to four affordable housing projects in Sunnyvale, including Fair
Oaks Senior Housing, Moulton Plaza, Socorro Home, and Plaza de las Flores.

Administrative Resources
Described below are several non-profit agencies active in providing affordable housing in
Sunnyvale. These agencies serve as resources in meeting the housing needs of the community.
MidPen Housing Corporation (MPHC) is a regional non-profit organization involved in
the development, and acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. MPHC also
provides professional management services and on-site coordination of services to residents.
MPHC has developed, acquired/rehabilitated and preserved numerous affordable housing
projects in Sunnyvale, including Moulton Plaza, Aster Park, Garland Plaza, the Carroll Inn,
Crescent Terrace, Morse Court, Homestead Park, and the Fair Oaks Senior Housing project.
MPHC is currently developing the new 58-unit Armory Apartments project for very low income
households.
Charities Housing Development Corporation is a non-profit affordable housing
developer based in San Jose. CHDC developed 23 apartments for developmentally disabled
tenants, the Stoney Pine Apartments, in 2001, and is currently building a new project in
Sunnyvale known as Parkside Studios, which will provide 59 studios for very low income
individuals, including homeless applicants. CHDC is also in the process of acquiring two group
homes for seniors in Sunnyvale.
Christian Church Homes of Northern California develops and preserves affordable
housing for seniors, and provides property management services and social service coordination.
The City worked with Christian Church Homes in the acquisition and preservation of Plaza Las
Flores as long-term affordable housing.
First Community Housing designs, develops and manages affordable housing. Located in
San Jose, First Community focuses on providing sustainable housing, locating projects adjacent
to transit corridors and providing free bus and light rail “Eco Passes” to tenants. Sunnyvale
worked with First Community Housing in the development of Orchard Gardens Apartments.

                                                                            Housing Opportunities
Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Conventional building construction, use and demolition along with the manufacturing of building
materials have multiple impacts on our environment. In the United States, the building industry
accounts for:
           65 percent of electricity consumption
           30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions
           30 percent of raw materials use
           30 percent of landfill waste
           12 percent of potable water consumption
Interest in addressing these impacts at all levels of government has been growing. In 2004, the
State of California adopted legislation requiring LEED (Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design) certification for new and renovated public buildings. Some local
jurisdictions have not only adopted similar standards for their public buildings, but have also
required LEED certification for larger commercial and residential developments.
LEED certification building standards are one piece of a coordinated green building program.
Why would a city adopt a green building program? Most local building standards already
consider energy and storm water issues. In addition, many jurisdictions have programs related to
energy, recycling, water conservation, storm water management, land use, and public health.
However, these programs are often overlapping and uncoordinated. One of the primary goals
behind establishing a green building program is to create a holistic, integrated design approach to
green building.
A green building program considers a broad range of issues including community and site
design, energy efficiency, water conservation, resource-efficient material selection, indoor
environmental quality, construction management, and building maintenance. The end result will
be buildings that minimize the use of resources, are healthier for people, and reduce harm to the
environment. Both the public and private sectors currently offer grants, refunds, and other
funding for green building. In addition, developments built to green standards assist both the
owners and tenants with energy and maintenance costs over time. The City adopted a green
building ordinance in 2010. The new Title 24 standards which will become effective in July 2014
are expected to exceed the local green building requirements, however the City continues to
encourage green building beyond that required by state regulations through use of incentives for
green building.
Environmental Sustainability in Sunnyvale
In 2006, Sunnyvale conducted a community feedback process as part of a visioning phase of the
General Plan update. The community clearly stated a desire for the City to become a leader in
environmental sustainability. This visioning process resulted in adoption of the following
sustainability policy:
Housing Element                               Page 96

                                                                           Housing Opportunities
         “A regional leader in environmental sustainability advocating to reduce dependence on
         non-renewable resources by providing greater transportation options, reducing waste,
         protecting our natural resources, and promoting alternative energy usage and research.
         We take environmental preservation and protection seriously and consider how each
         action will affect Sunnyvale for future generations.”
In response this sustainability policy, in 2007 the City developed a Framework for Sustainability
to provide the “big picture” perspective on what the City is (and can be) doing to promote
environmental sustainability. Part of this effort has involved the hiring of a full-time
Sustainability Coordinator to coordinate the various environmental sustainability activities
among City departments, and to leverage City funds through grants and partnerships with the
private sector. Highlights of but a few of the City’s achievements include:
     Adoption of the 2007 Solar Energy Plan aimed at educating the public on solar and
        reducing institutional barriers to promote solar energy. Over 893 photovoltaic permits
        have been issued for solar panels in residential buildings since 2007.
     Partnership in Sustainable Silicon Valley and adoption of the Sunnyvale Climate Action
        Plan to report and reduce CO2 emissions.
     Creation of an economic development initiative to attract businesses in the clean and
        green industry, with a focus on energy generation and energy efficiency.
     Zoning incentives for sustainable industrial development, and integration of sustainability
        development requirements and incentives in the Specific Plan for the Moffett Park
        industrial area.
     Municipal Code provisions which promote sustainable practices, including energy
        requirements in Title 24 of the Building Code, and provisions that apply to storm water
        runoff, wood burning appliances, solar water heating, landscaping and sidewalk
        improvements
     Partnership with Acterra to provide eco-information and education to help Sunnyvale
        residents reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. Through its “Green @ Home
        program,” community volunteers visit Sunnyvale households and perform basic home
        energy audits to calculate their carbon emissions and provide recommendations to reduce
        energy usage.
     Provision of up to $25,000 Energy Efficiency Loans for low income homeowners to
        replace inefficient aging appliances, heating systems, windows, increase insulation, and
        undertake other types of weatherization improvements.
The City adopted its first Climate Action Plan on May 20, 2014 2014.
The City’s commitment to sustainability was recognized by Popular Science magazine in its
2008 naming of Sunnyvale as the 13th greenest city in America. The ranking is based on National
Geographic Society’s Green Guide, and considers the following factors for cities of over 100,000
population: renewable energy, transportation and trip reduction, reduction of CO2 emissions,
recycling, and green living.

Energy Conservation Programs Offered through Local Utilities
In addition to green building, Sunnyvale promotes energy conservation by advertising utility
rebate programs and energy audits available through Pacific Gas and Electric, particularly
connected to housing rehabilitation programs. Lower-income households are also eligible for
State sponsored energy and weatherization programs.
Pacific Gas & Electric (www.pge.com)
Pacific Gas & Electric provides both natural gas and electricity to residential consumers in Santa
Clara County, including Sunnyvale. The company provides a variety of energy conservation
services for residents and PG&E also participates in several other energy assistance programs for
lower-income households, which help qualified homeowners and renters conserve energy and
control electricity costs. These include the following:
   The California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program - Provides a 20 percent
    monthly discount on gas and electric rates to income qualified households, certain non-
    profits, facilities housing agricultural employees, homeless shelters, hospices and other
    qualified non-profit group living facilities.
   The Relief for Energy Assistance through Community Help (REACH) Program -
    Provides one-time emergency energy assistance to low income customers who have no other
    way to pay their energy bill. REACH aims to assist who are in jeopardy of losing their
    electricity services, particularly the elderly, disabled, sick, working poor, and the
    unemployed, who experience severe hardships and are unable to pay for their necessary
    energy needs. Customers who have experienced an uncontrollable or unforeseen hardship
    may receive an energy credit up to $200.
   The Balanced Payment Plan (BPP) - Designed to eliminate big swings in a customer’s
    monthly payments by averaging energy costs over the year. On enrollment, PG&E averages
    the amount of energy used by the household in the past year to derive the monthly BPP
    amount. PG&E checks the household’s account every four months to make sure that its
    estimated average is on target. If the household’s energy use has increased or decreased
    dramatically, PG&E will change the amount of monthly payment so that the household does
    not overpay or underpay too much over the course of a year.
   The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) Block Grant - Funded
    by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, it provides two basic types of
    services. Eligible low-income persons, via local governmental and nonprofit organizations,
    can receive financial assistance to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling dwellings, and/or
    have their dwellings weatherized to make them more energy efficient. This is accomplished
    through these three program components:
    o The Weatherization Program provides free weatherization services to improve the energy
        efficiency of homes, including attic insulation, weather-stripping, minor home repairs,
        and related energy conservation measures.
Housing Element                                Page 98

                                                                           Housing Opportunities
   o The Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible
        households to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling dwellings.
   o The Energy Crisis Intervention Program (ECIP) provides payments for weather-related or
        energy-related emergencies.
  The Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) Program - PG&E’s rate reduction program
   for large households of three or more people with low- to middle-income. It enables low
   income large households to receive a Tier 3 (131 percent to 200 percent of baseline) electric
   rate reduction on their PG&E bill every month.
  Medical Baseline Allowance Program - PG&E offers additional quantities of energy at the
   lowest (baseline) price for residential customers that have special medical or heating/cooling
   needs because of certain medical conditions.
  Energy Works Program/Energy Partners Program - The Energy Works Program
   provides qualified low-income tenants free weatherization measures and energy-efficient
   appliances to reduce gas and electricity usage. In order to qualify for the program, a
   household’s total annual gross income cannot exceed the income as set in the income
   guidelines (http://www.hacsc.org/energy_works_program.htm); households must receive gas
   and/or electricity from PG&E; and the residence did not participate in the Energy Partners
   Program in the past 10 years.
  PG&E's SmartAC™ program - This program offers a simple and convenient way to help
   prevent power interruptions. When customers sign up, PG&E installs a free SmartAC device
   that slightly reduces the energy the air conditioner uses automatically in case of a state or
   local energy supply emergency. PG&E customers get $25 for signing up for the SmartAC™
   program.

HOUSING PLAN
The prior sections of the Housing Element establish the housing needs, opportunities and
constraints in Sunnyvale. This Housing Plan section begins by evaluating the City’s
accomplishments achieved during the 2007-2014 planning period, and then presents Sunnyvale’s
goals, policies and programs for the 2015-2023 period.
Evaluation of Accomplishments                                                under             the
Adopted Housing Element
Under State Housing Element law, communities are required to assess the achievements under
their adopted housing programs as part of the five-year update to their housing elements. These
results should be quantified where possible (e.g. the number of units rehabilitated), but may be
qualitative where necessary (e.g. mitigation of governmental constraints). The results should then
be compared with what was projected or planned in the earlier element. Where significant
shortfalls exist between what was planned and what was achieved, the reasons for such
differences must be discussed.
This section reviews the City’s progress to date in implementing these housing programs and
their continued appropriateness for the 2009-2014 Housing Element. Table C-1 contained in
Appendix C of the Element details the City’s specific accomplishments under each of the prior
Element’s goals and objectives, and indicates the continued appropriateness of these programs in
the updated Element. The discussion which follows draws from this analysis to highlight
Sunnyvale’s major housing accomplishments during the prior planning period, followed by a
review of the City’s progress in meeting its overall quantified objectives for housing production,
rehabilitation, and preservation. The results of these analyses provide the basis for developing
the comprehensive housing program strategy for the 2009-2014 planning period.
Some of Sunnyvale’s major housing accomplishments during the 2007-2014 period included:
   Development of the Fair Oaks Senior Housing project by Mid-Pen Housing Corporation, a
    124-unit development for extremely low and very low income seniors located next to the
    Valley Medical Center.
   Provision of assistance to MidPen Housing and Charities Housing for site acquisition and
    development of a total of 117 new affordable rental units for very low and extremely low
    income households, including formerly homeless households, at the former site of the
    Sunnyvale Armory.
   Revision of the BMR Ordinance in 2012 to make program enhancements and provide
    additional flexibility, and to update the density bonus provisions consistent with state law.
   Acquisition and rehabilitation of the 20-unit Garland Plaza Apartments by MidPen Housing
    Corporation.
   Rehabilitation and preservation of the 95-unit Aster Park Apartments project.
   Rehabilitation of the 211-unit Homestead Park Apartments project.

    Revision of the City’s Mobile Home Park Conversion Ordinance to provide additional
     protections for lower-income park residents.
    Provision of affordable housing density bonus incentives for development of the Ironworks
     apartment projects and the 455 Mathilda Avenue project, resulting in commitments to
     provide 19 very low income units.

  Rehabilitation column.
In total, approximately 77% of the RHNA goal for new construction was met during the cycle.
This is particularly notable given that several years of the cycle included the historic recession
which brought most investment and developer interest in new projects nearly to a halt. The new
units affordable to very low income households include 58 units affordable to extremely low
income households, with another 12 ELI units approved and scheduled to be under construction
by December 2014. When rehabilitated units are included, a total of 438 very low income units
were produced during the 2007-2014 period, or 41% of the very low income goal. That is a
significant achievement, given the amount of subsidy required to produce a very low income
unit. The City met 56% of its low income unit goal, including new and rehabilitated units; 152%
of its moderate income goal; and 95% of its above moderate income goal. If the 2009 Palmer
court decision had not occurred early in the cycle, terminating the City’s inclusionary (BMR)
rental program, approximately 125 of the moderate income units would have likely been low
income BMR rental units, and there would be another approximately 142 low income units in the
pipeline for the coming cycle, based on projects approved during the current cycle which have
not yet begun construction.
As illustrated earlier in Table 24, market rate rents in Sunnyvale were affordable to moderate
income households during this period. Sunnyvale’s BMR ordinance provided 258 BMR units
affordable to low income households, a portion of which were BMR rental units approved before
Palmer, and 82 BMR homes affordable to moderate income households, during this period.
Housing for moderate-income households was also provided through development of market-rate
apartments and condominiums. In addition to the units shown above, one additional new
affordable rental project was approved for development during this period, the Armory

Apartments project, which will provide 58 units affordable to very low and extremely low
income households.4
In terms of housing rehabilitation, Sunnyvale exceeded its overall goal to rehabilitate 260 units,
by providing rehabilitation assistance to rehabilitate more than 359 affordable rental units. These
included units at the following projects: Homestead Park (211 units, including 78 completed to
date and the balance to be completed by August 2014), Peacock Commons (28 units) Aster Park
(95 units), Garland Plaza Apartments (20 units), plus five group homes (Soccoro, Arbor Court,
Duane Court, and the Klee/Offenbach duplex). The Aster Park project was also a preservation
project, since the property’s affordability restrictions would have expired if the City had not
provided rehabilitation assistance in 2011. In addition, Sunnyvale provided 32 rehabilitation
loans to single-family and mobilehome owners, and 121 home improvement grants during this
period.

  That project is not included on Table 47 above because its building permit has not yet been issued, but the project is currently
in plan check and the permit is anticipated by September 2014. It will be included in the accomplishments of the 2015-2023
RHNA cycle.

Goals and Policies
This section of the Housing Element presents the goals and policies the City intends to
implement to address Sunnyvale’s identified housing needs.

                of Sunnyvale’s households of all income levels.
                Policy A.1   Encourage diversity in the type, size, price and tenure of residential
                             development in Sunnyvale, including single-family homes,
                             townhomes, apartments, mixed-use housing, transit-oriented

                Policy A.2   Facilitate the development of affordable housing through
                             regulatory incentives and concessions, and/or financial assistance.

                             tool to integrate affordable units within market rate developments,
                             and increase the availability of affordable housing throughout the
                             community.
                Policy A.4   Continue to require office, residential, and industrial development
                             to mitigate the demand for affordable housing.
                Policy A.5   Work with Sunnyvale’s major employers, educational and health
                             care institutions to facilitate and encourage the development of
                             workforce housing. Promote the City’s affordable housing

                Policy A.6   Provide first time homebuyer assistance to low and moderate
                             income households, with priority to buyers who currently work

                Policy A.7   Support collaborative partnerships with non-profit organizations,
                             affordable housing builders, and for-profit developers to gain
                             greater access to various sources of affordable housing funds.
                Policy A.8   Encourage developers to use State density bonus incentive when
                             applicable to provide affordable housing units.

                Policy B.6  Preserve Sunnyvale’s mobile home parks as an affordable housing
                            option. Maintain at least 400 acres of mobile home park zoning.
                Policy B.7  Regulate the conversion of rental apartments to condominium
                            ownership, and only permit conversions when the citywide
                            vacancy rate for rental units warrants, and a benefit to the overall
                            housing supply can be shown.

                Policy D.7  Take advantage of existing infrastructure and public improvements
                            to provide additional housing by allowing accessory living units
                            within residential neighborhoods.
Equal Housing Opportunities and Special Needs
Goal E          Promote equal housing opportunities for all residents, including
                Sunnyvale’s special needs populations, so that residents can reside in
                the housing of their choice.

                Policy E.4  Continue to address the special needs of persons with disabilities
                            through provision of supportive housing, accessibility grants, and

                                                                                    Housing Plan
                             households, and/or families with children, such as including units
                             with three or more bedrooms, on-site child care facilities, and/or
                             family-friendly open space and common areas.
Neighborhood Quality
Goal F          Maintain sustainable neighborhoods with quality housing,
                infrastructure and open space that fosters neighborhood character
                and the health of residents.
                Policy F.1   Continue efforts to balance the need for additional housing with
                             other community values, including preserving the character of
                             established neighborhoods, high quality design, and promoting a
                             sense of identity in each neighborhood.
                Policy F.2   Promote neighborhood vitality by providing adequate community
                             facilities, infrastructure, landscaping and open space, parking, and
                             public health and safety within new and existing neighborhoods.
                Policy F.3   Continue a high quality of maintenance for public streets, rights-
                             of-way, and recreational areas, and provide safe and accessible
                             pedestrian, bike, and transit linkages (accessibility) between jobs,
                             residences, transportation hubs, and goods and services.
                Policy F.4   Continue to implement a citizen-oriented, proactive education
                             program regarding neighborhood preservation. Encourage resident
                             involvement in identifying and addressing neighborhood needs in
                             partnership with the City.
                Policy F.5   Promote the preservation of historically and architecturally
                             significant buildings and neighborhoods through land use, design
                             and housing policies.
                Policy F.6   Require the use of sustainable and green building design in new
                             and existing housing.
                Policy F.7   Continue to permit and encourage a mix of residential,
                             neighborhood-serving retail, and job-producing land uses, as long
                             as there is neighborhood compatibility and no unavoidable
                             environmental impacts.

Housing Programs
The housing programs described on the following pages include existing programs as well as
several new programs that have been added to address the City’s identified housing needs. The
program summary (Table 48) included at the end of this section specifies for each program the
following: five-year objective(s), funding source(s), and agency responsible for implementation
of the program.
GOAL A: Provision of New Housing and Home Buyer Assistance
1. Below Market Rate (BMR) Housing Program
Sunnyvale began implementation of its Below Market Rate (BMR) Program, one of the oldest
inclusionary housing programs in the country, in the early 1980’s. The BMR Program is
continually reviewed and refined to address changing market conditions and improve its
effectiveness. The last major revision was adopted in 2012 to implement Program 1 of the 2009
Housing Element. That revision added several new compliance options for developers with
projects subject to the BMR ordinance, and made some administrative improvements as well.
The current BMR ordinance, Chapter 19.67 of the Municipal Code, requires residential
developments consisting of eight or more ownership units to designate 12.5 percent of newly
developed homeownership units as BMR units, for purchase by low and/or moderate income
homebuyers earning up to 120% of AMI. The BMR sale prices are targeted to be affordable to
households with median incomes (100% of AMI). The period of affordability is 30 years for
owner-occupied units.
BMR rental units were required in new rental projects between 1980 and July 2009, at which
time the program was rendered essentially inoperable by the Palmer v. City of Los Angeles court
decision. Part of the revisions to the BMR requirements adopted in 2012 included a revision to
preserve existing BMR rental units for the remainder of each property’s recorded term of
affordability, subject to the new Chapter 19.69 of the Municipal Code, and a revision removing
the prior requirement for BMR units to be provided in new rental projects.
Since the inception of the BMR program, a total of 685 BMR rental units and 421 BMR homes
for sale have been developed and occupied by income eligible households. In the intervening
years, a large number of those units have expired due to the twenty-year affordability term
required until 2003, when it was increased to thirty years for owner-occupied units and fifty-five
years for rental units. Currently there are 178 BMR rental units and nearly 330 BMR home
ownership units still subject to affordability restrictions. An additional 20 BMR homes for sale
are currently under development in approved residential projects, and an additional 52 BMR
homes have been proposed in projects for which planning applications have been submitted and
are pending City approval. Staff expects most of these planned BMR homes will be completed
during the 2015-2023 planning period.
        2015-2023 Objective: Continue to implement the BMR Home Ownership Program.
        Review and refine BMR program guidelines and codes periodically as needed to
        accommodate changing market conditions and improve overall program effectiveness.

2. First Time Home Buyer Programs
The City established a First Time Homebuyer Program (FTHB) in 2005 to help low and
moderate income home buyers purchase their first home. Most program participants purchase
homes made available through the City’s Below Market Rate (BMR) Housing Program, although
the program allows participants to purchase moderately-priced market rate homes as well.
Current market conditions are not highly conducive to market-rate purchases through the
program however the option is still available. Low-interest, deferred second mortgage loans
(“silent seconds”) of up to $50,000 are currently provided through the FTHB program, which has
provided a total of fifty-five loans since 2005. In 2009, the City updated the program guidelines
to streamline program administration, respond to changing conditions, and improve program
effectiveness.
        2015-2023 Objective: Continue to implement the FTHB Program and aim to assist 5-10
        low to moderate income homebuyers per year, or as demand warrants.
3. Affordable Housing Development Assistance
The City, using its local Housing Mitigation Fund, BMR in-lieu fees, and its HOME entitlement
grant funds, can finance the construction of new affordable housing in Sunnyvale, including
assistance to non-profit developers for various typical development costs, such as: clearance, site
acquisition, predevelopment/design, construction, and related project costs. The City collects
housing mitigation fees from non-residential development projects that generate significant
amounts of new employment in the City. The City prioritizes the use of these funds primarily for
projects that provide housing for extremely low and very low income households, as well as
some units for low income (LI) households. Priority is also placed on projects that agree to
reserve some units for special needs households, such as elderly and disabled tenants, including
those with developmental disabilities, people transitioning out of homelessness, and youth aging
out of foster care.
        2015-2023 Objective: Continue to work closely with the non-profit community through
        provision of regulatory incentives, technical assistance, and/or financing to support the
        development of new housing units affordable to extremely low, low and low income
        households. Continue to collect housing mitigation fees from non-residential
        developments to offset the demand they generate for affordable workforce housing. Seek
        additional sources of funding for affordable housing. Issue notices of funding availability
        annually, with advance outreach to potential applicants.
4. Density Bonus Provisions
Pursuant to State density bonus law (Government Code Section 65915), developers of residential
projects may apply for a density bonus and additional incentive(s) if the project includes one or
more of the following:
                 At least 10 percent of the units for lower income households;
                 At least 5 percent of the units for very low income households;
Housing Element                               Page 110

                                                                                       Housing Plan
                  A senior citizen housing development, as defined in Sections 51.3 and 51.12
                     of the Civil Code, or mobile home park that limits residency based on age
                     requirements for housing for older persons pursuant to Section 798.76 or
                     799.5 of the Civil Code;
                  At least 10 percent of the total dwelling units in a condominium development
                     for moderate income households.
In addition, developers of the above types of projects may qualify for an additional density bonus
if the project also provides one or more of the following:
                  Land dedication sufficient for the development of affordable units
                  Space for a child care facility.
The amount of density bonus varies according to a sliding scale set forth in State law, but
generally ranges from 20-35 percent above the density otherwise allowed under the zoning or
land use designation of the site. In addition to the density bonus, eligible projects may receive 1-
3 additional development incentives, depending on the proportion of affordable units and level of
income targeting. The following development incentives may be requested:
             Reduced site development standards or design requirements.
             Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing project.
             Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant or the City
                 that would result in identifiable cost reductions.
Applicants are also eligible to utilize the State’s parking ratio (inclusive of handicapped and
guest parking), which requires: one space for studios and 1-bedroom units; two spaces for 2- or
3-bedroom units, and two and one half spaces for units with 4 or more bedrooms. The Sunnyvale
Municipal Code was updated in 2012, in order to implement Program 4 of the 2009 Housing
Element, to reflect current State density bonus law.
         2015-2023 Objective: Continue to educate developers about the density bonus incentives
         available under State law through outreach materials provided online and/or at the One-
         Stop Center. Promote use of the density bonus in discussions with development
         applicants, and share the City’s density bonus calculator tool with interested developers.

GOAL B: Housing Conservation and Maintenance
5. Home Improvement Program
Since the late 1970’s, the City has offered a Home Improvement Program that provides various
types of assistance for home owners to allow them to fund needed improvements to their homes.
The program is funded by the City’s CDBG funds, either new grant funds or revolving loan
funds, as may be available. The program provides two main types of assistance: grants and
loans. Loans are provided for major housing rehabilitation projects, major energy efficiency
improvements, and/or exterior painting by licensed contractors. Grants are provided for
accessibility improvements, emergency repairs, purchase of paint for exterior painting to be
completed by the home owner, and/or minor energy efficiency improvements. Applicants may
combine any type of loan up to a maximum of $85,000 in loan funds, and may also add on an
accessibility grant if needed. Between mid-2007 and early 2014, the City provided loans and/or
grants to a total of 153 home owners through the Home Improvement Program. Major
rehabilitation of a total of 32 homes and mobile homes was completed during this period.
A list of the current loan and grant types and the maximum loan or grant amount available for
each is provided below. However, evolving prices for labor and materials, interest rates for
home equity loans, and related economic conditions may require program parameters to be
modified from time to time, so these limits may be adjusted if deemed necessary during the
2015-2023 planning period. All programs are available to lower-income home owners.
Accessibility grants are also available to lower-income renters, with the landlord’s permission
for the requested improvements. Loan payments are deferred for borrowers who are seniors
and/or very low income, and are amortized for borrowers who can afford to make payments
without incurring a housing cost burden.
        Loan/Grant Type                                     Maximum Available
        Single-Family/Condominium Rehabilitation Loan              $60,000
        Mobile Home Rehabilitation Loan                            $15,000
        Energy Efficiency Loan                                     $25,000
        Paint Loan                                                 $ 4,000
        Accessibility Improvements Grant                           $  6,500
        Emergency Repair Grant                                     $  5,000
        Paint Grant                                                $  1,000
        Energy Efficiency Matching Grant                           $  5,000
        2015-2023 Objective: Continue to operate the Home Improvement Program to assist
        lower-income households with funding for rehabilitation and minor improvements. Assist
        a total of 15-20 home owners per year through the program, or as demand warrants.
6. Multi-Family Rental Property Rehabilitation
The Multi-Family Rental Property Rehabilitation Program provides below market-rate interest
loans, including deferred and/or residual receipts loans, to finance substantial rehabilitation of
multi-family rental housing, including deferred maintenance, energy efficiency upgrades, and
correction of code violations. At least 51 percent of the units to be rehabilitated with program
Housing Element                             Page 112

                                                                                       Housing Plan
funds must be occupied by and rent-restricted to be affordable to low income tenants.
Historically this program has primarily appealed to non-profit owners of affordable housing
since they are used to complying with the requirements of public sector financing, and the units
are already subject to affordability restrictions. The loans are funded with several sources,
including CDBG, HOME, and local Housing Mitigation funds. The City provided a number of
rehabilitation loans for rehabilitation of various affordable rental housing properties during the
2009-2014 planning period, including rehabilitation loans for: Homestead Park (211 units),
Peacock Commons (28 units), Aster Park (95 units), Garland Plaza (20 units) and the Socorro,
Arbor, Duane, and Klee/Offenbach group homes, one of which was a duplex, for a total of 359
units rehabilitated during this period.
         2015-2023 Objective: Continue to offer below-market rate financing for rehabilitation of
         affordable rental units, using funding sources available to the City for this purpose.
         Provide rehabilitation financing to one or more properties during the planning period.
7. Multi-family Rental Property Acquisition and/or Preservation
The City also assists non-profit housing corporations in acquiring and/or preserving multi-family
rental properties, in order to preserve or improve affordability. Financing provided for this
purpose is very similar to that provided for rental rehabilitation projects as described above, and
may be combined with rehabilitation financing if the property to be acquired or preserved
requires rehabilitation as well.
         2015-2023 Objective: Assist in the acquisition and/or preservation, alone or in
         combination with rehabilitation assistance, of at least one multi-family rental property
         during the planning period.
8. Neighborhood Preservation Program
The Neighborhood Preservation (NP) Program is implemented by the NP Division of the
Department of Public Safety. The purpose of the program is to maintain and improve the quality
of life in the City’s residential and commercial neighborhoods. The program’s objectives include
the following:
        Promote attractive and well maintained residential and non-residential properties and
         neighborhoods, and discourage neighborhood decline by:
             o Resolving property maintenance violations in accordance with the Sunnyvale
                Municipal Code and;
             o Providing education, outreach, and resources to the community to foster attractive
                neighborhoods and prevent neighborhood deterioration.
        Resolve property maintenance nuisances throughout the community by:
             o Providing education and assistance and;
             o Conducting progressive enforcement when necessary.
        Provide education, outreach, and resources to the community to foster attractive
         neighborhoods and prevent neighborhood deterioration by:
             o Conducting concentrated code enforcement and implementing improvement plans
                in targeted areas and;

            o Supporting neighborhood clean-up programs and events.
         2015-2023 Objective: Continue to implement the Neighborhood Preservation Program.
        Housing Division shall continue to support the program as may be needed by providing
        information about the Home Improvement Program and other affordable housing
        information to NP staff, and attending program outreach meetings and events as needed.
9. Preservation of Assisted Housing
As described in the needs assessment section, the City currently has a total of 1,360 assisted
rental units in its affordable housing stock. While none of the assisted units are considered at
high risk of conversion to market rents, one project with a total of 150 affordable units currently
subject to a Section 8 contract (Life’s Garden) could potentially opt out of that contract during
the planning period, which means that the tenants might have to pay somewhat higher rents than
they are paying currently with the Section 8 assistance. However this project is owned by a non-
profit organization whose long term mission is to maintain the affordability of these units, as
confirmed by the organization. In addition, when such HUD contracts expire, HUD provides
portable Section 8 vouchers to all tenants occupying Section 8 units. The tenants may use the
portable vouchers to remain in their current units indefinitely, or may opt to move to another unit
of their choice with the portable vouchers. Although tenants of the expiring units would not be at
risk of facing major rent increases, the City’s housing stock could potentially lose these
affordable units. In order to minimize the risk of an opt-out at Life’s Garden, the City will take
the following actions to facilitate long-term preservation of these units:
       Monitor the property and maintain close contact with the property owner regarding long-
        term plans for the affordable units at the property.
       Offer financial and/or technical assistance to the property owner for preservation and/or
        rehabilitation of the units.
       In the unlikely event that the property owner opts not to renew its current Section 8
        contract for the units, monitor the property owner for compliance with the HUD
        requirements applicable in these situations, such as providing one-year notice to tenants,
        ensuring that the Housing Authority provides portable Section 8 vouchers to affected
        tenants, and so on.
        2015-2023 Objective: The City will maintain close contact with the owner of Life’s
        Garden and offer financial and other assistance to maintain the affordability of the 150
        units potentially at risk.
10. Section 8 Rental Assistance
The federal Section 8 Rental Assistance Program, currently referred to as the Housing Choice
Voucher Program, provides portable rental subsidies (vouchers) to very low and extremely low
income households, including families, seniors, and the disabled. Section 8 vouchers pay the
difference between the HUD-established “fair market rent,” which is set at approximately the
40th percentile of market-rate rents for a modest rental unit in the county, and what a tenant can
afford to pay in rent, typically 30 to 35 percent of household income. This program is
administered by the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Clara (HACSC) for the entire
Housing Element                               Page 114

                                                                                     Housing Plan
county. As of May 2014, a total of 520 Sunnyvale households were receiving rental assistance in
the form of portable Section 8/Housing Choice vouchers. Nearly half of those households, or
224 households, were headed by seniors. Given the significant gap between market rents and
what very low income households can afford to pay for housing, Section 8 plays a critical role in
allowing such households to remain in the community, and is a key program to address the needs
of extremely low and very low income households.
A second, lesser-known component of this program is known as “project-based Section 8.” This
component consists of contracts between the HACSC and various rental property owners who
agree to accept Section 8 subsidies directly from the HACSC in exchange for renting a certain
number of their rental units to very low and extremely low income tenants, generally selected
from the Section 8 waiting list. The subsidy formula is generally the same as with the portable
vouchers: the tenant pays approximately 30% of their income toward the rent, and the Section 8
subsidy pays the difference to the landlord. However, in the case of project-based vouchers, the
voucher is not portable. Instead, it is committed to a specific rental unit for a specific time
period, generally 10-15 years, based on the contract with the landlord, rather than being awarded
to a particular household which can use the voucher virtually anywhere within the county. Many
of the City’s affordable rental properties and even some market-rate rental properties participate
in the project-based voucher program, including many of the properties listed on the at-risk
inventory. As of May 2014 there were 150 rental units in Sunnyvale receiving project-based
vouchers, of which 122 were occupied by senior households.
        2015-2023 Objective: Continue to support the Housing Authority in its efforts to maintain
        adequate federal funding for the Section 8 program. Continue to refer extremely low to
        very low-income residents to the Housing Authority for information about Section 8
        assistance and other HACSC-provided affordable housing opportunities. Continue to
        provide landlords with information on Section 8, encourage them to list available rental
        units with the Housing Authority, accept voucher-holders as tenants, and participate in
        the project-based Section 8 program.
11. Anti-Displacement Provisions
In recent years public concern has been increasing regarding involuntary displacement of tenants
from existing housing in the Silicon Valley, San Francisco, and elsewhere in the Bay Area. In
Sunnyvale and some surrounding communities, there have been some recent incidents where
tenants, particularly those with more modest incomes, have expressed concern about being
displaced by redevelopment (demolition) of existing rental housing, or renovation of rental
properties followed by significant rent increases. The goal of this program would be to develop
provisions in City codes and/or policy to provide lower- and moderate-income tenants with
protection and/or assistance to in the event of demolition and/or renovation of large rental
properties, potentially similar to policies in place in Mountain View and other communities.
        2015-2023 Objective: Consider developing an anti-displacement policy or ordinance
        applicable to redevelopment and/or major renovation of larger rental properties.
        Conduct outreach on the topic with interested stakeholders before developing proposed
        provisions.
Housing Element                                Page 115

                                                                                      Housing Plan
12. Mobile Home Park Preservation
With 16 mobile home parks and over 4,000 mobile home units, mobile homes comprise an
important segment of Sunnyvale’s stock of affordable housing. Several policies serve to protect
mobile homes in the community. The City has established a designated mobile home park zone
district, and has adopted a policy to maintain a minimum of 400 acres of mobile home park
zoning. Currently, 13 of the City’s 16 parks, comprising a total of 420 acres, are zoned for long-
term mobile home park use. Chapter 19.72 of the Municipal Code, revised in 2012 to implement
Program 11 of the 2009 Housing Element, regulates the conversion of mobile home parks to
other uses, including requirements for preparation of a conversion impact report, tenant noticing
and public hearing requirements, and payment of relocation assistance to displaced tenants.
         2015-2023 Objective: Continue to implement current mobile home park protections and
         maintain mobile home park zones. In the event of a closure of a mobile home park,
         enforce the provisions of Chapter 19.72, Mobile Home Park Conversions, which requires
         relocation assistance to be provided to park residents.
13. Foreclosure Prevention
While home foreclosures were not as prevalent in Sunnyvale as in many other areas of the
County even during the worst part of the recession, there was and continues to be some incidence
of foreclosure in the City. Several area agencies provide foreclosure intervention counseling
services, including Project Sentinel and the Housing Trust of Silicon Valley. The City has
provided funding for services provided by these agencies for Sunnyvale residents in the past
several years, and will continue to promote these services to residents at risk of, or in the midst
of default or foreclosure proceedings. In addition, the home buyer counseling classes that the
City promotes to all interested home buyers, and requires of all BMR home buyers, provide
prospective home buyers with information and tools to avoid foreclosure once they become
home owners.
         2015-2023 Objective: The City will provide information about available foreclosure
         counseling services, warnings about foreclosure-related scams, and available legal
         resources, through City public outreach channels (website, Housing newsletter, media
         releases, City blog, etc.), and will continue to refer any homeowners in default to the
         services available.
14. Condominium Conversion Regulations
Apartment projects proposed for conversion to condominium ownership are subject to the City’s
Condominium Conversion regulations (Section 19.70 of the Zoning Code). These regulations set
forth a series of tenant protections, including relocation provisions, limitations on tenant rent
increases, and first right of refusal, among other provisions. The regulations limit the number of
conversions to 175 units in any 12 month period and require a citywide rental vacancy rate above
three percent, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission. Condominium
conversions are now also subject to the 12.5 percent affordability requirement under the City’s
BMR Home Ownership Ordinance.

                                                                                       Housing Plan
         2015-2023 Objective: Continue to provide tenant protections through implementation of
         the City’s condominium conversion regulations.
GOAL C: Removal of Government Constraints
15. Consider Modifications to Development Standards for Accessory Living Units (ALU’s)
Review current standards for development of ALU’s to determine if any revisions to the
standards are warranted to encourage or facilitate more development of ALUs. Evaluate capacity
for ALU development under current standards and existing property conditions in relevant
zoning districts, develop a menu of possible modifications to the standards to increase capacity,
streamline application review and approval, and/or otherwise encourage and facilitate
development of ALUs in appropriate locations.
         2015-2023 Objective: Conduct outreach, complete analysis of ALU standards and
         possible modifications, and provide recommendations for public, stakeholder, and
         Council consideration.
16. Complete the “Retooling the Zoning Code” Project
This project, which was partially completed in 2013, involves reorganizing, reformatting and
“retooling” the entire Zoning Code (Title 19 of the Sunnyvale Municipal Code) to make it more
clear and user-friendly for members of the public, staff and decision-makers. The new format
will use everyday language, illustrations and examples to clarify development requirements. This
project will also explore ways to improve administrative procedures and streamline permitting
requirements for residents and businesses. This project will not make substantive changes to land
use regulations or development standards.
An important goal of this effort is to create a permitting system with permit types and titles that
reflect the purpose of the permit (such as use permit or design review) and the decision-making
body (i.e., staff or a legislative body). For example, the permit title and type for most residential
projects in residential zones would be “Design Review” rather than “Use Permit.” For example,
the permit type for larger multi-family residential projects in residential zones might be Planning
Commission Design Review, provided the project complies with the density range and other
development standards of the zoning district. This change in title would improve the clarity and
certainty of approval for projects that meet the designated development standards of a given site,
since the approval is limited to design details rather than the proposed use itself. More
information about this project is available online at: ZoningCode.inSunnyvale.com.
The Retooling project was planned to be presented for Council review in three phases. Staff
completed the first phase of the project with a report to Council in 2013, and plans to complete
the next two phases by December 2015. The second phase of the project will clarify or create
necessary definitions, simplify the current use tables, and improve and streamline permitting
procedures. The final phase will reorganize and clarify the chapters on the various zoning
districts, site planning standards, and any remaining sections not covered in the earlier phases.
The final phase will also include the final draft of the Zoning Code for adoption by Council.

        2015-2023 Objective:
        Complete the Retooling project by providing a final draft of the Zoning Code for Council
        consideration by the end of December 2015.
GOAL D: Provision of Adequate Housing Sites
17. Residential Sites Inventory
The Land Use Sub-Element of the City’s General Plan provides for a variety of housing types to
meet the diverse needs of Sunnyvale residents, with densities ranging from 7 to 78 units per acre.
Industrial to Residential (ITR) areas provide the most significant opportunity for future
residential growth, with potential for development of more than 2,900 new units. The Downtown
Specific Plan and Lakeside Specific Plan areas provide capacity for more than 1,000 new units of
housing, providing opportunities for people to live, work, shop and recreate without having to
use their cars. The El Camino Real Precise Plan area also provides capacity for an additional
1,200 dwelling units, and various residential zones provide capacity for approximately 700 units.
The residential sites analysis demonstrates the availability for sites of a total of 5,849 units
during the 2015-2023 time frame. This residential development potential is more than adequate
to address the City’s share of regional housing needs, identified as 5,452 new units. As part of
this Housing Element update, City staff updated the parcel-specific vacant and underutilized sites
analysis that can be used to assist developers in the identification of potential sites.
        2015-2023 Objective: Continue to provide appropriate land use designations to address
        the City’s share of regional housing needs. Maintain a current inventory of potential
        residential and mixed-use sites to provide to developers in conjunction with information
        on available development incentives.
18. Minimum Densities
To encourage the efficient and sustainable use of land, the City requires residential development
to achieve at least 75 percent of the maximum densities permitted under zoning. Given high land
costs, multi-family projects in Sunnyvale’s highest density residential zones typically develop at
well above this threshold. Exceptions to this policy may be granted by City Council as warranted
by unique site characteristics.
        2015-2023 Objective: Inform development applicants of the minimum density policy and
        its purpose to encourage compact urban form.
19. Downtown Specific Plan
The development of its downtown as a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly, transit-oriented center for
shopping, working, living and entertainment is a key priority for Sunnyvale. In support of this
goal, the City prepared a comprehensive update to its Downtown Specific Plan in 2003,
providing various land use and development standard revisions including increasing residential
densities to an excess of 55 units per acre and providing for up to 1,800 dwelling units;
Housing Element                              Page 118

                                                                                      Housing Plan
commercial development potential is in addition to this residential capacity. The Plan is divided
into a series of blocks, with a maximum number of residential units identified in each block. In
addition to the nearly 300 units nearing completion on block 18 in the Town Center, additional
opportunities for higher-density residential development are available within the DSP area,
providing for a net increase of 1,019 units, in addition to the hundreds of units currently nearing
completion or soon to be under construction downtown, including units at Town Center, Solstice,
Carmel Lofts, Mathilda Avenue Apartments, and Ironworks North and South.
As a means of facilitating the assembly of sites and realizing the development envisioned for
Downtown, the 2003 Specific Plan identified the following implementing actions to be
undertaken by the City and its former Redevelopment Agency:
           Identify and target areas of partly aggregated property and assist in land aggregation
           Identify and purchase strategically located property as it becomes available and
              where it is important to accomplish long-term goals
           Invest in strategic parcels (including City-owned land) where it would increase the
              potential for strategic land assembly and redevelopment activity.
The City implemented major site assembly efforts in the Downtown many years ago, including
purchase of five parcels in Block 15 (one-quarter of the land area) that it is holding to facilitate
future land assemblage and development. At least one major residential developer has expressed
interest in this block and has submitted a preliminary review application with conceptual plans
for the site.
        2015-2023 Objective: Continue to publicize the downtown redevelopment potential made
        possible by the DSP through City channels such as the “Downtown Redevelopment
        Information” webpage, KSUN, and public meetings. Facilitate the provision of housing
        affordable to low and moderate income households by requiring below market rate
        (BMR) units to be provided on-site or within the boundaries of the Specific Plan, and by
        promoting the density bonus incentives and affordable housing financing available.
20. Accessory Living Units
An Accessory Dwelling Unit (ALU) is a separate dwelling unit that provides complete,
independent living facilities for one or more persons. It includes permanent provisions for living,
sleeping, cooking, eating, and sanitation on the same parcel as the primary unit is situated. Given
the limited developable land remaining in Sunnyvale, integrating secondary dwelling units in
existing residential neighborhoods present an opportunity for the City to accommodate needed
rental housing. The development of secondary dwelling units is effective in dispersing affordable
housing throughout the City and can provide housing to lower-income persons, including
seniors, college students, and recent graduates.
        2015-2023 Objective: Facilitate the construction of new accessory living units by making
        information about how to obtain permits for them available to the public.
21. Housing Policies for Priority Development Areas
Housing Element                                Page 119

                                                                                     Housing Plan
Priority Development Areas (PDAs) are areas of the City designated by Council as likely and
appropriate for development of new residential, mixed use and/or non-residential uses due to
their locations near transit and related factors influencing development capacity. These areas are
also identified in Plan Bay Area, which is the regional land use plan and Sustainable
Communities Strategy developed by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). The
City may consider developing specific housing policies for designated PDAs, such as the El
Camino Real Corridor and Lawrence Station Area, through preparation of new or modified
specific plans and/or station area plans. Such policies would provide additional incentives and
goals for the provision of affordable housing and/or any type of housing encouraged by the City
within the PDAs.
        2015-2023 Objective: Consider developing specific housing policies for designated PDAs
        in the City through preparation of specific plans or station area plans.
GOAL E: Equal Housing Opportunities and Special Needs
22. Fair Housing Program
The City will continue to support programs that provide fair housing services to Sunnyvale
residents. Sunnyvale currently provides funding to several qualified local fair housing agencies
to provide fair housing services in Sunnyvale. These agencies provide education, outreach, and
complaint investigation services for all members of the community. The City also contracts with
one of these agencies to provide tenant/landlord referral and mediation services.
        2015-2023 Objective: Continue to contract with qualified fair housing agencies to
        provide comprehensive fair housing services and/or tenant/landlord mediation to the
        extent funding is available. Provide multi-lingual fair housing brochures at City Hall, the
        Sunnyvale Library, Senior Center, Recreation Center, and the Columbia Neighborhood
        Center. Provide fair housing information on the City’s website, including a direct link to
        HUD fair housing website. Continue to participate in the Santa Clara County Fair
        Housing Task Force.
23. Accessible Housing
The City adopted reasonable accommodation procedures during the last planning period as part
of Program 23 of the 2009 Housing Element (see Appendix C). Its current procedures, available
in conjunction with Building, Planning, or any other development permits, meet all requirements
of applicable State and federal law.
        2009-2014 Objective: Maintain procedures for reasonable accommodation requests with
        respect to zoning, permit processing, and building codes. Continue to adopt accessibility
        updates to building and housing codes as needed. Provide grants to income-qualified
        households for accessibility improvements, and continue to provide CDBG funding, when
        available, for accessibility improvements to pedestrian facilities as needed in residential
        neighborhoods.
24. Programs to Address Homelessness
Housing Element                                Page 120

                                                                                     Housing Plan
During the prior planning period, the City provided financial and related assistance to facilitate
the development of two new housing developments that will provide a total of 117 units of
permanent supportive housing for very low income households, of which 47 will be reserved for
homeless applicants. Both projects will include supportive services on site to support all tenants,
with a special focus on those transitioning out of homelessness and/or with special needs. A
portion of the units will include project-based subsidies through the Section 8, Mental Health
Services Act, and Continuum of Care programs. These projects are currently under development
and expected to be completed in the first two years of the new planning period.
In addition, the City has been providing a significant amount of CDBG and HOME funds for two
programs for several years to help work-able homeless residents to gain housing and jobs. The
City will continue to support these programs, WorkFirst Sunnyvale and the Tenant-Based Rental
Assistance Programs, to the extent funding is available. In addition, the City provides CDBG
human services grants to a variety of agencies providing supportive services for lower income
residents who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Agencies currently providing these
services include Sunnyvale Community Services, Downtown Streets Team, West Valley
Community Services, Bill Wilson Center, agencies providing services for victims of domestic
violence, and HomeFirst SCC.
        2015-2023 Objective: Continue to provide funding for programs that seek to prevent and
        end homelessness and provide supportive services to homeless and at-risk clients.
        Continue to implement programs such as WorkFirst Sunnyvale and TBRA. Continue to
        offer financing for permanent supportive housing projects and other projects that agree
        to reserve units for applicants transitioning out of homelessness.
25. Special Needs Housing Development Assistance
Encourage developers of affordable and/or market-rate housing projects to reserve some or all
units in development for tenants with special needs, including but not limited to: adults with
severe disabilities, including developmental disabilities, mental and/or physical disabilities,
elderly residents, and youth aging out of foster care. Provide such projects with priority for
development and/or rehabilitation financing available through the City’s various housing funds,
such as Housing Mitigation, BMR in-lieu funds, CDBG and/or HOME funds. Encourage
developers and housing providers to work with advocacy groups that provide supportive services
to such special needs populations in order to facilitate outreach to prospective special needs
residents about planned or available special needs housing units, and to assist prospective tenants
with the rental application and leasing process.
        2015-2023 Objective:
        Include priority for special needs units in City notices of funding availability for new
        housing construction, rehabilitation, and/or preservation projects. Aim to assist in the
        development of at least one new project with some or all of the units reserved for special
        needs tenants, including tenants with severe disabilities. Encourage developers to include
        special needs advocacy groups in their marketing and leasing efforts related to newly
        available special needs units.

26. Development of Housing Units for Large Families and Single-Parent Households
Encourage developers of market-rate and affordable rental housing to include units with three or
more bedrooms in their new developments, to the extent demand is projected to exist for such
units based on timely market analyses and projected rent levels. Encourage developers to include
family-friendly common areas and open spaces within residential developments, including
appropriate play areas for children when possible. Encourage residential developers to include
on-site child care facilities to the extent possible, and inform developers of the density bonus
incentives available for qualifying projects that also include such facilities.
         2015-2023 Objective:
        Encourage rental housing developers to include units that address the needs of large
        families, single-parent households, such as units with three or more bedrooms, and to
        provide family-friendly common areas, open space and amenities such as on-site child
        care. Inform developers of the density bonus incentives available for qualifying projects
        with child care facilities.
GOAL F: Neighborhood Quality
27. Sustainability and Green Building
In 2007, the Sunnyvale City Council adopted a sustainability policy to become “a regional leader
in environmental sustainability, advocating to reduce dependence on non-renewable resources by
providing greater transportation options, reducing waste, protecting our natural resources, and
promoting alternative energy usage and research.” The structure for implementation of this
policy is set forth in Sunnyvale’s Framework for Sustainability, with the City’s various
environmental activities coordinated through the City’s Sustainability Coordinator.
In 2010, the City adopted its first green building codes using the “Build It Green” GreenPoint
rating system for residential construction, establishing minimum point thresholds, and providing
density, height and lot coverage incentives for exceeding the minimum thresholds. As a means
of lessening the potential impact on development, the ordinance phases in the green building
standards over several years, with threshold requirements for green building points increasing
over the four year period.
        2015-2023 Objective: Continue the City’s comprehensive sustainability and green
        building programs.

Stakeholder Outreach Meeting
October 9, 2013 at 10:30 am
City Hall, West Conference Room
456 W. Olive Avenue, Sunnyvale
Staff provided a background presentation on the housing element process, similar to that
provided at the earlier outreach meetings, but with slightly more focus on development-related
issues. Presenters included Suzanne Isé, Housing Officer; Trudi Ryan, Planning Officer; and
Hanson Hom, Director of Community Development. Several additional Housing and Planning
staff members were also in attendance. Eleven members of the public signed in at the meeting,
although more may have been present. Attendees included representatives of non-profit and for-
profit developers, advocates, local residents, and other community members.
A roundtable discussion took place after the presentation. Public comments included the
following:
     Even extremely-low income units (affordable to households at 30% of AMI) are not
        affordable for some residents on fixed income or SSI. There are very few units available
        at 20% of AMI or less.
     Review/reevaluate accessory living unit (second unit) policies to see if more could be
        permitted.
     Density bonus units should be provided at 15% AMI.
     Rezone larger lots into smaller lots to allow more units in single family neighborhoods.
     Focus on homeownership.
     Example given of Arlington County, VA which has inclusionary requirements on all
        home constructions, including single family home demolition/rebuilds.

Hanson Hom, Community Development Director and Suzanne Isé, Housing Officer attended this
meeting at the request of BIA. Approximately 20 building industry stakeholders attended,
including then-BIA South Bay representative Crisand Giles and a number of market-rate
developer representatives. Director Hom provided a background presentation on the Housing
Element Update, focused primarily on issues of interest to developers such as available sites,
constraints, land use policy developments, regional planning efforts such as Plan Bay Area and
the Priority Development Areas, and local planning efforts such as the Lawrence Station Area
Plan and the Grand Boulevard Initiative.
Attendees’ questions concerned development processes, available sites, Plan Bay Area, the
timeline for the Housing Element update, traffic study requirements, and impact fees. No major
issues arose during the discussion.

Joint Study Session of the Planning and Housing and Human Services Commissions
May 12, 2014
Human Resources Training Room
505 W. Olive Avenue, Sunnyvale
The Planning and Housing and Human Services Commissions met in joint study session for a
presentation and brief discussion of the 2015-2023 Housing Element Update. The meeting was
held on May 12, 2014 in the Human Resources Training Room at the Sunnyvale Office Center.
Suzanne Isé, Housing Officer, presented an overview of the draft Housing Element, and provided
information on City population growth, as well as demographic, housing cost, and income
changes since the 2009 update. Planning Officer Trudi Ryan and Community Development
Director Hanson Hom also participated in the presentation. Staff described recently approved
and constructed affordable housing projects, current housing programs, future housing goals, and
the public outreach efforts and public survey that was conducted in Summer/Fall of 2013.
Commissioners asked questions during and after the presentation.
Following the presentation, Commissioners held a brief roundtable discussion and invited the
public present to ask questions or provide comments. The discussion included the following:
     Availability of adequate sites for housing, and how the number of sites is determined based
      on zoning, general plan, allowable densities, the “default densities,” etc.;
     Whether or not there were any plans to increase density south of El Camino Real (answer:
      not as part of Housing Element);
     Whether or not single person households are considered special needs households (answer:
      no) but larger households are due, to less availability of large rental units;
     The challenge of creating significant numbers of new affordable rental units now that cities
      cannot impose inclusionary requirements on new rental projects, due to the Palmer court
      decision of 2009;
     The difficulty affordable housing developers face in trying to acquire new sites for
      affordable housing in the current very competitive real estate market;
     Possibility of charging impact fees on new rental housing to generate funds for affordable
      housing, and the required nexus study for any new fees;
     Potential options and strategies to address housing needs, such as secondary dwelling units
      or modifying BMR housing requirements, such as lowering project size threshold (like in
      Montgomery County, Maryland, which applies requirements to all new housing including
      those of single homes or home additions over a certain size), and/or increasing the
      percentage of BMR units required;
     Questions about how Sunnyvale’s housing programs and accomplishments compare with
      those of neighboring communities;
     Affordability concerns:
     o Rising rents have caused some residents to have to move out of town;
     o Households in middle income ranges are also struggling: they don’t qualify for
        assistance but can’t afford home prices
     o Possible anti-displacement policies to protect tenants of units to be demolished or
        renovated
     Impacts of growth on the community

    o Questions about impacts of new development on schools in Sunnyvale
    o School demographers continue to report that residents of single family homes, most of
        which are older homes, continue to enroll much higher numbers of children per home in
        local public schools (due largely to resale by elderly homeowners to younger families
        with children) than do residents of multi-family housing, whether rental or for-sale.
   o Many buyers of new condominiums in north Sunnyvale are reportedly sending their
        children to private schools due to concerns about public school quality, and/or don’t yet
        have children.

PUBLIC HEARINGS/GENERAL BUSINESS
Agenda Item 2: 14-0262 Make Recommendation to Council on the Draft 2015-2023 Housing
                 Element
Housing Officer Suzanne Isé gave a short presentation that included a review of the Housing
Element Update process, its requirements, and the progress made since the process started in
early 2012. She also noted that the Draft Housing Element summarizes the initial public input
received, and that there will be additional opportunities for the public and other interested parties
to provide input in the next few months before a final draft is submitted to the Department of
Housing and Community Development for approval in late August 2014. She encouraged the
more than 20 members of the public present to take this opportunity to share their ideas or
concerns.
Chair Chiu opened the public hearing at 7:40 p.m.
Non-Profit Housing Association of Northern California Regional Policy Manager Pilar F.
Lorenzana-Campo asked if density was the only metric being used to identify sites, or are there
any other land use or zoning mechanisms that are included in the Housing Element, such as
affordable housing overlay zones. She also asked what financing mechanisms is the City
considering, e.g. the use of boomerang funds or housing/commercial impact fees. Lastly she
spoke in favor of mobile home park preservation efforts.
Pat Sausedo, representative of the Building Industry Association, provided a letter addressed to
all Bay Area jurisdictions that includes a number of comments and issues that should be
addressed in the Housing Elements.
Mark Sabin, a Sunnyvale resident, spoke about the burden that high rents are creating for many
working people in Sunnyvale. If Sunnyvale is to remain a sustainable community, he suggested
creating a mechanism where those who choose to buy and develop housing above the median
affordable price pay a fee to offset the cost and provide incentives and subsidize funding for
those who buy properties to develop housing below the median price to provide affordable
housing, not low-income housing. Director of Community Development Hanson Hom noted that
a similar proposal, a rental housing impact fee, is scheduled to be considered by Council later
this year.
Sandra Murillo of the Housing Trust Silicon Valley thanked the City of Sunnyvale for its
continued partnership and funding to provide services to the residents of Sunnyvale.
Chair Chiu closed the public hearing at 7:55 p.m.

PUBLIC HEARINGS/GENERAL BUSINESS
Agenda Item 4:      14-0562 Make Recommendation to Council on the Draft 2015-2023 Housing
                    Element
                    Environmental Review: Negative Declaration
Suzanne Isé, Housing Officer, presented the draft Housing Element update.
Vice Chair Olevson and Ms. Isé discussed the policies that have been added to the draft Housing
Element, and discussed the proposal for a relocation assistance program.
Comm. Klein confirmed with Ms. Isé that City Council decided not to increase the Below
Market Rate (BMR) of 12.5% in 2012, and that lowering the threshold for the number of units
triggering the BMR program could be an added recommendation to Council.
Comm. Durham confirmed with Ms. Isé that requests by applicants to only pay the in-lieu fee
rather than build the BMR units would need to be heard by Council, and discussed a future
program to develop the BMR units that would otherwise have been built with the in-lieu fees
collected from different projects.
Comm. Harrison discussed with Ms. Isé current housing studies which include the adjustment of
the linkage fee assessed on commercial properties and the rental housing impact fee.
Chair Melton confirmed with Ms. Isé that several recessions slowed housing growth between the
years of 2000 and 2010. Trudi Ryan, Planning Officer, noted that during the 2008 recession,
Planning permits were extended in preparation for construction when the economy improved.
Chair Melton commented on the gap between the needed number of very low income housing
units determined by the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) and those that City staff
have determined will be built between 2015 and 2023, and discussed with Ms. Isé that money,
land and a zoning code that allows density and height are needed to close this gap.
Vice Chair Olevson discussed with Ms. Isé the source of funding to build 72 BMR units over the
next 20 years, and confirmed which agencies determine regional housing needs. Vice Chair
Olevson commented on the North Bay appearing exempt from these housing requirements.
Comm. Harrison discussed with Ms. Isé the BMR ownership program and confirmed that there is
no waiting list for these units. Comm. Harrison and Ms. Isé also discussed how a BMR property
is subsidized.
Melissa Morris, with the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, discussed her support of adopting
the draft Housing Element and said that her organization believes it is important to have a rent
stabilization program.

                                                                                     Appendices
Julie Quinn, with the Housing Trust Silicon Valley, discussed her support of adopting the draft
Housing Element and said that her organization believes funding programs should be included in
the Housing Element.
Marie Bernard, Executive Director at Sunnyvale Community Services, discussed her support of
adopting the Housing Element, the importance of having a rent stabilization program and of
finding other sources of funding.
Wendee Crofoot, with the Silicon Valley Leadership Group and Friends of Caltrain, discussed
her support of adopting the draft Housing Element and the need for housing to be built near
transit.
Chair Melton closed the public hearing.
Comm. Harrison confirmed with Ms. Isé that there is no division of the BMR in-lieu fund for
ownership versus rental properties, and confirmed that the housing mitigation fund supported the
armory.
Vice Chair Olevson confirmed with Ms. Isé that staff is not recommending the adoption of the
Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) job connection strategy, and that the ABAG
recommendations were added to the draft Housing Element as a reference.
Comm. Harrison moved Alternative 2 to recommend that Council authorize staff to submit the
draft Housing Element with modifications to HCD for review:
1) That all housing built for ownership be subject to the BMR requirement, regardless of the
number of units.
Vice Chair Olevson seconded.
Comm. Harrison said that while she understands that rental housing in California is exempt from
BMR requirements, she is aware of a program in Montgomery County, Maryland in which all
ownership housing is subject to BMR requirements on a sliding scale so that there are no games
played with an artificial limit. She said she thinks it could provide more money and not unduly
affect people building single units and would provide a continuous stream without politics.
Vice Chair Olevson said that there are so many requirements, from Federal funding requirements
to the State RHNA requirements, that the only means of survival seems to be spreading the pain
around to everyone. He said he is generally not in favor of requiring a builder to support
someone else, which looks to him like wealth transfer, but that at this point this is the only
equitable way of doing this.
Comm. Klein offered a friendly amendment to consider increasing the BMR requirement from
12.5% to 15% of all units in the project.
Comm. Harrison and Vice Chair Olevson accepted.
Housing Element                              Page A-10

                                                                                       Appendices
Comm. Klein said he will be supporting the motion and that decreasing the number of units
required before allocating funds to the BMR program makes sense, and that while he has a
question about single-family versus more than one, he thinks staff will look more closely to
determine what is fair. He said 12.5% has been the status quo for a long time and that ten years
ago the issue was brought up to raise that percentage, and seeing that it remains as 12.5%, he
thinks now raising it to 15% seems a more fair and easy calculation. He said it makes sense
within this state of the housing environment in Sunnyvale, and he applauds the upgrades staff has
made to the Housing Element, and thinks taking it a few steps further will improve the plan
overall.
Comm. Durham said he will be supporting the motion, and in looking at the gap between those
who can buy and those who cannot in the City and while trying to reduce travel and transit to
work, he thinks we have to try to keep a balance for people working in the area and that this may
be best way to do it. He said we cannot afford economically or environmentally to ship our
housing out to the other side of the peninsula or to the Central Valley.
Chair Melton said he will be supporting the motion and that he implores staff and everybody in
the City to continue to explore creative solutions to the problem. He said this is a real issue of
great impact to the wellbeing of the city, to all its citizens and to the future of the City to
continue exploring what we can do in Sunnyvale and on a regional basis. He said he gives a tip
of the cap to City staff for a job well done in the creation of the Housing Element as there are a
lot of moving parts and State requirements, and that there is a lot of subject matter and expertise
that we are fortunate to have in City staff. He said he is looking forward to seeing City Council
and the Housing and Human Services Commission take a shot at this.
MOTION: Comm. Harrison moved Alternative 2 to recommend that Council authorize staff to
submit the draft Housing Element to HCD for review with modifications:
    1) To add a program to consider expanding the Below Market Rate Ownership Housing
         Requirement to all ownership housing projects (i.e. those of fewer than eight new units);
         and
    2) To consider increasing the BMR requirement to 15% of all units in the project.
Vice Chair Olevson seconded. The motion carried by the following vote:
Yes: 6 -

                Re: Housing Element Update
                The undersigned members of the Bay Area Business Coalition
                advocate for a vibrant regional economy and outstanding quality
                of life for existing and future residents of the San Francisco Bay
                Area. A necessary—though by no means sufficient—condition to
                achieve these goals is for the region to provide an adequate
                supply of housing within the region. State housing element law
                generally—and the governmental constraints component in
                particular—can be important tools to advance these goals. With
                Bay Area cities and counties currently updating their housing
                elements, our organizations respectfully request that your
                jurisdiction consider and address the following comments as part
                of the public review process.
                We recognize that the housing element process can be resource
                intensive and sometimes difficult. We hope that by identifying
                certain priority issues and questions, this letter will assist in
                focusing resources on policies and practices that are of significant
                and recurring interest to the regulated community. We also
                would support incorporating these standardized issues into the
                framework for local jurisdictions to be able to take advantage of
                the housing element certification streamlining developed by the
                California Department of Housing and Community Development
                (HCD).
                I. Overview of the statutory provisions.
                The California Department of Housing and Community
                Development (HCD) has prepared formal guidance interpreting
                the constraints analysis portion of housing element law
                (http://www.hcd.ca.gov/hpd/housing_element2/CON_home.php.
                HCD’s overview of the requirements and their purpose provides:
                The element must identify and analyze potential and actual
                governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, or
                development of housing for all income levels, including housing for
                persons with disabilities. The analysis should identify the specific
                standards and processes and evaluate their impact, including
                cumulatively, on the supply and affordability of housing. The
                analysis should determine whether local regulatory standards
                pose an actual constraint and must also demonstrate local efforts
Housing Element                 Page A-17

                                                                                         Appendices
to remove constraints that hinder a jurisdiction from meeting its housing needs…. The analysis
of potential governmental constraints should describe past or current efforts to remove
governmental constraints. Where the analyses identifies that constraints exist, the element
should include program responses to mitigate the effects of the constraint. Each analysis should
use specific objective data, quantified where possible. A determination should be made for each
potential constraint as to whether it poses as an actual constraint. The analysis should identify
the specific standards and processes and evaluate their impact, including cumulatively, on the
supply and affordability of housing.
II. Requested specific areas of focus
We have identified certain policies that generally represent significant potential constraints in
the Bay Area and we request that as you conduct the constraints portion of your housing
element review, these issues in particular be addressed:
•        Did your jurisdiction commit to addressing specific constraints as a condition of HCD
certification of the existing housing element? If so, what was the constraint and what has
been done to address it?
•        Does your jurisdiction have a mandatory inclusionary zoning policy? If so, has an
analysis been done that measures the economic impact? Does it contain meaningful and
regularly available incentives, and is its implementation flexible so that there are alternatives to
a “like for like must build requirement” such as payment of reasonable in lieu fees, land
dedication, or acquisition and rehabilitation of existing units with provision affordability
covenants? Are such alternatives available at the developer’s option or with staff approval—
but without need for Council or Board approval on a project-by-project basis?
•        Has your jurisdiction adopted a density bonus ordinance consistent with governing
state law (Gov’t Code Section 65915)? Does the density bonus ordinance count mandatory
inclusionary zoning units toward the density bonus threshold as required by the recent court of
appeal decision in Latinos Unidos del Valle de Napa y Solano v. County of Napa, 217 Cal. App.
4th 1160 (2013)?
•        What is the cumulative fee and exaction burden on new housing in your jurisdiction?
This analysis should include not only development fees that are “formally” reflected in
published fee schedules, but also include exactions imposed via housing allocation program/
“beauty contests,” community benefits/amenities agreements, CFD annexation requirements,
and the like. The analysis should also include fees imposed by other agencies, for example
school fees, sewer and water fees, and fees imposed pursuant to an applicable regional Habitat
Conservation Plan. The analysis should determine the % of the sales of price of new housing in
the jurisdiction is represented by the cumulative fee/exaction burden, as well as the % of costs
for rental housing units represented by the cumulative fee/exaction burden.
•        Does your jurisdiction have any recently adopted, proposed, or under consideration
new or increased fee or exaction, such as an affordable housing impact fee?
•        Has your jurisdiction required new housing projects, including multifamily/attached
projects,  to pay a fee or special tax for ongoing
Housing Element                                    general governmental services?

                                                                                       Appendices
•       Does your jurisdiction have a designated Priority Development Area (PDA)? Is it a
“planned” or “potential” PDA? Have the number of residential units and densities shown in
the PDA application been incorporated into the General Plan? Has the CEQA process been
completed for the PDA so that no additional CEQA review is necessary for a proposed project
consistent with the PDA? Have development restrictions and processes been streamlined in
the area covered by the PDA?
•       What were the sites relied on for the adequate sites compliance of the existing
housing element? What has been the entitlement/development activity for these sites during
the prior planning period? Were any of the sites subject to “by right” development
procedures?
•       Does your jurisdiction have any type of cap or limitation on the number or type of
housing units that may be permitted or constructed jurisdiction wide or in specific areas of
the jurisdiction—including a cap or limitation tied to a specified level of new job creation in
the jurisdiction?
•       Has your jurisdiction provided for “by right” housing development in any areas?
•       Are there zoning or other development restrictions (such as voter approval
requirements, density limits or building height restrictions) that have impeded infill and/or
transit oriented development?
•       Has your jurisdiction consistently demonstrated compliance with both the letter and
spirit of the Permit Streamlining Act?
•       What are your jurisdiction’s historic preservation policies and review procedures and
have they had a significant impact on the permit and entitlement processes for new
development projects?
•       Has your jurisdiction adopted an ordinance pursuant to the Quimby Act that gives
developers credit for private open space?
•       In implementing the Quimby Act, does your jurisdiction provide for consistency
between the calculation of the existing neighborhood and community park inventory, and the
criteria and procedures for determining whether to accept land offered for parkland
dedication or to give credit for private open space? For example, has your jurisdiction refused
to accept an area in whole or in partial satisfaction of the parkland dedication ordinance on the
basis that it is unsuitable for park and recreational uses even though the area is substantially
similar to areas included in the overall parkland inventory used to calculate the parkland
dedication requirement and fee?
•       In the project review process, has your jurisdiction required developers to use the Bay
Area Air Quality Management District’s CEQA Thresholds of Significance for Toxic Air
Contaminants (TAC Receptor Thresholds)? Has your jurisdiction explored alternative
procedures for addressing project siting and air quality concerns, such as in the general plan or
zoning code?

•       Has your jurisdiction adopted a Climate Adaptation Plan that is more stringent with
respect to the per capita GHG reductions for the land use sector/transportation sector than
the equivalent per capita targets established for the region by CARB pursuant to SB 375?
Our organizations intend to monitor housing element updates throughout the region, and we
respectfully request that your jurisdiction formally respond to these questions early in the
update process. We also ask that you send a paper or electronic copy of the responses to:

  DATE:               June 6, 2014
        COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE CITY OF
                            SUNNYVALE’S DRAFT 2015-2022 HOUSING ELEMENT1
  These comments are submitted on behalf of the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley,
  Housing Trust Silicon Valley, MidPen Housing, the Non-Profit Housing Association of
  Northern California (NPH), and Downtown Streets Team. We are pleased that the City is
  taking its housing element update so seriously and welcome the opportunity to provide
  comments and suggestions regarding the current draft. We hope that the Planning
  Commission will adopt our recommendations, and we look forward to working with City
  staff to improve the analysis and recommendations contained in the draft housing
  element.
  PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
           We appreciate that the City has made consistent efforts over the last 6 months to
            reach out to our organizations and other stakeholders, to solicit our feedback, and
            to encourage our participation in this process.
  REVIEW AND REVISE
           Based on our review of Sunnyvale’s Annual Progress Reports, it appears that
            Sunnyvale’s performance during the 2007-2014 planning period fell well short of
            meeting the City’s housing need, especially with respect to lower-income
            households. Value is shown as % of total RHNA for each affordability level:
                  VLI – 12.3%
                  LI – 0%
                  Mod – 56.2%
                  Above Mod – 8%

  HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
         Sunnyvale’s population grew 6% between 2000-2010 which is less than the 11%
          projected by ABAG. Lack of affordable home options may be contributing to
          the smaller-than-anticipated population growth.
         According to jobs and housing fit research recently conducted by the UC Davis
          Center for Regional Change, Sunnyvale has a ratio of 3.65 jobs for every
          affordable home.2 The City should pursue policies and strategies to achieve a
          better fit between existing jobs and homes produced.
         The housing element should include a discussion of the impact of the closure of
          the Sunnyvale Armory on the community’s need for emergency shelter.
  AT-RISK UNITS
         Page 44 notes $240-$280K /unit to preserve. Please note this figure is low for new
          construction.
         With regards to replacement cost vs preservation. While it may be possible to
          purchase an existing market rate unit that’s in poor condition at $240-$280K/unit,
          it should be noted that replacement in the form of new construction would be
          much higher.
         Estimate of replacement versus preservation costs - Table 27 which is related to
          150 units of at risk rental housing for seniors at Life’s garden uses 50% AMI to
          calculate required subsidy, while most tenants are on fixed income and probably
          earn less. Is there a reason why 50% AMI is used to calculate needed subsidy vs.
          say 30% AMI? Further, needed subsidy is only focused on loss of rental
          assistance. Additional subsidy is needed for rehabilitation to extend the useful life
          of the building.
         Identification of qualified entities – There is limited discussion about transfer of
          ownership.
         Identification of potential funding - Elment discussed loss of BMR units due to 20
          year restriction. Element notes cost is too great to preserve and that “there is
          essentially no cost-effective mechanism by which the City can preserve only a
          few BMR rental units within otherwise market-rate properties” More thought
          could be given to identification of potential funding sources to help in the
          preservation of new “moderate income” or “workforce” rental housing
          opportunities to replace expiring BMR units which is a segment typically not
          served by traditional affordable housing funding sources that target low and very
          low income units.

  POTENTIAL GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL
  CONSTRAINTS
          A quick review of the Zoning Code reveals constraints on the development of
           housing for people with disabilities that are not identified in the draft housing
           element. For example, the City’s reasonable accommodation policy defines
           disability as “a medical condition, physical or mental impairment that
           substantially limits one or more of the individual’s major life activities.”3 This
           definition is more restrictive than the definition of disability used in the Fair
           Employment and Housing Act4 and other California anti-discrimination laws and
           could potentially lead to improper denials of reasonable accommodations.
           Additionally, the highly discretionary nature of the Miscellaneous Plan Permit
           process could lead to the improper denial of reasonable accommodations.5
          One of the most significant non-governmental constraints that a city must
           analyze in its housing element is “housing financing, including private financing
           and government assistance programs.”6 However, the draft housing element
           provides little analysis regarding the loss of redevelopment funds on the City’s
           ability to facilitate the new development of new affordable homes. As noted in
           the discussion on page 93, the state dissolved the redevelopment agencies,
           including the Sunnyvale Redevelopment Agency, since the beginning of the last
           planning period, depriving the City of one of its primary affordable housing
           development tools and creating great uncertainty for the future. This loss of
           funding should be analyzed as a non-governmental constraint to the development
           of housing for lower-income households, and the City should consider programs
           to mitigate the funding gap caused by the loss of redevelopment funds.7
          Land Use Controls - Table 35: Parking standards for Affordable housing
           developments (not including senior affordable) are 1 space for 1 bedroom, 2 for
           two or three bedroom and 2.15 for 4 bedroom or greater. Further parking
           reduction should be considered for affordable housing.
          Fees and Other Exactions - An affordable housing impact fee should be
           implemented to help in the creation of affordable housing units pursuant to nexus
           study.
           Existing Nexus study for commercial linkage fee supports a higher per square foot
           fee than what is currently being assessed. Consider increasing the commercial
           linkage fee to support creation of more affordable housing.
           Consider increasing the in-lieu fee payment for ownership housing.
          The development of a variety of housing types for all income levels - As noted in
           the housing element, market competition and land cost are the biggest constraint
           to affordable housing development in Sunnyvale. Housing element notes land cost
           of $3-$4 Million per acre. Actual market cost is more like $6-$7 Million per acre

             for parcels that are the right size, density and proximity to amenities. City could
             consider additional “carrots” and “stick” measures including land banking,
             transfer of development rights for affordable housing, affordable housing overlay
             zones and community benefit agreements, land value recapture etc. (i.e. requiring
             community benefits in exchange for up zoning of entire areas to a higher density,
             which may cause more speculation and put more upward pressure on already high
             land values)
  SITES INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS
            Property Listing - List meets requirements
            Unit determination - Mullin densities are used and a range between 75% to 85%
             max density used. 30+ DU/AC zoned sites are assumed as viable for low and very
             low, 15+ DU/AC sites are assumed for moderate households. Most opportunity
             parcels are less than ½ acre in size which is not ideal for multifamily development
             so there is a question as to whether actual density can be achieved without
             assemblage.
            Additional development potential of non-vacant sites - Extent to which existing
             uses may constitute an impediment to additional residential development is not
             sufficiently explored. Many of the sites listed as an opportunity for low and very
             low income housing include existing uses such as retail stores, self-storage
             facilities, religious institutions and offices that are economically sound businesses
             or that have deep roots in the community; making their redevelopment into
             affordable housing highly unlikely.
  QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES AND HOUSING PROGRAMS
            Generally, the housing programs are not sufficiently detailed. As noted by
             HCD, effective housing element programs include the following: “[d]efinite time
             frames for implementation;” “[i]dentification of agencies and officials responsible
             for implementation;” “[d]escription of the local government’s specific role in
             program implementation;” “[d]escription of the specific action steps to implement
             the program;” “[p]roposed measurable outcomes;” “[d]emonstration of a firm
             commitment to implement;” and “[i]dentification of specific funding sources,
             where appropriate.”8 However, the programs described at pages 124 to 129
             provide very little detail, no concrete timelines, no prioritization, and few concrete
             actions on behalf of the City. For example, programs 24 and 25 state that the City
             will “encourage” certain types of development but do not set forth any actions
             that the City intends to take.9 Notably, the time frame for every program is 2015-
             2023.10 The City should amend this section to set forth specific plans, actions,
             and timeframes for each of its programs.

           Additionally, the housing element should include more robust programs for
            addressing the shortfall of affordable housing funding created by the loss of
            redevelopment. For example, the City is already considering a housing impact fee
            for new residential development, and the housing element should include a
            program for adoption of such a fee. Along the same lines, the housing element
            should include programs for the designation and use of former redevelopment
            “boomerang” funds for affordable housing development.
           Since the City’s density bonus program is new since 2012, it should consider a
            housing element program to analyze the efficacy of the density bonus formulas in
            promoting the development of new affordable homes.
           We applaud the City for including a program to consider some form of anti-
            displacement policy (Program 11)11 and are very interested in working with the
            City to develop viable and effective policy options. However, it is our experience
            that unchecked increases in market-rate housing are one of the primary forces
            driving displacement in Sunnyvale and throughout Silicon Valley. As such, we
            encourage the City to specifically list rent stabilization and just-cause eviction
            protections as anti-displacement tools and to include these policies in its anti-
            displacement program.
           The housing element should include a program to address the loss of emergency
            shelter beds caused by the closure of the Sunnyvale Armory. While, as the draft
            housing element notes, the redevelopment of the Armory site is expected to yield
            117 units of much-needed permanent affordable housing,12 the need for
            emergency shelter has not disappeared. The City should make local efforts and
            participate in regional efforts to meet the area’s emergency shelter needs.
           We laud the City for identifying preservation of mobile home parks among its
            priorities for conserving and improving the existing housing stock.13 We wonder
            if the City has identified any particular parks that are at risk of closure now—with
            the proposed closure of Buena Vista Mobile Home Park in Palo Alto and
            Winchester Ranch Mobile Home Park in San Jose, mobile home park conversions
            appear to be a growing trend that threatens one of the region’s most significant
            sources of affordable housing. Sunnyvale has a recently updated and relatively
            protective mobile home park conversion ordinance, but it could also consider
            other proactive strategies for helping to preserve at-risk parks, such as the
            investment of City affordable housing funds to assist in resident or non-profit
            purchases where such purchase may be effective in preventing the displacement
            of mobile home park residents.
           The draft housing element identifies Section 8 housing choice vouchers as an
            important component of meeting the housing needs of very low-income
            households and includes a program to work with the Housing Authority of Santa
            Clara County (HACSC) and landlords.14 Especially after the cuts to the Section 8
            program prompted by the federal budget sequester, finding landlords who will
            rent to Section 8 voucher-holders creates a significant barrier to housing choice

            for these members of the community. State law does not explicitly prohibit
            landlords from discriminating against Section 8 voucher-holders, and the outright
            refusal of private landlords to accept Section 8 vouchers is a widespread problem
            affecting housing choice throughout California.15 This climate of discrimination
            is compounded by the disconnect between HACSC’s payment standard and
            existing market-rate rents, as well as its implementation of across-the-board
            subsidy cuts in 2013.16 In addition to working with HACSC to lobby to maintain
            or increase funding for the Section 8 program, the City should consider other local
            ways to create viable housing choice for Section 8 voucher-holders. For example,
            the housing element should include a program for considering an ordinance to
            prohibit discrimination against Section 8 voucher-holders. East Palo Alto and
            several other cities have successfully implemented such ordinances.
           The housing element should include a program to address the constraints to the
            development of housing for people with disabilities discussed above.
  OTHER REQUIREMENTS
           While the draft housing element does indicate that the City will deliver a copy of
            the adopted housing element to relevant water and sewer service providers,17 it
            does not indicate whether or not those providers grant priority to housing
            developments for lower-income households consistent with AB 1087.18

     HACSC’s payments standards are available here: http://www.hacsc.org/p_VPS.php . As an example,
  the payment standard for a two-bedroom unit is $1581 per month, whereas the average market-rate rent for
  a two-bedroom unit in Sunnyvale is listed at page 36 of the draft housing element as $2550 per month.

RE:      City of Sunnyvale Housing Element Update
         June 9, 2014 Planning Commission Agenda Item # 4.
THE FOLLOWING ARE COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE
CITY OF SUNNYVALE’S DRAFT 2015-2022 HOUSING ELEMENT.
I represent Sunnyvale Community Services. As the core safety net non-profit agency in the City of
Sunnyvale, we served 6,643 unduplicated low-income individuals last year with food and/or financial
aid. Our slogan for many years has never been more true: “Our business is booming and that’s not
good.” The amount of financial aid we distributed in just one year increased by 5%, and the number of
visits to our food program increased by 16%. But there are people behind the statistics:
         One senior couple came to us desperate after they received a notice that their rent
         was increasing $700. The husband was in ill and in hospice care. The wife was his
         caretaker. The husband subsequently passed away and she faces homelessness.
         Where can she go?
         A hardworking mom received the following notice rent increase notice: She could
         sign a 12-month lease for $2,174 per month for her apartment – an increase of
         61% in 18 months. Or, she could sign an 8-month lease for $2,565, or a month-to-
         month lease for $6,909 a month. How high can it go?
The same economic boom that is bringing in new revenue to our City is squeezing out the
middle income and low-income residents - the people we need to work in our City’s
businesses and services.
Our City’s cost of living is one of the highest in Silicon Valley, which leads the country in
housing costs. Fair market rents in Sunnyvale now equal $2,129 (similar to $2,153 for Santa
Clara County) according to RealFacts Online as of December, 2013. Rents in Sunnyvale went
up 40% in just three years!
    Housing Element                              Page A-27

                                                                                              Appendices
Unfortunately, Sunnyvale is losing its competitive edge and quality of life because of the
lack of TRULY affordable housing. Workers in the service industry can’t afford to live
where they work. Long commutes means clogged streets and freeways. If Sunnyvale wants
to be friendly to business, that means we need service workers living close to service jobs
that support all the businesses coming to town. We know that for every high tech worker,
there are four or more service industry jobs created. Truly affordable housing for low-income
and middle-income workers is a wise investment and needs to be a core part of our City’s
plans for the future.). If Sunnyvale wants to attract talent, we need affordable housing for all
workers.
We see Sunnyvale residents when they are at the end of their rope, when they get an
unexpected rent increase and they have no place to turn. We can’t fix the long-term problem
if their incomes can’t sustain their monthly rent. We need to invest in programs and policies
that will help the growing number of families and seniors who are one bill away from
homelessness.
In the same way, Sunnyvale’s affordability is at the end of its rope. We are quickly becoming a City of
haves and have-nots and it is changing our City in negative ways that will impact us for decades to
come.
On behalf of the nearly 7,000 individuals who come to Sunnyvale Community Services each year, I ask
that you strengthen your Housing Element recommendations to include the following:
     -   The City can prioritize specific investments in more robust programs for addressing the
         shortfall of affordable housing funding created by the loss of redevelopment. This may
         include a housing impact fee for new residential development, and the housing element should
         include a program for adoption of such a fee.
     -   The City can take the lead to grow more partnerships with non-profit agencies and business
         partners to raise new funds and use innovative approaches for truly affordable housing in
         Sunnyvale and north county. An alliance of civic and nonprofit and business partners can bring
         combined strengths to tackle this urgent and growing crisis.
     -   Since the City’s density bonus program is new since 2012, it should consider a housing
         element program to analyze the efficacy of the density bonus formulas in promoting the
         development of new affordable homes.
     -   The City can specifically list rent stabilization and just-cause eviction protection as tools in
         the anti-displacement program. Since we see evictions and rent increases every day, we are
         very interested in working with the City to develop viable and effective policy options. It is our
         experience that unchecked increases in market-rate housing are one of the primary forces
         driving displacement in Sunnyvale and throughout Silicon Valley.
     -   In light of the closing of the Sunnyvale Armory, we want to continue working with the City and
         Santa Clara County and neighboring cities on regional efforts to meet the area’s emergency
         shelter needs.
     -   Sunnyvale can be proactive in preservation of mobile home parks among its priorities for
         conserving and improving the existing housing stock. For example, Sunnyvale can consider
         strategies for helping to preserve at-risk parks, such as the investment of City affordable
         housing funds to assist in resident or non-profit purchases where such purchase may be
         effective in preventing the displacement of mobile home park residents.
     -   Our City can do specific outreach to landlords to accept Section 8 vouchers and TBRA
    Housing Element                                Page A-28

                                                                                           Appendices
       vouchers. Last year, the 15 TBRA vouchers for the City of Sunnyvale resulted in 13 families
       moving OUT of Sunnyvale because they could not afford the ongoing rent after the 2-year
       subsidy period was over.
    -  Finally, with the growing number of disabled and senior residents in Sunnyvale, we feel that the
       Sunnyvale Housing Element must include a program to address the needs of housing for people
       with disabilities.
Sincerely,
Marie Bernard

Appendix B: Residential Sites Inventory and Maps
As discussed earlier in the Housing Resources chapter of the Housing Element, the tables in
Appendix B provide parcel-specific detail on Sunnyvale’s inventory of residential sites suitable
for development within the 2015-2023 planning period. In addition, Table B-5 provides a list of
recent residential infill projects approved in recent years.
Table B-1:      Vacant and Underutilized Residentially Zoned Sites
Table B-2:      Industrial to Residential (ITR) Sites
Table B-3:      Downtown and Lakeside Specific Plan Area Sites
Table B-4:      El Camino Real Precise Plan Sites
Table B-5:      Recent Residential Infill Projects (2010-2014)
Table B-6:      Part One: Sample of Recent Residential Projects Involving Redevelopment of
                Underutilized Sites and/or Demolition of Existing Dwelling Units
Table B-6:      Part Two: Sample of Recent Residential Projects Involving Redevelopment of
                Underutilized Sites and Demolition of Existing Commercial Structures
In order to assess the development potential on identified vacant, underutilized and ITR parcels,
the sites inventory utilizes a “realistic density” of between 75 to 85 percent of the maximum
zoning density. Sunnyvale’s General Plan states all new residential development should be built
to at least 75 percent of permitted zoning density as a means of achieving the development form
envisioned under the General Plan. Following the City’s density policy, realistic densities have
been assumed at 75 percent of maximum density for sites with low to medium density residential
zoning designations (R-1, R-2, and R-3). Within high-density residential areas (R-4 and R-5
zones), the City encourages the greatest residential densities. Development trends evidence
projects being developed at close to the maximum zoned densities or occasionally even higher
through use of the state density bonus. Therefore, the realistic densities for these higher density
zones have been increased and assumed at 85 percent of maximum density.
Following the tables, a map is also provided for Tables B-1 through B-4.

use. For example, the conversion of former hospital or school buildings to residential use, or the conversion of a
historic single-family home to office use.
Adverse Impact: A negative consequence for the physical, social, or economic environment resulting from an action
or project.
Affordability Requirements: Provisions established by a public agency to require that a specific percentage of
housing units in a project or development remain affordable to very low- and low-income households for a specified

Area; Area Median Income: As used in State of California housing law with respect to income eligibility limits
established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), “area” means metropolitan area or
non-metropolitan county. In non-metropolitan areas, the “area median income” is the higher of the county median
family income or the statewide non-metropolitan median family income.
Article 34 Referendum: Article 34 of the Constitution of the State of California requires passage of a referendum
within a city or county for approval of the development or acquisition of a publicly financed housing project where
more than 49 percent of the units are set aside for low-income households.

and density bonus programs. All California Housing elements are required to address the preservation or replacement
of assisted housing that is eligible to change to market rate housing within 10 years.
Bed and Breakfast: Usually a dwelling unit, but sometimes a small hotel, which provides lodging and breakfast for
temporary overnight occupants, for compensation.
Below-market-rate (BMR) Housing Unit: (1) Any housing unit specifically priced to be sold or rented to low- or
moderate-income households for an amount less than the fair-market value of the unit. Both the State of California and
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development set standards for determining which households qualify as
“low income” or “moderate income.” (2) The financing of housing at less than prevailing interest rates.

Building Height: The vertical distance from the average contact ground level of a building to the highest point of the
coping of a flat roof or to the deck line of a mansard roof or to the mean height level between eaves and ridge for a
gable, hip, or gambrel roof. The exact definition varies by community. For example, in some communities building
height is measured to the highest point of the roof, not including elevator and cooling towers.
Buildout; Build-out: Development of land to its full potential or theoretical capacity as permitted under current or
proposed planning or zoning designations.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA): A State law requiring State and local agencies to regulate activities
with consideration for environmental protection. If a proposed activity has the potential for a significant adverse
environmental impact, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be prepared and certified as to its adequacy before
taking action on the proposed project. An Environmental Assessment may be prepared for housing elements, leading to
a Declaration of No Environmental Impact.
California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA): A State agency, established by the Housing and Home Finance Act of
1975, which is authorized to sell revenue bonds and generate funds for the development, rehabilitation, and
conservation of low-and moderate-income housing.
Capital Improvements Program (CIP) : A program, administered by a city or county government and reviewed by
its planning commission, which schedules permanent improvements, usually for a minimum of five years in the future,
to fit the projected fiscal capability of the local jurisdiction. The program generally is reviewed annually, for
conformance to and consistency with the general plan.
Census: The official decennial enumeration of the population conducted by the federal government.
Character: Special physical characteristics of a structure or area that set it apart from its surroundings and contribute to
its individuality.
City: City with a capital “C” generally refers to the government or administration of a city. City with a lower case “c”
may mean any city or may refer to the geographical area of a city (e.g., the properties in the city.)
Clustered Development: Development in which a number of dwelling units are placed in closer proximity than usual,
or are attached, with the purpose of retaining an open space area.

Services, typically for residents who are frail and need supervision. Services normally include three meals daily,
housekeeping, security and emergency response, a full activities program, supervision in the dispensing of medicine,
personal services such as assistance in grooming and bathing, but no nursing care. Sometimes referred to as residential
care or personal care. (See “Congregate Care.”)
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): A grant program administered by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) on a formula basis for entitlement communities, and by the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) for non-entitled jurisdictions. This grant allots money to cities and
counties for housing rehabilitation and community development, including public facilities and economic development.
Sunnyvale is an Entitlement City.

Community Redevelopment Agency (RDA): A local agency created under California Redevelopment Law, or a local
legislative body that has elected to exercise the powers granted to such an agency, for the purpose of planning,
developing, re-planning, redesigning, clearing, reconstructing, and/or rehabilitating all or part of a specified area with
residential, commercial, industrial, and/or public (including recreational) structures and facilities. The redevelopment
agency’s plans must be compatible with the adopted community general plan, including the housing element.
Compatible: Capable of existing together without conflict or ill effects.
Condominium: A structure of two or more units, the interior spaces of which are individually owned; the balance of
the property (both land and building) is owned in common by the owners of the individual units. (See “Townhouse.”)
Congregate Care: Apartment housing, usually for seniors, in a group setting that includes independent living and
sleeping accommodations in conjunction with shared dining and recreational facilities. (See “Community Care
Facility.”)
Consistent: Free from variation or contradiction. Programs in the General Plan are to be consistent, not contradictory
or preferential. State law requires consistency between a general plan and implementation measures such as the zoning
code.
County: County with a capital “C” generally refers to the government or administration of a county. County with a
lower case “c” may mean any county or may refer to the geographical area of a county (e.g., the county’s 15 cities).
Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs): A term used to describe restrictive limitations that may be
placed on property and its use, and which usually are made a condition of holding title or lease.
Criterion: A standard upon which a judgment or decision may be based. (See “Standards.”)
Density, Residential: The number of permanent residential dwelling units per acre of land. Densities specified in the
General Plan may be expressed in units per gross acre or per net developable acre. (See “Acres, Gross,” and
“Developable Acres, Net.”)
Density Bonus: The allocation of development rights that allow a parcel to accommodate additional square footage or
additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the parcel is zoned, usually in exchange for the provision or
preservation of an amenity at the same site or at another location. Under California law, a housing development that
provides 20 percent of its units for lower income households, or 10 percent of its units for very low-income households,
or 50 percent of its units for seniors, is entitled to a density bonus.
Density, Control of: A limitation on the occupancy of land. Density can be controlled through zoning in the following
ways: use restrictions, minimum lot-size requirements, floor area ratios, land use-intensity ratios, setback and yard
requirements, minimum house-size requirements, ratios comparing number and types of housing units to land area,
limits on units per acre, and other means. Allowable density often serves as the major distinction between residential
districts.
Design Review; Design Control: The comprehensive evaluation of a development and its impact on neighboring
properties and the community as a whole, from the standpoint of site and landscape design, architecture, materials,
colors, lighting, and signs, in accordance with a set of adopted criteria and standards. “Design Control” requires that
certain specific things be done and that other things not be done. Design Control language is most often found within a
zoning code. “Design Review” usually refers to a system set up outside of the zoning ordinance, whereby projects are
reviewed against certain standards and criteria by a specially established design review board or committee. (See
“Architectural Control.”)
Developable Acres, Net: The portion of a site that can be used for density calculations. Some communities calculate
density based on gross acreage. Public or private road rights-of-way are not included in the net developable acreage of
a site.

without disruption of, or significant impact on, natural resource areas.
Developer: An individual who or business that prepares raw land for the construction of buildings or causes to be built
physical building space for use primarily by others, and in which the preparation of the land or the creation of the
building space is in itself a business and is not incidental to another business or activity.
Development: The physical extension and/or construction of urban land uses. Development activities include
subdivision of land; construction or alteration of structures, roads, utilities, and other facilities; installation of septic
systems; grading; deposit of refuse, debris, or fill materials; and clearing of natural vegetative cover (with the exception
of agricultural activities). Routine repair and maintenance activities are exempted.
Development Fee: (See “Impact Fee.”)
Development Rights: The right to develop land by a land owner who maintains fee-simple ownership over the land or
by a party other than the owner who has obtained the rights to develop. Such rights usually are expressed in terms of
density allowed under existing zoning. For example, one development right may equal one unit of housing or may
equal a specific number of square feet of gross floor area in one or more specified zone districts. (See “Interest, Fee.”)
District: (1) An area of a city or county that has a unique character identifiable as different from surrounding areas
because of distinctive architecture, streets, geographic features, culture, landmarks, activities, or land uses. (2) A
portion of the territory of a city or county within which uniform zoning regulations and requirements apply; a zone.
Diversity: Differences among otherwise similar elements that give them unique forms and qualities. E.g., housing
diversity can be achieved by differences in unit size, tenure, or cost.
Duet: A detached building designed for occupation as the residence of two families living independently of each other,
with each family living area defined by separate fee title ownership.
Duplex: A detached building under single ownership that is designed for occupation as the residence of two families
living independently of each other.
Dwelling Unit: A room or group of rooms (including sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation facilities, but not more
than one kitchen), which constitutes an independent housekeeping unit, occupied or intended for occupancy by one
household on a long-term basis.
Elderly Housing: Typically one- and two-bedroom apartments or condominiums designed to meet the needs of
persons 62 years of age and older or, if more than 150 units, persons 55 years of age and older, and restricted to
occupancy by them. (See “Congregate Care.”)
Emergency Shelter: A facility that provides immediate and short-term housing and supplemental services for the
homeless. Shelters come in many sizes, but an optimum size is considered to be 20 to 40 beds. Supplemental services
may include food, counseling, and access to other social programs. (See “Homeless” and “Transitional Housing.”)
Encourage, v: To stimulate or foster a particular condition through direct or indirect action by the private sector or
government agencies.
Enhance, v: To improve existing conditions by increasing the quantity or quality of beneficial uses or features.
Environmental Impact Report (EIR): A report required of general plans by the California Environmental Quality
Act and which assesses all the environmental characteristics of an area and determines what effects or impacts will
result if the area is altered or disturbed by a proposed action. (See “California Environmental Quality Act.”)

Feasible: Capable of being done, executed, or managed successfully from the standpoint of the physical and/or
financial abilities of the implementer(s).
Feasible, Technically: Capable of being implemented because the industrial, mechanical, or application technology
exists.
Finding(s): The result(s) of an investigation and the basis upon which decisions are made. Findings are used by
government agents and bodies to justify action taken by the entity.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR): The gross floor area permitted on a site divided by the total net area of the site, expressed in
percent. For example, on a site with 10,000 net sq. ft. of land area, a Floor Area Ratio of 100 percent will allow a
maximum of 10,000 gross sq. ft. of building floor area to be built. On the same site, an FAR of 150 percent would
allow 15,000 sq. ft. of floor area; an FAR of 200 percent would allow 20,000 sq. ft.; and an FAR of 50 percent would
allow only 5,000 sq. ft. Also commonly used in zoning, FARs typically are applied on a parcel-by-parcel basis as
opposed to an average FAR for an entire land use or zoning district.
Footprint; Building Footprint: The outline of a building at all of those points where it meets the ground.
General Plan: A compendium of city or county policies regarding its long-term development, in the form of maps and
accompanying text. The General Plan is a legal document required of each local agency by the State of California
Government Code Section 65301 and adopted by the City Council or Board of Supervisors. In California, the General
Plan has 7 mandatory elements (Circulation, Conservation, Housing, Land Use, Noise, Open Space, Safety and Seismic
Safety) and may include any number of optional elements (such as Air Quality, Economic Development, Hazardous
Waste, and Parks and Recreation). The General Plan may also be called a “City Plan,” “Comprehensive Plan,” or
“Master Plan.”
Granny Flat: (See “Second Unit.”)
Group Quarters: A residential living arrangement, other than the usual house, apartment, or mobile home, in which
two or more unrelated persons share living quarters and cooking facilities. Institutional group quarters include nursing
homes, orphanages, and prisons. Non-institutional group quarters include dormitories, shelters, and large boarding
houses.
Guidelines: General statements of policy direction around which specific details may be later established.
Handicapped: A person determined to have a physical impairment or mental disorder expected to be of long or
indefinite duration. Many such impairments or disorders are of such a nature that a person’s ability to live
independently can be improved by appropriate housing conditions.
Historic; Historical: A historic building or site is one that is noteworthy for its significance in local, state, or national
history or culture, its architecture or design, or its works of art, memorabilia, or artifacts.

Historic Preservation: The preservation of historically significant structures and neighborhoods until such time as,
and in order to facilitate, restoration and rehabilitation of the building(s) to a former condition.
Home Occupation: A commercial activity conducted solely by the occupants of a particular dwelling unit in a manner
incidental to residential occupancy.
Homeless: Persons and families who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. Includes those staying in
temporary or emergency shelters or who are accommodated with friends or others with the understanding that shelter is
being provided as a last resort. California Housing element law, Section 65583(c)(1), requires all cities and counties to
address the housing needs of the homeless. (See “Emergency Shelter” and “Transitional Housing.”)
Household: All those persons—related or unrelated—who occupy a single housing unit. (See “Family.”)
Householder: The head of a household.
Households, Number of: The count of all year-round housing units occupied by one or more persons. The concept of
household is important because the formation of new households generates the demand for housing. Each new
household formed creates the need for one additional housing unit or requires that one existing housing unit be shared
by two households. Thus, household formation can continue to take place even without an increase in population,
thereby increasing the demand for housing.
Housing and Community Development Department of the State of California (HCD): The State agency that has
principal responsibility for assessing, planning for, and assisting communities to meet the needs of low- and
moderate-income households.
Housing Authority, Local (LHA): Local housing agency established in State law, subject to local activation and
operation. Originally intended to manage certain federal subsidies, but vested with broad powers to develop and
manage other forms of affordable housing. In Sunnyvale, the LHA is the Housing Authority of Santa Clara County.
Housing element: One of the seven State-mandated elements of a local general plan, it assesses the existing and
projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community, identifies potential sites adequate to provide the
amount and kind of housing needed, and contains adopted goals, policies, and implementation programs for the
preservation, improvement, and development of housing. Under State law, Housing elements must be updated every
five years.
Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of (HUD): A cabinet-level department of the federal
government that administers housing and community development programs.
Housing Unit: The place of permanent or customary abode of a person or family. A housing unit may be a
single-family dwelling, a multifamily dwelling, a condominium, a modular home, a mobile home, a cooperative, or any
other residential unit considered real property under State law. A housing unit has, at least, cooking facilities, a
bathroom, and a place to sleep. It also is a dwelling that cannot be moved without substantial damage or unreasonable
cost. (See “Dwelling Unit,” “Family,” and “Household.”)
Impact: The effect of any direct man-made actions or indirect repercussions of man-made actions on existing physical,
social, or economic conditions.
Impact Fee: A fee, often called a development fee, levied on the developer of a project by a city, county, or other
public agency as compensation for otherwise-unmitigated impacts the project will produce. California Government
Code Section 66000 et seq. specifies that development fees shall not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing
the service for which the fee is charged. To lawfully impose a development fee, the public agency must verify its
method of calculation and document proper restrictions on use of the fund.
Impacted Areas: Census tracts where more than 50 percent of the dwelling units house low- and very low-income
households.

Implementation: Actions, procedures, programs, or techniques that carry out policies.
Improvement: The addition of one or more structures or utilities on a parcel of land.
Infill Development: Development of vacant land (usually individual lots or left-over properties) within areas that are
already largely developed.
Infrastructure: Public services and facilities, such as sewage-disposal systems, water-supply systems, other utility
systems, and roads.
In Lieu Fee: Cash payments that may be required of an owner or developer as a substitute for a dedication of land or
construction of below-market-rate housing, and referred to as in lieu fees or in lieu contributions.
Institutional Use: (1) Publicly or privately owned and operated activities that are institutional in nature, such as
hospitals, museums, and schools; (2) churches and other religious organizations; and (3) other nonprofit activities of a
welfare, educational, or philanthropic nature that cannot be considered a residential, commercial, or industrial activity.
Interest, Fee: Entitles a land owner to exercise complete control over use of land, subject only to government land use
regulations.
Issues: Important unsettled community matters or problems that are identified in a community’s general plan and are
dealt with by the plan’s goals, policies, and implementation programs.
Jobs/Housing Balance; Jobs/Housing Ratio: The availability of affordable housing for employees. The jobs/housing
ratio divides the number of jobs in an area by the number of employed residents. A ratio of 1.0 indicates a balance. A
ratio greater than 1.0 indicates a net in-commute; less than 1.0 indicates a net out-commute.
Land Banking: The purchase of land by a local government for use or resale at a later date. “Banked lands” have been
used for development of low- and moderate-income housing, expansion of parks, and development of industrial and
commercial centers. Federal rail-banking law allows railroads to bank unused rail corridors for future rail use while
allowing interim use as trails.
Land Use Classification: A system for classifying and designating the appropriate use of properties.
Land Use Regulation: A term encompassing the regulation of land in general and often used to mean those regulations
incorporated in the General Plan, as distinct from zoning regulations (which are more specific).
Lease: A contractual agreement by which an owner of real property (the lessor) gives the right of possession to another
(a lessee) for a specified period of time (term) and for a specified consideration (rent).
Leasehold Interest: (1) The interest that the lessee has in the value of the lease itself in condemnation award
determination. (2) The difference between the total remaining rent under the lease and the rent the lessee would
currently pay for similar space for the same time period.
Linkage: With respect to jobs/housing balance, a program designed to offset the impact of employment on housing
need within a community, whereby project approval is conditioned on the provision of housing units or the payment of
an equivalent in-lieu fee. The linkage program must establish the cause-and-effect relationship between a new
commercial or industrial development and the increased demand for housing.
Lot: (See “Site.”)
Lot of Record: A lot that is part of a recorded subdivision or a parcel of land that has been recorded at the County
Recorder’s office containing property tax records.

Low-income Household: A household with an annual income usually no greater than 80 percent of the area median
income for a household of four persons and based on the latest available eligibility limits established by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the Section 8 Housing Program. (See “Area.”)
Low-income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC): Tax reductions provided by the federal and State governments for
investors in housing for low-income households.
Maintain, v: To keep in an existing state. (See “Preserve, v.”)
Mandatory element: A component of the General Plan mandated by State Law. California State law requires that a
General Plan include elements dealing with seven subjects—circulation, conservation, housing, land use, noise, open
space and safety—and specifies to various degrees the information to be incorporated in each element.
Manufactured Housing: Residential structures that are constructed entirely in the factory, and that since June 15,
1976, have been regulated by the federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 under the
administration of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). (See “Mobile Home” and
“Modular Unit.”)
May: That which is permissible.
Minimize, v : To reduce or lessen, but not necessarily to eliminate.
Ministerial (Administrative) Decision: An action taken by a governmental agency that follows established
procedures and rules and does not call for the exercise of judgment in deciding whether to approve a project.
Mitigate, v : To ameliorate, alleviate, or avoid to the extent reasonably feasible.
Mixed-use: Properties on which various uses, such as office, commercial, institutional, and residential, are combined in
a single building or on a single site in an integrated development project with significant functional interrelationships
and a coherent physical design. A “single site” may include contiguous properties.
Mobile Home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed for use as
a single-family dwelling unit and which (1) has a minimum of 400 square feet of living space; (2) has a minimum
width in excess of 102 inches; (3) is connected to all available permanent utilities; and (4) is tied down (a) to a
permanent foundation on a lot either owned or leased by the homeowner or (b) is set on piers, with wheels removed
and skirted, in a mobile home park. (See “Manufactured Housing” and “Modular Unit.”)
Moderate-income Household: A household with an annual income between the lower income eligibility limits

established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the Section 8 housing program.
(See “Area” and “Low-income Household.”)
Modular Unit: A factory-fabricated, transportable building or major component designed for use by itself or for
incorporation with similar units on-site into a structure for residential, commercial, educational, or industrial use.
Differs from mobile homes and manufactured housing by (in addition to lacking an integral chassis or permanent hitch
to allow future movement) being subject to California housing law design standards. California standards are more
restrictive than federal standards in some respects (e.g., plumbing and energy conservation). Also called Factory-built
Housing and regulated by State law of that title. (See “Mobile Home” and “Manufactured Housing.”)
Mortgage Credit Certificate: Under a County-operated program, gives a first-time homebuyer a federal income tax
credit of up to 20 percent of the mortgage interest paid on the first mortgage loan, for each year the buyer keeps the
same mortgage loan and lives in the same house. Maximum initial household income limits and maximum initial home

Multifamily Building: A detached building designed and used exclusively as a dwelling by three or more families
occupying separate suites.
Municipal Code: place holder
Must: That which is mandatory.
Necessary: Essential or required.
Need: A condition requiring supply or relief. The City or County may act upon findings of need within or on behalf of
the community.
Non-conforming Use: A use that was valid when brought into existence, but by subsequent regulation becomes no
longer conforming. “Non-conforming use” is a generic term and includes (1) non-conforming structures (by virtue of
size, type of construction, location on land, or proximity to other structures), (2) non-conforming use of a conforming
building, (3) non-conforming use of a non-conforming building, and (4) non-conforming use of land. Thus, any use
lawfully existing on any piece of property that is inconsistent with a new or amended General Plan, and that in turn is a
violation of a zoning code amendment subsequently adopted in conformance with the General Plan, will be a non-
conforming use. Typically, non-conforming uses are permitted to continue for a designated period of time, subject to
certain restrictions.
Notice (of Hearing): A legal document announcing the opportunity for the public to present their views to an official
representative or board of a public agency concerning an official action pending before the agency.
Objective: A specific statement of desired future condition toward which the City or County will expend effort in the
context of striving to achieve a broader goal. An objective should be achievable and, where possible, should be
measurable and time-specific. The State Government Code (Section 65302) requires that general plans spell out the
“objectives,” principles, standards, and proposals of the general plan. “The addition of 100 units of affordable housing
by 2005” is an example of an objective.
Ordinance: A law or regulation set forth and adopted by a governmental authority, usually a city or county.
Overlay: A land use designation on the Land Use Map, or a zoning designation on a zoning map, that modifies the
basic underlying designation in some specific manner.
Parcel: A lot, or contiguous group of lots, in single ownership or under single control, usually considered a unit for
purposes of development.
Parking, Shared: A public or private parking area used jointly by two or more uses.
Patio Unit: A detached single family unit, typically situated on a reduced-sized lot, that orients outdoor activity within
rear or side yard patio areas for better utilization of the site for outdoor living space.
Planned Community: A large-scale development whose essential features are a definable boundary; a consistent, but
not necessarily uniform, character; overall control during the development process by a single development entity;
private ownership of recreation amenities; and enforcement of covenants, conditions, and restrictions by a master
community association.
Planned Unit Development (PUD): A description of a proposed unified development, consisting at a minimum of a
map and adopted ordinance setting forth the regulations governing, and the location and phasing of all proposed uses
and improvements to be included in the development.
Planning and Research, Office of (OPR): A governmental division of the State of California that has among its
responsibilities the preparation of a set of guidelines for use by local jurisdictions in drafting General Plans.

land both within the City Limits and potentially annexable land.
Planning Commission: A body, usually having five or seven members, created by a city or county in compliance with
California law (Section 65100) that requires the assignment of the planning functions of the city or county to a planning
department, planning commission, hearing officers, and/or the legislative body itself, as deemed appropriate by the
legislative body.
Policy: A specific statement of principle or of guiding actions that implies clear commitment but is not mandatory. A
general direction that a governmental agency sets to follow, in order to meet its goals and objectives before undertaking
an action program. (See “Action Statement.”)
Poverty Level: As used by the U.S. Census, families and unrelated individuals are classified as being above or below
the poverty level based on a poverty index that provides a range of income cutoffs or “poverty thresholds” varying by

change in the Consumer Price Index.
Preserve, v: To keep safe from destruction or decay; to maintain or keep intact. (See “Maintain.”)
Principle: An assumption, fundamental rule, or doctrine that will guide general plan policies, proposals, standards, and
implementation measures. The State Government Code (Section 65302) requires that general plans spell out the
objectives, “principles,” standards, and proposals of the general plan. “Adjacent land uses should be compatible with
one another” is an example of a principle.
Protect, v: To maintain and preserve beneficial uses in their present condition as nearly as possible. (See “Enhance.”)
Recognize, v: To officially (or by official action) identify or perceive a given situation.
Redevelop, v: To demolish existing buildings; or to increase the overall floor area existing on a property; or both;

residential unit on a single lot. Sometimes called “Granny Flat.”
Section 8 Rental Assistance Program: A federal (HUD) rent-subsidy program that is one of the main sources of
federal housing assistance for low-income households. The program operates by providing “housing assistance
payments” to owners, developers, and public housing agencies to make up the difference between the “Fair Market
Rent” of a unit (set by HUD) and the household’s contribution toward the rent, which is calculated at 30 percent of the
household’s adjusted gross monthly income (GMI). “Section 8” includes programs for new construction, existing
housing, and substantial or moderate housing rehabilitation.
Senior Housing: (See “Elderly Housing.”)
Seniors: Persons age 62 and older.
Shall: That which is obligatory or necessary.
Shared Living: The occupancy of a dwelling unit by persons of more than one family in order to reduce housing

“standards,” and proposals of the general plan. Examples of standards might include the number of acres of park land
per 1,000 population that the community will attempt to acquire and improve, or the “traffic Level of Service” (LOS)
that the plan hopes to attain. (2) Requirements in a zoning code that govern building and development as distinguished
from use restrictions—for example, site-design regulations such as lot area, height limit, frontage, landscaping, and
floor area ratio.
Stock Cooperative Housing: Multiple-family ownership housing in which the occupant of a unit holds a share of
stock in a corporation that owns the structure in which the unit is located.

Subregional: Pertaining to a portion of a region. The Golden Triangle was a subregional task force.
Subsidize: To assist by payment of a sum of money or by the granting of terms or favors that reduce the need for
monetary expenditures. Housing subsidies may take the forms of mortgage interest deductions or tax credits from
federal and/or state income taxes, sale or lease at less than market value of land to be used for the construction of
housing, payments to supplement a minimum affordable rent, and the like.
Substandard Housing: Residential dwellings that, because of their physical condition, do not provide safe and
sanitary housing.
Substantial: Considerable in importance, value, degree, or amount.
Target Areas: Specifically designated sections of the community where loans and grants are made to bring about a

Tax Credit: A dollar amount that may be subtracted from the amount of taxes owed.
Tax Increment: Additional tax revenues that result from increases in property values within a redevelopment area.
State law permits the tax increment to be earmarked for redevelopment purposes but requires at least 20 percent to be
used to increase and improve the community’s supply of very low-and low-income housing.
Townhouse; Townhome: A one-family dwelling in a row of at least three such units in which each unit has its own
front and rear access to the outside, no unit is located over another unit, and each unit is separated from any other unit
by one or more common and fire-resistant walls. Townhouses usually have separate utilities; however, in some
condominium situations, common areas are serviced by utilities purchased by a homeowners association on behalf of
all townhouse members of the association. (See “Condominium.”)

median family income, based on the latest available eligibility limits established by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) for the Section 8 Housing Program. (See “Area.”)
Zero Lot Line: A detached single family unit distinguished by the location of one exterior wall on a side property line.
Zone, Combining: A special purpose zone that is superimposed over the regular zoning map. Combining zones are
used for a variety of purposes, such as airport compatibility, flood plain or wetlands protection, historic designation, or
special parking regulations. Also called “overlay zone.”
Zone, Interim: A zoning designation that temporarily reduces or freezes allowable development in an area until a
permanent classification can be fixed; generally assigned during General Plan preparation to provide a basis for
permanent zoning.
Zone, Study: (See “ Zone, Interim.”)

moderate-income housing, or plans for public plazas and courts at ground level—are included in a project.
Zoning, Inclusionary: Regulations that increase housing choice by providing the opportunity to construct more
diverse and economical housing to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income families. Often such regulations
require a minimum percentage of housing for low- and moderate-income households in new housing developments and
in conversions of apartments to condominiums.
Zoning Map: Government Code Section 65851 permits a legislative body to divide a county, a city, or portions
thereof, into zones of the number, shape, and area it deems best suited to carry out the purposes of the zoning code.

Chapter Lead-in
[For information only, not to be included once adopted into the General Plan]
The LUTE is adopted in compliance with the state law requirement that each city prepare
and adopt a comprehensive and long-range general plan for its physical development
(California Government Code Section 65300). Accordingly, the general plan is a legal
document fulfilling statutory requirements relating to background data, analysis, maps, and
exhibits. The legal adequacy of the general plan is critical, since many city actions and
programs are required to be consistent with the general plan. California Government Code
Section 65302 specifically requires that general plans address seven topics (referred to as
“elements”): land use, circulation, housing, open space, conservation, safety, and noise. A
local jurisdiction may adopt a general plan in the format that best fits its unique
circumstances (California Government Code Section 65300.5). The LUTE combines the
required land use and circulation elements into a single chapter. The chapter is internally
consistent and is consistent with other elements of the Sunnyvale General Plan and other
plans adopted by the City of Sunnyvale. The LUTE includes the fiscally, economically, and
environmentally sustainable land use and transportation policies necessary to support goals
established in each of the other General Plan chapters. The LUTE will be incorporated into
the Land Use and Transportation chapter of the General Plan, which also contains the Open
Space Element.
The LUTE incorporates and integrates policy direction and land use patterns from other City
of Sunnyvale planning documents, including:
        Arques Campus Specific Plan (2003)
        Downtown Specific Plan (2003, amended 2013)
        East Sunnyvale and other Industrial to Residential (ITR) sites
        Lakeside Specific Plan (2005)
        Lawrence Station Area Specific Plan (draft plan released 2015)
        Moffett Park Specific Plan (adopted 2004, last amended 2013)
        Peery Park Specific Plan (in progress)
        Precise Plan for El Camino Real (2007)
The planning area for Sunnyvale includes all land within the city limits, plus a portion of
Moffett Federal Airfield. The General Plan lays out a new path for the city’s future that is
responsive to the needs of Sunnyvale’s diverse population.
Sunnyvale – A Complete Community
The LUTE consists of an aggregated set of goals and policies with the overall purpose of

Horizon 2035
To be moved to the Community Vision chapter upon adoption
Introduction
The overall focus of the General Plan is to guide the City’s physical development and
transportation investments in the Sunnyvale planning area (Sunnyvale). The Land Use and
Transportation chapter establishes the fundamental framework of how streets and buildings
in Sunnyvale will be laid out and how various land uses, developments, and transportation
facilities will function together. The Land Use and Transportation Element (LUTE) and
accompanying policies have been developed to help guide decision making regarding land
use and transportation for an approximate 20-year horizon—a time frame that is referred to
as Horizon 2035. The framework for this chapter is based on a concept of a Complete
Community—an attractive, green, sustainable place that is accessible for all residents.
California Government Code Section 65302 specifically calls for elements of general plans to
be combined when major issues cross topics. The LUTE includes the fiscally, economically,
and environmentally sustainable land use and transportation policies necessary to support
goals established in each of the other General Plan chapters. The LUTE will be incorporated
into the Land Use and Transportation chapter of the General Plan, which also contains the
Open Space Element.
The LUTE incorporates and integrates policy direction and land use patterns from other City
of Sunnyvale planning documents, including:
         Arques Campus Specific Plan (2003)
         Downtown Specific Plan (2003, amended 2013)
         East Sunnyvale and other Industrial to Residential (ITR) sites
         Lakeside Specific Plan (2005)
         Lawrence Station Area Specific Plan (draft plan released 2015)
         Moffett Park Specific Plan (adopted 2004, last amended 2013)
         Peery Park Specific Plan (in progress)
         Precise Plan for El Camino Real (2007)
The planning area for Sunnyvale includes all the land within the city limits, plus a portion of
Moffett Federal Airfield. The General Plan lays out a new path for the city’s future that is
responsive to the needs of Sunnyvale’s diverse population.
The land use policies provide direction for the amount, location, and direction of future
change. This chapter presents a 20-year growth scenario for Sunnyvale that includes
additional mixed-use residential/commercial uses in key transit-oriented areas and in
transformed Village Centers. Areas for additional business (or industrial) growth are also
identified.
                                              Page 7

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
The transportation policies guide how the roadways and streets will function and how space
on the roadways will be utilized by multiple modes of transportation, with attention to the
transit, pedestrian, and bicycle networks. The policies create incentives for these modes of
transportation , recognize that driving will remain a significant transportation mode in
Sunnyvale, and offer transportation mode I Sunnyvale, and offer options for the car-free or
car-light living. The transportation policies in this chapter carefully integrate with the land
use policies, in part by reducing travel distances through promoting compact, mixed-use
development.
The land use and transportation policies strive to preserve community qualities that are
favorable to residents and businesses and contribute to the community’s identity. Policies
also provide guidance on visual quality and the character of new development and provide
additional direction for a complete community.
Addressing Climate Change
Since the previous adoption of the LUTE in 1997, the global issue of climate change has
taken center stage in the collective consciousness, particularly when it comes to addressing
how we travel, utilize land, design buildings, and lay out communities. The State of
California adopted the Global Warming Solutions Act (Assembly Bill [AB] 32) to establish the
first comprehensive program of regulatory and market mechanisms in the nation to achieve
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. AB 32 sets an emissions limit for 2020 at 1990
levels. It also points the state toward an 80% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, with an
interim threshold that communities are required to meet in their land use and
transportation planning efforts.
Sunnyvale’s Climate Action Plan (CAP), adopted in 2014, sets out specific prioritized
measures to be utilized to achieve GHG emissions reductions. The General Plan’s land use
and transportation policies call for maintaining a CAP and for regional participation in
climate change adaptation strategies. The CAP will support the Land Use and Transportation
chapter of the General Plan by establishing specific measures that will put the City in a
regional leadership role regarding its GHG emissions reductions.
Senate Bill 32 (SB) was adopted in 2016 and builds on the statewide GHG reduction targets
included in AB 32. SB 32 establishes a statewide GHG reduction target of 40% below the AB
32 target by 2030, codifying a directive issued by Governor Jerry Brown in a 2015 Executive
Order. Achieving the SB 32 reduction target will require a substantial increase in GHG
reductions from the AB 32 trajectory.
One such regional effort is preparation of a Sustainable Communities Strategy as required
by Senate Bill (SB) 375. Sunnyvale has been active in this process, which is part of
California’s multipronged approach to reducing GHG emissions. Bay Area cities have
collaborated to prepare Plan Bay Area to coordinate regional transportation planning and
                                              Page 8

                                                                    Adopted LUTE – April 2017
regional housing allocation planning and to address climate change. The policies in the LUTE
and the CAP provide clear direction as Sunnyvale continues to participate in regional efforts.
Cities in the Bay Area also need to plan for climate change impacts that are predicted to
occur regardless of future changes made to the man-made environment, including potential
sea level rise, increased rainfall or drought, and increased temperatures. Agencies such as
the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) and the Joint
Policy Committee are leading regional efforts to analyze and prepare for the impacts of
climate change in the Bay Area. The land use policies direct the City to participate in regional
efforts on adaptation plans, to prepare for risks and hazards associated with climate change,
and to consider climate change impacts when reviewing future development or considering
changes to City policies.
Sunnyvale – A Complete Community
The LUTE consists of an aggregated set of goals and policies with the overall purpose of
moving Sunnyvale toward a Complete Community. A Complete Community is a sustainable
end state that represents a place to live that is less dependent on automobiles.
The “Complete” Sunnyvale strategy ensures that the entire community has adequate
resources, such as school capacity, and would share land use, transportation, and resource
planning with adjacent communities and the region as a whole.
The features of a Complete Community include:
        Sustainability by design
        Reduced automobile trip-making, with daily needs within a 20-minute walk from
         home or work, and a focus on vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
        Village Centers with enhanced neighborhood services
        Comfortable, safe, convenient, and complete pedestrian and bicycle networks
         throughout Sunnyvale
        Comprehensive and healthy urban tree canopy
        Transit access on arterial streets within a 10-minute walk from home or work
        Accessible parks, open spaces, and public facilities
        Diverse housing choices with a range of affordability
        Sufficient school capacity
        Preservation and enhancement of distinctive neighborhood character and features
        A community that looks beyond its borders and considers its relationship to
         neighboring cities
        Diverse employment and shopping opportunities
The Character of Change
Over the next 20 years, the city can be expected to change as a result of a number of forces
such as population growth, changing demographics, the need for newer buildings and
                                              Page 9

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
homes, and an ever-changing economy. Other forces such as climate change and citizen
demand for a sustainable community will also influence change. Physical changes are guided
by new development that almost exclusively occurs through private forces based on market
demand. The policies and actions provided in this chapter address areas of Sunnyvale that
would be best suited to accommodate transformational change that support the city’s
evolution into a Complete Community.
Figure 1 indicates where change would be encouraged to occur and to what degree it can be
expected. The map indicates areas that are meant to be preserved, the new Village Centers,
and industrial areas that are meant to improve and evolve over time but that are not
planned for a major character shift. Some of the change portrayed on the map represents
areas where a plan has been adopted and transformation is already occurring. For example,
plans for the El Camino Real corridor, Downtown, Peery Park, and the Lawrence Station area
have been recently adopted. See the individual Specific Plan documents for more detailed
information and allowable land uses and design concepts permitted in these areas. Zoning
regulations and development standards have been adopted to support these changes.
New areas where noticeable change may occur under new LUTE goals and policies include
the nodes on El Camino Real, newly identified Village Centers, the Lawrence Station area,
and the Peery Park industrial/office area. Change in these areas would be in addition to
what has been planned to date and would only occur over the 20-year term of Horizon
2035, based on market demand for new development.
Future change areas were selected based on the following general criteria:
       Mixed-use development transforming older shopping centers and office areas into
        new Village Centers to provide close-in services and residential diversity in existing
        residential areas (to be managed through the preparation of precise plans or site-
        specific plans).
       Additional mixed-use development located in nodes at major intersections beyond
        that originally contemplated in the Precise Plan for El Camino Real.
       Increased industrial and office intensity in the Peery Park business area to be
        managed by a specific plan.
       Development of a transit village near the Caltrain Lawrence Station with increased
        housing and business intensity and supporting services in accordance with a station
        area plan.
       Pockets of more intensive industrial and office development on corridors such as
        Mathilda Avenue in anticipation of future improved north/south transit, and along
        Tasman Avenue near the Reamwood light rail station in The Woods business area.

Plan Structure
This LUTE is based on the following guiding principles, which include important concepts for
land use and transportation in Sunnyvale:
       Complete Community. Create a place to live that is less dependent on automobiles
        and reduces environmental impacts, with distinctive activity centers and
        neighborhoods with character and access to nearby services.
       Regional Planning Coordination. Coordinate regional and local planning efforts with
        other agencies and organizations to ensure Sunnyvale’s competitive edge in the
        regional economy.
       Neighborhood and Transit-Oriented Place-Making. Develop mixed-use areas that
        incorporate commercial, public, and residential uses that are compatible with the
        surrounding neighborhoods, create dynamic gathering spaces, establish unique
        visual character, provide nearby services, and reduce reliance on automobiles.
       Economic Development. Foster an economic development environment which
        provides a wide variety of businesses and promotes a strong economy that can
        resist downturns within existing environmental, social, fiscal, and land use
        constraints.
       Environmental Sustainability. Provide environmental leadership through land use
        patterns, renewable energy opportunities, and a multimodal transportation system.
       Multimodal Transportation. Offer the community a variety of options for travel in
        and around the city that are connected to regional transportation systems and
        destinations.
       Healthy Living. Maximize healthy living choices by providing easy access to fresh
        and healthy food, a range of recreation and open space options for community
        members of all ages, and convenient and safe biking and walking options
        throughout the community.
       Attractive Design. Protect the design and feel of buildings and spaces to ensure an
        attractive community for residents and businesses.
       Diverse Housing. Provide residential options for all incomes and lifestyles, including
        a variety of dwelling types, sizes, and densities that contribute positively to the
        surrounding area and the diversity of the community.
       Special and Unique Land Uses. Allow for land uses such as child care, nursing
        homes, and places of worship that complete the community fabric.
       Neighborhood Preservation. Ensure that all residential areas and business districts
        retain the desired character and are enhanced through urban design and
        compatible mixes of activities.

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
These guiding principles are supported by goals, policies, and action items. In summary, the
goals to guide the future development of Sunnyvale are:
        GOAL A: Coordinated regional and local planning
        GOAL B: Environmentally sustainable land use and transportation planning and
         development
        GOAL C: An effective multimodal transportation system
        GOAL D: An attractive community for residents and businesses
        GOAL E: Creation, preservation, and enhancement of Village Centers and
         neighborhood facilities that are compatible with residential neighborhoods
        GOAL F: Protected, maintained, and enhanced residential neighborhoods
        GOAL G: Diverse housing opportunities
        GOAL H: Options for healthy living
        GOAL I: Supportive economic development environment
        GOAL J: A balanced economic base
        GOAL K: Protected, maintained, and enhanced commercial areas, shopping centers,
         and business districts
        GOAL L: Special and unique land uses to create a diverse and complete community
Goal A: Coordinated Regional and Local Planning
Protect the quality of life, the natural environment, and property investment, preserve
home rule, secure fair share of funding, and provide leadership in the region.
A fundamental concept to planning for the future of Sunnyvale is that it is not isolated, but
rather a part of an integrated region. It is part of the County of Santa Clara as well as the
nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, which shares many resources, including natural
resources, an air basin, and regional facilities such as major roadways. Development around
the area is also affected by regional organizations such as the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG), the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), and the Bay
Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD).
Although Sunnyvale can plan ahead to address many issues within its boundaries such as
how the community will look and where uses will be located, larger issues such as regional
transportation, demand for adequate housing, preservation of the bay, air quality, and
climate change need to be addressed in a regional context. In the case of traffic, impacts to
the transportation system occur regardless of local growth; regional growth accounts for
most traffic increases citywide. Sunnyvale’s own land use plans only marginally contribute to
traffic within the community. Maintaining a regional perspective and participating in and
leading regional land use and transportation planning efforts will help Sunnyvale protect the
quality of life enjoyed by its residents. Regional participation will also help Sunnyvale
achieve its goals for the future and protect the city and the region for future generations.

Prompted by passage of SB 375, Plan Bay Area is the Bay Area’s Sustainable Communities
Strategy. It is an integrated long-range transportation, land use, and housing plan that
supports a growing economy, provides more housing and transportation choices, and
reduces transportation-related pollution in the Bay Area. Sunnyvale is committed to
implementation of Plan Bay Area. A critical component of Plan Bay Area is the Priority
Development Area (PDA) Plan Program, which links regional transit planning to local land
use planning to promote sustainable growth. Cities and counties can identify PDAs where
they will focus growth in relation to existing or future transit stations. PDAs are eligible for
grant funding from ABAG and other agencies. The City of Sunnyvale has identified several
PDAs, including the Downtown Specific Plan area, the Lawrence Station area, the Sunnyvale
El Camino Real corridor, the East Sunnyvale Industrial to Residential area, and Tasman
Crossing.
Sunnyvale’s local economy is part of the larger economic region of Silicon Valley, which is
made up of 15 cities in the South Bay and East Bay areas. Silicon Valley has long been known
as an epicenter of innovation and entrepreneurship. Sunnyvale industry clusters have
contributed to the regional economy and helped fuel local and regional economic growth.
There will continue to be regional competition to attract and hold onto new companies,
major employers, and industry innovators. The City’s land use and transportation goals and
policies will significantly affect Sunnyvale’s place and competitive edge in the regional
economy.
(Note: Other regionally significant maps may be located in related General Plan chapters and
will be linked as appropriate.)
In addition to the greater region, Sunnyvale’s local region is shared by five bordering cities—
Cupertino, San Jose, Los Altos, Santa Clara, and Mountain View. Positive relationships with
neighboring cities are important for achieving land use and transportation plans and for
protecting residents and businesses on or near Sunnyvale’s edges from potential
incompatible uses and traffic. Decisions by neighboring cities can have significant impacts on
Sunnyvale if not monitored and if Sunnyvale does not participate in planning efforts by
adjacent cities.
Larger regional issues are also affected by relationships with local cities such as the future
use of Moffett Federal Airfield, located within the spheres of influence of both Sunnyvale
and Mountain View. The Santa Clara County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) has
completed a Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) for Moffett Federal Airfield, which is
intended to be used to safeguard the general welfare of the inhabitants within the vicinity of
an airport. The CLUP includes height, safety and noise policies for land uses within an
Airport Influence Area surrounding the Airfield. Figure 2 shows the Airport Influence Area,
noise, height and safety zones in relation to the City. (Note: A link will be provided to the
Sunnyvale Planning Area Map with Sphere of Influence that is located in Chapter 1 of the
Consolidated General Plan on line. A link to the glossary will also be provided.)

Goal B: Environmentally Sustainable Land Use and Transportation
Planning and Development
Support the sustainable vision by incorporating sustainable features into land use and
transportation decisions and practices.
Environmental sustainability is a concept and a goal that is identified at all levels of
Sunnyvale’s policy structure. The Sunnyvale Community Vision (2007) sets the values and
guiding framework for the City’s approach to sustainability. (Note: A link will be provided to
General Plan Chapter 2 – Community Vision.)
The following policies address land use and transportation topics typically associated with
the environment such as green development, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction,
urban forestry, streamside development, and alternative and renewable energy. However,
in response to the comprehensive direction set forth in the Sunnyvale Community Vision,
related land use and transportation policies focused on health, community design, and the
economy also support the City’s desired end state for a more sustainable community.
  GREEN DEVELOPMENT
POLICY 12:         Enhance the public’s health and welfare by promoting the city’s
                   environmental and economic health through sustainable practices for the

                   improvements, wildlife habitat, and reduction of heat islands; and
                   enhance the health, safety, and welfare of residents.
                   Action 1:      Prepare and implement an Urban Forestry Plan for City
                                  properties and street rights-of-way. The plan should
                                  promote planting and maintaining large canopy trees.
                   Action 2:      Monitor the success of the City’s Urban Forestry Plan by
                                  periodically measuring the percentage of tree canopy
                                  coverage in the community.
                   Action 3:      Evaluate increasing the level of required tree planting and
                                  canopy coverage for new developments and site renovation
                                  projects while preserving solar access for photovoltaic
                                  systems.
                   Action 4:      Require tree replacement for any project that results in tree
                                  removal, or in cases of constrained space, require payment
                                  of an in-lieu fee. Fee revenues shall support urban forestry
                                  programs.
POLICY 15:         Maintain and regularly review and update regulations and practices for
                   the planting, protection, removal, replacement, and long-term
                   management of large trees on private property and City-owned golf
                   courses and parks.
                   Action 1:      Strictly enforce Chapters 13.16 City Trees and 19.94 Tree
                                  Preservation to prevent the unauthorized removal,
                                  irreversible damage, and pruning of large protected trees.
(Note: The following policy will be relocated or cross-referenced by a link with General Plan
Chapter 5 – Community Character: Goal CC-5 Protection of Sunnyvale’s Heritage)
POLICY 16:         Recognize the value of protected trees and heritage landmark trees (as
                   defined in City ordinances) to the legacy, character, and livability of the
                   community by expanding the designation and protection of large
                   signature and native trees on private property and in City parks.
                   Action 1:      Expand community education on the value of trees and the
                                  benefits of tree planting and preservation.

                   Action 3:       Emphasize tree relocation, site redesign, or special
                                   construction provisions over removing and irreparably
                                   damaging healthy heritage landmark trees and protected
                                   trees. Consider more than the economic value of a tree.
 STREAMSIDE DEVELOPMENT
Streamside development can affect the health, safety, and general welfare of the city’s
residents and environment. The following policies are intended to mitigate negative effects
of streamside development by avoiding impacts of projects located in proximity to streams.
(Note: This policy direction is provided in General Plan Chapter 7 – Environmental
Management: Goal EM-8 Protections of Creeks and Bay.)
POLICY 17:       Address sea level rise, increased rainfall, and other impacts of climate
                 change when reviewing new development near creeks, and consider the
                 projected flood levels over the economic lifespan of the project.
 ALTERNATIVE/RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
POLICY 18:         Provide Sunnyvale residents and businesses with opportunities to develop
                   private, renewable energy facilities.
                   Action 1:       Maintain and regularly review and update uniform and
                                   comprehensive standards for the development, siting, and
                                   installation of solar, wind, and other renewable energy and
                                   energy conservation systems on private property which
                                   address public health, safety, community welfare, and the
                                   aesthetic quality of the city.
                   Action 2:       Consider deviations from development standards such as
                                   setbacks, design guidelines, or heights to encourage
                                   innovative energy-efficient building design.
                   Action 3:       Participate in a Community Choice Energy (CCE) program
                                   through the Silicon Valley Clean Energy Authority in

Goal C: An Effective Multimodal Transportation System
Offer the community a variety of transportation modes for local travel that are also
integrated with the regional transportation system and land use pattern. Favor
accommodation of alternative modes to the automobile as a means to enhance efficient
transit use, bicycling, and walking and corresponding benefits to the environment, person-
throughput, and qualitative improvements to the transportation system environment.
(Note: A link will be provided on the City’s web page to transportation background data.)
The transportation policies provided below mark a transition away from long-held
approaches to planning and managing the transportation system that formerly emphasized
the automobile. Since the 1950s, suburban and urban forms in Sunnyvale and the Bay Area
in general have embraced more highways, expanded intersections, widened roads, and
intricate, indirect residential street patterns. Sunnyvale’s transportation system evolved
with the particular characteristics of the automobile culture, including an emphasis on large-
lot, single-family residences, a commercial strip mall core on a six-lane arterial street
accessible chiefly by car (El Camino Real), an absence of sidewalks in industrial areas, and a
token bikeway network. As a result, Sunnyvale’s land use and transportation pattern
emphasizes the automobile as the primary mode of transportation in terms of behavior,
accommodation, and facility development.
Since 1991, the General Plan has endorsed maximizing bicycle and pedestrian facilities and
supported improved transit facilities. However, Sunnyvale’s transport mode share for the
single-occupant automobile has been over 90% of trips for the last several decades. Transit,
bicycle, and pedestrian shares have remained relatively static and low. Despite construction
of 138 new lane miles of bike lanes, thousands of linear feet of sidewalks, and the
introduction of light rail and express bus services to the planning area, the mode split of 90%
for the single-occupant automobile remains virtually unchanged.

Rendering of a Multimodal “Complete Street” and Mixed-Use Development
(Source: City of San Jose)
At this time, impetus for the City to embrace a more aggressive approach toward balancing
the system and creating opportunities for alternative transportation comes from several
places:
          State GHG reduction, transportation planning, VMT, and complete streets mandates
           (AB 32, SB 375, AB 1358, and SB 743)
          Allocation of transportation funding favors alternative transportation and transit-
           oriented core projects
          A lack of non-local funding for roadway capacity and access improvements
          Citizen input and support
The following policies seek to dramatically shift the emphasis in Sunnyvale from single-
occupant vehicles to alternative transportation modes and to prioritize non-automotive
uses. By supporting implementation of new land use policies, transportation system design
and operation, and support for regional multimodal systems, the transportation policies
seek to improve transportation by moving in four key directions:
          Increasing the share of trips by alternative modes.
          Reducing single-occupant vehicle miles traveled (VMT).
          Improving connectivity and convenience of walking, biking, and transit.
          Creating a transportation environment that is pleasant, healthy, and safe for all
           users.
The transportation policies also recognize that in regard to transportation, Sunnyvale is part
of a larger region and that the City’s policies are one of many layers in combination with
policies from outside agencies that affect the operation and governance of a regional
transportation system. The City recognizes that regional transportation operators and
facilities are present in the community, and supports the integration of major regional and
interregional transit systems into the local transportation system to better serve Sunnyvale
community members.

Although Sunnyvale has only partial influence over transportation choices, the City seeks to
take bold steps in the following areas to influence the configuration and use of the
transportation systems:
       Working in combination with land use policies that encourage focused mixed-use
        development and vertical integration of mixed-use development.
       Using transportation demand management (TDM) as a tool to reduce automobile
        trips in peak hours.
       Identifying and approving car-free zones such as Cyclovia events in high pedestrian
        demand areas in order to encourage walk trips.
       Using design and operation of roadways that place emphasis on non-automotive
        modes.
       Incorporating parking management as a transportation demand management tool.
       Implementing complete streets policies to develop a transportation system that is
        accessible to all users and comfortable and attractive, particularly for walking and
        biking.
       Reducing the barrier effect that high-speed, multilane roadways create between
        neighborhoods.
  EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF TRANSPORTATION AND LAND USE PLANNING
POLICY 19:         Use land use planning, including mixed and higher-intensity uses, to
                   support alternatives to the single-occupant automobile such as walking
                   and bicycling and to attract and support high investment transit such as
                   light rail, buses, and commuter rail.
                   Action 1:       As part of the development project review process in
                                   mixed-use and other high-intensity use areas, require that
                                   adequate transit stops or a dedicated transit lane is
                                   provided, even if bus stops are not yet located there. Ensure
                                   that off-street loading areas do not conflict with adjacent
                                   uses or impede pedestrian, bicycle, or transit access.
                   Action 2:       Establish reduced parking requirements for transit, corridor,
                                   and village mixed-use developments and for developments
                                   with comprehensive TDM programs that are consistent with
                                   the City’s established goals.
POLICY 20:         Refine land use patterns and the transportation network so they work
                   together to protect sensitive uses and provide convenient transportation
                   options throughout the planning area.
                   Action 1:       Use transportation services and facilities to facilitate
                                   connections between neighborhood Village Centers both
                                   within and outside of Sunnyvale.

                Action 2:      Require needed street right-of-way dedications and
                               improvements as development occurs. Any additional right-
                               of-way beyond that required by the roadway classification
                               should be used for alternative mode amenities, such as bus
                               pullouts or medians, wider bike lanes, or walkways.
POLICY 21:      Establish appropriately scaled car-free and pedestrian-only zones in
                higher-density locations and high pedestrian demand locations.
                Action 1:      In areas with high pedestrian demand, close roads for
                               specified periods of time.
                Action 2:      Study the implementation of Cyclovia events.
POLICY 22:    Require large employers to develop and maintain transportation demand
              management programs to reduce the number of vehicle trips generated by
              their employees.
                Action 1:      Work with large employers to develop appropriate target
                               trip reduction goals by company size and a system to track
                               results and establish penalties for noncompliance.
POLICY 23:      Follow California Environmental Quality Act requirements, Congestion
                Management Program requirements, and additional City requirements
                when analyzing the transportation impacts of proposed projects and
                assessing the need for offsetting transportation system improvements or
                limiting transportation demand.
                Action 1:      Reduce peak-hour and total daily single-occupant vehicle
                               trips by expanding the use of transportation demand
                               management programs in the city.
                Action 2:      As part of a future update to the City’s Transportation
                               Impact Assessment Guidelines, establish and monitor
                               development-based transportation goals and indicators for
                               the following:
                                  Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the city per service
                                   population (population + jobs)
                Action 3:      As part of a future update to the City’s Transportation
                               Impact Assessment Guidelines, consider establishing
                               additional development-based transportation goals and
                               indicators for the following:
                                   Vehicle trips
                                   Service population within walking distance to bicycle
                                    facilities and transit stations

 A WELL-DESIGNED AND WELL-OPERATED TRANSPORTATION NETWORK
POLICY 24:   Promote modes of travel and actions that provide safe access to city
             streets and reduce single-occupant vehicle trips and trip lengths locally
             and regionally.
             The order of consideration of transportation users shall be:
               (1) Pedestrians
               (2) Non-automotive (bikes, three-wheeled bikes, scooters, etc.)
               (3) Mass transit vehicles
               (4) Delivery vehicles
               (5) Single-occupant automobiles
POLICY 25:   Provide parking and lane priority to environmentally friendly motorized
             vehicles (e.g. carpools, low emission, zero emission).
POLICY 26:   Prioritize safe accommodation for all transportation users over non-
             transport uses. As City streets are public spaces dedicated to the
             movement of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians, facilities that meet
             minimum appropriate safety standards for transport uses shall be
             considered before non-transport uses are considered.
POLICY 27:   As parking is the temporary storage of transportation vehicles, do not
             consider parking a transport use of public streets.
POLICY 28:   Prioritize street space allocated for transportation uses over parking when
             determining the appropriate future use of street space.
POLICY 29:   As they become available, use multimodal measures of effectiveness to
             assess the transportation system in order to minimize the adverse effect
             of congestion. Continue to use level of service (LOS) to describe
             congestion levels. Use vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis to describe
             potential environmental effects and impacts to the regional
             transportation system.
POLICY 30:   Maintain a funding mechanism where new and existing land uses
             equitably participate in transportation system improvements.
POLICY 31:   Move progressively toward eliminating direct and hidden subsidies of
             motor vehicle parking and driving, making the true costs of parking and
             driving visible to motorists.
             Action 1:       Pursue opportunities for user fees such as paid parking, paid
                             parking permits at workplaces, and paid parking places for

                                vehicle trips.
                Action 3:       Advocate at the regional, state, and federal levels for
                                actions that increase the visibility of the true costs of
                                parking and driving to motorists and improve the cost
                                return attributable to driving.
POLICY 32:      Require roadway and signal improvements for development projects to
                improve multimodal transportation system efficiency.
POLICY 33:      Prioritize transportation subsidies and project financing over time to the
                most environmentally friendly modes and services. Support bicycling
                through planning, engineering, education, encouragement, and
                enforcement.
                Action 1:       Maintain and implement a citywide bicycle plan to
                                maximize the provision of safe and efficient bicycle and
                                pedestrian facilities throughout Sunnyvale.
POLICY 34:      Support neighborhood traffic calming and parking policies that protect
                internal residential areas from citywide and regional traffic, consistent
                with engineering criteria, operating parameters, and resident preferences.
POLICY 35:      Set speed limits at the lowest practicable levels consistent with state law.
                Action 1:       Advocate for changes to state speed laws to provide further
                                ability to lower speed limits.
POLICY 36:      Facilitate safe and orderly traffic flow and promote school pedestrian and
                bicycle safety.
                Action 1:       Help manage school traffic on city streets and develop
                                management plans.

Goal D: An Attractive Community for Residents and Businesses
In combination with the City’s Community Design Sub-Element, ensure that all areas of the
city are attractive and that the city’s image is enhanced by following policies and
principles of good urban design while valued elements of the community fabric are
preserved.
Sunnyvale is an attractive community with comfortable residential neighborhoods and a
variety of commercial and business districts, each with a unique character. As the
community changes over time, Sunnyvale residents have come to expect that the positive
aspects of the city that they enjoy will be preserved and carefully blended with new housing
and business developments that feature high-quality architecture and design. Policies in this
section advocate new development that features innovative, signature buildings and active
and interesting public spaces, and require that City codes, standards, and development
review processes be used to steer Sunnyvale in a positive and attractive direction.

                                   of development.
Goal E: Creation, Preservation, and Enhancement of Village Centers
and Neighborhood Facilities That Are Compatible with Residential
Neighborhoods
Support the development of Village Centers that create an identity and “sense of place”
for residential neighborhoods, provide neighborhood gathering places, and allow a
vibrant mix of public, commercial, and residential activities. Through development review
and other permitting processes, ensure adequate protection is provided to residential
neighborhoods when new uses and development projects are considered.
A recurring message throughout the LUTE is the desire to strengthen Sunnyvale’s residential
neighborhoods and to create a city where walking or bicycling can replace the use of a car
much of the time within neighborhoods. Key to the success of these concepts is the
development of Village Centers, a sustainable neighborhood concept.
A Village Center is a specifically identified neighborhood crossroad or district nucleus that is
planned to become the focus of activity and future transformative change for nearby
neighborhoods. It is designed to support a lifestyle with less reliance on a private
automobile. It is an active, pedestrian-oriented place with neighborhood-serving
commercial uses that are close to residents and are mixed with residential uses. It serves as
a meeting place for the community and may also support public and quasi-public services
to reduce the need for automobile trips. Residential uses in a Village Center address diverse
lifestyles, ages, and incomes in order to allow residents to stay in the neighborhood longer.
A Village Center has a unique “sense of place” beyond what has been experienced in
Sunnyvale’s older neighborhood commercial areas.
                                              Page 36

                                                                      Adopted LUTE – April 2017
Fundamental to its purpose, a Village Center is intended to provide mixed-use development.
Village Centers will be constructed in accordance with urban design principles and
performance standards that support pedestrian activity with buildings close to the street
and transit, and served by wide sidewalks. A “toolkit” will be developed (special design
guidelines and site planning standards) to achieve the new visual and functional character of
a Village Center.
Visually, buildings in a Village Center will be a maximum of three to four stories and located
close to the street, near a wide pedestrian sidewalk. Residential density in Village Centers,
with average densities of 18 units per acre allowed, will be slightly higher than in the
surrounding neighborhoods, which are generally low-density residential (up to 7 units per
acre). Development intensity at the edges of Village Centers will decrease to provide a
buffer to adjacent neighborhoods.
The Village Center will be activated, with people gathering in well-designed plazas and other
meeting spaces between and around buildings. Automobile parking in the Village Center
may be reduced due to the convenient and comfortable pedestrian- and bicycle-supportive
neighborhood street and path network, and as a result of planned and convenient transit
service.
A Village Center will not consist of any single new development. Rather, it is intended to be
a multi-acre, most likely multi-site or multi-corner area, typically at a major street
intersection and strategically located near the crossroads of a neighborhood. Most areas
identified to become Village Centers are occupied by existing older commercial uses with
outdated, auto-oriented development forms. Development of the Village Centers will be
market-driven over the lifespan of Horizon 2035 and beyond, but will be encouraged and
facilitated by the zoning designations and development standards put in place by the City to
implement the desired changes.
Features and amenities of a Village Center include the following:
        Supportive of a lifestyle without a private automobile
        Neighborhood-serving or community-serving commercial core
        Pedestrian-oriented design: active ground-floor uses and generous outdoor spaces
        Activated by mixed use (commercial with residential)
        Easily accessed by pedestrian and bicycle networks
        Regular transit service
        Reduced need for parking
        Unique design guidelines to address form
        Neighborhood gathering spaces (e.g., plazas, coffee shops, community gardens,
         taverns)

Existing Conditions in Future Village Center Site
Rendering of a Village Center (Source: City of San Jose)
Sunnyvale has been divided into nine neighborhood planning areas, as shown in Figure 2.
These areas were used to make sure each neighborhood was supported by adequate
schools and commercial services and to help plan facilities such as parks. As indicated on
Figure 5 in the General Plan Land Use Framework section of the LUTE, seven potential
neighborhood-oriented Village Centers are planned for the city in various existing
commercial nodes within residential neighborhoods.
                                          Page 38

                                                                     Adopted LUTE – April 2017
Additional residential development that is intensified in the Village Centers would gradually
decrease in density as it moves outward toward the Village Center boundaries. Overall,
existing single-family residential areas are protected by these policies.
POLICY 53:         Strengthen the image that the community is composed of cohesive
                   residential neighborhoods, each with its own individual character and
                   Village Center; allow change and reinvestment that reinforces positive
                   neighborhood concepts and standards such as walkability, positive
                   architectural character, site design, and proximity to supporting uses.
                   Action 1:      Promote land use patterns and urban design in Village
                                  Centers that reflect context and iconic aspects of the
                                  surrounding neighborhood to strengthen the sense of
                                  uniqueness and community.
                   Action 2:      Consider the designation of a new Village Center at the
                                  intersection of Fremont Avenue and Sunnyvale-Saratoga
                                  Road.

                         serve neighborhood retail and service needs.
           Action 4:     Provide public gathering places with appropriate amenities
                         for residents, such as Village Centers and neighborhood and
                         community parks.
           Action 5:     Prior to accepting any application for a Village Center Plan,
                         a public engagement program shall be submitted to the City
                         for City Council approval with a recommendation from the
                         Planning Commission. The public engagement program
                         should provide a range of opportunities for community
                         members to identify preferences for uses, design, density or
                         intensity, height, open space, privacy, and transportation.
                         City Council may provide direction on the community
                         preferences and the vision for individual Village Center
                         Plans, which shall be used in the preparation of the Plan.
           Action 6:     Seek opportunities to create distinctive landmark features
                         or focal elements at Village Centers and at points of entry or
                         gateways into neighborhoods from the Village Centers.
POLICY 54: Preserve and enhance the character of Sunnyvale’s residential
           neighborhoods by promoting land use patterns and transportation
           opportunities that support a neighborhood concept as a place to live,
           work, shop, entertain, and enjoy public services, open space, and
           community near one’s home and without significant travel.
           Action 1:     Enhance existing residential neighborhoods by retaining and
                         creating Village Centers with safe and convenient
                         pedestrian and bicycle access.
           Action 2:     Support a full spectrum of conveniently located commercial,
                         public, and quasi-public uses that support and enhance the
                         livability of residential neighborhoods.
           Action 3:     In addition to parks, promote small-scale, well-designed,
                         pedestrian-friendly spaces within neighborhoods to
                         establish safe and attractive gathering areas.
           Action 4:     Require amenities in new development and Village Centers
                         that serve the needs of residents.
POLICY 55: Require new development, renovation, and redevelopment to be
           compatible and well integrated with existing residential neighborhoods.

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
                   Action 1:      Utilize adopted City design guidelines to achieve compatible
                                  and complementary architecture and scale for new
                                  development, renovation, and redevelopment.
                   Action 2:      Where an opportunity arises, consider integrating or co-
                                  locating a Village Center with a neighborhood park or open
                                  space.
Goal F: Protected, Maintained, and Enhanced Residential
Neighborhoods
Ensure that all residential areas of the city are maintained and that neighborhoods are
protected and enhanced through urban design which strengthens and retains residential
character.
As stated throughout this chapter, Sunnyvale residents enjoy their community and would
like to protect and preserve the positive aspects while enhancing the city with vibrant, high-
quality development as Sunnyvale adapts to future development trends and residents’
needs.
A key concern of residents is protecting residential neighborhoods from the encroachment
of incompatible and disruptive uses and buildings. Compatible uses may include group
homes, day care, and home businesses. In addition, many of Sunnyvale’s residential
neighborhoods exceed 50 years in age, and residents have concerns about property neglect
and decay. The Housing Element contains policies and programs to address the
maintenance and rehabilitation of the housing stock. The following policies are meant to
support and enhance other General Plan policies and emphasize the need to protect existing
neighborhoods while allowing reasonable use of and reinvestment in residential properties.
POLICY 56:         Improve and preserve the character and cohesiveness of existing
                   residential neighborhoods.
                   Action 1:      Support neighborhood associations throughout Sunnyvale
                                  to facilitate community building and neighborhood identity
                                  and to encourage participation in land use and
                                  transportation decisions.
                   Action 2:      Explore developing design standards and guidelines, similar
                                  to the Eichler Design Guidelines, to preserve the defining
                                  character of existing distinctive neighborhoods.
                   Action 3:      Use land use and transportation policies, guidelines,
                                  regulations, and engineering specifications to respect
                                  community and neighborhood identities and values for
                                  quality and design.

                                                                    Adopted LUTE – April 2017
                   Action 4:      Establish standards and promote and support programs that
                                  result in the maintenance and rehabilitation of existing
                                  housing and residential neighborhoods.
                   Action 5:      Develop special area plans and neighborhood preservation
                                  programs to guide change in neighborhoods that need
                                  special attention.
                   Action 6:      Look for opportunities to reclaim unneeded and
                                  underperforming paved areas (public and private) that
                                  could be converted to neighborhood-enhancing features
                                  such as additional tree coverage, gathering areas, pocket
                                  parks, or community gardens.
POLICY 57:         Limit the intrusion of incompatible uses and inappropriate development
                   in and near residential neighborhoods, but allow transition areas at the
                   edges of neighborhoods.
                   Action 1:      Where appropriate, use higher-density residential and
                                  higher-intensity uses as buffers between neighborhood
                                  commercial centers and transportation and rail corridors.
                   Action 2:      Require appropriate noise attenuation, visual screening,
                                  landscape buffers, or setbacks between residential areas
                                  and dissimilar land uses.
 (Note: The Community Character Chapter of the General Plan provides more detailed
guidance on appropriate and compatible development design.)
POLICY 58:         Encourage and support home businesses that remain secondary to the
                   use of each home and do not detract from the primary residential
                   character of the neighborhood.
                   Action 1:      Monitor home business trends to ensure City regulations
                                  accommodate changing technologies, lifestyles, and
                                  neighborhood needs.
POLICY 59:         Allow compatible and supporting uses such as group homes, places of
                   assembly, community centers, recreational centers, and child-care centers
                   in residential neighborhoods (including single-family neighborhoods)
                   subject to review and consideration of operations, traffic, parking, and
                   architecture.
Goal G: Diverse Housing Opportunities
Ensure the availability of ownership and rental housing options with a variety of dwelling
types, sizes, and densities that contribute positively to the surrounding area and the health
of the community.

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
Sunnyvale Townhome Neighborhood
Including housing goals in the LUTE ensures that the City has adequate land use tools to
provide for housing. When combined with the land use categories on the Land Use Map
(Note: A link will be provided to Horizon 2035 General Plan Land Use Diagram online), the
City ensures that housing is provided in the right places. Related to the policies in this
chapter is General Plan Chapter 5 – Housing. In that chapter, the City lists policies that
ensure the right quantities and types of housing, including affordable housing, are available
to meet the existing and projected housing needs of all segments of the community.
The City is required to adopt land use plans and regulatory systems that provide
opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing development. The policies in this
chapter help reemphasize the City’s intent to provide opportunities for a diverse population
to live in Sunnyvale, including those that require or desire housing for families, the
workforce, live/work-style housing, housing to transition from one stage of life to another,
accessible housing, and affordable rental or ownership housing. The LUTE creates and
maintains a variety of land use designations and specific zoning categories that will allow for
adequate sites and housing variety to meet the community’s needs.

Sunnyvale Condominium Neighborhood
POLICY 60:       In addition to more traditional forms of housing (single-family detached,
                 townhouses, garden apartments, and shared corridor multi-family housing),
                 support alternative housing types including co-housing, single-room
                 occupancy units, live/work spaces, transitional housing, assisted living, and
                 other types that may become necessary and appropriate to serve a
                 changing population.
POLICY 61:       Determine the appropriate residential density for a site by evaluating the
                 site planning opportunities and proximity of services (such as
                 transportation, open space, jobs, and supporting commercial and public
                 uses).
Note: Potential negative impacts from temporary construction such as noise, traffic, and air
quality (dust) are addressed by Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)
Guidelines. All development is subject to these guidelines.)
POLICY 62:       Encourage the development of housing options with the goal that the
                 majority of housing is owner-occupied.
POLICY 63:       Promote new mixed-use development and allow higher-residential density
                 zoning districts (medium and higher) primarily in Village Centers, El Camino
                 Real nodes, and future industrial-to-residential areas.
POLICY 64:       Consider the impacts of all land use decisions on housing affordability and
                 on the housing needs of special needs groups within Sunnyvale.
                                            Page 45

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
Note: Housing affordability and needs are addressed extensively in the Housing Element of
this General Plan.)
Goal H: Options for Healthy Living
Create a city development pattern and improve the city’s infrastructure in order to
maximize healthy choices for all ages, including physical activity, use of the outdoors, and
access to fresh food.
An area not specifically addressed previously in the General Plan is the concept of
community health. With regional and national obesity rates and diabetes rates climbing, and
with their associated costs to the health-care system, communities have started to address
the issue of health through land use and transportation policies. The purpose of these
policies is to provide choices for people who need or wish to increase activity and improve
their diets. This goal includes policies that encourage a healthier, active lifestyle and make
being active more convenient. The policies also make fresh food visible and accessible
through permissible zoning codes and by creating better access to farmers markets and
urban gardens. Other policies would allow the City to consider changing codes so that
residents may grow their own food and raise their own small livestock and poultry as an
option to better control their diets. By incorporating a healthy rationale in the City’s land
use and transportation policies, Sunnyvale will promote better health for its residents and
workers, work toward sustainability, and develop a Complete Community.
 HEALTHY CITY
POLICY 65:          Promote community gardens and urban farms.
                    Action 1:      Modify the Zoning Code to create specific provisions for
                                   community gardens and urban farms as allowed uses,
                                   including those in and near residential areas.
                    Action 2:      Identify appropriate locations for community gardens and
                                   urban farms.

 OPEN SPACE, PARKS, AND WETLANDS
The following policies regarding open space, parks, and wetlands are provided to convey a
complete picture of the community in regard to the need for healthy living and the related
need for access to open space.
(Note: This section will likely be removed from the Land Use and Transportation section and
the policies will be relocated to other areas in the General Plan or eliminated where they are
duplicative of other policies. If eliminated, related policies from other General Plan chapters
will be cross-referenced, such as Goal LT-8: Adequate and Balanced Open Space.)

Goal I: Supportive Economic Development Environment
Facilitate an economic development environment that supports a wide variety of
businesses and promotes a strong economy within existing environmental, social, fiscal,
and land use constraints.
Sunnyvale’s economic competitive edge is its business-friendly environment and its effective
and efficient planning and building permitting processes; the city is well known for its
innovative One-Stop Permit Center. Historically, 90% of building permits issued in Sunnyvale
are issued “over the counter” as opposed to requiring lengthy internal review periods. At
this time, cities in general lack the ability to provide financial incentives to attract
businesses. The City of Sunnyvale’s development review and permitting services for
businesses are marketed and promoted as a way to remain on top in the competitive arena
of Silicon Valley business attraction and retention.
POLICY 74:           Provide existing businesses with opportunities to grow in Sunnyvale and
                     provide opportunities to expand into new technologies.
                     Action 1:      Monitor the effect of City policies on business development
                                    and consider the effects on the overall health of business in
                                    the community.
                     Action 2:      Participate in partnerships with local industry/businesses in
                                    order to facilitate communication and address mutual
                                    concerns.
                     Action 3:      Work with start-up companies to address their unique land
                                    use and transportation needs during product development
                                    and placement of their new technologies.
POLICY 75:           Support a full spectrum of conveniently located commercial, mixed-use,
                     public, and quasi-public uses that add to the positive image of the
                     community.
POLICY 76:           Promote business opportunities and business retention in Sunnyvale.
                     Action 1:      Encourage conveniently located retail, restaurant, and other
                                    supportive land uses near business areas.
POLICY 77:           Participate in regional efforts to respond to transportation and housing
                     problems caused by economic growth in order to improve the quality of
                     life and create a better environment for businesses to flourish.
                     Action 1:      Support land use policies to achieve a healthy relationship
                                    between the creation of new jobs and housing.
                     Action 2:      Support transportation demand management programs and
                                    other ride-sharing programs countywide.

POLICY 78:          Encourage businesses to emphasize resource efficiency and
                    environmental responsibility and to minimize pollution and waste in their
                    daily operations.

Goal J: A Balanced Economic Base
Develop a balanced economic base that can resist downturns of any one industry and
provides revenue for City services.
Economic development is critical to the success of any city. A successful business
environment provides jobs and revenue, and workers in turn support other city businesses
like shops, services, and restaurants. Having land use and transportation policies that
support a variety of businesses and industries helps create a balanced and resilient local
economy.
Companies consider a wide range of criteria when selecting a location. Globally and
regionally, Silicon Valley is still considered a premier and dynamic place to do business. The
strengths of a Silicon Valley location include access to universities, venture capital, an
educated workforce, and a high quality of life. Challenges include housing costs, labor costs,
and land costs.
                                               Page 51

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
Sunnyvale offers a high quality of life and benefits for a strategic location directly in the
heart of Silicon Valley. However, Sunnyvale must distinguish itself from other regional cities
to attract businesses. At this time, office development in the city is strong. However, lack of
a strong downtown commercial district has also significantly affected sales tax revenue,
which is leaking to shopping areas located in adjacent and nearby cities.
The City’s economic development strategy is a three-pronged approach addressing business
attraction, business retention, and business expansion. The economic development policies
in the LUTE focus on how land use and transportation can support a healthy economy. They
are used to complement other General Plan policies (such as housing policies) and guide
future decisions to ensure regional economic competitiveness.

                   Action 1:       Promote a variety of commercial, retail, and industrial uses,
                                   including neighborhood shopping, general business, office,
                                   clean technology, and industrial/research and development.
                   Action 2:       Ensure that rezoning of industrial or commercial areas and
                                   sites will not significantly hurt the community’s economic
                                   base.
                   Action 3:       Encourage independent local businesses.

                   centers/uses to meet the needs of residents.
                   Action 1:       Track retail leakage to encourage businesses that meet
                                   missing retail needs.
POLICY 87:         Consider the importance of tax generation (retail, hotel, auto, and
                   business-to-business uses) to support the fiscal health of the community
                   and to fund municipal services.
Goal K: Protected, Maintained, and Enhanced Commercial Areas,
Shopping Centers, and Business Districts
Achieve attractive commercial centers and business districts and buildings that are
maintained and allow a full spectrum of businesses that operate unencumbered.
Sunnyvale is fortunate to have a number of unique business areas that offer a full spectrum
of building spaces and properties from retail, service-commercial, and heavy industrial to
Class A, B, and C office/research and development space and an increasing number of major
corporate campuses. Although separated for the most part into appropriate zoning areas,
similar to residential areas, individual businesses and business districts require protection
from the encroachment of incompatible uses in order to operate unencumbered, remain
competitive, and contribute to the city’s economic health. The vitality of older business
                                               Page 53

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
areas, including shopping centers, also can be affected by a lack of reinvestment and
maintenance.
The following policies aim to encourage development and funding of programs that
promote and enforce property maintenance as well as provide the buffers and protection
that business areas require. Through the development review process, the City will support
pedestrian-oriented design and require visual improvement in architecture, landscaping,
and signs.

                            policies, architectural and site planning guidelines,
                            regulations, and engineering standards that respect
                            community and neighborhood identities and protect quality
                            design.
             Action 4:      Establish and monitor standards for property appearance
                            and maintenance.
             Action 5:      Promote and support programs that result in the
                            maintenance and rehabilitation of existing properties.
             Action 6:      Develop special area plans and neighborhood preservation

 PROTECTED COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS
POLICY 90:   Use density and design principles, such as physical transitions, between
             different land uses and to buffer between sensitive uses and less
             compatible uses.
             Action 1:      When making land use decisions, anticipate and avoid
                            whenever practical the incompatibility that can arise
                            between dissimilar uses such as the encroachment of
                            residential uses into business areas.
             Action 2:      Require that commercial activities near or adjacent to
                            residential uses be conducted with minimally invasive
                            exterior activity.

                               shopping areas by encouraging pedestrian-oriented
                               architecture that addresses the street (e.g., uniform
                               setbacks, continuous building façades, building articulation,
                               and appropriate signage).
POLICY 92:      Support convenient neighborhood-serving commercial centers that
                provide services that reduce automobile dependency and contribute
                positively to neighborhood character.

POLICY 94:      Promote continuous reinvestment in shopping centers through
                maintenance, revitalization, and redevelopment.
                Action 1:      During the development review process, work with owners
                               of older shopping centers to revitalize façades and bring
                               other site standards up to code.
                Action 2:      Consider providing incentives for renovating and upgrading
                               the appearance of existing older shopping centers, such as a
                               façade improvement grant program and similar economic
                               development tools.
                Action 3:      Utilize neighborhood enhancement programs and code
                               enforcement to achieve maintenance at shopping centers
                               that are neglected.
                Action 4:      Require increased landscaping, tree planting, and internal
                               sidewalks when considering a revitalized or redeveloped

                     businesses and provide a complete community.
Goal L: Special and Unique Land Uses to Create a Diverse and
Complete Community
Provide land use and design guidance so that special and unique areas and land uses can
fulfill their distinctive purposes and provide a diverse and complete community fabric.
Land use and transportation in most of Sunnyvale are guided by standardized codes and
manuals such as the Zoning Code, the Citywide Design Guidelines, or the Santa Clara Valley
Transportation Authority (VTA) Bicycle Technical Guidelines. The City aims to be consistent
as it applies standards to all properties in Sunnyvale. Although standardization is considered
desirable in most cases, unique land use situations warrant more specific policies to guide
development. In these cases, the City has the ability to utilize special plans and zoning tools
such as specific plans, precise plans, and design guidelines to provide protection or guide
change more carefully.

Area Plans
Figure 3 shows existing and future area plans.
Moffet Park Specific Plan
After adopting the previous LUTE (1997), the City realized that there was significant
development pressure to be capitalized upon in the city’s northern business park—Moffett
Park. The City had received a number of requests to develop corporate campuses that
exceeded the older, one-story tilt-up-style development standards adopted for that area. In
response, in 2004 the City adopted the Moffett Park Specific Plan, which included
development standards that made way for a more modern and intensive business park that
met the needs of new businesses. Identifying and responding to the special needs of the
Moffett Park area has allowed the community to remain competitive in attracting new
businesses by having opportunities in place for new office development.
Precise Plan for El Camino Real
The City has also responded to development pressure by establishing a plan for El Camino
Real. The Precise Plan for El Camino Real (2007) was adopted to clarify the City’s long-term
vision for its primary commercial corridor. The Precise Plan serves as a guide to encourage
well-designed, appropriate developments along El Camino Real. The plan also offers
strategies to capitalize on the strengths of El Camino Real and to overcome limitations in
order to enhance the ability of the corridor to remain a vibrant and successful part of the
community.
Peery Park Specific Plan
To allow for redevelopment of under-utilized industrial properties and accommodate new
industrial growth, the City approved the Peery Park Specific Plan in 2016. The Specific Plan
is to provide the City, property owners and businesses with a guide for future development
in the 446-acre Peery Park area. The Specific Plan provides details on the type, location and
intensity of uses, define the capacity and design of needed public improvements and
infrastructure, and determine the resources necessary to finance and implement the public
improvements and infrastructure needed to support the vision for the area.
Lawrence Station Area Plan
The Lawrence Station Area Plan was completed in 2016 to maximize benefits for Sunnyvale
that come from the area’s proximity to Lawrence Caltrain Station. The plan supports mixed
use office/research and development, residential and retail uses in the approximate ½ mile
radius around the station. The land uses and circulation identified in the plan support
transit ridership, and provide access through the area for pedestrians, bicyclists and motor
vehicles.

Other opportunities to utilize special zoning tools include preserving architectural resources.
The City has design guidelines in place to protect the unique character of Eichler residential
neighborhoods and the Heritage Housing District on Frances Street and Taaffe Street near
Downtown. Additionally, Citywide Design Guidelines, Industrial Design Guidelines, and
Single Family Home Design Techniques have been put into place in order to respond to the
community’s changing demand for higher-quality architectural and site design standards.

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
                 Action 1:      Maintain sense of place plans that provide more focused
                                policies and development standards to guide future land
                                use and transportation decisions.
                 Action 2:      Prepare a special area plan for each of the Village Centers to
                                provide focused land use, transportation, and design
                                standards, policies, and guidelines.

SPECIAL ZONING TOOLS
POLICY 100:      Use specialized zoning districts and other zoning tools to address issues in
                 the community, and update as needed to keep up with evolving values
                 and new challenges in the community.
POLICY 101:      Use the Industrial-to-Residential (ITR) combining district to help meet the
                 community’s housing needs for all ages and economic sectors and balance
                 its use with maintaining a healthy economy and employment base. ITR
                 zoning allows industrial/commercial/office uses to continue as conforming
                 uses while an area transitions to residential uses. ITR areas include
                 Tasman Crossing, East Sunnyvale, the Lawrence Station Area, the Evelyn
                 Corridor (Fair Oaks to Wolfe), and Fair Oaks Junction.

                                                               Adopted LUTE – April 2017
            Action 1:      Update the Zoning Code to indicate that once a site zoned
                           ITR has transitioned to residential use (or other use only
                           allowed in a residential zoning district), it cannot be
                           returned to industrial use.
            Action 2:      During the transition from industrial to residential uses,
                           anticipate and monitor compatibility issues between
                           residential and industrial uses (e.g., noise, odors, and
                           hazardous materials). Identify appropriate lead
                           departments and monitoring strategies for each
                           compatibility issue.
            Action 3:      Incorporate “sense of place” requirements for new ITR
                           areas in order to enhance the residential feeling of new
                           neighborhoods by requiring pedestrian, bicycle, and
                           streetscape enhancements that reflect the unique character
                           of each new neighborhood.
            Action 4:      Rezone transitioned neighborhoods from ITR to appropriate
                           residential zoning after 75% of the land area has been
                           redeveloped with residential use.
            Action 5:      Consider sense of place or pedestrian circulation plans to
                           address access in ITR neighborhoods.
            Action 6:      Rezone industrial sites for conversion to residential uses
                           only after environmental remediation sufficient to enable
                           residential use of the sites is completed and any deed
                           restrictions are removed from subject properties. Such sites
                           may be counted toward RHNA obligations after
                           environmental remediation is completed and any deed
                           restrictions are removed.
POLICY 102: Ensure that industrial uses in the ITR generally do not intensify beyond the
            base floor area ratio of 35% allowed in the zoning district (including any
            incentives to allow higher-intensity development).
POLICY 103: Balance the need for additional residential uses with industrial uses
            needed for a healthy economy.
            Action 1:      Require any future study to change an area from industrial
                           to residential to include a full evaluation of the economic
                           and fiscal impacts of converting an industrial area to
                           residential uses, including the potential impacts on
                           community facilities, municipal services, and schools.
COMMUNITY BENEFITS
                                      Page 63

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
POLICY 104:   Ensure that development projects provide appropriate improvements or
              resources to meet the city’s future infrastructure and facility needs, and
              provide development incentives that result in community benefits and
              enhance the quality of life for residents and workers.

                     Action 1:     Update development impact fees periodically to provide
                                   fair-share funding for transportation, utilities, parks, and
                                   other public improvements and to address community
                                   needs such as affordable housing.
                     Action 2:     Establish zoning incentives, density bonuses, or other land
                                   use tools where higher development potential may be
                                   allowed based on contributions toward desired community
                                   benefits.
                     Action 3:     Include a discussion of community benefits in area plans
                                   and specific plans that defines the City’s priorities and
                                   outlines an implementation program.
  PUBLIC AND QUASI-PUBLIC USES
Other land uses that require attention are public and quasi-public uses. Public uses include
City administration buildings, libraries, parks, the water pollution control plant, the Santa
Clara County medical clinic, and school district facilities. Quasi-public uses include places of
worship, private community centers, private schools, child-care centers, and medical clinics
and hospitals. These uses are scattered throughout the community. Although they provide
much-needed community services and facilities, they can also provide challenges by
potentially impacting adjacent land uses, such as nearby residential uses.
One way the City can respond to the needs of public and quasi-public uses is to utilize
special zoning tools. In recent years, some quasi-public uses were having difficulty finding
large parcels of land that were also affordable. The City has used special zoning designations
to identify areas in industrial parks that would be appropriate to allow places of assembly
(e.g., religious institutions, community centers) without disrupting the primary purpose of
business and industrial areas. Taking this approach allowed the City to increase
opportunities for uses that the community desires and needs in Sunnyvale. Other quasi-
public uses such as child-care facilities continue to struggle to find suitable and affordable
locations without disrupting residential and commercial areas.
The following policies recognize the desire to accommodate public and quasi-public uses in
Sunnyvale to enhance the community, as well as the challenges of integrating them
successfully in the existing built fabric of the community.

(Note: Parks and open space are also special and unique land uses and were addressed in
Goal H: Options for Healthy Living. A link will be provided to open space goals and policies
located in other chapters and sections of the General Plan.)
POLICY 105:        Support the provision of a full spectrum of public and quasi-public services
                   (e.g., parks, day care, group living, recreation centers, religious
                   institutions, schools, hospitals, large medical clinics) that are appropriately
                   located in residential, commercial, and industrial neighborhoods and
                   ensure they do not have a negative effect on the surrounding area.
                   Action 1:       Encourage carpooling, shuttles, and transit access to public
                                   and quasi-public services to minimize adverse traffic and
                                   parking impacts on neighborhoods.
                   Action 2:       Ensure the provision of bicycle support facilities at all major
                                   public use locations.
POLICY 106:        Encourage multiple uses of public and quasi-public facilities (e.g., religious
                   institutions, schools, social organizations, day care), such as community
                   events, after-school programs, and festivals.

POLICY 107: Maintain and promote conveniently located public and quasi-public uses
            and services that enhance neighborhood cohesiveness and provide social
            and recreational opportunities.
POLICY 108: Recognize child care and places of assembly as essential services and land
            uses that support the diverse needs of the community. Avoid locating
            these sensitive uses near hazardous materials, noise, dust, etc.
            Action 1:        Periodically review the availability of and demand for sites
                             appropriate for places of assembly, and consider expanding
                             available sites if appropriate.
POLICY 109: Locate place of assembly uses where they provide benefit to the
            community and do not adversely impact nearby uses.
            Action 1:        Maintain zoning tools to limit the locations and type of
                             places of assembly in industrial areas to protect industrial
                             users from incompatibilities.
POLICY 110: Allow community-serving places of assembly in commercial zoning
            districts if the provision of a full range of conveniently located retail and
            retail services is not compromised.
POLICY 111: Recognize schools, both public and private, as integral parts of the
            community that require special consideration to manage traffic, support
            residential development, and provide open space.
            Action 1:        Work with school districts and private school operators
                             during and after the City review and permitting process to
                             minimize negative effects on the surrounding area.
            Action 2:        Maintain a working relationship with school districts on
                             transportation, pedestrian and bicycle access, safe routes to
                             school, and other neighborhood issues.
            Action 3:        Assist public and private schools in neighborhood relations
                             regarding land use and transportation issues.
            Action 4:        Work closely with school districts to review the impacts of
                             proposed residential development on school capacity and
                             facilities.
POLICY 112: Support continuous education (beyond grades K–12) and educational
            enrichment programs while minimizing impacts on the surrounding land
            uses.
POLICY 113: Give due consideration to the location and operation of government uses
            in order to provide benefit to the greater community.

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
                   Action 1:        Maintain and plan for appropriate land areas to support
                                    public facilities, such as the civic center, library, corporation
                                    yard, and water pollution control plant.
                   Action 2:        Promote co-locating government (federal, state, county,
                                    city) activities when appropriate to improve access to
                                    services for the community at large.
General Plan Land Use Framework
Building on the Horizon 2035 strategies, the land use designations map (shown in Figure 4)
identifies locations, types, and intensities of employment, residential, and mixed-use
development throughout Sunnyvale. It gives geographic reference and a spatial context to
the goals and policies of the LUTE. The map should be used in conjunction with land use
designation descriptions shown below, which describe the intended relationship between
General Plan uses and related zoning districts.
Residential Designations
Residential designations are used to identify locations for residential uses alone or in
combination with other compatible uses such as child care, education, places of assembly,
professional office, or other community-serving uses. These designations have been divided
into four different densities to either preserve or create a specific residential neighborhood
character. Through zoning, these densities are further refined as described in Table 2.
Based on the General Plan Land Use Map, only one area of Sunnyvale is expected to have
significant development with low-medium density residential uses (the 10-acre Corn Palace
site). Other than small infill sites of two to four houses, no new low-density residential
development is anticipated. Most future residential development is expected to be medium-
and higher-density residential.
In some cases, areas designated for High Density Residential and Commercial land uses,
which typically would only allow R-4 and C-1 zoning respectively, have conditional zoning
that would allow R-2 uses. Eleven High Density Residential sites and four commercial sites
allow this conditional zoning.

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
Figure 4: Land Use Designations
Allowing a change to a land use designation or zoning district to permit a higher residential
density may be considered when the development is located on the periphery of a
neighborhood, when the property is of significant size to be defined as its own
neighborhood, or when a project contributes to desired community benefits.
(Note: The following sidebar will be provided when the Land Use and Transportation
chapter is web based: Residential densities are described as dwelling units per acre
(du/acre). For example, a 2-acre site with 14 homes would have a density of 7 du/acre. One
acre = 43,560 square feet.)
Low Density Residential (0–7 du/ac)
This designation primarily preserves existing single-family neighborhoods designed around
parks or schools and located along neighborhood streets or residential collector streets.
Larger lots may accommodate accessory dwelling units pursuant to standards provided in
the Zoning Code. The corresponding zoning districts are R-0 and R-1.

Townhomes, apartments, and condominiums are typical within this residential designation.
Medium density neighborhoods and developments are appropriate along arterials and
residential collector streets, and may also be located in close proximity to industrial or
commercial areas.
 LAND USE CATEGORY                     MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL
 DESCRIPTION                           Allows townhomes, apartments, and condominiums.
                                       Medium-density neighborhoods and developments are
                                       generally located along arterials and residential collector
                                       streets, and may also be located near industrial or

High Density Residential (25–36 du/ac)
This designation also provides for densities consistent with apartments or condominiums
but at higher densities than the medium density designation. High density neighborhoods
and developments are typically located next to expressways, major arterial roads, or
freeways. The primary purpose of this designation is to provide for high-density residential
uses; however, mixed-use development (combining commercial with residential) is
encouraged when sites are located near public transit (e.g., Santa Clara Valley
Transportation Authority light rail, Caltrain, or a major bus route) and where commercial
uses would be beneficial to create a Village Center or meet a need for service in a residential
or commercial neighborhood.

                                      projects are also encouraged when sites are located near
                                      public transit and where commercial uses would be
                                      beneficial to create a Village Center or meet a need for
                                      service in a residential or commercial neighborhood.

Mixed-Use Designations
Mixed-use designations promote the integration of residential and commercial/office uses
together on the same site. These compact developments facilitate walkability, reduce
vehicle trips, and create centers of activity in different neighborhoods.
The City is anticipating a transformation of selected sites to mixed use by 2035, as shown in
Figure 5. These areas are located near public transit and major thoroughfares. They have
been further divided into three categories of mixed-use areas to determine the residential
density, type of commercial, and scale of the areas:
        Transit Mixed-Use
        Corridor Mixed-Use
        Village Mixed-Use
(Note: Nonresidential densities/intensities are described as floor area ratio (FAR), which is
the total floor area of the building (all levels) divided by the total lot area, expressed as a
percentage. For example, a 10,000-square-foot building on a 20,000-square-foot lot would
have a FAR of 50%.)
Transit Mixed-Use
This category allows for a wide variety of uses and densities located in close proximity to rail
stops or other major forms of mass transit. High-density residential is desirable closest to
transit stops/stations; densities greater than 65 dwelling units per acre may be compatible
with this designation. Other residential densities are also desirable in Transit Mixed-Use
areas. High-intensity commercial and office uses should be expected. Buildings may be up to
eight stories. In the Downtown area, regional commercial is allowed. Densities and
intensities in each Transit Mixed-Use area will be further refined and implemented with a
specific plan or area plan and a toolkit of development standards and design guidelines.
  LAND USE CATEGORY                    TRANSIT MIXED-USE
  DESCRIPTION                          Allows a mix of residential uses at various densities, high-
                                       intensity commercial uses, regional commercial uses, and
                                       office uses located near rail stops or other mass transit.
  DENSITY/INTENSITY                    Typically up to 65 du/acre near transit stations;

Corridor Mixed-Use
This designation provides for regional, community, or employment-serving retail uses in
conjunction with residential uses. Corridor Mixed-Use areas are appropriate along major
corridors such as El Camino Real, Mathilda Avenue, or similar roadways. Commercial uses
are a crucial component of future development along these corridors. Future mixed uses
should include commercial components with a typical floor area ratio (FAR) of 25%.
Alternative commercial FARs may be considered based on the location and constraints of
the site, and potential benefits to the area and community offered by the project.
Residential densities, averaged over the entire site, are typically 24 dwelling units per acre,
with mixed-use areas having a lower number of dwelling units per acre (as the residential
units are mixed with other uses) and primarily residential areas having a higher number of
dwelling units per acre. The Precise Plan for El Camino Real will further determine
development intensities, with the most intensive mixed-use development to occur in El
Camino Real Nodes.

Village Mixed-Use
This category provides neighborhood-serving commercial uses integrated with residential
uses. In the future, most residents can expect to have a mixed-use Village Center within
one-quarter to one-half mile of their homes. The Village Centers should typically be located
at a crossroad of arterials or major collector streets and have excellent pedestrian and
bicycle connections.
Commercial uses are a crucial component of these sites, and future mixed uses should
include commercial components equal to a minimum of 10% of the lot area, up to a
maximum of about 25%. The residential uses in most Village Mixed-Use areas are
anticipated to achieve an average density of 18 dwelling units per acre (medium density),
with the same variations in density described in the Corridor Mixed-Use section above. If
determined to be appropriate due to more intensive surrounding uses (such as at the corner
of Tasman Road and Fair Oaks Avenue), residential densities may be higher subject to a
                                             Page 75

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
public review process. Residential uses will likely be concentrated near street corners above
commercial uses and may give the appearance of a medium- to high-density development.
Village Mixed-Use developments will be designed to provide buffers between higher-
intensity sections and the adjacent lower-density neighborhood. Densities and intensities
within each Village Mixed-Use area should be further refined and implemented with a
specialized plan such as a precise plan, specific plan, or area plan and a toolkit of
development standards and design guidelines.

Commercial, Office, and Industrial Designations
These designations preserve areas for retail, commercial services, offices, research and
development, and manufacturing facilities. These areas should generally be preserved for
appropriate nonresidential use. However, except in industrial areas, residential uses may be
considered when the site is not isolated, is located within one-quarter mile of an existing
residential neighborhood, and when adequate residential services are available in close
proximity (e.g., retail, parks, and schools).
Commercial
This designation supports retail and retail service uses. Restaurants, entertainment, and
small offices may be considered in this designation. Commercial designations are typically
located at major intersections or along expressways, major arterials, or freeway frontage
roads.

Three zoning districts are consistent with this designation, and each provides for a distinct
subset of commercial uses. The C-1 (Neighborhood Business) zoning district allows low-scale
neighborhood-serving commercial uses such as grocery stores, retail, personal services,
recreational studios, and tutoring. The C-2 (Highway Business) zoning district is typically
located along regionally significant roads such as El Camino Real, Wolfe Road, or Fair Oaks
Avenue. “Big-box” retailers, auto dealers, and hotels are permitted in this zoning district.
The C-4 zoning district provides for commercial service, including auto repair, other service
shops, and self-storage and is typically located near industrial neighborhoods.

Industrial
This designation provides for research and development, manufacturing, office, and heavy
industrial uses and is found in the north half of the planning area (Evelyn Avenue and north).
Retail uses that serve the industrial area or the entire community (e.g., restaurants,
warehouse shopping, home improvement) may be considered appropriate. Places of
assembly, residential development, and other uses with sensitive receptors and uses that
may restrict the industrial purpose of the area are limited or prohibited in these areas.
Industrial areas generally allow 35% FAR with particular areas designated for more intensive
development.
Certain existing industrial areas have been planned to transition to residential uses. Those
Industrial-to-Residential (ITR) areas now have a General Plan designation of Medium Density
Residential or High Density Residential.

Public Facilities
This designation provides for public and quasi-public services such as parks, schools, places
of assembly, child-care facilities, civic facilities, and public works facilities such as solid
waste, landfill, or other similar facilities to be located throughout the city. This General Plan
designation is compatible with the P-F (Public Facilities) zoning district. Public facility uses
are crucial to the education, recreation, and operation of the community. Preserving
adequate land area for these spaces is a high priority. Changing a public facility designation
to another nonpublic designation should only be considered when adequate facilities or
resources are available to serve the community.

Area Plans
The City has developed a number of area and specific plans to guide redevelopment of older
industrial neighborhoods or to promote desired or unique land uses while staying true to
the overall goals for the future of Sunnyvale as established in the General Plan. The LUTE
includes eight area or specific plans and directs preparation of additional plans for each of
the proposed Village Centers. Some of these plan areas are already fully or nearly fully built
out, while others are identified for transformation. Existing and future area plans are
described in further detail, by predominate land use type, below. Specific development
requirements are detailed in each Area or Specific Plan.
Residential Area Plans
East Sunnyvale Sense of Place Plan
The East Sunnyvale area allows conversion from industrial to residential uses.
Mixed-Use Area Plans
Lakeside Specific Plan
This specific plan allows up to 47 dwelling units per acre of residential use and 263 hotel
rooms near Lawrence Expressway and US Highway 101. Lakeside is designated Village
Mixed-Use; however, it is a unique type of village due to the inclusion of a hotel as the
primary commercial use and the limited amount of retail space.
Tasman Crossing
This area is located near Tasman Drive and Fair Oaks Avenue. The plan allows a broad range
of densities (14–45 dwelling units per acre) with up to 140,000 square feet of neighborhood-
serving commercial. High-density residential is encouraged in the area due to its proximity
to light rail; however, densities consistent with the Medium Density Residential designation
are also compatible. Part of this area is designated Village Mixed-Use.
Downtown Specific Plan
This plan promotes a traditional, full-service, and mixed-use downtown in proximity to
major regional transit (Caltrain and bus service). The plan’s focus is to provide regional
shopping and a mixed-use environment with appropriately located high-density residential
in certain locations while preserving the historic elements of Sunnyvale’s Downtown. This
area is designated Transit Mixed-Use.
Lawrence Station Area Plan
This plan addresses a 372-acre area, or approximately a one-half-mile radius, surrounding
the Lawrence Caltrain Station. The plan promotes greater use of this existing transit asset
and guides the development of a diverse neighborhood of employment, residential, retail,
other support services, and open space. The plan area will likely result in high- and very
high-density residential units, higher-intensity office/research and development uses, retail
space, and industrial uses.

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
Future Mixed-Use Area Plans
The City will consider Village Center area plans at neighborhood crossroads designated
Village Mixed-Use on the General Plan Land Use Map.
Commercial Area Plans
Precise Plan for El Camino Real
This plan allows a mix of commercial and residential uses oriented along El Camino Real, a
highway business corridor. A range of commercial and office uses are permitted along the
corridor, serving neighborhood and community needs with opportunities for regional
“small-box” retail. Mixed-use development is expected and encouraged to occur primarily in
identified Nodes but may be considered elsewhere under limited circumstances. Residential
uses should be vertically mixed with commercial uses. Principles of transit-oriented design
should be followed in the mixed-use nodes. Commercial portions of sites should have floor
area ratios that range from 20% to 25% minimum. Below-grade parking is strongly
encouraged. Development on El Camino Real should be further refined and implemented
with the Precise Plan for El Camino Real and the Toolkit for Mixed-Use Development
(standards and design guidelines).
Industrial Area Plans
Arques Campus Specific Plan
This specific plan was adopted in 1999 to allow an integrated campus for corporate
headquarters with up to 72% FAR and significant site and architectural improvements.
Moffett Park Specific Plan
This specific plan was adopted in 2004 to maximize the development potential for corporate
headquarters, offices, and research and development facilities. The plan encourages higher-
intensity office uses (up to 70% FAR) along the Tasman light rail line and medium-density
floor area ratios (up to 50% FAR) in outlying areas. The allowable FAR depends on the level
of green building standards that are met. The specific plan also has provisions for supportive
commercial services. A development reserve was established to calculate supply and
allocation of additional square footage and higher floor area ratios to projects. Three zoning
districts implement the Moffett Park Specific Plan: MP-TOD (Moffett Park Transit-Oriented
Development), MP-I (Moffett Park General Industrial), and MP-C (Moffett Park Commercial).
FAR limits may be exceeded through participation in the Green Building Program.
Peery Park Specific Plan
The specific plan for Peery Park guides improvements to and redevelopment of the existing
407-acre industrial business park, including new industrial and commercial buildings on
vacant or underutilized land, new design standards, and transportation and infrastructure
improvements. It provides for new commercial space for technology-based business
development, and supports uses within defined activity centers, such as mixed commercial,
and allows residential uses along San Aleso Avenue on the east side of Mathilda Avenue.

Most development will consist of higher-density Class A office and tech-based industrial
buildings that are in high demand in Sunnyvale.
Reamwood Light Rail
This area is identified for higher floor area ratios due to its proximity to the Reamwood Light
Rail Transit station. A specialized plan should be prepared to implement 50% FAR.
General Plan Transportation System
The city’s transportation system consists of roads, public transit, and bike and pedestrian
paths. Sunnyvale has about 300 miles of roadways, including major freeways, expressways,
arterial streets, and neighborhood streets. The community is well served by regional
freeways: US Highway 101 and State Route (SR) 237 on the north, SR 85 on the west, and
Interstate 280 on the south.
The General Plan Roadway Classification Map (Figure 6) represents the recommended
roadway system for Horizon 2035. The roadway classifications are based on intended
priorities and levels of use by pedestrians, bicyclists, transit vehicles, delivery vehicles, and
automobiles in relation to nearby land uses and circulation within the planning area and to
the larger region. The roadway classifications on the map, in combination with the following
classification description and section examples, are tools the City uses to accomplish land
use and transportation goals and policies as well as related policies throughout the General
Plan. Figure 6 shows the spectrum of roadway classifications that dictate appropriate uses
and users for access and mobility.
Roadway Classifications
The transportation system is a key public facility in Sunnyvale that provides access to and
mobility within the community and contributes to the design and character of the area. Each
roadway is classified to allow individuals greater choice and control over their mobility, and
to enable a physically and socially active lifestyle.
State Freeway
State freeways provide mostly uninterrupted travel by car, bus, or trucks, and are designed
for high speeds over long distances. They have fully controlled access through on- and off-
ramps, typically with separation between opposing traffic flows. Driveways and alternative
modes of transportation such as walking or bicycling are forbidden, and intersections may
only occur as freeway interchanges.
County Expressway
County expressways, unique to Santa Clara County, provide partially controlled access on
high-speed roads with a limited number of driveways and intersections. Expressways also
allow bicycles; pedestrians are permitted in limited locations. Speed is typically between 45
and 55 miles per hour, depending on location. Expressways are generally designed for
longer trips at the county or regional level.

Commercial/Industrial Corridor
Commercial/industrial corridors serve local crosstown traffic and may also serve regional
traffic. Industrial and commercial corridors connect local roads and streets to arterial roads.
They provide access to local transit and include pedestrian connections designed to
encourage multipurpose trips. Four-lane corridors have up to 90 feet of ROW with street
parking or bike lanes as well as traffic buffers, such as trees, on both sides of the street.
Two-lane corridors may have up to 90 feet of ROW with street parking and may have bike
lanes.

Residential Corridor
Residential corridors serve local crosstown and residential traffic and may serve some
regional traffic. Residential corridors are collector streets that connect cars, bicycles, and
pedestrians to arterial roads and land uses. Residential corridors may have on-street parking
and/or bike lanes, and a median may be present if there is no bike lane. The ROW includes
sidewalks with traffic buffers, such as trees, on both sides of the street.

Transportation Investment and Performance Tracking
As with all infrastructure, transportation investments must be prioritized to improve system
performance and reduce environmental impacts. The LUTE prioritizes investment in
pedestrian, bicycle, and transit improvements as a way to achieve greater mobility within
the community and to comply with recent GHG emissions reduction legislation.
Transportation performance metrics for assessing new projects will consist of both a
traditional approach using level of service (LOS) and a new approach using vehicle miles
traveled (VMT). The LOS approach measures levels of congestion at specific intersections
and roadway segments resulting from a project and grades them from a free-flowing LOS A
to a stop-and-go LOS F. The VMT approach focuses on the anticipated vehicle travel
distances associated with a project. LUTE policies focus on providing multiple transportation
options to increase LOS for vehicle travel and to decrease VMT by single-occupant cars.

Glossary
Assembly Bill (AB) 32 – California’s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. This act requires
that California’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. This is
a reduction of approximately 30% from projected “business-as-usual” levels. AB 32 gives the
California Air Resources Board (CARB) authority to identify and regulate sources of GHG
emissions. CARB’s Scoping Plan for implementing AB 32 includes a wide range of strategies
including reducing GHG emissions from cars and light trucks through transportation
planning relating to land use. Other measures include implementing green building
standards that increase energy efficiency, water conservation, waste reduction, and
recycling.

Caltrain – Commuter rail serving San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties,
overseen by the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board and managed by the San Mateo
Transit District.
Climate Action Plan (CAP) – A planning document that identifies ways in which the
community can reduce GHG emissions. The CAP was developed will be developed in
accordance with the criteria for a Qualified Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program set by
BAAQMD.
Climate Change – Refers to any significant change in measures of climate (such as
temperature, precipitation, or wind) lasting for an extended period (decades or longer).
Climate change may result from natural factors, such as changes in the sun’s intensity or
slow changes in the earth’s orbit around the sun; natural processes within the climate
system (such as changes in ocean circulation); and human activities that change the
atmosphere’s composition (such as burning fossil fuels) and the land surface (such as
deforestation, reforestation, urbanization, or desertification).
Community Garden – Places where neighbors and residents can gather to cultivate plants,
vegetables, and fruits and, depending on local laws, keep bees and raise chickens or other
livestock and poultry.
Complete Streets – Well-balanced, connected, safe, and convenient multimodal street
networks that are designed and constructed to serve all users of streets whether they are
driving, walking, biking, or taking transit.
Congestion Management Program (CMP) – Programs developed and managed by
organizations formed by 1991 state law to undertake the responsibility for urban area
transportation planning and funding and for managing the county’s blueprint to reduce
congestion and improve air quality. The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) is
the Congestion Management Agency that develops and implements the Congestion
Management Program for Santa Clara County. Components of the Congestion Management
Program include traffic analysis requirements for land development, monitoring of
transportation system service levels, short- and long-term capital improvement planning
and implementation, and allocation of federal, state, and regional transportation funding.
Cyclovia – Closure of the partial or full width of certain streets to motor vehicle traffic for a
weekend day and allowing cyclists and pedestrians to use the streets. Stations promoting
healthy lifestyles, the arts, or other activities would be available for community
participation.
Density – See Residential Density.

Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) – An area plan for approximately 125 acres in Downtown
Sunnyvale last comprehensively updated in 2003, with several amendments since then. The
plan establishes a common vision for the Downtown, defines a unique market niche, and
creates a framework to link current and future downtown projects into a vibrant, cohesive
place. The plan allows for mixed use and utilizes principles of transit-oriented development.
Emissions – The release of a substance into the atmosphere, including particulate matter
and gases.
Farmers Market (Certified California Farmers' Market) – A market (1) operated by a local
government agency, one or more certified producers, or a nonprofit organization;
(2) certified by and operating in a location approved by the county agricultural
commissioner; and (3) where farmers sell directly to consumers agricultural products or
processed products made from agricultural products that the farmers grow themselves.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR) – The gross floor area on a site divided by the total net area of the
site, expressed as a percentage. For example, on a site with 100,000 net square feet of land
area, a FAR of 100% will be built with 100,000 gross square feet. On the same site, a FAR of
50% would be built with 50,000 square feet of floor area; a FAR of 35% would be 35,000
square feet. The FAR may also be represented without percentages in some cases (e.g.,
100% is the same as 1.0). Also commonly used in zoning, FARs are typically applied on a
parcel-by-parcel basis as opposed to an average FAR for an entire land use or zoning district.
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) – Any gas that absorbs infrared radiation in the atmosphere. Types
of GHGs include water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), ozone (O3),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) – An umbrella term for a range of technologies
including processing, control, communication, and electronics that are applied to a
transportation system. As examples, freeway electronic variable information signs, 511
services, and real-time traffic counting systems are considered intelligent transportation
systems.
Intersection Level of Service (LOS) – A measure of traffic volume and corresponding average
delay of conflicting traffic movements to determine the effectiveness of intersection
operations. Intersection LOS is most commonly used to analyze intersections and roadway
segments by categorizing traffic flow with corresponding driving conditions and roadway
and intersection efficiency.
Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) – The transportation planning, financing,
and coordinating agency for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area.

Mixed Use – Properties on which various uses such as office, commercial, institutional, and
residential are combined in a single building or on a single site in an integrated development
project with significant functional interrelationships and a coherent physical design. A single
site may include contiguous properties.
Multimodal – A transportation system that supports and connects cars, bicycles, pedestrians,
and public transit.
Nodes – Specific areas around major intersections along El Camino Real in Sunnyvale where
more intense mixed-use development will be encouraged.
Non-Transport Use – Use within a roadway right-of-way that does not support the
movement of vehicles and pedestrians, such as landscaping and parking (see also Transport
Uses).
Paratransit – Special transport services providing door-to-door service for people not able
to use the standard fixed-route, scheduled transit service. Typical customers may be seniors
or may have disabilities.
Parking, De-Coupled or Unbundled – Parking that is sold or rented separately from a land
use. For example, rather than renting an apartment for $1,000 per month with two parking
spaces at no extra cost, each apartment can be rented for $850 per month, plus $75 per
month for each parking space; occupants only pay for the parking spaces they actually need.
This approach can improve land use and transportation efficiency, since occupants save
money when they reduce parking demand, are not forced to pay for parking they do not
need, and can adjust their parking supply as their needs change.
Planter Strip – A strip of landscaped land typically located between a roadway curb and a
sidewalk and oriented longitudinally along a roadway edge that creates an aesthetic feature
and provides buffering characteristics for pedestrians from moving automobiles.
Residential Density – Residential densities are described as dwelling units per acre
(du/acre). For example, a 2-acre site with 14 homes would have a density of 7 du/acre. One
acre equals 43,560 square feet.
Road Diet – Reduction of the number of travel lanes on a roadway in order to improve
traffic safety, provide bicycle or pedestrian facilities, and/or calm traffic speeds and
volumes.
Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) – Provides stream stewardship, wholesale water
supply, and flood protection for Santa Clara County.

Senate Bill (SB) 375 (Chapter 728, Statutes of 2008) – Directs the California Air Resources
Board to set regional targets for metropolitan planning organizations to reduce GHG
emissions from cars and light trucks. SB 375 aligns the regional allocation of housing needs
and regional transportation planning in an effort to reduce GHG emissions from motor
vehicle trips. ABAG is the metropolitan planning organization for Sunnyvale and the
surrounding region.
Sensitive Use – A use which has populations that are more likely to have health-related
issues from an adjacent or nearby use. Can include day-care facilities, elementary and high
schools, hospitals, senior housing, or nursing homes.
Service Level Standard – Standards established for the efficient and cost-effective operation
of transportation systems. For example, a transit agency may set ridership, on-time
performance, and/or cost per rider objectives as service level standards for guiding
decisions on whether to maintain, increase, or decrease a service.
Single-Occupant Vehicle – A private vehicle operated on the roadway by a single driver with
no passengers.
Smart Growth – A broad concept that describes the change in community design from post-
World War II development principles to development that better serves the economic,
environmental, and social needs of communities. The US Environmental Protection Agency
identified the following ten principles of smart growth: (1) mix land uses; (2) take advantage
of compact building design; (3) create a range of housing opportunities and choices;
(4) create walkable neighborhoods; (5) foster distinctive, attractive communities with a
strong sense of place; (6) preserve open space, farmland, natural beauty, and critical
environmental areas; (7) strengthen and direct development toward existing communities;
(8) provide a variety of transportation choices; (9) make development decisions predictable,
fair, and cost effective; and (10) encourage community and stakeholder collaboration in
development decisions.
Sphere of Influence (SOI) – The probable future physical boundaries and service area of a local
agency, as determined by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) for the county
within which the agency is located.
Sustainable/Sustainability – Broadly, to keep up or keep going; to maintain an action or
process. In the context of land use and environmental sustainability, there are many
definitions and some debate about their merits. The National Environmental Policy Act of
1969 declared as its goal a national policy to “create and maintain conditions under which
humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic and
other requirements of present and future generations of Americans.” The United Nations’
1987 Report of World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future

defined sustainable development as “development that meets the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” It can also
be defined as physical development that simultaneously provides for economic prosperity,
environmental quality, and social equity.
Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) – A regional growth strategy required under SB 375
that, in combination with transportation policies and programs, strives to reduce GHG
emissions, and, if feasible, achieves regional GHG reduction targets set by the California Air
Resources Board. The Sustainable Communities Strategy is part of a Regional Transportation
Plan, must comply with federal law, and must be based on “current planning assumptions”
that include the information in local general plans and sphere of influence boundaries. (See
Senate Bill [SB] 375.)
Trail – A path physically separate from roadway or other transportation systems, but not
substituting for those systems, that may be paved and is intended to provide primarily
recreation opportunities but may serve transportation needs for bicyclists and pedestrians.
Transit – The conveyance of persons or goods from one place to another by means of a local
or regional public transportation system.
Transit, Public – A system of regularly scheduled buses and/or trains available to the public
on a fee-per-ride basis. Also called mass transit.
Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) – Moderate- to higher-density development, located
within an easy walk of a major transit stop, generally with a mix of residential, employment,
and shopping opportunities designed for pedestrians without excluding the automobile.
Transit-oriented development can be new construction or redevelopment of one or more
buildings whose design and orientation facilitate transit use.
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) – The application of strategies and policies to
reduce travel demand (specifically that of single-occupant private vehicles) or to redistribute
this demand in space or in time. Managing demand can be a cost-effective alternative to
increasing capacity. A demand management approach to transport also has the potential to
deliver better environmental outcomes, improved public health, stronger communities, and
more prosperous and livable cities. Transportation demand management techniques link
with and support community movements for sustainable transport.
Transportation System – The infrastructure used for the movement of community members
and visitors using all modes of transport through the city including roadways, sidewalks, bike
routes, railways, and other pathways.

Adopted LUTE – April 2017
Transport Use – A conveyance to move persons or goods on a street (see also Non-Transport
Use).
Trip – A one-way journey that proceeds from an origin to a destination via a single mode of
transportation; the smallest unit of movement considered in transportation studies. Each
trip has one “production end” (origin) and one “attraction end” (destination). Typical origins
and destinations are home, work, shopping, school, and entertainment.
Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) – One vehicle traveling the distance of 1 mile. Total vehicle
miles is the aggregate mileage traveled by all vehicles within a specified region for a
specified time period. VMT is a key measure of overall street and highway use. Reducing
VMT is often a major objective in efforts to reduce vehicular congestion and achieve air
quality goals.
Village Center – A specifically identified neighborhood crossroad or district nucleus that is
planned to become the focus of activity and future transformative change for the nearby
neighborhoods. It is designed to support a lifestyle with less reliance on a private
automobile. It is an active, pedestrian-oriented place with neighborhood-serving
commercial uses that are close to residents and are mixed, typically vertically, with
residential uses. It serves as a meeting place for the community and may also support public
and quasi-public services in order to reduce the need for automobile trips. Residential uses
in the Village Center address diversity in lifestyles, ages, and incomes in order to allow
residents to stay in the neighborhood longer. A Village Center has a unique “sense of place”
beyond what has been experienced in Sunnyvale’s older neighborhood commercial areas.

     distinguish Sunnyvale from surrounding communities and by preserving
     historic buildings, special districts and residential neighborhoods
     which make the City unique. (Previously Community Design Goal A / Adopted

opportunities to improve. Improving the built environment may not require many
grand gestures, but a collection of smaller actions.
A city’s visual image is a complex relationship between private and public development
patterns and the natural features of the land. Ideally, this visual image should match
the values and ambitions of a community. A city should create a place that residents
can identify with and visitors can understand. A strong, clear visual image is like a firm
handshake. It is a satisfying encounter.
There are many different factors that contribute to the City’s image. These factors
include defined boundaries and gateways, distinctive landmarks and districts and
publicly visible art. Enhancing these features will help articulate an image of Sunnyvale
as a complete City and a special place to live and work.
Boundaries and Gateways

                                                                                            area.
the next. There are few visual clues to distinguish Sunnyvale from adjoining cities. This
sprawl creates confusion and lack of orientation in the physical environment. Currently,
there are few City monument signs or other distinctive features at these gateways to
mark the municipal boundary and welcome people to Sunnyvale.

                               Roadways and natural features offer the best opportunities to define and clarify the
                               City’s edges. Distinctive landscaping, signage and medians can be used to highlight
                               boundaries and gateways. Unique development or prominent artwork can be also
                               encouraged at gateway and boundary locations. The City of Sunnyvale requires artworks

Special Districts and Residential Neighborhoods
Districts are special areas within a city which have a unique and unified character.

Memorable districts and neighborhoods create memorable cities.
Sunnyvale has three basic types of districts: residential, commercial and industrial.
See the sidebar for a list of some of the districts in Sunnyvale. Most districts share
a predominantly homogenous form of horizontal structures and relatively similar
building styles. Some districts and neighborhoods are more disrupted by change than
others. Incompatible development has a damaging impact on the cohesiveness of the
area and erodes its special quality.
                                                                                             See Goal CC-3 (Well-Designed

                       Publicly Visible Art
                       The cultural identity of a community is enhanced by the inclusion of public art in physical
                       boundaries, gateways, landmarks, open spaces and buildings. Public art distinguishes
                       communities from one another and adds human dimension to both outdoor and indoor
                       environments by adding color and movement while defining “a sense of place.” There
                       are three techniques to use to incorporate art into the community: a Master Plan for
                       Public Art, art in private development and integration of art into capital projects.
                       In 1983, a 10-Year Master Plan for Public Art was developed to purchase commissioned
                       artwork for permanent display on public properties. The plan identified public locations
                       (both indoors and outdoors) for the permanent display of art and set aside funding to
                       acquire a balanced and varied collection of public art. To date the City’s Public Art
                       Collection includes something for everyone.
                       In 1990, an Art in Private Development ordinance was adopted to further enhance the
                       City’s commitment to providing art in the community and in response to a policy in the
                       1983 Cultural Arts sub-element. Code requirements of the ordinance require large and
                       centrally located private sector developments to include art for public display.
                       The City also incorporates art components in appropriate capital projects. This approach
                       has been used with recent park development and redevelopment projects. Baylands Park
                       incorporates many elements of art and has the potential to include more. Art was also
                       included in the renovation of the City’s oldest park, Washington Park. These successful
                       models of incorporating art into park projects will be used for future parks projects.

The challenge for the future will be to find new and reinvent old, ways of providing and
encouraging the provision of publicly visible art. A new Master Plan for Public Art needs
to be developed to set goals and priorities for the future which may be pursued as funds
become available. Key elements of the 1983 Master Plan for Public Art included the
capital project funding that enabled the commission and purchase of quality artworks
and the City’s commitment to funding the development of a permanent collection
through capital improvement funds. Since the original Master Plan for Public Art is
now outdated, new funding sources and strategies need to be identified if a revised
master plan is to be developed.
An exciting area for consideration of new art is in the area of community murals. The
Lakewood Community Mural set a good model for community involvement and support
in assisting a professional artist create a high quality mural in the Lakewood area. Staff will
explore other options with neighborhood and community organizations for community
murals to provide high quality public art and help promote neighborhood identity. Park
sites, public buildings and other public spaces may provide appropriate venues.

                                The view from the road is one of the most significant factors shaping Sunnyvale’s visual
                                image. For non-residents, the view from the road is often their only impression of
                                Sunnyvale. For Sunnyvale residents, the quality of the street environment has a more
                                direct impact on their daily lives. City roads are used for shopping errands, by children
                                walking to school and by residents driving to work. Roadways provide the continuity
                                that links neighbor to neighbor, district to district and the City to the larger regional
                                transportation systems. Roadways are an important part of the visual landscape and
                                affect property values throughout the City.
                                Sunnyvale is distinguished from surrounding cities by the amount of landscaped
                                medians, street trees, private commercial landscaping, undergrounded utilities and
                                sign controls. These features create an attractive roadway environment which differs
                                from surrounding cities that do not have similar programs and regulations. Sunnyvale
                                also looks different because of the extensive use of monolithic sidewalks, instead of the

                                Public landscaping can help unify and identify an area. Sunnyvale’s landscaped medians
                                help distinguish the major thoroughfares in the City and make streets more attractive,
                                motorists more comfortable and increase safety by separating oncoming cars. Trees also
                                represent a substantial value to the City, by adding to the real estate values of the private

                                for pedestrians and motorists, contribute to fresher air and reduce reflected heat from
                                buildings and pavement.
                                The City has installed approximately 60 acres of public landscaping on Sunnyvale’s
                                roadways. The City also maintains approximately 37,000 street trees. In 2011, the City is
                                drafting an Urban Forestry Plan to further detail the City’s plan for trees. Maintenance
                                costs can be expected to increase as trees grow taller, requiring additional and more

     enjoyment of residential neighborhoods. (Previously Community Design

Streetscape Improvements
Utility wires, walls and fences along the public right of way have a direct impact on the
view from the road. The design of these elements can add or detract from the visual
appeal of the streetscape.
Undergrounding Overhead Utilities
Most property owners are required to place existing or new utilities underground
when their land develops or redevelops. The City helps facilitate the undergrounding of
utilities by paying for a portion of the undergrounding which extends beyond private
property lines and street centerlines. The City’s program to fund utility undergrounding
along major thoroughfares has resulted in even more significant improvements to the
roadway environment and the City’s image.
Fencing and Sound Walls
Many of Sunnyvale’s major thoroughfares are bordered by a continuous wall of rear
yard fencing. In residential areas fencing provides privacy, blocks the view of traffic and
can provide some noise buffer.                                                               See Goal SN-8 (Compatible

Authority (VTA). The City has required sound walls as part of new development when
needed for noise mitigation. State and County agencies are responsible for installing
sound walls along freeways and expressways when there are substantial modifications,
such as widening.
Signs
Commercial signs are a highly visible part of the roadside environment. They affect the
visual quality of the roadways and the character of the City. Signs are generally oriented
to the street and are a useful convenience to locate businesses. The differences in the
types of signage often help to identify districts. Residential districts have few signs,
while commercial districts have many signs in all different colors and sizes.

                               Ensure that buildings and related site improvements for private
                               development are well designed and compatible with surrounding
                               properties and districts. (Previously Community Design Goal C/ Adopted in 1990)
                               Private development is as important as public improvements in creating a vital, enjoyable
                               and comfortable environment for residents and visitors. As a result, most communities
                               have development standards and often require public review and approval of project design.
                               In Sunnyvale, the design of new projects is reviewed as part of the permitting process.
                               Without design policies and standards, private development may or may not produce the
                               type of visual environment preferred by Sunnyvale. It is even less likely that the City will
                               get outstanding development without a commitment to quality design review.
                               Sunnyvale has zoning regulations, standard development conditions and design
                               guidelines which address site and building design. These regulations, conditions
                               and policies are intended to create an environment which is engaging and attractive.
                               They cover four major topics: site design, compatibility with the built environment,
                               integration with the roadway and building design.

Along commercial roadways in Sunnyvale, buildings have routinely been set back from
the street to accommodate parking. Often, a sense of enclosure is lost. The building also
loses its relationship to the street and appears isolated at the back of a long expanse of
asphalt. The City has studied El Camino Real and Downtown and addressed the building
and street relationship through the use of both minimum and maximum setbacks.               List of Design Guidelines:

                       GOAL CC-4
                       ACCESSIBLE AND ATTRACTIVE PUBLIC FACILITIES
                       Provide public facilities which are accessible, attractive and add to the
                       enjoyment of the physical environment. (Previously Community Design Goal D/
                       Adopted in 1990)
                       Public buildings and facilities are the official face of a City. Sunnyvale’s public buildings
                       are centers of government, law, culture, education, recreation and other City services.
                       The City services provided in these buildings are essential to the health, safety and
                       welfare of the community.
                       There are many public buildings and complexes which serve Sunnyvale:
                       n	  City Hall
                       n	  Library
                       n	  Community Center, including the Senior Center and Creative Arts Center
                       n	  Parks and Recreation Centers (18)
                       n	  Municipal Golf Courses
                       n	  Public Safety Building
                       n	  Fire Stations (6)
                       n	  Corporation Yard
                       n	  Water Pollution Control Plant and SMaRT Station
                       See Figure 4-2, Public Facilities Map for the location of these buildings and complexes.
                       Sunnyvale’s public buildings have unique characteristics which are different from other
                       buildings in the City. Sunnyvale’s buildings are open to everyone and heavily used by the
                       community. These public buildings are not commercial enterprises, but are solely meant
                       to provide the best possible services to Sunnyvale residents, businesses and visitors. Public
                       buildings represent the City and strengthen the identity of Sunnyvale. These buildings
                       are publicly funded and owned. In addition to all of the design principles discussed for
                       private development, the public nature of these buildings also requires them to be readily
                       accessible, easily identified, attractive and representative of the communities’ values and
                       aspirations. See Figure 4-2 for a map displaying the City’s public facilities.
                       While Sunnyvale’s public buildings have good accessibility, improvements could be
                       made to a comprehensive and visible sign program to help locate City facilities and
                       other major attractions, such as the downtown. Some of Sunnyvale’s public buildings
                       would be more easily identified if the signs were in prominent locations, of larger size,
                       or made of more distinctive materials.

In 1980, the City of Sunnyvale recognized the need to preserve those objects that
represent the community’s physical and cultural development and adopted the first
Heritage Preservation Sub-Element as part of the Sunnyvale General Plan. The City also
established the official Heritage Resources Inventory in 1980 containing landmarks,

Taaffe-Frances Heritage Neighborhood
The majority of the homes in the Taaffe-Frances Heritage Neighborhood (the 500
blocks of S. Frances Street and S. Taaffe Street and one home on the corner of S. Murphy
Avenue and Olive Avenue) are in good to excellent condition. Although some individual
buildings show the need for improvement, the overall appearance of this neighborhood
is that owners care about their properties and make an effort to maintain them.

District was added to the neighborhood, have been consistent with the regulations         4–17

Maintaining and Updating the Heritage Resources Inventory
The Heritage Resource Inventory does not include all of the buildings, trees and sites
in the City that may be worthy of inclusion. The Heritage Resources inventory should
be updated periodically to include new resources that have been added to the inventory
since the last publication, delete those that have been lost and indicate any that may
have been upgraded from a heritage resource to a landmark status. At that time, existing
resources should be re-evaluated and a new survey of the community conducted to
determine if other buildings, sites, trees, streetscapes or districts should be considered
for inclusion in the Inventory.

Partnerships with Other Groups and Agencies
It will become increasingly important to maintain and expand relationships with private
organizations as the City seeks to broaden its constituency for heritage preservation
support and maximize the effectiveness of the City’s Heritage Preservation program.
These other agencies can provide information and support for the City’s heritage
preservation activities.
Some of these program activities include providing written histories of the City.           Records, photographs,

the City of Destiny to the Heart of Silicon Valley, by Mary Jo Ignoffo. This book was
published by the California History Center Foundation and provides another example
of how various public and private agencies can work together to acknowledge and
preserve the City’s heritage preservation program.
Oral Histories
In addition to written resources, the City also has a resource that has not been fully
utilized – the memories of long-time residents. Older residents have stories to tell about
Sunnyvale’s past which can help us to understand how things came to be as they are and
how personalities of these individuals have affected the City’s historical development.
For example the story of W.E. Crossman’s efforts to create the City of Destiny is largely
an oral tradition that was later recorded and documented. These heritage resources,
although in some ways intangible, make an important contribution to Sunnyvale’s
Heritage and should be acknowledged.
Integration of Diverse Traditions
The cultural traditions which now are reflected in Sunnyvale’s built environment are
largely the traditions of Americans of European descent. It is these traditions which
have defined what is beautiful and worth of preservation. As the number of immigrants
from other countries increases, the ethnic make-up of the population will change. The
new residents will bring with them their own concepts about what is beautiful, what is
acceptable and what is worthy of preservation.
Sunnyvale has not yet experienced the “layering” effect of having buildings used over
time by different cultural groups. Therefore, the question of “whose heritage is it?” that
should be preserved has not arisen. However, if the predicted demographic changes occur,
this could be a relevant question in the future. Some new residents may at first tend to
move into the older, less expensive neighborhoods which contain a significant number
of cultural resource homes and propose to make changes to these homes to express their
cultural traditions. Should this pattern occur, it will provide an opportunity to develop
a creative dialogue between the new residents and the heritage “establishment.” In order
to benefit from the enrichment possible through integration of diverse traditions, an      4–21
energetic program of outreach and involvement should be developed.

Library use in Sunnyvale has been high for more than a decade. Frequent users of library
services are children, adults from 35-54 and seniors. The Library is consistently among
the top five California public libraries in communities of similar size in terms of number
of items circulated per capita. Library use ebbs and flows with the economy, community
education levels and in relation to library conditions in neighboring communities. As
of 2003, the Sunnyvale Library is experiencing a sustained period growth in use of
materials, an increase of 20 percent in the last year alone.
The library collection is the backbone of the Library, supporting the Library’s activities
and services. The library collection continues to evolve as technology provides new
formats and information delivery systems. Books, books on CDs (compact discs), music
CDs, down-loadable electronic books for computer use and portable devices, DVDs,
magazines and newspapers, in print and online, and other digital resources comprise
the current array of materials offered to satisfy the information needs of our community.
Modernization and additional space are required for to support future areas of emphasis
in library services. Special areas of emphasis include additional space for children’s
materials, media collection computer-related materials and materials in a variety of
languages. Additional space for functions such as meeting space, study areas, and areas
to obtain, meet in small groups and gather in large groups for programs.
In response to the increasing complexity of Library space issues, facility studies were
conducted in depth in 2006 and 2007. Space, aging building systems and access issues
were addressed at that time. The study also determined how much additional space was
needed and what kind of space it should be. The options for study included consideration
of a new main library facility and additional branches in the community. Building a new,
larger main library facility was recommended and presented to Sunnyvale residents for
approval in 2007 as a Library Bond Measure. The measure failed to achieve the two-
thirds majority needed to pass, so the possibility of a branch library was explored in
2008. The City Council did not to pursue the branch library alternative at that time.
Future considerations should also explore the feasibility of retail and/or food beverage
services for Library customers due to many requests from customers over a long period
of time. Additional options and decisions need to be made to provide full library service
in updated, accessible, technology-upgraded facilities in Sunnyvale.
The Sunnyvale Library looks towards future trends to continue to provide the public
with current content and materials. The Library must address the most effective ways
to continue to support reading and learning using print as well as the new formats and
methods that technology continues to offer. There is a vast array of formats that the
public increasingly expects the Library to offer, which is a challenge to the Library’s
static budget. The Library also needs to offer easy access to Library resources via social
networks and on personal handheld devices. It is not enough to simply introduce new
technologies and formats to the public. The Library must be supportive of each user’s
specific needs in terms of the management and evaluation of such technologies and
formats.

     APPROPRIATE ARTS FACILITIES
     Provide and maintain arts facilities based on community need and the
     city’s ability to finance, construct, maintain and operate them. (Previously
     Arts Goal F/ Adopted in 1995)
As an essential and integral part of the City of Sunnyvale’s services, the City currently
operates two community buildings dedicated to the arts: Sunnyvale Theatre and the
Creative Arts Center. The fully-equipped 200-seat Sunnyvale Theatre is the most
heavily programmed theatre venue in the South Bay, serving an annual audience of
more than 65,000 with a schedule that includes more than 400 performances of all types
of venues. The Theatre building also includes one of the area’s most attractive public
dance studios. The adjacent Creative Arts Center includes one of the largest pottery
studios in the Bay Area, two fine art studios and two music and drama classrooms.
Together, these two facilities house most of the City’s performing and visual arts classes
in a central location, providing recreational experiences for more than 21,000 youth and
adult students enrolled annually.
These well-equipped, well-maintained and conveniently-located arts facilities showcase
Sunnyvale as a center of creativity and productivity. Community members of all
ages can practice and enjoy both performing and visual arts. These buildings invite
shared cultural experiences, serve as gathering places and allow nonprofit art groups
opportunities to flourish.
There is an acknowledged shortage of suitable and affordable commercial space available
to individual professional artists in the region. In addition to the Sunnyvale Theatre and
Creative Arts Center, Sunnyvale also maintains and leases four Artist Studios at Raynor
Activity Center at below-market rates. By making available affordable workspaces for
local professional artists, the City further affirms its commitment to providing an
encouraging and welcoming environment for the arts.
Community Center Theatre
The Community Center Renovation Project, completed in 1991, included major
improvements to the Community Center Theatre because of heavy use and need for
quality arts facilities. The theatre lobby was enlarged and a ticket box office was added
to the front of the theatre. Handicapped accessible rest rooms, a rehearsal room and
office space were also added. The ambiance of the facility was enhanced by updating
and coordinating interior finishes and furniture and the theatre seating was replaced.
Infrastructure improvements included replacing the roof, heating, ventilation and air
                                                                                           4–25
conditioning systems, stage lighting, audio system and fire protection system.

                       Use of the Community Center Theatre has expanded since 1983, and the theatre is annually
                       booked for 49 weeks with three weeks generally set aside for preventive maintenance and
                       repair. Over 450 performances are offered each year which include performances by the
                       California Theatre Center, Sunnyvale Community Players, Sunnyvale Singers, Sunnyvale
                       Music Association, the City’s Evenings of Cultural Arts and various community rentals.
                       Performances include drama, dance, storytelling and music.
                       Creative Arts Center
                       To address changing programming needs, the Creative Arts Center was remodeled in
                       1985 to replace the lapidary studio with a general purpose arts and crafts studio, and
                       add storage for the gallery along with office space. As part of the Community Center
                       Renovation Project, a fire protection system was added, the roof replaced, and interior
                       finishes were updated. New kilns were installed in 1995, and potter’s wheels and other
                       pottery-related equipment are replaced on an as needed basis. In compliance with the
                       Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, a fully accessible potter’s wheel has been added
                       to the equipment inventory.
                       Dance Studio
                       Since 1983, there has been increased community interest in dance; therefore, a major
                       component of the Community Center Renovation Project identified the addition of a
                       dance studio to the theatre building. The “state of the art” dance studio includes a sprung
                       wooden floor, full length mirrors, exercise bars and a sound system. The studio can be
                       accessed from the outside or through the main building — a feature which lends itself well
                       to the conducting of classes as well as rehearsal space for theatre and dance productions.
                       Approximately 250 annual dance classes are held in the Dance Studio for children,
                       youth and adults. Dance opportunities include ballet, tap, jazz, street dance, flamenco,
                       belly dance and creative movement. Classes serve approximately 3,000 participants
                       a year and represent major growth in program participation since 1983. The dance
                       program includes traditional offerings of Ballet, Tap and Jazz, while expanding to meet
                       the changing needs of the community. Classes such as Hip Hop are popular with the
                       younger members of the community and classes such as Chinese Ethnic Folk Dance and

                       To further demonstrate the City’s commitment to encourage and support local artists,
                       a portion of the Raynor Activity Center has been converted to four artist studios. The
                       studios are offered to local artists on a short-term lease basis at below market rental
                       rates. These studios offer a creative space for artists who cannot rent space at commercial
                       rates. Artists are selected by a jury based on their eligibility in meeting the following
                       criteria: quality of work; residence (Sunnyvale resident or non-resident); and diversity
                       in the types of media being represented at the site.

Future Facilities
The present trend is towards maintaining existing facilities rather than constructing
new ones, given the high costs both of facility construction and of operation. The recent
and extensive renovation of the Community Center Complex has ensured that the arts
facilities located therein are functional and attractive. Efforts will continue to focus
on maintaining the Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility, along with facility
quality, safety and cleanliness to ensure participants’ safety and user satisfaction.
Located within the greater Sunnyvale area are many arts facilities of a regional nature
which may offer the potential for partnerships while also serving as arts resources to
residents of the region. For facilities owned by the City of Sunnyvale, where possible and
appropriate, efforts will be made to recover the costs of operation from users, such as
in rental situations.
     Policy CC-9.1 Provide, maintain, and operate arts facilities within
     financial constraints such as the Community Center Theatre,
     Creative Arts Center, artists’ studio, gallery and public art
     collection in a safe, clean and usable condition with attention
     to customer satisfaction. (Previously Arts Policy F.1)
n	  CC-9.1a Plan and implement appropriate non-use times for arts facilities which will
    ensure adequate maintenance time.
n	  CC-9.1b Conduct ongoing surveys of special populations related to facilities in order
    to provide maximum accessibility.
n	  CC-9.1c Evaluate opportunities to utilize regional arts facilities and resources.

                       The city strives to develop and implement passive and active recreation and
                       enrichment programs that:
                       •	 Provide constructive opportunities for fitness, well-being, healthy
                           coping and stress management
                       •	 Highlight cultural practices and traditions reflective of a diverse
                           community
                       •	 Promote activities that foster interaction among diverse parts of the
                           community
                       •	 Encourage creative expression, education, skill development and

                       GOAL CC-11
                       WIDE RANGE OF RECREATION PROGRAMMING
                       The City strives to ensure equal opportunities for participation and to
                       provide for a range of structured and unstructured uses, and a variety
                       of general and special interest uses in parks and facilities. The city
                       also provides a wide range of program choices, open space, amenities
                       and facility offerings to meet the recreational needs of a diverse
                       and changing population, including identified subgroups and special
                       populations. Policies related to acquiring and/or developing open space
                       facilities and amenities are also included here. Competing interests and
                       finite resources, however, require the City to set some priorities. (Previously

The City strives to create community through its people, parks and programs. A wide
range of accessible, high quality arts and recreation services, facilities and programs are
provided to enhance the well-being of the diverse and changing Sunnyvale community.
Increasing ethnic diversity in the City affects the promotion and communication of
recreation services. Areas of the City differ in ethnicity, of English language proficiency
and economic need.
The City offers a full-range of arts and recreation program opportunities and services,
comparable to what is offered by neighboring communities. Programs include sports,
aquatics, visual arts, performing arts, camps, golf, facility and picnic reservations,
therapeutic recreation and partnerships with community groups, such as sports leagues.
Recreation programs are continually monitored, evaluated and modified as appropriate.
Increasing ethnic diversity in the City affects the promotion and communication of
recreation services. The City is committed to maximize access to facilities and art
and recreation programs to ensure that people can utilize the services, facilities and
amenities the City provides, regardless of income, age, disability, location of residence,
or other category of need. Most offerings are fee-based but with some no-cost or low-
cost opportunities. Highlights of this programming include youth services, senior
services and co-sponsored groups.
Youth Services
A youth services needs assessment led the way for a restructuring of after school
programs to focus on those neighborhoods with the greatest need for after school
activities. The creation of a mobile recreation program, Fun on the Run, provides local
youth with an array of supervised, safe and structured recreational activities in their
own neighborhoods.
High school teen programs are located in the Fair Oaks Park building, providing a safe
gathering place and performance venue for local teen talent. Programs feature live bands
on a monthly basis for high school students living or attending school in Sunnyvale.
Senior Center
With the opening of the new Senior Center in 2003, there was an opportunity to adjust
programming to take advantage of the new facility. Services now include a fitness room,
a dedicated ballroom and comfortable and attractive common areas.
The Senior Center is a special facility with activities targeted and limited for individuals
50 and older. Membership is not required for participation in Senior Center activities,
although a membership option is provided.
                                                                                             4–29

                       Co-Sponsored Groups
                       The City’s Co-sponsorship Policy underwent revision in 2003 and was replaced by a
                       broader policy dealing with partnerships with outside groups and retitled “Relationships
                       with Outside Groups.” Many of the City’s long-standing co-sponsored groups, such as
                       youth sports leagues, have transitioned under this new policy to formal agreements
                       with the City that define the special arrangements the City has with the various groups.
                       Trends and Issues
                       With finite resources—physical, personnel and financial—there seems to be an ever
                       increasing demand for programming priorities and resource allocation. For every
                       interest group served, another may go underserved. The following trends and issues
                       affect the City’s recreation programs:
                       n	 Prioritization of recreational services — Competition for resources between those
                          with economic need or geographic need or “at risk.” After-school use: market-based
                          demand in competition with community need.
                       n	 Additional recreational services — Growth is being seen in new technologies and
                          spread of new technologies, creating demand for new services or new methods of
                          delivering services. Time constraints on families are prevalent, with both parents
                          working. Families are looking for activities they can do together. Communities are
                          increasingly demanding web access to services/information.
                       n	 Range of needs for senior recreation services — Multiple generations within the
                          one rubric of “seniors,” challenging the “one size fits all” mentality. Frail seniors
                          versus active seniors, with differing needs.
                       n	 Contracting of services — Subcontracting to vendors using City facilities is
                          increasing—agreements exist for swimming, gymnastics, dance, camps and food
                          services, among others.
                       n	 Changes in services and spaces for sports — Year–round play is increasingly
                          common for individual sports as compared to set seasons. Sports for youth are
                          shifting from recreational to more competitive programs. Longer seasons and non-
                          traditional seasons for youth soccer and baseball have created greater demand for
                          sports/athletic fields. Competing demands for fields also come from football, softball
                          and cricket. Adult leagues are looking for athletic fields where they can play. Leagues
                          would like the City to have enough of the right kinds of athletic fields to facilitate
                          hosting of regional tournament play.
                       n	 Businesses and their relationship to recreation — Local businesses have expressed
                          a strong desire to have more community events that would attract people to the
                          community and to their businesses. Demand by “day time only” business residents
                          for recreational space.
                       n	 Additional recreational areas — Skateboarders want places throughout the open
                          space system for skating. BMX bike riders want places where they can refine their
                  4–30    skills. Gardeners desire locations for providing community gardens.

Policies to achieve the Goal CC-10 (High-Quality Recreation Programming) are:
    Policy CC-10.1 Design programs to meet the needs of residents,
    allowing for non-resident participation as long as it does
    not take away from opportunities or resources for residents
    (Exceptions are services that are intended to serve as profit

Hazards and Disaster Preparedness and Response
     GOAL SN-1
     ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF RISK FOR NATURAL AND
     HUMAN-CAUSED HAZARDS
     Ensure that natural and human-caused hazards are recognized and
     considered in decisions affecting the community and that land uses
     reflect acceptable levels of risk based on identified hazards and
     occupancy. (Previously Safety Mission A / Adopted In 2008)
Consideration of natural and manmade hazards in land use decisions is a critical
component of the City’s planning process. By carefully balancing the community’s need
for safety with other needs such as housing, employment and transportation, the City
can ensure that the knowledge of existing safety hazards are reasonably considered in
all planning and development review processes.
Among the hazards that should be considered are seismic, flood, fire, hazardous materials
and aviation hazards. An important consideration is also the protection of vital City
lifelines from hazards. Hazards and lifelines are discussed in more detail below.
     Policy SN-1.1 Evaluate and consider existing and potential
     hazards in developing land use policies. Make land use
     decisions based on an awareness of the hazards and potential
     hazards for the specific parcel of land. (Previously Safety Policy A1)
Seismic Hazards
Damaging earthquakes are infrequent; however, they pose the most significant threat in
relation to the destruction they may cause to the City.
Sunnyvale is located between two active earthquake faults. (See Figure 6-1, San Francisco
Bay Region Earthquake Probability Map.) Scientists have identified four fault segments
on which they believe large earthquakes are most likely to occur. The USGS estimated
that there is a 63 percent chance for at least one earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or larger
to strike in the San Francisco Bay Area before the year 2037. An earthquake of this size
could strike at any time.
The City has taken significant steps to reduce the risk of seismic hazards. To improve the
seismic safety of buildings in the less stable soil areas of the City, geotechnical reports
are now required for all developments in the City. New Building Code requirements
and the continuing modernization of the City have greatly reduced the number of             6–3

                                structures most vulnerable to seismic events. The City actively participates in the State
                                of California Seismic Hazards Mapping Program. In addition, the seismic safety of City
                                buildings has received considerable attention. Many City buildings have been designated
                                as “Essential Services Buildings.” Seismic retrofitting of the Community Center, City
                                Hall Annex, Library, Corporation yard (stores section) has been completed, along with
                                all six fire stations.
                                Other hazards of a seismic event include flooding and fire hazards. A local major earthquake

                                Flood Hazards
                                Santa Clara Valley is classified as an active flood plain that has been severely altered
                                by human activity. Approximately 1,800 acres of Sunnyvale has been designated by
                                the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as Special Flood Hazard Areas
                                (SFHA). The SFHA show areas in Sunnyvale susceptible to flooding (See Figure 6-2,
                                FEMA Flood Hazard Map). In Sunnyvale, SFHAs are generally located in the northeast
                                portion of the City. Flood events are generally caused by a creek topping its banks,
                                clogged catch basins or storm drains.
                                The City has been a participant in the FEMA Community Rating System (CRS) since
                                1998. In May 2003, the City of Sunnyvale was granted a Class 7 community rating by
                                FEMA, enabling Sunnyvale citizens and businesses to obtain discounts on their flood
                                insurance premiums. This rating is granted based on the community’s participation in
                                public information activities, mapping and regulating activities and flood preparedness
                                and damage reduction activities. Sunnyvale’s program addresses flood hazards with a
                                combination of infrastructure projects and building code requirements.
A 1 percent flood, also

                                flood control channels. These channels, coupled with the City’s storm drains take the
                                majority of surface run-off to the San Francisco Bay. The East and West Channels and
                                Calabazas Creek were built to contain a 1 percent annual chance flood.

                                are at a higher elevation, gravity flow conveys the stormwater to the Bay.

                                Levees and Dikes — Dike and levee systems have been constructed along the San
                                Francisco Bay, originally to form and protect the salt evaporators and concentrators that
                                ring the southernmost arm of the bay, not as a barrier to prevent flooding a populated
                                area. The dikes are constructed of weak, locally-derived Bay materials that are constantly
                                undergoing settlement, erosion by the elements and damage by burrowing animals.
                                Without the present system of dikes and levees, a part of Sunnyvale normally would
                                be subjected to flooding by tides. It assumed that this would still be the case if these

                                Dams — Stevens Creek Dam, located on Stevens Creek 2.5 miles south of the City of
                                Sunnyvale’s boundary, is an earthen dam approximately 135 feet in height. Constructed
                                in 1936, the dam’s principal purpose is water supply. The waters impounded in the
                                reservoir are released at a rate such that the waters will percolate into the ground, thus
                                recharging the ground water aquifer.
                                Building Code Requirements — Sunnyvale has enforced specific building code
                                requirements in the flood prone areas to minimize potential property damage from
                                flooding. Specific requirements for development in these areas to reduce flood hazards
                                include minimum foundation pad heights above the projected flood depth as specified
                                on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
                                Future Flood Control Activities
                                There are four sources of flooding that can threaten Sunnyvale:
                                Excessive Precipitation — The areas in Sunnyvale that will flood as a result of heavy
                                rains and the resulting surface runoff border Calabazas Creek and the East and West
                                Flood control channels. Specific street flooding will also occur from clogged storm
                                drains and low places in some roadways.
                                Storm drain inlets are routinely inspected prior to the rainy season each year and
                                cleaned, if necessary, to prevent flooding, alleviate odors and/or prevent mosquitos
                                from breeding. Maintenance crews also clean inlets in response to citizen and business
                                complaints. The majority of the inlets are shallow (less than three feet deep) and debris
                                is removed manually. Deeper inlets are cleaned using a vacuum truck and flushed with
                                water to eliminate remaining debris.
                                Three significant flooding events have occurred in Sunnyvale since the 1993 writing
                                of the Seismic Safety and Safety Sub-element. These events occurred in 1995, 1997 and
                                the El Nino flooding of 1998. These were all declared disasters throughout Santa Clara
                                County. In the years following these storms, the SCVWD, as the agency that maintains
                                and improves the flood control channels in SCVWD completed a project to construct
                                wing walls along Calabazas Creek several feet higher than they were. Additional channel
                                openings, called “boxes”, were also installed under Homestead Road, Vireo Avenue
                                and Lochinvar Avenue, expanding the creek size under these streets. As a result of this
                                improvement, in 2009, City and SCVWD staff worked together to petition FEMA to

                               fire service must be ready to respond to fires and other incidents. While the potential
                               for extraordinary disaster always exists, and while the aging process of the City and
                               its buildings will have some adverse impact on fire loss, the overall environment is

                               The majority of fires experienced in Sunnyvale are kitchen fires caused by inattention
                               while cooking. Future public education will focus on residential kitchen fires to raise
                               awareness and provide the community with information that will help to reduce the
                               incidence of these types of fires.

Hazardous Materials
For decades, Sunnyvale has been home to many innovative high tech companies.
New and emerging technology companies (e.g. solar cell companies and LED
light manufacturers) whose presence here is vital to a thriving and diverse business
community, require the use of a large variety of hazardous materials, including highly
toxic compressed gases. The highest hazard facilities, those with larger quantities of
hazardous materials or materials having greater toxicity, are located in the industrial
area in the northern part of the City.
As of 2010, more than 900 businesses in the City of Sunnyvale store or use hazardous
materials in quantities requiring a permit. By serving as a Certified Unified Program
Agency (CUPA) the City’s Department of Public Safety is able to conduct inspections
of hazardous materials facilities and to review and certify risk management plans
to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials. The City also maintains a
hazardous materials response team, which is specially trained and equipped to mitigate          Certified Unified

The City will continue to evaluate the need for collaborating between hazardous
materials inspectors and first responders.
The State of California recognized and responded to the need for increased sharing
of hazardous materials information by passing Assembly Bill 2286 which requires all
businesses handling regulated quantities of hazardous material to electronically report
inventories and site maps to the jurisdiction by 2013. Similarly, the City will be required to
report hazardous materials inventories and compliance inspection data to the state by 2013.

Lifelines
Lifelines are essential services that are necessary for the continued functioning of the
community following a disaster. They include utilities (gas, electricity, water, sewer and
communications), City streets, major highways, bridges and railways lines. Information
on age, service, condition and location help emergency preparedness planners assess the
likelihood of failure.
Electric Power — PG&E provides the natural gas and electrical power for Sunnyvale.
The severity of damage to these utilities resulting from an earthquake and what effects
it will have is very difficult to forecast. PG&E has three electrical sub-stations in the
Sunnyvale area — along with a backup power supply network comprised of multiple
transmission lines. If power is interrupted, service from other sources can be obtained.
Water Service — Sunnyvale has four sources of potable water in the City: San
Francisco’s Hetch Hetchy system, the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD), 10
City wells and Cal Water. This system supplies both domestic and emergency water for
the City. Projects were completed in the 1990’s that provide the grid connections in        See EM-1, EM-2, EM-3

processes all of the City’s sewage. The WPCP has two separate generators normally
used every day that supply approximately 90 percent of the electrical needs of the
plant. Operators of the plant have participated in a thorough training program in plant
operations and emergency incidents (including chemical spills, leaks and containment
procedures).
Roadways and Overcrossings — Sunnyvale has 46 major roadway over-crossings and
bridges on streets and freeways within City limits. Sunnyvale has completed seismic
retrofitting for all over-crossings in the City of Sunnyvale. The Mathilda overcrossing
at Evelyn is scheduled for modernization and widening to be completed with the most
recent seismic safety standards by 2011.

                                    There is a difference between the day-to-day response to emergencies and the response
                                    needed to meet the demands of a disaster. City Departments respond to the routine
                                    emergencies of the community. However, disasters pose a different set of demands that the
                                    normal resources and established levels of service cannot meet. In general terms, a disaster
                                    is defined as an emergency event which exceeds the capacity of the City to handle it in the
                                    same manner as it handles the day-to-day emergencies. Effective disaster management
                                    requires the City to use all of its resources to meet emergency needs.
                                    The overall strategy of disaster management is to provide for an integrated approach to
                                    preventing, planning, responding, preparing and mitigating disasters.

Emergency Planning and Coordination
Responsibility for preparing for emergencies lies both with the City and the members
of the community. No government agency has all the resources needed to respond to all
the needs of its community members in or after a disaster. The City has established an
emergency management program to coordinate emergency planning for neighborhoods,
schools and businesses. When City resources are exhausted and a local emergency has
been declared, outside assistance can be requested through an established network of
local, operational area, regional, state and federal mutual aid.
Community and Staff Notification Systems
Public Safety has automated a notification system that uses two different methods
to rapidly notify personnel for emergencies. The first method is the rapid, automatic
notification of specific groups of staff members identified as having certain needed
skills sets, such as SWAT, Hazardous Materials, Accident Investigation teams and DPS
administration. Santa Clara County also has a Web base that allows any subscriber in
the county to enter their phone number, usually cell number, and e-mail address. Santa
Clara County implemented a system which includes this Web-based “reverse 911” type
system in 2010.
Community Resources
One of the City’s greatest resources is its people. When a disaster — natural or man-
made — strikes a community, spontaneous, unaffiliated volunteers — neighbors and
residents — often arrive on-site at a disaster ready to help. As seen in previous disasters
(e.g. Loma Prieta Earthquake, September 11 tragedy, Hurricane Katrina, etc.) affiliated
and unaffiliated volunteers willingly and in unprecedented numbers, will do anything

                                complete the detailed planning necessary to create a pre-disaster mitigation plan.
                                ABAG completed a regional plan for the nine Bay Area counties which was adopted by
                                ABAG on March 17, 2005 after being approved by FEMA. Local agencies were given the
                                opportunity to partner with ABAG to reduce the staff time required to complete a plan.
                                Sunnyvale staff participated with ABAG and completed a FEMA approved Local Annex

                       Community safety is the top priority for the City. The community, both residents and
                       visitors, must feel fundamentally safe while living, working or conducting daily activities
                       within the City of Sunnyvale. This is accomplished in many ways; from prevention of
                       the crime before it occurs, to patrol response to the emergency, to investigation of the
                       crime once the initial report has been written. In addition to crime prevention and
                       investigation, there are non-criminal emergencies as well as traffic related community

     GOAL SN-4
     PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN POLICE SERVICES
     Increase and maintain public confidence in the ability of the Public
     Safety Department to provide quality police services (Previously Law
     Enforcement Goal 4.1C / Adopted in 1995)
Public confidence is the cornerstone of a successful law enforcement organization. A
police agency that is disengaged from the community cannot possibly meet the demands
of modern day law enforcement operations and the expectations of today’s society. As
an agency builds the confidence of the community, the public often feels comfortable
contacting law enforcement to request assistance or to relay information. The agency
that quickly responds to this contact with a professional, well trained and well equipped
police force, stands to further build trust with the community that ultimately leads
to an enhanced quality of service. A professional organization that approaches each
community contact as an opportunity to establish a deep connection with the citizen
will likely be rewarded with information that can be utilized to effectively and efficiently
provide the needed services, whether that is the investigation of a homicide or the
resolution of a neighborhood dispute.
Professional Standards and the Public Safety Assurance of Quality Control
In order to sustain the successes of community confidence building efforts, an agency
must provide feedback to the community about investigations of criminal acts or
complaints related to the conduct of officers, to the degree possible. The public must
know that the information that is provided to the police is actually being utilized to
solve the crime that they reported or to improve the service delivered to the community.
Often times this type of community confidence is enhanced through mandatory
reporting requirements currently utilized by all agencies in Santa Clara County.
Public Safety participates in all County level sub-committees charged with creating
and reviewing county reporting protocols and the mandatory reporting requirements
contained within them.
Citizen commendations and complaints provide the City with valuable information for
evaluating employee performance, identifying areas of police misconduct, monitoring
police relations with the public and identifying the need for new or revised policies
or improved training. For these reasons, citizens are encouraged to report both
commendations and matters of misconduct to the City.                                         6–21

                       Neighborhood Resource Officers
                       The Department of Public Safety takes pride in being connected to community.
                       More than 30 years ago, the Neighborhood Resource Officer position was created.
                       The primary focus of these officers is to be in schools connecting with children and
                       teachers. Additionally, these officers provide service to neighborhoods and the business
                       community in the form of crime prevention tips and neighborhood conflict resolution.
                       This direct contact will sustain and enhance public trust now and into the future.
                       Challenge Team Sunnyvale
                       In 2007, Public Safety created the “Challenge Team Sunnyvale.” Monthly, members of
                       the community meet at Public Safety Headquarters to discuss youth and community
                       issues. These community members represent the business community, nonprofit
                       organizations, health care professionals, faith base organizations, judicial representatives
                       and law enforcement. The team has brought resources together to sponsor youth
                       activities, mentoring programs and the group is currently working towards a public/
                       private collaboration that will be designed to bring youth services to underserved areas
                       of the community. It is this deep connection that will sustain community confidence
                       and enhance public trust into the future.
                       Continuously Enhancing Community Connections
                       In 2004, the City requested the assistance of the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF)
                       to evaluate our community outreach efforts and provide suggestions to strengthen our
                       valued relationship with the public. The Neighborhood Resource Officer position,
                       as well as the entire Crime Prevention Unit in the Department of Public Safety, was
                       highlighted as key to enhancing connections with the community and strengthening
                       public trust.
                       The study determined that citizens in the City of Sunnyvale feel safe in the community
                       and are extremely satisfied with the delivery of police services. PERF did point out
                       several areas by which the department could create a deeper connection with the public.
                       The study suggested enhancements to the Public Safety website and the use of the
                       media to highlight Public Safety activities. The City of Sunnyvale has made substantive
                       changes to the website designed to highlight services available and enhance the public’s
                       experience. In addition, the City is currently utilizing social media and an e-newsletter
                       designed to highlight activities and bring transparency to operations.
                       The City will continue to explore the benefits of the utilization of social media and
                       the use of smart phone technology to open avenues of communication with the public
                       and provide transparency to the community. In addition to non-traditional methods,
                       the City emphasizes connections in non-traditional settings. Connecting Public Safety
                       Officers with other City departments, such as Economic Development and Community

                       barriers and perceptions, leading to significant enhancements of public trust.

On average, the Fire Services Division responds to approximately 7,300 calls for service
annually. Of those calls for service, approximately 70 percent are Emergency Medical
(EMS) calls. Per year, the Division responds to approximately 620 hazardous material
calls and 140 structure fires. There are six fire stations in the city, all of which were
remodeled between 1998 and 1999. The stations are situated throughout the city, based
on a combination of call volume and response time. The department has mutual aid
and/or auto aid agreements with Santa Clara County Fire, San Jose Fire, Mountain          6–23

                              An often-cited measure of fire suppression capability is the rating assigned to a department
                              by the nationally recognized Insurance Services Office (ISO). The ISO is a subsidiary
                              of a publicly traded company and acts as an advisory organization which provides
                              information that insurance companies may use to establish premium costs. The rating
                              is based on, among other things, fire alarm and communications systems, telephone and
                              dispatching systems, fire equipment, staffing, training and geographic distribution of
                              fire stations. Based on all this information, the ISO assigns a classification rating from
                              1-10. Sunnyvale has an ISO rating of 2, which falls within the ‘superior’ category.

                       within the Public Safety model. Public Safety will continue to monitor the County’s
                       paramedic service provision. Public Safety will evaluate the options/opportunities to
                       deliver paramedic services within the Department of Public Safety and will periodically
                       report to Council its findings.
                       Within this ongoing paramedic evaluation process, the City will utilize advances in
                       technology to help reduce response times. Scheduled for completion in 2011 is the
                       establishment of a link between the Public Safety Dispatch computers and County
                       Communications to decrease the response time of paramedics. As in-vehicle GPS
                       becomes more accessible, closest-unit dispatching will be explored to further reduce
                       response times to medical emergencies.

     EFFECTIVE EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION SERVICES
     Provide emergency communications services (Previously Support Services
     Goal 4.3D / Adopted in 1988)
The Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety Dispatch Center provides a public safety
answer point twenty four hours a day 365 days a year. This is a critical link between the
City’s emergency services, first responders and its citizens, and is the primary method
of coordination of Public Safety services. When a citizen has a complaint, problem,
or emergency, virtually all of this information is channeled through the Public Safety
Dispatch Center, which then disseminates and/or dispatches the information to Public
Safety responders or allied agencies/departments. The Dispatch Center handles tens
of thousands of calls for service each year, including many calls from non-English
speaking citizens. With the advent of cellular phones as well as a growing population,
the numbers of calls have increased dramatically and most likely will continue into the
foreseeable future.
Most calls coming into the Dispatch Center are either fire or police-related. These
include crimes in progress, medical emergencies and fires. The timely transmission of
information to field units is critical to enabling successful outcomes. As such, training,
the use of new technology and interoperability enables the communications dispatchers
to effectively gather and disseminate information more efficiently.
The Department of Homeland Security has stated that interoperability is a top priority
for Public Safety agencies nationwide. The purpose of this interoperability goal is to
connect voice and data communications for near real-time sharing across multiple
agencies, counties and regional partners. The Bay Area Urban Area Security Initiative
is tasked with helping 10 counties in the region to prepare for all hazards, natural
or man-made, through a collaborative approach. The ability for multiple cities and
counties to work together provides a significant advantage in the development of these
communication networks leveraging infrastructure, knowledge and funding sources as
a region.
There are four major components to this interoperability effort:
n	  Radio/voice communications
n	  Information sharing
n	  Broadband technology
n	  Digital microwave connectivity through the 10 bay area counties
                                                                                           6–27

                       What level of noise are people expected to tolerate in a residential, commercial or
                       industrial development? Residential uses are the most sensitive. Industrial uses are the
                       most tolerant. Tolerance also depends on how loud the noise is, when and where it
                       happens, the duration, frequency and tone of the noise and the sensitivity of the person
                       who hears the noise. People are generally most tolerant of existing ambient noise. They
                       are least tolerant of single event noise, operational noise and increases in ambient noise.

                       except single-family detached homes. Interior noise levels cannot exceed an Ldn of 45
                       dBA with doors and windows closed and a residential site with an exterior Ldn above
                       60 dBA needs a detailed noise study and mitigation plan. The study must show how the
                       dwelling will meet an interior Ldn of 45 dBA. These requirements are enforced through
                       development review and the building permit process.

                       Exterior Noise Standards
                       In 1976, the State of California published guidelines for noise compatible land use
                       planning. Generally, exterior noise exposures fall into three categories: normally
                       acceptable, conditionally acceptable and unacceptable. Each land use has a particular
                       dBA range within each exterior noise exposure category. The following table summarizes
                       these guidelines.

                                    Normally Acceptable — Specified Land Use is satisfactory, based on the assumption
                                    that any buildings involved are of normal conventional construction, without any
                                    special insulation requirements.
                                    Conditionally Acceptable — Specified land use may be permitted only after detailed
                                    analysis of the noise reduction requirements and needed noise insulation features are
                                    included in the design.
                                    Unacceptable — New construction or development should generally not be
                                    undertaken because mitigation is usually not feasible to comply with noise element
                                    policies.

                       The state Noise Guidelines indicate that all residential land uses with exterior noise
                       levels of 60-75 dBA Ldn are “conditionally acceptable.” The City has applied this limit
                       in plans and projects with conditions of approval that attempt to achieve a 60 dBA Ldn
                       for backyards, large balconies and common recreation areas. These areas have a high
                       use rate and deserve a fairly quiet setting.

Achieving an outdoor Ldn of 60 dBA if the noise source is a railroad is generally more
difficult. Train noise is usually made up of relatively few loud events. Although the
outdoor Ldn may be high, the noise level between events is typically acceptable for
speech. An Ldn limit of 70 dBA is more appropriate for areas affected by train noise.
If the noise source is aircraft, the overhead noise is impractical to mitigate for outdoor
residential areas. Preventing residential uses within areas of high Ldn from aircraft is a
                                                                                             See San Jose International
way of avoiding noise exposure of homes from aircraft. However, only industrial areas
                                                                                             Airport’s website at

Historically, the City’s demand for housing has been great. Due to the lack of alternative
locations, most new residential projects are being developed near major roadways. These
environments are noisy, but they must comply with Title 24 (State of California Noise
Insulation Requirements) and are recommended to comply with state Noise Guidelines
for Land Use Planning (see Figure 6-5).
In addition to reviewing proposed development for compliance with noise standards,
all proposed development must be reviewed to see if it results in a “significant noise
impact” on existing development. To determine if a proposed noise increase is considered
“significant” under CEQA, the following standards should be used.

                       land uses with their noise environments, except where the City
                       determines that there are prevailing circumstances of a unique
                       or special nature. (Previously Noise Action 3.6A.1c)
                       Policy SN-8.6 Use Figure 6-6, “Significant Noise Impacts from new
                       Development on Existing Land Use” to determine if proposed
                       development results in a “significant noise impact” on existing
                       development. (Previously Noise Action Statement 3.6A.1d)

                       guidelines for Land Use Planning” for residential uses by
                       attempting to achieve an outdoor Ldn of no greater than 60 dBA
                       for common recreational areas, backyards, patios and medium
                       and large-size balconies. These guidelines should not apply where
                       the noise source is railroad or an airport. If the noise source
                       is a railroad, then an Ldn of no greater than 70 dBA should
                       be achieved in common areas, backyards, patios and medium
                       and large balconies. If the noise source is from aircraft, then
                       preventing new residential uses within areas of high Ldn from
                       aircraft noise is recommended. (Previously Noise Action Statement 3.6A.1f)

                       the outdoor Ldn is greater than 70 dBA as a result from train
                       noise. (Previously Noise Action Statement 3.6B.6c)

                       selected single-event noises (see the list of Implementation Plans in Appendix A). These

                       and noise levels produced by certain activities and powered equipment. While the

                       complaints in special circumstances (e.g. unusual schedules or sensitivities to certain

                       to resolve despite the intent and guidelines of the noise regulations.
                       Noise complaints that cannot be resolved through the application of code regulations
                       are primarily due to conditions existing prior to the adoption of the 1995 noise code
                       revisions, conditions that are not appropriate to regulate (children at child care centers) or

Major Roadways
Major roadways cause most of the transportation noise in Sunnyvale. Sunnyvale has an
interstate, three highways, two expressways and numerous arterial and collector streets
within or near its borders. Virtually all existing homes next to freeways and expressways
are protected by sound walls or depressed grades. Traffic noise is generally not an issue
for commercial, office and industrial uses.
The 1997 Noise Exposure Map, Figure 6-7, shows 1997 noise levels measured 50 ft. from
the edge of each major roadway. All major roadways in Sunnyvale have an Ldn of at least
60 dBA. Noise levels that range from 60 to 75 dBA Ldn are defined as “conditionally
acceptable” for residential uses (see Figure 6-4, State Noise Guidelines for Land Use
                                                                                           Refer to Figure 6-5, State

                       Moffett Federal Airfield (Moffett Field) is now operated by the National Aeronautics
                       and Space Administration (NASA). In 1995, approximately 24,000 annual aircraft flight
                       operations (a take-off and a landing are each considered to be one flight operation)
                       occurred at Moffett Field. Other noise sources at Moffett Field include wind tunnel
                       facilities and the Outdoor Aerodynamic Research Facility.
                       In 1976, when the Navy operated Moffett Field, the U.S. Department of Defense prepared
                       guidelines which identify suitable land uses in an area impacted by high noise and potential
                       accidents. These guidelines are part of an Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ)
                       study. Noise contours were updated in 1982. The AICUZ Map displays federal guidelines
                       for and uses near the Naval Air Station (NAS) at Moffett Field. Since the Navy no longer
                       operates Moffett and the number and character of flights are different, the AICUZ study
                       is considered an informational document.

                       Residents in northeast Sunnyvale are affected by San Jose Airport flight patterns. By
                       2010, they may hear twice as many aircraft as they did in 1995. However, noise levels
                       will eventually stabilize and decrease as quieter aircraft become prevalent. Current and
                       future noise levels are below state limits.

                                The Airport Land Use Commission has developed noise standards for heliports affecting
                                residential uses. Design and location criteria for any new private use heliports require
                                permits from the ALUC and affected cities.

Trains and Light Rail
Central Sunnyvale has a Caltrain heavy-rail corridor running east-west. The rail is used
by both commuter trains during the day and freight train operations. Unscheduled
freight operations can happen at any time, but typically occur at night. Sunnyvale also
has a light rail transit in the northern part of the City along Tasman and Java Drives.
Nearby surrounding uses are mobile home parks, multifamily residential uses and
industrial areas.
Train Noise
There are two main sources of train noise — engine noise and train horn noise. Train
horns blow at the Mary Avenue and Sunnyvale Avenue at-grade rail crossings and the
two local stations (Downtown Sunnyvale and Lawrence Station). In 1996, the areas
affected by train noise had an Ldn of 71-73 dBA at 50 ft. from the tracks (see Figure 6-7,
1997 Noise Exposure Map). Maximum noise events could reach 90 dBA (engines) and
105 dBA (horns).
These noise levels are acceptable for all but approximately 80 homes near the tracks
which experience “conditionally acceptable” noise levels. Some of these homes are
exposed to excessive outdoor noise (above 70 dBA Ldn) and probably excessive interior
noise as well (above 45 dBA Ldn). These noise levels are generally acceptable for non-
residential uses.
Freight train operations are not likely to expand. There are few major rail shippers left
on the railroad line and heavy industry on the Peninsula and in San Francisco is in
decline. Commuter passenger service is now the primary use of the railroad line.
Commuter train operations are likely to continue and expand. Plans to increase service
could increase the noise levels by a noticeable three dBA. Possible electrification of the
route could reduce existing Ldn by as much as eight dBA. Because of the uncertainty
of these plans these conditions are not noted on the Noise Condition map. Sunnyvale
has no jurisdiction over the number or noise level of trains, but actions can be taken to
monitor and mitigate future noise events.
                                                                                           6–41

                       Sunnyvale’s transportation center located near Evelyn Avenue and Murphy Street is a prime example of how

Light Rail Noise
Light rail noise is generally less than train noise. Noise and vibration studies completed
as part of an Environmental Impact Report/Statement for the construction of the Light
Rail Project indicated that barriers should be provided to guard against wheel squeal.
No excessive noise impacts are expected for residents in these areas.

 Water Supply
    GOAL EM-1
    ADEQUATE WATER SUPPLIES
    Acquire and manage water supplies so that existing and future
    reasonable demands for water, as projected in the 20-year forecast,
    are reliably met. (Previously Water Resources Goal A / Adopted in 2008)
The City has several sources of potable water to meet expected water demand. These
include local groundwater wells, imported supplies from the San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission (SFPUC) and Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD), plus
interagency connections with other local water suppliers for emergencies. Temporary
interruptions of water supply from one source can be readily offset by increasing supply
from the other available sources.
In order to further manage supplies, the City uses recycled water for nonpotable use and
water conservation efforts. Future challenges will include the possible expansion of the
recycled water system and new capital projects to address the aging water infrastructure.
During the last 10 years, on average, SFPUC and SCVWD have together supplied
approximately 90 percent of the total potable water used in the City. Of the remaining
10 percent, about six percent of the potable water demand has been supplied by seven
City-owned and operated wells. To offset potable water demand for landscape irrigation
and other non-potable uses, the remaining four percent has been supplied by recycled
water produced by the Sunnyvale Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP).

San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC)
SFPUC uses the Hetch-Hetchy Reservoir outside of Yosemite Valley as its primary water
source. Maximum and minimum usages of water are stipulated in the City’s current
individual contract with SFPUC. If the overall usage by all suburban retail customers
exceeds the maximum available level, the maximum amount of water available to
Sunnyvale would be reduced based on the master agreement that covers both the City
and other SFPUC wholesale customers. The City would then rely on one of its other
water supply sources (Santa Clara Valley Water, City Wells, Recycled Water) to meet the
demand.
Under the current contract and barring catastrophic events, the SFPUC believes it can
meet the demands of its retail and wholesale customers in years of average and above-
average precipitation.
Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD)
The current contract calls for Sunnyvale to submit proposed water delivery schedules to
SCVWD for three-year periods, indicating amounts of treated water desired by the City
during each of the three years. SCVWD can make reductions to the water requested by
Sunnyvale consistent with its ability to deliver water to all its customers.
To maintain water supply reliability and flexibility, SCVWD’s water supply is from a
variety of sources including local groundwater, imported water, local surface water, and
recycled water. The District has a program to optimize the use of groundwater and
surface water and prevent groundwater overdraft and land subsidence.                           7–5

From 1987 to 1992, California experienced a prolonged drought, with severe water
shortages and water rationing in Santa Clara County. Through the cooperative efforts
of water retailers and their customers, Santa Clara County endured the drought with
minimal economic and aesthetic impacts. Between 1984 and 1993, the City experienced
a decrease in water consumption, primarily due to water conservation in the residential,
commercial, and industrial sectors. Some of the demand management practices that                              7–9
were used to maximize the availability of water supply during the drought, such as

    GOAL EM-3
    RELIABLE AND SAFE WATER DISTRIBUTION
    Proactively maintain the water distribution system infrastructure
    to ensure the reliable and safe delivery of water under normal and
    emergency conditions to both current and future customers. (Previously
    Water Resources Goal C / Adopted in 2008)
The City owns, operates, and maintains a water supply and distribution system that
includes connections with City suppliers and neighboring water utilities. Although not
obvious, ground elevations in Sunnyvale vary from sea level at the north end of the City
to 300 feet above sea level at the southwest corner. Because of this elevation difference,
the water system is broken up into a series of three pressure zones (Figure 7-1, Water
System Facilities).
Within the City’s service area, some pocketed areas adjacent to Fremont Avenue and
Sunnyvale-Saratoga Road receive water from Cal Water. These areas were formerly
part of the county, but have been annexed by Sunnyvale. Cal Water produces water
from its own wells, which meets all federal and state quality requirements. The City has
provided six emergency connections to Cal Water service areas to improve fire flows
and reliability, and all fire hydrants have been replaced to conform to City standards.
Perhaps the largest water system issue for the City is the need for significant and on-going
investment in improvements to the water system infrastructure. A significant portion of
the City’s investment in water system infrastructure is represented by the transmission
and distribution pipelines. Approximately 80 percent of the 330 miles of transmission
and distribution pipelines and related facilities were constructed in the 1960s and are      7–11

The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) requires the City to distribute to
all customers an Annual Water Quality Report. This report provides information on
contaminants that may be present in the three source waters and in the distribution
system. Testing has consistently shown that the water provided by the City meets
established water quality standards.
The SFPUC completed construction of its new, system-wide fluoridation facility in 2005.
Beginning in November 2005, all water delivered from the SFPUC was fluoridated.
SCVWD does not currently fluoridate its water, though it is currently studying the
feasibility of doing so. The City does not fluoridate its well water. As a result, some areas
of Sunnyvale receive fluoridated water (the northern part of the City approximately
north of El Camino Real), other areas receive non-fluoridated water (southern portion),
and some areas receive a mixture. City staff manages the water system to provide
consistent concentrations of fluoride by keeping the SFPUC and SCVWD service areas
separated as much a possible.
The SDWA regulations have continued to evolve as more monitoring data have been
collected by water systems, monitoring and detection capabilities have improved, and
new constituents of concern have been identified. City staff continues to closely track
new and proposed regulations and update monitoring and analyses accordingly.

Water Collection System
Sunnyvale’s wastewater collection system has the capacity to convey all sewage and
industrial wastes generated when the City is fully developed in accordance with the land
use projections (approximately 55.7 million gallons per day). Five major trunk networks
terminate at the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP), referred to as the Lawrence,
Borregas, Lockheed, Moffett and Cannery trunks. Figure 7-7 is a map showing drainage
area boundaries for the areas served by the five collection networks. Capacities of
individual networks are:

Based on growth projections in 2001, it is not anticipated that flows will exceed the
capacity of the overall collection system. Specific locations within the collection system
may require additional capacity in the future.

services tend to allow some groundwater or rainwater to enter the system. This
process is called infiltration. A certain amount of rainwater may also find its way into
the wastewater system as inflow. Inflow can result from direct connections of storm
drains or downspouts to the wastewater system, either in the right-of-way or on private
property. Components of the system itself, such as piping, manholes, pumps, etc., will
also require replacement as they exhaust their life expectancy.
Infiltration and inflow can interfere with the needed capacity of sanitary sewers and
the WPCP. Though virtually impossible to eliminate altogether, maintenance crews use
closed circuit video inspection to monitor for bad joints and/or broken pipes which allow
infiltration. Private industry is also inspected for illegal storm drain cross-connections
to ensure that the quantity of rainfall that flows to the WPCP is kept under control.
If infiltration and inflow are allowed to continue unmitigated, additional wastewater
flows could overwhelm treatment plant capacity and result in increased treatment costs.

                                Cupertino, and Moffett Federal Airfield. The WPCP is designed to treat an average of
                                29.5 million gallons of wastewater per day and a peak flow of 40 million gallons per day.
                                From 2004 to 2007, the average dry weather effluent flow was 14.2 MGD, well within the

                               Regulatory Compliance Activities
                               The WPCP operates under the requirements set for by the Global Warming Solutions
                               Act of 2006, Assembly Bill 32 or AB 32. AB 32 is a California State Law that fights
                               climate change by establishing a comprehensive program to reduce greenhouse gas
                               emissions from all sources throughout the state. AB 32 requires the California Air
                               Resources Board (CARB) to develop regulations and market mechanisms to reduce
                               California’s greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, representing a 25 percent
                               reduction statewide, with mandatory caps beginning in 2012 for significant emissions
                               sources. For the Plant, it sets in motion a series of mandatory reporting, and equipment
                               maintenance requirements that are additional to the “normal” function of maintaining
                               plant effluent compliance.
                               Future Water Pollution Control Plant Improvements
                               Plant capacity appears sufficient based on use in 2001 and the updated projections. The
                               Environmental Protection Agency requires that when flows reach 75 percent of design
                               capacity, agencies begin to evaluate future needs and develop plans for expansion,
                               if appropriate. Based on 2001 figures, it is not anticipated that this milestone will be
                               reached in Sunnyvale and it will not be necessary to evaluate ways to provide additional
                               capacity at the WPCP during the next five to ten years. Projections indicate that
                               flows may not continue to increase significantly between 2001 and 2020. This overall
                               projection is attributed to changes in land use, changes in water consumption patterns,
                               and the overall reduced rate of growth.
                               Portions of the WPCP were first constructed in 1954 and are now nearly 50 years old. In
                               addition, the nature of wastewater treatment itself presents an adverse environment for
                               facilities and equipment. In order to maintain this infrastructure and ensure the ongoing
                               ability to meet effluent and recycled water quality requirements, it is necessary to have in
                               place a strategy for the ongoing refurbishment and replacement of components of the plant.
                               An asset condition assessment conducted in 2005 identified several critical plant
                               structures as at-risk, and in need of rehabilitation soon. In 2007, a Capital Project
                               Strategic Infrastructure Plan (SIP) was put in place to set future direction of plant
                               process enhancements and physical improvements. Following completion of this effort,
                          7–18 SIP implementation is expected to continue for ten to fifteen years for construction of
                               new and/or rehabilitated plant facilities.

     REDUCED RUNOFF AND POLLUTANT DISCHARGE
     Minimize the quantity of runoff and discharge of pollutants to the
     maximum extent practicable by integrating surface runoff controls
     into new development and redevelopment land use decisions. (Previously

Urban runoff consists of stormwater runoff from rainfall as well as non-stormwater
runoff from human activities (e.g. over-irrigation of landscapes, vehicle washing,
discharges from pools, spas, or water features, etc.). Urban runoff is collected and
transported through the city’s storm drain system and ultimately discharged to local
waterways. Managing urban runoff minimizes the discharge of pollutants to creeks,          Impervious Surfaces:

and carries it through impervious pipes, suspended pollutants are concentrated in the
rapidly flowing runoff. When the system reaches its outfall, large volumes of polluted
water can be emptied, untreated, into a natural water body and the large volume can
further erode our natural waterways.
The City, as part of the region, is transitioning from the conveyance approach to a newer
infiltration approach often referred to as Low Impact Development (LID). This system
seeks to “preserve and restore the hydrologic cycle.” An infiltration stormwater system
seeks to infiltrate runoff into the soil by allowing its to flow slowly over permeable
surfaces. These permeable surfaces can double as recreational and landscape areas
during dry weather. Because the infiltration network allows much of the runoff to return
to the soil, overall runoff volume is reduced, and more water is available to replenish
groundwater and maintain stream base flows. Storm drain systems are designed to
transport urban runoff to the San Francisco Bay or nearby creeks or channels. Adequate

                                 City of Sunnyvale owns and operates approximately 150 miles of storm drains, with two
                                 pump stations that collect runoff from low-lying urban areas and discharge to creeks
                                 and sloughs which are at a higher elevation (see Figure 7-8: Storm Drain System).
                                 To address both the quantity and quality of urban runoff, the City has undertaken a
                                 series of programs to both reduce and treat runoff. These programs and actions are
                                 collectively described as Urban Runoff Best Management Practices (BMPs). Urban
                                 Runoff BMPs are continually changing based on recent studies, practical experience

                                 There are a variety of laws and permit requirements regulating the quantity and quality

perform periodic updating of the goals and policies associated with urban runoff, the
Urban Runoff Management Plan, and sections of the Sunnyvale Municipal Code to
address these changes, update data and emerging trends, as well as measure success
toward completing urban runoff goals. Annual reports will continue to be made to
the Regional Board to demonstrate compliance with NPDES permit provisions and
document the City’s progress toward meeting the establish goals and policies through
the implementation of action statements.
In addition, the storm drain systems will continue to be monitored and maintained to
ensure the adequate collection and transfer of urban runoff.

                       Air Quality
                       GOAL EM-11
                       IMPROVED AIR QUALITY
                       Improve Sunnyvale’s air quality and reduce the exposure of its citizens
                       to air pollutants. (Previously Air Quality Goal A / Adopted in 1993)
                       All major urban areas in California, including Sunnyvale, experience some degree of
                       reduced air quality. The combination of climatic conditions and a multitude of air
                       pollutant sources (particularly the automobile) results in reduced air quality, which
                       can be considered as reducing the quality of life by adversely affecting human health,
                       causing damage to plants or crops, and other effects such as soiling, visibility reduction
                       and accelerated corrosion of materials.
                       One of the major reasons that air quality continues to be a problem in the Bay Area
                       specifically and California in general, is a relatively high rate of population and economic
                       growth. The major obstacle to improved air quality in the future is increasing population
                       and vehicle use and deteriorating operating conditions on highways and roads.
                       The major air quality problems in the Bay Area are ozone, carbon monoxide, and PM-10.
                       Ozone and carbon monoxide are primarily released in the air from combustion sources
                       such as automobiles and factories. PM-10 (otherwise known as suspended particulate
                       matter) is a collection of particles of dust, soot, aerosols and other matter which are small
                       enough to remain suspended in the air for a long period of time. Man-made sources of
                       PM-10 include automobile exhausts and road travel, smoke, and factory emissions.
                       To combat this, the most efficient and cost-effective technological or “hardware”
                       controls have already been implemented. Remaining technological controls, which
                       are increasingly expensive, have been found to be unable to reduce emissions to the
                       point where all air quality standards (glossary in the margin) would be met. Therefore,
                       attention has been focused in recent years on the relationship of land use, community
                       design and transportation as a means of reducing air pollutant generation. For further
                       information on air quality measurements and modeling, see Appendix H, Air Quality
                       Technical Report.
                       Cooperation with Regional Agencies
                       Past efforts by federal, state and local governments have resulted in steady, gradual
                       improvement in air quality in Sunnyvale and the greater Bay Area. Sunnyvale is within
                       the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD). The City of Sunnyvale
                       has implemented a number of programs and projects that directly or indirectly reduce
                       air pollutant emissions. Most of these programs are part of a larger regional effort to
                       improve air quality. These projects include:

impact on public health. There are 71 sources of TACs within Sunnyvale. The majority
of these sources are microelectronic industries, dry cleaners and auto repair businesses.

In 1993, the Sunnyvale Futures Study examined the effects of revising the General

                       GOAL EM-12
                       SAFE AND HEALTHY SOLID WASTE COLLECTION
                       Ensure that municipal solid waste is collected and transported in a safe
                       and healthy manner. (Previously Solid Waste Goal 3.2A / Adopted in 1993)
                       GOAL EM-13
                       CLEAN NEIGHBORHOODS
                       Encourage residents to maintain clean neighborhoods by preventing
                       unsightly accumulations of discarded materials and illegal dumping of
                       municipal solid waste. (Previously Solid Waste Goal 3.2B / Adopted in 1996)
                       Solid waste consists of virtually all of the materials discarded by residents and
                       businesses in the course of daily life, business activities and manufacturing. It does not
                       include hazardous wastes, radioactive wastes, medical waste, sewage or liquids. Because
                       accumulations of solid waste can present public health problems, the Sunnyvale
                       Municipal Code requires all occupied residence and business premises to subscribe to
                       regular collection services. According to a 2010 study performed for the City by Cascadia
                       Consulting Group, single-family residents generate approximately 34 percent of the
                       solid waste collected, multi-family residents account for 22 percent, and the remaining
                       44 percent comes from businesses, government agencies, schools and other institutions
                       and construction and demolition projects.
                       Collection of solid waste in Sunnyvale is performed by a private company under contract
                       with the City. The contract takes the form of a franchise agreement that is “exclusive,”
                       that is, no other company is allowed to collect solid waste. Exclusivity minimizes the
                       community and environmental impacts of refuse collection by limiting the number
                       of trucks used for collection. It reduces pavement damage, noise and air pollution
                       from heavy collection trucks compared to an open market approach where multiple
                       companies may serve homes and businesses located near each other. The Sunnyvale
                       franchise agreement also gives the City the ability to enforce community standards for
                       service quality, collection hours, truck and container colors and cleanliness, graffiti
                       removal, use of clean air fuels, etc.
                       The City periodically provides special disposal programs at discounted or no cost. These
                       programs are designed to discourage illegal dumping of solid waste and to minimize
                  7–32 accumulations of discarded material in the community. These programs include:

n	 Spring/Fall Extra Dump Weekends —On four weekends per year (two each for
   spring and fall), Sunnyvale residents can dispose of extra solid waste at the City-
   owned Sunnyvale Materials Recovery and Transfer (SMaRT Station®), 301 Carl Road,
   at no charge. “Extra Dump” Weekends are for residents only, and not for businesses,
   contractors, non-resident property owners or other commercial establishments. The
   SMaRT Station permit allows over 1,000 vehicle trips per day on Extra Dump event
   days.
n	 On-Call Collection — Service to residents of single-family homes includes as many
   as two on-call collections per calendar year. Residents may schedule these pickups
   on any of their regular collection days and may set out two cubic yards of extra solid
   waste and two “bulky” items, such as a couch, refrigerator, or other appliance.
n	 Neighborhood Cleanups — Working with recognized neighborhood associations,
   the City offers a number of neighborhood cleanup events. During these events,
   typically held on a weekend, the City arranges for delivery of “roll-off” debris boxes
   to pre-selected locations. The boxes are emptied and returned throughout the event.
   These events provide a convenient disposal option for residents who cannot or do
   not utilize other special disposal options.

                       GOAL EM-14
                       RECYCLING AND SOURCE REDUCTION PROGRAMS
                       Reduce solid waste through recycling, source reduction, education
                       and special programs. (Previously Solid Waste Goal 3.2B/Adopted in 1996)
                       Sunnyvale has long been a leader in recycling and in 1982 was one of the first cities in
                       the Bay Area to begin collecting residential recyclables at curbside. In 1990, Sunnyvale
                       became the first city in the state to adopt the Source Reduction and Recycling Element
                       required by the Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939). In 1994 the SMaRT
                       Station materials recovery facility (MRF) began sorting recyclables from solid waste
                       and remains one of the most sophisticated municipal MRFs in the nation.
                       These and other programs and facilities are reflected in Sunnyvale’s state-calculated
                       diversion rate, which has increased from 18 percent in 1990 to 65 percent in 2009. In 2009
                       the state Disposal Reporting System coordinated by CalRecycle documented disposal of
                       88,442 tons originating in Sunnyvale. This marks a 60 percent disposal reduction since
                       1982, when the City disposed of 222,000 tons, even though the City has seen substantial
                       growth in population and business activity over that 27-year period. Milestone dates of
                       major components of the City’s diversion effort include:
                       n	Curbside    recycling for single-family residences (1982)
                       n	 Concrete Recycling lease at Sunnyvale Landfill (1985)
                       n	Household     Hazardous Waste drop-off events (1985)

                       Zero Waste Strategic Plan
                       In 2009, the City Council adopted a Zero Waste Policy that broadly describes a vision
                       for even greater diversion efforts. The first step in implementing the Zero Waste Policy
                       was a 2010 study detailing the composition of Sunnyvale’s generated and disposed
                       waste (the latter consisting of the unrecycled residue following materials recovery at the
                       SMaRT Station).
                  7–34

	En v ironmental M anagement — SOLID WASTE	                                                       CHAPTER 7
As of 2011, the City had contracted with a consultant to create a Zero Waste Strategic
Plan that will define just what “Zero Waste” is and will identify program and facility
options for achieving Zero Waste. Potential actions will be both “upstream,” as in
placing controls on problematic materials that become waste and “downstream,” as in
technologies such as composting and anaerobic digestion with the potential to extract
additional value from SMaRT Station residues that are currently disposed.
Many components of solid waste have economic value when they are separated,
handled, packaged or offered for collection in a manner different from solid waste.
Other components have been designated by state or federal regulations as hazardous
waste that may not be disposed in a landfill. Over the past 30 years, this trend has
led to an increasingly fragmented waste stream, with equally fragmented systems for
collecting, handling and disposing or recycling individual waste stream components.
This increased regulation and special handling has provided benefits to the environment
by minimizing damaging discharges to air, water and land. It has also increased the
efficiency of the economy as a whole, by extracting value from products previously
disposed. But, while those who manufacture, distribute and retail products profit from
their sale, the “end of life” costs associated with achieving these environmental and
societal benefits are borne primarily by local agencies, such as the City, and ultimately
paid for by local rate payers and taxpayers. This imbalanced approach provides a
misleading message to consumers by understating the true cost of their individual
purchases, while increasing the refuse disposal bills of the community, regardless of the
individual rate payer’s level of consumption.
Product Stewardship
One way to restore an appropriate balance of responsibility is the concept of Product
Stewardship, an approach that holds producers liable for the costs of responsibly
managing their products at end of life. Extending producer responsibility for products
from “cradle to cradle” acknowledges that producers have the greatest control over
product design and therefore have the greatest ability and responsibility to reduce toxicity
and waste. The City of Sunnyvale has a history of supporting product stewardship – on
April 16, 2002, Council directed that the City become a member of the national Product
Stewardship Institute and passed a product stewardship resolution.
Product Stewardship is more effective at the state and national levels than it is locally,
given the flows of people and products throughout the region. Successful examples
in California include 2010 legislation that will put the paint industry in charge of
collecting waste paint and the carpet industry in charge of recovering and recycling
used carpeting. The cost of the stewardship system will be built into the cost paid by
consumers of paint and carpet.
                                                                                             7–35

                       Household Hazardous Wastes
                       By law, hazardous wastes are not to be collected or disposed along with municipal solid
                       waste. Disposal of hazardous wastes generated by businesses is regulated by state and
                       federal laws that require documentation of shipments, including their receipt at the
                       hazardous waste disposal site.
                       Hazardous waste generated by residential use is termed, “Household Hazardous Waste,”
                       or HHW. Common HHW items include paint, pesticides, lawn care products, home
                       maintenance and cleaning products and automotive products. It is illegal to dispose of
                       HHW with ordinary garbage.
                       One way to reduce the amount of HHW that is improperly disposed is to provide
                       residents with legal opportunities for disposal of HHW. To this end, the City provides
                       HHW drop off events by way of the Countywide HHW Program, with a portion of
                       the program funding coming from a per-ton fee charged by Santa Clara County on
                       disposed solid waste. The remaining cost is paid by the Solid Waste Program from
                       garbage collection rate revenues.
                       The City leases to the Countywide HHW Program an event site at 164 Carl Road. As
                       of 2011, this is one of three fixed locations at which the Program holds regular events,
                       eleven a year at the Sunnyvale site. The other locations are in San Martin and in San
                       Jose. Sunnyvale residents are eligible to use events at the three fixed sites or any of the
                       temporary locations used by the Program. Sunnyvale resident participation, measured
                       by the number of vehicles dropping off HHW, equals 7-8 percent of the number of
                       single-family homes in Sunnyvale.
                       Encouraging resident use of HHW events is not necessarily the best or most cost-
                       effective way to decrease improper disposal of HHW. HHW disposal is costly (about
                       $60 per vehicle on average, in 2010) and unbridled use of HHW events could cause
                       serious cost increases for the Solid Waste Fund and higher rates for Sunnyvale residents
                       and businesses.
                       As a result, the City encourages reduced generation of HHW and an Extended Producer
                       Responsibility (EPR) approach to handling discarded HHW. Residents are encouraged
                       to reduce generation by:
                       n	  Using non-toxic alternatives
                       n	  Using up products that would become HHW if discarded
                       n	  Sharing products with neighbors and friends
                       As described above, an EPR approach to items that will become HHW when discarded
                       places more responsibility for end-of-life management with the businesses that
                       manufacture, distribute and sell hazardous materials to consumers. EPR has the
                       potential to reduce the City’s cost of managing HHW material. Materials that adversely
                       affect public health and the environment if improperly disposed and that could be
                       better managed with an EPR approach include pharmaceuticals, sharps (needles and
                       lancets) and household batteries.

     ENVIRONMENTALLY-SOUND DISPOSAL
     Dispose of solid waste in an environmentally sound, dependable and
     cost-effective manner. (Previously Solid Waste Goal 3.2D / Adopted in 1996)
From the City’s perspective, the environmental impacts, costs and legal liabilities
of solid waste disposal link together the past, the future and the present. The past is
important because the City and individual waste generators located in Sunnyvale retain
liability for environmental issues related to waste previously disposed, regardless of the 7–37

Cit y of Sunn y vale 	 gener al Pl an – July 2 011
                       location. This calls for responsible management of the closed Sunnyvale Landfill, which
                       served the community’s waste disposal needs from the 1920s to 1993. The future is
                       important because it will someday become the past. That is to say, the City’s choices of
                       disposal method and location for the waste of the future will someday create liability
                       for actions taken or not taken with regard to that waste. In the present, the City expends
                       money based on past waste disposal decisions and plans its future disposal methods and
                       locations.
                       The City’s choice of disposal method and site is of great importance to the City itself and
                       to waste generators located in Sunnyvale due to the liability associated with disposal.
                       Waste placed in a landfill doesn’t go “away” and, under certain circumstances, future
                       environmental cleanup costs at a disposal site may create financial liability for the City.
                       In decades past the City has, in fact, been assessed liability for small percentages of the
                       cleanup cost at two hazardous waste landfills and a waste oil recycling facility. Although
                       the dollar amounts in these cases were relatively small, the experience is instructive.
                       Closed Sunnyvale Landfill
                       The Sunnyvale Landfill stopped accepting refuse on September 30, 1993. Final cover
                       placement in compliance with state regulations was completed in 1994. Approximately
                       93 of the landfill’s 100 acres contain waste. An area of about 7 acres is developed for
                       post-closure use as a biosolids monofill disposal site. It is designed to accept biosolids
                       from the WPCP when market conditions or the characteristics of the biosolids make it
                       difficult or expensive to take them elsewhere.
                       The closed landfill represents one of the largest areas of open space in Sunnyvale. It
                       is especially valued for recreation because portions are adjacent to the Bay Trail. The
                       walking trails and landfill maintenance roads on the South and West Hills are heavily
                       used for lunch time recreation by employees of companies located in the nearby Moffett
                       Park industrial area. Walking, biking, bird watching and the scenic views from the top
                       of the West Hill are especially popular with the public.
                       Since closure, the landfill has developed increasing biological diversity. Many mammal,
                       reptile and bird species are observed. Most notable is the Western Burrowing Owl
                       (Athene cunicularia hypugaea), a “species of special concern.” Burrowing owls nest in
                       old ground squirrel burrows on the landfill surface and are observed seasonally, often
                       at up to four sites. The City manages the landfill surface around these owl sites so as to
                       enhance its value as habitat for the owls (for example, grass is mowed short to enhance
                       visibility of prey and predators). Landfill maintenance activities are scheduled to avoid
                       active burrows and to avoid choice nesting sites in the breeding season. Additionally,
                       leash laws are actively enforced as the presence of loose dogs discourages use of the
                       landfill as owl habitat.

Asphalt and Concrete Recycling Facility
Since 1985, the City has leased space at or near the landfill to a private company that
recycles concrete and asphalt. The source of the raw material is typically pavement
material generated by roadway and sidewalk repairs or demolition of concrete structures.
Because the facility accepts material that would be otherwise disposed of in a landfill,
it is an important component of the City’s compliance with the 50 percent diversion
mandate contained in the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB
939). The City’s lease requires the operator to report the jurisdiction of origin of the
raw materials, and that information is available to the City and other jurisdictions for
preparing AB 939 compliance reports.

Kirby Canyon Landfill
Waste is disposed at Kirby Canyon under a 1991 disposal agreement between the City
and Waste Management of California, a private company that operates Kirby Canyon,
leasing the site from Castle & Cook. The term of the disposal agreement ends in 2021.
The agreement requires that the City deliver to the SMaRT Station all municipal solid
waste collected by its franchised hauler. It then requires that all municipal solid waste
that is not segregated at the SMaRT Station for recycling be delivered to Kirby Canyon
for disposal. Although the agreement was drawn up contemplating disposal at Kirby
Canyon, it does contain provisions for Waste Management to direct the City’s waste
elsewhere under specified conditions.
In 1991 Sunnyvale, Mountain View and Palo Alto selected the Kirby Canyon Landfill,
operated by Waste Management of California and located in south San Jose, as their site
for long term garbage disposal. These three “SMaRT Station” cities, combined, are the
largest single customer at Kirby Canyon. Identifiable contributors of the waste, such as
large industrial generators located in Sunnyvale, can also be named directly in cleanup
actions. As a result, these generators tend to share the City’s concern about the integrity
of disposal sites. The cities cooperated in the construction and now the operation of the
SMaRT Station pursuant to the 1992 Second Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
The MOU spells out each city’s operational and financial obligations and benefits with
regard to the facility. It places Sunnyvale at the center of the relationship as owner and
operator of the SMaRT Station.
                                                                                            7–39

Cit y of Sunn y vale 	 gener al Pl an – July 2 011
                       The agreement with Waste Management allows the landfill operator to increase City
                       costs due to regulatory changes. Depending on the type of regulation, these cost increases
                       could apply to incoming solid waste as well as “in place” solid waste disposed in prior
                       years. Reducing the amount of solid waste for which the City is responsible in landfills
                       in the future may be the most cost-effective way to manage the cost of complying with
                       future environmental regulations.
                       The City’s decision to enter into a long-term disposal contract with Waste Management
                       was driven in part by the technical qualifications of that company, its proactive
                       approach to regulatory compliance and its practice of keeping up with rapidly changing
                       requirements and standards for landfill construction, operation and monitoring. City
                       staff conducts an annual review and assessment of regulatory documents for Kirby
                       Canyon to verify that the site continues to be operated in a way that minimizes future
                       City liabilities. Future city decisions and policies that affect where Sunnyvale wastes
                       (hazardous and non-hazardous alike) are disposed should likewise consider not just the
                       immediate cost of disposal, but also the potential for long-term environmental cleanup
                       liabilities.
                       Planning For Future Disposal
                       The fact that Sunnyvale has landfill disposal capacity under contract until 2021
                       should not lead to complacency. There were 16 years between the designation of the
                       SMaRT Station site as suitable for a transfer station and the date the facility was ready
                       for operation. It should be assumed that acquiring new disposal capacity will take a
                       minimum of five years—possibly longer if coordination with other cities is required.
                       Thus, the City should begin the process of arranging for post-2021 disposal no later
                       than 2016. The time prior to 2016 should be used to determine a Zero Waste Strategic
                       Plan and investigate potential technologies, partnerships and funding issues, all of
                       which will affect the amount and type of disposal capacity required post-2021.
                       As 2021 approaches, the City should begin developing its strategy for future transfer and
                       disposal methods, locations and partnerships. This process must be well under way no
                       later than 2016, five years prior to the expiration of the current disposal agreement in
                       order to assure an orderly transition to post-2021 disposal options consistent with the
                       Zero Waste Strategic Plan.

*Based on 2005 U.S. Census data showing the City of Sunnyvale Population is 131,700
From 1992 to 2006, City-owned open space acreage increased by 2.6 acres with Plaza
del Sol and Victory Village Park. Through agreements, the City has made an additional
eight acres available to the public at Braly and Ponderosa schools; opened 3.45 miles of
the Bay Trail to public use; finished improving the John W. Christian Greenbelt; and
built a 50-meter swimming pool in partnership with the Fremont Union High School
District. Major physical improvements since the early 1990s also include a new 23,000
square foot Senior Center, three new tennis courts and a snack bar at the Tennis Center;
a skate park at Fair Oaks Park; a boardwalk at Baylands Park; and the relocation of a
1918 redwood barn (Bianchi Barn) from San Jose to Orchard Heritage Park.
It is generally accepted that parks best serve those living immediately adjacent to them,
although today’s population is highly mobile and will readily use parks throughout
the City as well as in neighboring cities and not be limited to parks within walking
distance. The City has identified neighborhood planning areas to describe this concept.
Neighborhood planning areas are generally bounded by traffic arterials, are served with
an elementary school or park within walking distance, and have neighborhood shopping
facilities within a half-mile radius. Within the City there are nine neighborhood planning
areas that are used by the City as a means to describe and evaluate the City’s physical
organization and distribution of parks (see Figure 3-5 for neighborhood planning area
boundaries.)
For the purposes of identifying areas which are relatively underserved by open space, a
neighborhood approach was taken, looking at which households were within specified
distances from City open space sites. Parks of three acres or less in size were considered
to primarily serve those living with a quarter mile radius of the park. For larger parks, a
half mile radius was used, because the larger parks generally include more amenities and
can serve more people. For school open space, which represents athletic fields without
amenities such as restrooms or playgrounds, a quarter mile radius was used.
Once the half-mile and quarter-mile buffers are drawn around each open space site, it is
possible to see which pockets of the City are not within these designated service areas. Figure
3-4 depicts all park sites with their accompanying buffers, or service areas. An Open Space
Initiative was suggested to evaluate areas as being currently underserved by open space and       3–33
determine measures to be taken to mitigate the impact of these service gaps.

	L and Use and Tr ansportation — Open space	                                                     CHAPTER 3
In 1990, the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) developed standards or
guidelines which recommended 4-6 acres of open space per 1000 population. Although it
would be helpful to have a standard for the amount and kind of open space appropriate
for the Sunnyvale community, the NRPA has since acknowledged the difficulty in setting
standards that would be applicable to all communities, given each community’s unique
characteristics. The 1990 NRPA standard is, however, still widely used as a starting point
of discussion. At 5.7 acres per 1000, Sunnyvale falls well within that guideline.
The public has expressed interest in increasing most park services, programs, resources
and facilities, with the most emphasis on additional open space or enhancement of
existing facilities. Much of the stated demand is for sports/athletic fields; however,
there is a general sense that additional open space is increasingly important as the City’s
population increases.
Sunnyvale is experiencing a number of trends related to open space:
n	  Requiring residential developments to include buildings for community gatherings/
    meetings.
n	  Businesses are increasingly using open space during the work day for the benefit of
    their employees, resulting in a large increase in the use of picnic sites and athletic
    fields near large businesses. The daytime population for Sunnyvale was estimated at
    149,923 in 2000 by the US Census Bureau, almost 20,000 more than the nighttime
    population. Staff has noted the phenomenon particularly in the northern part of the
    City. Encinal Park, Lakewood Park, Sunnyvale Baylands Parks and Fair Oaks Park
    each get heavy use during the day from nearby day-time only residents.
n	  New residential development is planned in several locations throughout City. Figures
    3-4 and 3-5 show areas where increased residential growth can be expected. Seven
    areas are noted in the table below, along with estimates of the magnitude for which
    growth is being planned. Evelyn/Wolfe, Lakeside Specific Plan, and Tasman/Morse
    areas are also identified as being underserved by open space (see Figure 3-6, Projected
    Residential Growth). The underserved nature of these areas can be exacerbated by
    the planned residential growth.

In 2006, the City developed Key Initiatives to respond to demands for increased open
space and the areas identified as having “service gaps” and being underserved by current
open space offerings. These Key Initiatives were further evaluated in the Parks of the
Future Study, which was completed in 2009. The 2006 Key Initiatives and the 2009
Parks of the Future study recommendations are described as follows:
n	  Key Initiative #1 — Evaluate how well the following City-owned sites meet the
    open space and recreation priorities and determine which should be pursued for
    development as public open space;
    •	 Murphy Parksite Housing on Jackson Avenue  
    •	 Orchard Gardens Parksite Housing on Garner Avenue
    •	 Fair Oaks Industrial Complex
    In 2009, the City Council directed staff to sell the Orchard Gardens and Murphy Park
    park-site housing at a future time when the market improves and use the proceeds
    from the sale of the properties to fund other park and open space priorities. The Fair
    Oaks Industrial Complex, also known as the Morse Avenue park site, was identified
    as high priority for development as a Neighborhood Park. (In 2010 the planning and
    design for Morse Avenue Park was started, with an expect completion date in 2013.)
                                                                                           3–37

                          space and determine measures to be taken to mitigate the impact of these service gaps.
                          In 2009, the City Council adopted as priorities for acquisition and development of
                          new open space the following areas:
                          •	 Morse/Tasman (includes ITR 7 & 8)
                          •	 East Evelyn (includes ITR 4)
                          •	 Acalanes/Iowa (Between western border of Sunnyvale and Mary Avenue,
                             between El Camino and Evelyn)
                          •	 Downtown
                          •	 Community Center area
                          •	 East Sunnyvale ITR
                          The Council also directed staff to:
                          •	 Actively identify land for acquisition and development, with particular
                             emphasis on areas identified as priorities for new open space
                          •	 Revisit the City/School Use Agreements and look for opportunities to
                             expand and/or redefine the existing partnerships to best meet the City’s
                             needs.[This effort was underway in 2010 and will be on-going.]
                          •	 Work together to develop a long-term plan for the recreational use of the
                             West Hill, Recycle Hill and South Hill portions of the Sunnyvale Landfill.
                          •	 Explore the potential for new off-street trails and coordination of on-street
                             bike connections.

                          expire in 2011 and the notice of intent was required by December 2008).
                          In December 2009 this agreement was renewed for an additional 25 years. It now
                          expires in 2036.
                       n	 Key Initiative #4 — Evaluate how the Raynor Activity Center meets open space and
                          recreation priorities and determine what should be done with the site (e.g. keep for
                          use as recreation facility; tear down and use for civic, non-recreation use; sell).
                          In June 2010, City Council declared that the Raynor Activity Center was no longer
                          needed for public purposes and available for long-term lease. The City anticipates
                          making a determination on the future use of the Raynor Activity Center in 2011.
                       n	 Key Initiative #5 - Consider revisions to Sunnyvale Municipal Code (e.g. evaluate
                          whether to include commercial development in park dedication or mitigation;
                          consider changes to the open space acreage dedication amount.)

  In 2009, the City Council adopted as a target to maintain an open space level of
  service of 5.34 acres per 1,000 residents. Council also directed staff to prepare an
  amendment to Sunnyvale Municipal Code Chapter 18.10 and Chapter 19.74 relating
  to park dedication and in-lieu fees to change the facility standard to 3.0 acres per
  1,000 population from its current standard of 1.25 acres per 1,000 population, in
  accordance with Fee Mitigation Act Requirements. This was completed on November
  24, 2009 when Council raised the park facility standard from 1.25 acres per 1,000
  residents to 3.0 acres per 1,000 residents over a three year period. In addition, the
  Council directed staff to further explore the feasibility of establishing expanded or
  modified Development Impact Fees under the Mitigation Fee Act.
Policies supporting Goal LT-8 (Adequate and Balanced Open Space)
       Policy LT-8.1 Follow management and preventive maintenance
       strategies to extend the usable life of open spaces and
       recreation facilities, such as planning for and implementing
       “non-use times” for open space and facilities in order to assure
       adequate maintenance and regeneration time. (Previously Open
       Space and Recreation Policy 2.2.A.1)
       Policy LT-8.2 Adopt management, maintenance and development
       practices that minimize negative impacts to the natural
       environment, such as supporting and enforcing the Integrated
       Pest Management System; and landscaping in ways which minimize
       the need for water. (Previously Open Space and Recreation Policy 2.2.A.2)
       Policy LT-8.3 Pursue the acquisition of appropriate federal lands
       currently located at the former Moffett Naval Air Station.

                       inventory through the replacement of trees with an equal or
                       greater number of trees when trees are removed due to disease,
                       park development or other reasons. (Previously Open Space and
                       Recreation Policy 2.2.A.4)
                       Policy LT-8.5 Maintain park and open space tree inventory on
                       a system wide basis rather than a site-by-site basis with an
                       understanding that there is no single optimum number of trees
                       for a particular site. (Previously Open Space and Recreation Policy 2.2.A.5)
                       Policy LT-8.6 Maintain a working fruit orchard throughout
                       the largest portion of Orchard Heritage Park for as long as
                       practical. (Previously Open Space and Recreation Policy 2.2.A.6)
                       Policy LT-8.7 Conduct a cost/benefit analysis to determine
                       whether the general community would be well-served during
                       non-school hours by capital improvements to school-owned
                       open space and/or recreational facilities. The cost/benefit
                       analysis should take into account ongoing maintenance costs
                       and responsibilities. When it is determined that the community
                       would be well served by the capital improvement, the City will
                       consider funding a share of the costs of those improvements
                       proportionate to the City’s use. (See also Fiscal Management

Policy LT-8.8 Support the acquisition or joint use through
agreements with partners of suitable sites to enhance
Sunnyvale’s open spaces and recreation facilities based on
community need and through such strategies as development
of easements and right-of-ways for open space use, conversion
of sites to open space from developed use of land and
landbanking. (Previously Open Space and Recreation Policy 2.2.A.8)
Policy LT-8.9 Refrain from engaging in the development of open
space and/or recreational facilities without prior assurance
that ongoing maintenance needs will be addressed. (Previously

                       identified as underserved through the acquisition of new
                       parkland and/or the addition of amenities in order to bring
                       sites in line with Design and Development Guidelines.
                       Policy LT-8.14 In applying the Park Dedication requirements for
                       new development, place a priority on acquiring land over in-lieu
                       payment, particularly when the development is in areas identified
                       as underserved and/or when the land is of sufficient size or can
                       be combined with other land dedication to form larger Mini
                       Parks or Neighborhood Parks.
                       Policy LT-8.15 Place a priority on ensuring that each site has the
                       minimum resources identified in the Design Guidelines for its park
                       classification before adding new amenities over and above the
                       minimum required resources for the park classification.
                       Policy LT-8.16 If amenities are no longer needed (e.g., due to fiscal
                       constraints, environmental reasons, change in community
                       needs) give strong consideration to redesigning the amenity to
                       serve community needs.
