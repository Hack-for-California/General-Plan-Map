Letter to the Reader:
This General Plan is truly a vision of what might be. The City of Taft could have embarked on a
narrow Plan update, but, recognizing local needs and the impacts of sprawl, Taft chose to make a
broad statement with lofty goals about the future of this area.
The Taft General Plan is truly unique and innovative while being simultaneously conservative. How
can this Plan be both?
Taft looked at the development patterns in the southern San Joaquin Valley and saw the impacts of
sprawl upon the environment and lifestyle. Taft said that enough is enough. The people west of I-5
value their lifestyle – a central city with agriculture, natural resource production, and heritage
conservation – as vital to the long-term health and well-being of the area. Therefore, rather than
looking at a minimal area to plan, the City identified the actions necessary to maintain the lifestyle
important to the people of this area and drew a line at I-5 to prevent sprawl west of that highway.
At the same time, Taft noted the lack of infrastructure in the unincorporated communities adjacent
to the City and identified actions necessary to improve those areas, actions requiring financial
resources adequate to meeting the need for improvements. Hence, Taft decided that it needed to
find a way to obtain the financial resources necessary to meet the need, including growth to a few
key sites along I-5, sites already approved for development by Kern County. Taft said that it needs
to capture the revenues from those sites even while restricting their future expansion.
Thus, this Plan is a bold and aggressive statement about cherishing the heritage and lifestyle of an
area while finding ways to meet very real needs, a Plan that is both unique and innovative about
lifestyle and yet very conservative about growth.

                                                         1.0 INTRODUCTION
     Taft is no ordinary city and this is no ordinary general plan. The residents and leaders of this
     community dare to dream of a brighter future. In 2007, the Taft City Council authorized an
     update to the City’s General Plan. This General Plan represents the product of years of effort on
     the part of residents and businesses in the community working to maintain and improve Taft’s
     quality of life and implement the community’s shared vision for the future.
     1.1     GENERAL PLAN
     1.1.1 ROLE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
     The General Plan is the official policy framework guiding physical, social, and economic
     development within the City’s Planning Area, as well as the City’s own operations and decisions.
     Taft’s General Plan is a long-range guide for attaining the City’s goals within its ultimate service
     area and accommodating the projected increase in population.
     1.1.2 THE PLANNING AREA
     The City of Taft is located in Kern County, nestled in the foothills at the extreme southwestern
     edge of the San Joaquin Valley. Taft is just 45 minutes from the City of Bakersfield, two hours
     from Los Angeles, and two hours from California’s Central Coast. The City of Taft was
     incorporated November 7, 1910, and today covers approximately 15 square miles of land.
     The General Plan for the City of Taft addresses land within the city limits and an area beyond
     the city that impacts the City’s planning efforts. This area is referred to as the General Plan
     Planning Area and encompasses 157,570 acres, or roughly 246 square miles, and is illustrated in
     Figure 1.0-1. Taft has an interest in guiding land use and circulation decisions within the General
     Plan Planning Area because of the impacts that decisions made for this area may have upon the
     City. The General Plan Planning Area is also seen as an area into which the incorporated city
     boundaries may eventually expand.
     Table 1.0-1 identifies the City of Taft General Plan land use designations for the Planning Area.
     Currently, Kern County has jurisdiction and land use authority over land outside of the city limits
     but within the General Plan Planning Area. The City of Taft land use designations for the area
     outside of the city limits represent minimal change to the Kern County land use designations for
     the same area.

     1.1.3 GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
     State law requires that general plans include seven elements: Land Use, Circulation, Housing,
     Conservation, Open Space, Noise, and Safety. This General Plan includes the required elements
     plus three optional elements. In addition, the City of Taft is committed to being a leader in
     sustainability and therefore has included “green” and sustainable principles throughout all of the
     elements of this General Plan (refer to Chapter 2.0: Planning a Sustainable Community for more
     discussion). Following are the elements included in the City of Taft General Plan:
          •     3.0 Land Use Element (required per state law)
          •     4.0 Circulation Element (required per state law)
          •     5.0 Open Space and Conservation Element (required per state law)
          •     6.0 Housing Element (required per state law)
          •     7.0 Energy Element (optional)
          •     8.0 Noise Element (required per state law)

                          1.0 INTRODUCTION
          •   9.0 Safety Element (required per state law)
          •   10.0 Public Facilities and Services Element (optional)
          •   11.0 Economic Development Element (optional)
    Together, these elements provide the City’s goals and policies on a broad range of issues related
    to the future of Taft, its livability, and its desire to be a leader in innovative and sustainable
    planning.
    1.1.4 ORGANIZATION OF THE PLAN
    This General Plan contains the following chapters and elements. The General Plan also includes
    several maps and tables throughout the document that help to express and describe the vision,
    goals, or key components of the Plan.
    Chapter 1.0: Introduction. Provides an overview of the intent and organization of the General
    Plan and identifies a Vision for the City of Taft.
    Chapter 2.0: Planning for a Sustainable Community. Defines sustainable development for
    the City of Taft and demonstrates how this General Plan is formulated to encourage sustainable
    development, consistent with the Vision for the City of Taft.
    Chapter 3.0 through Chapter 11.0: General Plan Elements.1 Each of the elements of the
    General Plan is organized as follows.
              Introduction. This section briefly explains what the element is intended to do and the
              reason for the particular element. The introduction also includes brief background
              information to establish the context for goals and policies contained in the element. This
              background material is neither a comprehensive statement of existing conditions nor a
              repository of adopted information.
              Related Plans and Programs. This section highlights significant plans, programs, and
              regulations that are related to a particular element and explains the relationship of each to
              the City’s General Plan.
              Relationship to Other General Plan Elements. This section summarizes how a particular
              element relates to other elements in the General Plan.
    1 It should be noted that Chapter 6.0: Housing Element was updated separately from the comprehensive General Plan
    update to comply with the timeline for certification through the California Department of Housing and Community
    Development. The Housing Element is contained under separate cover.

1.0-6                                                               PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT GENERAL PLAN

                                                         1.0 INTRODUCTION
             Issues and Considerations. Summarizes the primary issues addressed through the goals
             and policies included in the element. This section briefly outlines concerns identified
             during the General Plan update process.
             Goals, Policies, and Actions. The goals, policies, and actions included in each element
             provide the blueprint for achieving the Vision for the City of Taft and will help guide
             future decisions.
                     Goal: Goals are “end-state.” They are the long-range targets as to what the City
                     wants to accomplish regarding a particular issue.
                     Policy: A specific medium- or short-range statement of principle to guide decision-
                     making so there is continuing progress toward the attainment of stated goals.
                     Action: Actions are activities undertaken to implement a specific policy or group
                     of policies. Some of these actions may occur in the short term; others will require
                     more time and resources and may not be completed for some time.
     Chapter 12.0: Implementation Plan. Provides a summary of all action items and identifies the
     lead entity responsible for implementation. The Implementation Plan also assigns a priority
     ranking to each action item.
     Chapter 13.0: Glossary. Provides definitions for terms used throughout the General Plan.
     Appendix A. Provides a summary of all green goals and policies identified in the General Plan.
     The General Plan is also supported by the associated Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The
     EIR is intended to be used in conjunction with this General Plan and to serve as a companion to
     this policy document.
     The General Plan EIR assesses the potential implications of the policies in this General Plan in
     terms of physical environmental impacts. State law requires that the EIR be certified prior to
     adoption of the General Plan and be used to provide specific findings that are part of the City
     Council’s approval action(s). In the years following General Plan adoption, the assumptions,
     analyses, conclusions, and recommended mitigation measures inherent in the EIR will be useful
     in assessing implementation actions and projects.
     1.1.5 USE OF THE PLAN
     The General Plan is intended to be used by a broad range of persons, including:
         •   The City Council and Planning Commission in decision-making activities;
         •   City staff in developing programs and projects;
         •   The development community in preparing development proposals; and

PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT GENERAL PLAN                                                                        1.0-7

                        1.0 INTRODUCTION
         •  Residents and citizens seeking to understand the vision and future of Taft and the type of
            development which may occur.
    This General Plan will be used as the basis for standards for the development of public and
    private projects.
    1.1.6 AMENDMENTS TO THE GENERAL PLAN
    While the General Plan is a long-range planning tool, it is important for the Plan to remain
    current and reflective of local issues and policies. State law allows the City to amend each
    element of the General Plan up to four times each year to ensure that it is consistent with the
    conditions, values, expectations, and needs of the community. California General Plan
    Guidelines note:
            The General Plan is a dynamic document because it is based on community values and an
            understanding of existing and projected conditions and needs, all of which continually change.
            Local governments should plan for change by establishing formal procedures for regularly
            monitoring, reviewing, and amending the General Plan.
    Good planning requires periodic review of the General Plan to accommodate changing
    conditions and priorities. As circumstances or the City’s desires change, this General Plan may be
    amended by the City Council following review by the Planning Commission. To continue the
    involvement and vision of the community and ensure that the General Plan is proactive relative
    to any issues that may arise, the City of Taft will hold annual study sessions to review planning-
    related matters. Periodic revision of the Housing Element is required by state law, but there is no
    required regular update for any other portion of the General Plan.
    1.1.7 GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
    While this General Plan provides policies and action items to guide Taft’s growth and decision-
    making, it is not intended to answer every question which will be faced by the City over the
    lifetime of the Plan. This General Plan is also not intended to be a step-by-step guidebook for its
    own implementation. Future work will be needed to fully implement this General Plan.
    State law requires that the City’s ordinances regulating land use be consistent with the General
    Plan. The Zoning Ordinance is the primary implementing document as many of the goals,
    policies, and actions in this General Plan are achieved through zoning, which regulates public
    and private development. The City is responsible for ensuring that the Zoning Ordinance and
    this General Plan are in conformity. In most instances, this will mean that land is designated in
    the General Plan and zoned for similar uses with similar development standards (i.e., similar
    densities and minimum parcel sizes).
    Where zoning and General Plan land use designations are not identical, policies of this General
    Plan should be consulted carefully for guidance. Unless otherwise stated, the more restrictive
    controls of either zoning or the General Plan that apply to the parcel in question (e.g., larger
    minimum parcel size, fewer permitted uses) shall prevail.

                                                            1.0 INTRODUCTION
     Other related plans and ordinances must also be consistent with the goals and policies in this
     General Plan, including all capital improvements and public works projects.
     1.1.8 INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION
     The economy of the City of Taft and Kern County has always been, and is today, dependent in
     large part upon the availability and utilization of natural resources as well as access to water
     supplies. Either directly or indirectly, the majority of persons employed in the Planning Area are
     dependent upon the oil industry, farming, mining, recreation, and other activities related to and
     reliant upon the availability of these resources. These activities form the base for the economic
     stability of the city and are tied to the viable and effective use of land.
     Much of the land which produces the natural resources critical to the economy in the Planning
     Area is managed by federal, state, and county agencies or is affected by these agencies. The City
     of Taft recognizes that federal law mandates coordinated planning with local governments of
     federally managed lands and positively supports varied uses of these lands. State law also
     mandates coordinated planning between state, county, and local governments on issues with
     regional impacts. Such varied uses necessarily include continued maintenance of the historic and
     traditional economic uses within the Planning Area.
     Acknowledging the critical tie between use of the federal, state, and county managed lands and
     the economic stability of the Planning Area, the City is committed to working collaboratively
     with these agencies to remain informed of all pending or proposed actions affecting the Planning
     Area and to coordinate in the planning and implementation of those actions. Therefore, the City
     is interested in fully participating in a process to plan, formulate, develop, and implement
     programs, including monitoring and evaluation in these areas.

     Public participation played an important role in preparing this General Plan and will play a role
     in its implementation. Because the General Plan needs to reflect community goals and
     aspirations, citizens and stakeholders were involved from the onset with issue identification and
     goal formulation.
     Vision Steering Committee. One of the most important parts of the process was the
     participation of the 46-member Vision Steering Committee. This group was formed in early 2007
     and consisted of City staff, citizens, public stakeholders, and other agencies to assist the City in
     defining the direction of the General Plan planning effort.

                        1.0 INTRODUCTION
    The efforts of the Vision Steering Committee have provided invaluable information and input:
    their ideas have driven the General Plan update. The 46-member Vision Steering Committee was
    broken down into the following subcommittees to address specific issues:
        •    Economic Development and Housing Subcommittee;
        •    Energy Subcommittee;
        •    Land Use and Circulation Subcommittee; and
        •    Public Services and Facilities, Safety and Noise Subcommittee.
    The subcommittees continued to meet throughout the General Plan process, providing goal
    direction and review of proposed policies.
    Public Workshops. Citizen groups and individuals participated in the preparation of the
    General Plan through attendance at over 100 meetings and General Plan public workshops and
    public hearings. Public meetings were facilitated by the General Plan consultant team on
    October 22, 2008, November 19, 2008, and February 25, 2009, as follows.
             PMC Workshop No. 1, held October 22, 2008. Provided an overview of the Planning
             Area and of the opportunities and constraints within the Planning Area, and introduced
             the overall goals and recommendations for the General Plan made by each of the
             subcommittees, City staff, and the consultant team. Preliminary land uses were also
             presented at this workshop.
             PMC Workshop No. 2, held November 19, 2008. Presented the preferred Land Use
             Map, identified special issues associated with buildout of the Planning Area, and
             provided examples of how to address those issues through use of various development
             techniques, including green principles and conservation measures.
             PMC Workshop No. 3, held February 25, 2009. Provided an introduction to the
             Administrative Draft General Plan, including how the General Plan document fit into the
             regional planning efforts under way, such as the San Joaquin Valley Blueprint. The
             General Plan consultant team also provided an overview of the Vision for the City of
             Taft, the proposed land uses for the Planning Area, a summary of specific goals and
             policies formulated to implement the Vision, and the incorporation of green principles
             throughout the General Plan document.
    Feedback from citizens was heard at all of the public workshops.
    Public Review Period. In addition to the public workshops, the General Plan was circulated for
    a 45-day public review and comment period in conjunction with the General Plan
    Environmental Impact Report. The review and comment period started on _____, 2009, and
    ended on _____, 2009. An additional meeting was held during the public review period on
    _______, 2009, to provide a summary of key issues covered in the General Plan and

     Environmental Impact Report. Comments received during this review period were evaluated and
     incorporated, as appropriate, into the final General Plan.
     1.3       TAFT’S VISION FOR THE FUTURE
     In adopting this General Plan, the City of Taft is making a clear and definitive statement that
     good planning is crucial to the City’s success. The City recognizes and acknowledges the ability
     of planning to affect the quality of lives of residents, the success of businesses, the appearance of
     the community, the ability of Taft to respond to changing economic circumstances, and the
     extent to which the City can help in statewide and national efforts to reduce energy consumption
     and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
     The Vision for the City of Taft reflects this statement and was based on input from the Vision
     Steering Committee and City staff and on feedback received during the various public meetings.
     The guiding principles in Table 1.0-2 below constitute the Vision for the City of Taft and
     became the foundation for the formation of the General Plan’s goals and policies.
                  TABLE 1.0-2: TAFT’S VISION FOR THE FUTURE – GUIDING PRINCIPLES
       Incorporate green and sustainable principles throughout the General Plan, particularly as they relate to Assembly
       Bill (AB) 32 – California’s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and Senate Bill (SB) 375 – California Global
       Warming Bill legislation.
       Conserve natural and agricultural resources by incorporating design principles to conserve and preserve open
       space and agricultural uses by employing a variety of conservation design techniques to preserve land, site higher
       density developments appropriately, and provide links between open spaces.
       Encourage development in existing developed areas with limited new growth in undeveloped areas of the
       Planning Area.
       Promote a vibrant, healthy, active downtown by providing safe multi-family and mixed-use housing with a
       harmonious mix of uses and transportation options available.
       Promote attractive residential and aesthetically appealing commercial development through infill, rehabilitation,
       and development standards to improve the quality of the built environment.
       Encourage increased diversity in the economic base of Taft, while still remaining a leader in energy production
       and maintaining a strong petroleum-based industry.
       Be the economic focal point for Kern County west of I-5 and promote a positive business environment for new
       and existing businesses to locate and expand.
       Provide mobility, housing, and job options for all residents of Taft.
     The goals and policies included in this General Plan reflect a commitment by the City of Taft to
     implement these guiding principles.
CITY OF TAFT                                                                                                     JULY 2009

        PLANNING FOR A
SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY

           2.0 PLANNING FOR A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY
     Local government provides one of the best ways to demonstrate the necessity, the desirability,
     and the practicality of moving toward sustainable communities. The City of Taft’s Vision for the
     Future reflects core community values and identifies the guiding principles that informed the
     goals and policies of this General Plan (refer to Section 1.3: Taft’s Vision for the Future).
     One of the guiding principles of this General Plan is to “incorporate green and sustainable
     principles throughout the General Plan, particularly as they relate to Assembly Bill (AB) 32 –
     California’s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and Senate Bill (SB) 375 – California Global
     Warming Bill legislation.”
     In adopting this General Plan, the City of Taft is making a clear and definitive statement that
     better planning is crucial to the City’s success and its future. In promoting development of a
     sustainable community through the goals and policies identified in this General Plan, the City of
     Taft will strive to become a model in regard to sustainable development.
                                             2.1      WHAT IS SUSTAINABILITY?
       “We did not inherit the land from
       our fathers. We are borrowing it from “Sustainability” is defined as aligning our built environment
       our children.”                        and socioeconomic activities with the natural systems that
          – Native American Proverb          support life. Central to this definition is the ability to meet
                                             current needs without compromising the ability of future
     generations to meet their needs. Sustainability is the term used to show how Taft will balance the
     various interests and needs of our existing and future residents.
     Sustainable development considers the impact of decisions on each of the three key aspects of
     sustainability.
         •     The Environment. Sustainability is related to the physical environment in many ways
               and addresses both the built and natural environments.
         •     The local Economy. Maintaining a strong and diverse economy whose vitality can be
               relied on well into the future is key to sustainability.
         •     The Equity of such decisions on all people. “Equity” in terms of sustainability means
               ensuring open access to the benefits of living and working in a community and
               comparable exposure to potential risks and hazards – essentially, dealing fairly with all
               segments of the community.
     Ultimately, however, sustainability is a principle that should be seen as a point of departure to
     guide decision-making in everyday practice, not a final destination.

                        2.0 PLANNING FOR A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY
    2.2      WHY PLAN SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES?
    With goals to transform the City of Taft into a sustainable community, there is a need for good
    planning. Trends such as the increasing impact of greenhouse gases (GHG) on the world’s
    climate and the decreasing supply of resources that support life make a compelling case for
    meeting the needs of the present without compromising
    the ability of future generations to meet their needs.            “A hundred years after we are gone and
                                                                      forgotten, those who never heard of us will
    Without implementing sustainable principles, growth               be living with the results of our actions.”
    anticipated in the City of Taft would lead to an increase                     – Oliver Wendell Holmes
    in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through
    increased vehicle traffic and industrial activities. Similarly, growth would also indirectly lead to
    greater emissions through an increase in the consumption of energy, which would be supplied by
    power plants and oil refineries that generate greenhouse gases in their production processes.
    The State of California has acknowledged that climate change has become an issue of increasing
    concern. The California Environmental Protection Agency reports that better land use planning,
    which includes creating alternative choices for transportation, will achieve the largest emission
    reductions. Since 2005, there have been a number of legislative changes in California that address
    greenhouse gas impacts from land use planning decisions.
             Executive Order No. S-3-05. Issued by Governor Schwarzenegger in June 2005, this
             executive order set greenhouse gas emission targets for the state, starting with a
             reduction to 2000 GHG emission levels by 2010 and concluding with a reduction to 80
             percent below 1990 numbers by 2030. This order directed the California Environmental
             Protection Agency, the Business Transportation and Housing Agency, the California Air
             Resources Board, the California Energy Commission, and the Public Utilities
             Commission to work together to develop a Climate Action Plan for California and report
             back on progress on meeting the statewide targets under the Governor’s Executive
             Order.
             Assembly Bill (AB) 32. Signed by Governor Schwarzenegger in 2006, AB 32
             established the first set of limits on greenhouse gas emissions for the state of California
             and put into place the regulatory framework needed to reach those targets. AB 32
             establishes a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in California to 1990 levels by
             the year 2020. To attain that goal, AB 32 required the California Air Resources Board
             (CARB) to have adopted a scoping plan by January 1, 2009, indicating how emission
             reductions will be achieved. Reductions may be achieved by regulations, market
             mechanisms, and other actions. By January 1, 2011, CARB must adopt regulations to
             achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective reductions in
             greenhouse gas emissions.
JULY 2009                                                                                                 CITY OF TAFT

          2.0 PLANNING FOR A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY
             In December of 2008, CARB adopted a Scoping Plan to achieve the goals of AB 32. In
             recognition of the critical role local governments will play in the successful
             implementation of AB 32, CARB added a section describing this role. In addition, CARB
             recommended a greenhouse gas reduction goal for local governments of 15 percent
             below today’s levels by 2020 to ensure that their municipal and community-wide
             emissions match the state’s reduction target.
             Senate Bill (SB) 375. As a follow-up to AB 32, the California Legislature passed SB 375
             in October 2008 that is a comprehensive global warming bill focusing on housing and
             transportation planning decisions. The goal is to reduce fossil fuel consumption and
             conserve farmlands and habitat. SB 375 is vitally important to achieving the goals
             identified in AB 32 because greenhouse gas emissions associated with land use are the
             single largest sector of emissions in California.
             SB 375 identifies the “how” and “when” for achieving the goals established under AB 32
             by requiring Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO), in this case the Kern Council
             of Governments (Kern COG), to establish a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) in
             the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) that seeks to achieve the targeted reductions in
             greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks, as determined by the California Air
             Resources Board for each region. The SCS is part of the RTP and therefore is linked to
             transportation funding related to the RTP process.
             In the case where the SCS has shown that it cannot meet the greenhouse gas emission
             reduction targets, Kern COG must then develop an Alternative Planning Strategy (APS).
             The APS would identify alternative measures and policies for meeting the reduction
             targets and describe why these alternatives are the most practicable choices for achieving
             the targets. The APS is not part of the RTP.
             SB 375 also provides incentives to locate housing developments closer to where people
             work, shop, and go to school, thereby reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) every year.
             One such incentive is to allow qualifying projects to pass through a streamlined
             environmental review process under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
             These incentives were developed to encourage participation in the goals of SB 375 and
             the required SCS. The overall intent of the bill remains to more closely relate
             transportation and land use planning to achieve the target reduction in greenhouse gas
             emissions.
     The California Legislature endorsed the California Environmental Quality Act as the means by
     which to evaluate greenhouse gas emissions. The State Attorney General, the chief law
     enforcement officer of the state, is charged with enforcing CEQA and will review and send
     comments to spur the local lead agencies to take a second look at their CEQA documents and
     projects and to take additional measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
     In an effort to provide direction on how to comply with CEQA relative to greenhouse gas
     emissions, and in response to the above legislation enacted in California, the Attorney General
     issued a revised report in September 2008 identifying ways that local agencies could incorporate

    policy and implementation measures in the General Plan context to reduce impacts of
    greenhouse gas emissions. Recommended policy and implementation measures were included, as
    appropriate, in this General Plan.
    2.3       HOW IS TAFT PLANNING FOR A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY?
    Making the transition to a sustainable and clean energy future brings with it great opportunities,
    and also some challenges. As the State of California and the City of Taft move ahead with the
    development and implementation of policies to spur this transition, it will be necessary to ensure
    that the policies are crafted not only to cut greenhouse gas emissions and move toward
    sustainability and cleaner energy sources but also to ensure that the economic and employment
    benefits that will accompany the transition are realized. This means that particular attention must
                                                be paid to fostering an economic environment that
      “The world will not evolve past its       promotes and encourages investment and development of
      current state of crisis by using the same
                                                new technologies and that adequate resources are devoted
      thinking that created the situation.”

                           – Albert Einstein    equipped to help make the transition.
    To move toward a sustainable community, this General Plan encompasses established principles
    of good planning and advocates a proactive approach to future development. The sustainable
    principles incorporated throughout the elements of this General Plan address the City of Taft’s
    role in the implementation of California state law and address each of the three E’s of
    sustainability – Environment, Economy, and Equity.
    A summary of the sustainable principles incorporated into this General Plan for each of the
    three E’s and the elements that address each principle is shown in Table 2.0-1.
    Goals and policies based on the sustainable or “green” principles have been incorporated
    throughout each of the General Plan elements and are identified through the use of a leaf
    symbol, as follows:
    Policy S-1:          Discussion of policy.
    This symbol will visually alert the reader to how sustainable principles have been incorporated
    into the goals and policies throughout the document and demonstrates just how integral
    planning for sustainable communities is in all facets of the General Plan. A summary of all green
    goals and policies identified in the General Plan can be found in Appendix A.
    Implementation of the goals and policies contained in this General Plan will assist the City of
    Taft in achieving its goal of becoming a more sustainable city.

                                                         3.0 LAND USE ELEMENT
     3.1     INTRODUCTION
             Taft will be a community with a high quality of life that is clean, energetic, and sustainable. The
             City will create itself as a destination and will provide a balanced mix of housing, jobs,
             commercial activities, and services, as well as cultural and civic amenities. Taft’s pattern of land
             use will enhance the community character and provide for employment and shopping
             opportunities, transit, and protection of unique historical features, natural resources, and
             agricultural uses. The City will create a vibrant, active, healthy downtown which will remain the
             “heart” of the community.
     The Land Use Element is what people typically think of when they think of the “plan” for the
     city and is often considered the “heart” of the General Plan. This element establishes the pattern
     of activity for the community and provides the central framework for the General Plan by
     serving as a compass to guide planners, the general public, and decision-makers on the desired
     pattern of development in Taft.
     The Land Use Element defines areas of the city for housing, business, industry, open space,
     recreation, education, and other public services and describes future land use activity. Text,
     maps, and diagrams establish the blueprint for future land uses within the city and describe how
     these uses are integrated with the other General Plan elements and policies.
     3.2     RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     The Land Use Element relates to several other plans and programs, including the following:
          •  City of Taft Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Ordinance establishes zone districts that
             identify uses within each district which are consistent with the General Plan land use
             designations. The Zoning Ordinance also establishes development standards for each
             zone district, which creates the framework for the physical form of the community (e.g.,
             building setbacks, heights).
          •  City of Taft Downtown Specific Plan, 1999. Guides land use planning and policy
             document for Downtown Taft.
          •  Taft Community Development Agency (TCDA) Redevelopment Plan. The
             Redevelopment Plan currently covers approximately 900 acres in central Taft and was
             created for the purpose of improving and redeveloping commercial and residential areas
             and supports the production of mixed-income housing in the city. The TCDA is
             currently working on an expansion of the Redevelopment Plan Area from the existing
             900 acres to about 3,100 acres.
          •  County of Kern Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, September 1996, amended
             June 2003, March 2004, and November 2008. The Taft-Kern County Airport, a public
             use, general aviation airport, is located within the Planning Area. The airport operates in
             accordance with planning and land use procedures and criteria contained in the Airport
             Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP). This plan establishes planning boundaries for

        height, noise, and safety around the airport and also determines compatibility of
        surrounding land uses.
      • San Joaquin Valley Blueprint Program. The San Joaquin Valley Blueprint is a
        comprehensive visioning process that covers the eight counties in the San Joaquin Valley
        (San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Tulare, Kings, and Kern). The
        Blueprint process is intended to engage policymakers and citizens to create a regional
        vision of growth for the 21st century. The purpose of the Blueprint is to provide a
        cohesive framework that defines alternative solutions to growth-related issues in the San
        Joaquin Valley region. The planning process involves a comprehensive overview of
        transportation, housing, land use, economic development, and the environment to
        produce a preferred growth scenario to the year 2050.
        The Kern Council of Governments (Kern COG) acts as the lead agency and facilitator
        for preparing the local Blueprint process in Kern County. Kern COG has used a
        “bottom up” process that relies on public outreach and participation at the local level
        through a series of public workshops held in 2007 and 2008. These meetings considered
        growth scenarios for each sub-region of Kern County and determined a set of land use,
        transportation, and environmental goals. These goals helped develop a vision statement
        for future growth and a set of land use guiding principles consistent with the preferred
        growth scenario. Implementation strategies and measurable objectives to achieve the
        vision were also developed in the process.
        Kern COG released the Kern Regional Blueprint Program Final Draft in November
        2008, which included the following principles:
        –   Conserve energy and natural resources and develop alternatives;
        –   Provide adequate and equitable services;
        –   Enhance economic vitality;
        –   Provide a variety of housing choices;
        –   Use and improve existing community assets and infrastructure;
        –   Use compact, efficient development and/or mixed-use land uses where appropriate;
        –   Provide a variety of transportation choices;
        –   Conserve undeveloped land and spaces; and
        –   Increase civic and public engagement.

                                                    3.0 LAND USE ELEMENT
             The Blueprint will not supersede a local jurisdiction’s land use authority but is intended
             to provide various land use guidelines to improve the quality of life in the region by using
             a “toolbox” of implementation measures. It is, however, anticipated that some state
             and/or federal funding sources may be tied to a local agency’s consistency with the
             Blueprint Plan.
             Ultimately, the products of the Blueprint process are intended for use by local
             governments in the San Joaquin Valley. In particular, the principles and implementation
             strategies may be used in the preparation of general plans and future amendments to
             these plans.
     3.3     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
     The Land Use Element establishes the planned land use pattern for Taft based on historic
     development and the community’s vision for the future. While the Land Use Element influences
     all elements of this General Plan, it is most closely related to the following:
          •  The Circulation Element (Chapter 4.0) through the identification of the City’s
             circulation network to facilitate mobility throughout the Planning Area and through
             policies encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as transit, bicycle, and
             pedestrian circulation.
          •  The Open Space and Conservation Element (Chapter 5.0) through policies
             encouraging the continued use of agricultural lands and the protection of natural
             resources land and the integration of sustainable practices.
          •  The Public Facilities and Services Element (Chapter 10.0) through policies that
             encourage coordination with the school districts in the siting and design of school
             facilities as well as other public facilities.
          •  The Economic Development Element (Chapter 11.0) through policies that support
             the use of the local labor force for jobs in the community by encouraging a mix of uses
             that would allow retail and office uses to locate proximal to residential uses, thereby
             achieving a healthy jobs-to-housing balance.
     Where overlaps in policy issues can be identified, cross-references are provided to alert the
     reader to the specific policy group of the related elements.
     3.4     ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
     This Land Use Element addresses issues identified during the preparation of the City’s General
     Plan through discussions with the Vision Steering Committee, its subcommittees, and City staff,
     and feedback received during the various public meetings. The goals, policies, and actions
     included in this element have been prepared in consideration of these issues, which include the
     need to:

     Policy LU-3: Promote sustainable development practices.
     Policy LU-4: Support alternative development techniques to promote the conservation of land
                  for open space, natural resource, or agricultural uses.
     Policy LU-5: Analyze all development projects in accordance with the provisions of CEQA.
     Policy LU-6: Require all development to be compatible with the Airport Land Use
                  Compatibility Plan (ALUCP).
     LAND USE POLICIES: LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
     Policy LU-7: The following standards apply to lands designated as Agriculture on Figure 3.0-
                  1a and Figure 3.0-1b (Land Use Maps) of the General Plan.
                  Intent: To provide areas where the predominant land use is agriculturally oriented
                  and to identify areas in the Planning Area in which agriculture is now and should
                  continue to be the predominant land use, where land uses incompatible with
                  agriculture should be precluded, and where the development of urban type land
                  uses would be detrimental to the continuance of agriculture which is an economic
                  and aesthetic attribute to the area. Continuance of existing non-agricultural
                  development may be allowed. It is expected that this designation will have a very
                  low population to acre ratio, anticipating less than one person per acre.
                  This land use designation also allows the City to implement Williamson Act Land
                  Contracts, including Farmland Security Zones, to ensure the continued viability
                  of agriculture.
                  Maximum Dwelling Density: 1 dwelling unit per 20 gross acres (0.5 DU/Ac);
                  except, 1 dwelling unit per 80 gross acres (0.0125 DU/Ac) for land subject to the
                  Williamson Act/Farmland Security Zone Contracts
     Policy LU-8: The following standards apply to lands designated as Natural Resources on
                  Figure 3.0-1a and Figure 3.0-1b (Land Use Maps) of the General Plan.
                  Intent: This designation is applied to lands that have proven petroleum, mineral,
                  or biotic resources. Most of the land within this land use designation is utilized
                  for oil-related uses, including exploration, reserves, pipelines, and storage
                  facilities. Much of this land also provides added benefits, such as open space and
                  wildlife habitat. It is expected that this designation will have a very low
                  population to acre ratio, anticipating less than one person per acre.
                  This land use designation also provides for the continuation of agricultural uses
                  and allows the City to implement Williamson Act Land Contracts, including
                  Farmland Security Zones.

                  to the Williamson Act/Farmland Security Zone Contracts
    Policy LU-9: The following standards apply to lands designated as Rural Residential on
                  Figure 3.0-1a and Figure 3.0-1b (Land Use Maps) of the General Plan.
                  Intent: To provide for and protect a rural atmosphere and lifestyle. Rural
                  Residential also provides for the continued use of existing Rural Residential areas
                  within the Planning Area. It is expected that this designation will have a low
                  population to acre ratio, anticipating up to six persons per acre.
                  Maximum Dwelling Density: 1 dwelling unit per gross acre (1 DU/Ac)
    Policy LU-10: The following standards apply to lands designated as Estate Residential on
                  Figure 3.0-1a and Figure 3.0-1b (Land Use Maps) of the General Plan.
                  Intent: To provide for and protect a large-lot estate atmosphere and lifestyle.
                  Estate Residential development is generally served by community sewer and
                  water. This land use designation is also appropriately used when estate residential
                  developments are desired to promote larger lot homes and where the overall
                  density of an area should be limited because of public facility, safety, or aesthetic

                  of up to eight persons per acre.
                  Maximum Dwelling Density: 2.5 dwelling units per gross acre (2.5 DU/Ac)
    Policy LU-11: The following standards apply to lands designated as Low Density Residential
                  on Figure 3.0-1a and Figure 3.0-1b (Land Use Maps) of the General Plan.
                  Intent: To provide for low density residential neighborhoods. Low Density
                  Residential development will most likely consist of detached units or attached
                  units. Secondary dwelling units are also permitted. Low Density Residential
                  development is generally served by community sewer and water.
                  The Low Density Residential designation is intended to allow limited multiple-
                  family residential development on corner lots in single-family residential
                  neighborhoods.
                  The Low Density Residential designation is also intended to allow limited
                  neighborhood commercial development in residential neighborhoods.
                  Neighborhood commercial uses must be compatible with nearby residential uses
                  and located at the intersection of arterials/local streets or collectors/local streets.

                   dwelling units per gross acre (15 DU/Ac) on corner lots
     Policy LU-12: The following standards apply to lands designated as Medium Density
                   Residential on Figure 3.0-1a and Figure 3.0-1b (Land Use Maps) of the General
                   Plan.
                   Intent: To provide for medium density residential neighborhoods. Medium
                   Density Residential development will most likely consist of more compact single-
                   family development consisting of detached units or attached units, or multiple-
                   family units.
                   The Medium Density Residential designation is also intended to allow limited
                   neighborhood commercial development in residential neighborhoods.
                   Neighborhood commercial land uses must be compatible with nearby residential
                   uses and located at the intersection of arterials/local streets or collectors/local
                   streets. Development of neighborhood commercial centers must be in scale with
                   the surrounding residential neighborhood. It is expected that this designation will
                   have a population to acre ratio of between 10 and 40 persons per acre.
                   Minimum Dwelling Density: 4 dwelling units per gross acre (4 DU/Ac)

                   Intent: To provide for high density residential neighborhoods. High Density
                   Residential development will most commonly consist primarily of attached units
                   or multiple-family units.
                   The High Density Residential designation is also intended to allow limited
                   neighborhood commercial development in residential neighborhoods.
                   Neighborhood commercial uses must be compatible with nearby residential uses
                   and located at the intersection of arterials/local streets or collectors/local streets.
                   Development of neighborhood commercial centers must be in scale with the

                  Intent: To encourage a mix of residential, office, and retail uses in designated
                  areas of the community. The Mixed Use designation is concentrated in the
                  Downtown area and other appropriate areas as shown on Figure 3.0-1 (Land Use
                  Map). It is expected that this designation will have a population to acre ratio of
                  up to 78 persons per acre. Building intensity in this designation may cover the
                  entire parcel and reach to several floors.

                  Intent: To provide for local and regional shopping centers, highway commercial
                  land uses, general retail land uses, and office developments. It is expected that
                  this designation will not have population as the uses are not intended to include
                  residential development. However, there may be some associated residential uses
                  but the population to acre ratio is expected to be very low, anticipating less than

                  Intent: To provide for industrial land uses including manufacturing, processing,
                  light industrial, and alternative fuel or alternative energy land uses. The Industrial
                  land use designation is also intended to allow for business park developments.
                  This designation is also intended to allow for appropriate and complementary
                  commercial land uses in light industrial and business park developments. It is
                  expected that this designation will not have population as the uses are not
                  intended to include residential development. However, there may be some
                  associated residential uses but the population to acre ratio is expected to be very

                  3.0-1a and Figure 3.0-1b (Land Use Maps) of the General Plan.
                  Intent: This designation is reserved for facilities that are operated by public
                  agencies or which serve public agency functions, including state parks, schools,
                  the post office, city hall and other government facilities, hospital, airport, prison,
                  county offices, and similar uses. It is expected that this designation will not have

CIRCULATION ELEMENT

                                                  4.0 CIRCULATION ELEMENT
     4.1       INTRODUCTION
               The City’s desire is to provide mobility options for all citizens by creating a safe and comfortable
               environment where pedestrians, bicyclists, vehicular traffic, and parking work in harmony.
     Circulation refers to the ability of people and goods to safely and efficiently move about the
     community. Efficient mobility is essential to a community’s success and quality of life for its
     residents. The City will facilitate a circulation system that makes it easier to move throughout the
     city by focusing on an improved network of major and connector roadways on a modified grid
     system, expanding transit opportunities, and developing a network of pedestrian and bicycle
     routes throughout the community.
     This Circulation Element establishes goals, policies, and actions designed to guide the circulation
     system, including the roadway network, transit facilities and services, and bicycle and pedestrian
     facilities for the Planning Area. The City specifically promotes the development of “complete
     streets.” The text and maps are a basis for the development of the city’s transportation network.
     4.2       RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     The Circulation Element relates to several other plans and programs, including the following:
          •    Kern Council of Governments Destination 2030 Regional Transportation Plan
               (RTP), 2007. The RTP is a long-term (20-year) plan for the region’s transportation
               network, which includes eleven cities and the unincorporated areas of Kern County, and
               encompasses projects for all types of travel, including aviation and freight movement.
               The plan assesses environmental impacts of proposed projects and establishes air quality
               conformity as required by federal regulations. The document also discusses inter-modal
               and multi-modal transportation activities.
          •    California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Standards. Caltrans establishes
               minimum standards for several types of state transportation facilities including roadways,
               trails, and bicycle paths.
     4.3       RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
     An efficient circulation system, including roadways, transit, and bicycle and pedestrian paths,
     requires planning for current and future service demand and for constructing and maintaining
     facilities to meet the identified service demands. Therefore, the Circulation Element works in
     conjunction with several of the other elements of the General Plan, most specifically the
     following.
          •    The Land Use Element (Chapter 3.0) through policies that would determine the
               aesthetics of the roadway system as an integral part of the community image. The
               planned development identified on the land use map also influences the design capacity
               of the circulation system.

                       4.0 CIRCULATION ELEMENT
        •   The Open Space and Conservation Element (Chapter 5.0) through additional
            policies addressing the construction, expansion, and design of bikeway and pedestrian
            trails.
        •   The Public Facilities and Services Element (Chapter 10.0) through policies
            addressing the timing of construction of infrastructure improvements.

                                           4.0 CIRCULATION ELEMENT
     Goal CI-4: A well-integrated pedestrian and bicycle trail system.
     Goal CI-5: A circulation system that creates a positive image of Taft and
                  contributes to the residents’ quality of life.
     CIRCULATION POLICIES: GENERAL
     Policy CI-1: Coordinate circulation planning for all modes of transportation to help ensure an
                  efficient and effective system including the use of the “complete street” design
                  concept.
     Policy CI-2: Require projects subject to discretionary review to minimize vehicle trips.
                  Action CI-2a:         Work with transportation agencies to create a template for a
                  Transportation Demand Management program that can be used by businesses or
                  modified to meet the needs of the businesses. The template could include a
                  variety of methods to minimize trips and incentives for participation.
                  Action CI-2b:         Amend the Zoning Ordinance to require secure bicycle racks
                  or storage facilities at a ratio of 1 per every 10 vehicle spaces in new commercial
                  and public buildings.
     Policy CI-3: Require all new development and expansion of existing development to fully
                  provide for on-site transportation facilities including streets, curbs, traffic control
                  devices, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, and other improvements as deemed
                  necessary by the City.
     Policy CI-4: Require development projects to buy into previously-paid transportation
                  improvements that specifically benefit their projects or parcels or to construct
                  roadway/intersection improvements to implement the City’s Circulation
                  Element. The City may also require the payment of additional fees if necessary to
                  cover the fair share cost of new or improved facilities affected by the project but
                  not included in the fee program.
     Policy CI-5: Prohibit overnight truck and tractor-trailer parking other than in authorized areas

CITY OF TAFT                                                                                     JULY 2009
PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT GENERAL PLAN                                                                        4.0-3

                    4.0 CIRCULATION ELEMENT
                 Local Streets provide for direct access to abutting properties and for localized
                 traffic movements within residential, commercial, and industrial areas. Local
                 streets are typically developed with a 60-foot right-of-way and one travel lane in
                 each direction.
                 Collectors provide for traffic movement between arterial and local streets, traffic
                 movement within and between neighborhoods and major activity centers, and
                 limited direct access to abutting properties. Collectors are typically developed
                 with a 90-foot right-of-way and one to two travel lanes in each direction.
                 Arterials serve as the primary network for cross-town traffic flow. Arterials
                 connect areas of major traffic generation within the urban areas and connect with
                 important county roads and state highways. Arterials also provide for the distribution
                 and collection of through traffic to and from collector and local streets serving
                 residential, commercial, and industrial areas. Access to abutting uses should be
                 limited, where possible, to facilitate traffic flow and reduce potential traffic
                 conflicts and hazards. Arterials should not be located adjacent to sensitive land
                 uses nor bisect neighborhoods. Arterials are typically developed with a 110-foot
                 right-of-way and two to three travel lanes in each direction.
                 Arterial Highways serve as the primary routes to the Planning Area from the
                 surrounding communities and are intended to accommodate greater traffic
                 volumes. Construction of and improvements to arterial highways are generally
                 the responsibility of the State of California.
                 Interstate is the largest roadway type in the Planning Area. Interstates serve to
                 move the greatest number of vehicles as efficiently and safely as possible with
                 limited access. The only interstate in the Planning Area is I-5. Construction of
                 and improvements to interstates are the responsibility of the State of California.
    Policy CI-7: Maintain the Level of Service on roadways and at intersections in the Planning
                 Area as follows:
                 a) Assure that roadway congestion generally does not exceed Level of Service D
                     except where:
                     •   Providing Level of Service D would be infeasible due to physical
                         constraints.
                     •   Maintaining Level of Service D would require an unreasonable expansion
                         of the roadway or intersection as determined by the City.
                 b) Maintain a Level of Service D at all signalized intersections except where:
                     •   The level of congestion already exceeds this standard; or

                       •    Where increased intersection capacity cannot be provided due to physical
                            constraints.
                   c) Maintain the Level of Service at unsignalized intersections at D or better;
                       intersections may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if signal
                       warrants are met.
     Policy CI-8:  Adopt and maintain a circulation system evaluation methodology that establishes
                   Levels of Service and determines significance thresholds for impacts to
                   intersections and roadways within the Planning Area. Where a project would
                   cause or contribute to congestion exceeding the Level of Service and/or
                   significance threshold, require on- or off-site transportation improvements as a
                   condition of approval as appropriate. Examples include, but are not limited to:
                   •   Improvements to on- or off-site roadways;
                   •   Improvements to intersections in the vicinity of the project;
                   •   Installation of transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities, including facilities which
                       exceed the minimum standards imposed by City regulations;
                   •   Restriction of access to roadways;
                   •   Limitations on hours of operation or use.
     Policy CI-9:  Improve the operating efficiency of the roadway system through transportation
                   system management strategies (e.g., signal timing, restricted access).
     Policy CI-10: Require that local street systems be logical and, where possible, designed on a
                   “modified grid” system. In areas with significant features or natural resources,
                   deviation from the modified grid system may be allowed.
     Policy CI-11: Discourage the creation of cul-de-sacs except when needed to address specific
                   design constraints.
     Policy CI-12: Undertake street widening and right-of-way acquisition in existing developed
                   areas when required to improve safety.
     Policy CI-13: Improve existing programs for maintaining and upgrading existing streets and
                   constructing street improvements.
                   Action CI-13a:        Require irrevocable offers of dedication and development of
                   right-of-way for roadway improvements when development of property occurs.
     Policy CI-14: Eliminate unnecessary cross-traffic conflicts and reduce traffic disruptions to
                   improve the traffic flow along arterial and collector streets.

CONSERVATION ELEMENT

           5.0 OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
     5.1       INTRODUCTION
               The City of Taft will have a premier system of open space, parks, trails, and conservation
               habitat that serves the needs of all residents. Open space and conservation facilities will
               complement the City’s desire to support a healthy community by blending parks, recreation, and
               the natural environment.
     Open space and conservation lands are made up of lands and facilities that provide enjoyment
     and beauty to the residents of the community. Implementation of this element throughout the
     Planning Area will provide a place for active and passive recreation, help to preserve natural
     resources, and improve air quality. Taft will create and maintain a system of open space, parks,
     conservation habitat, and trails that is regionally unique, blending parks, recreation, and the
     natural environment (including natural resource areas). The city’s open space potential is
     significant and identifies the need to maintain existing open space and natural recreational areas,
     as well as to create additional areas for the enjoyment of residents and the protection of the
     environment.
     The Open Space and Conservation Element identifies the way in which the City will protect,
     maintain, and enhance its natural resources. The goals, policies, and actions provided are
     intended to achieve the City’s vision of open spaces that are accessible to all members of the
     community. This element establishes a policy framework and action program for the
     improvement, expansion, and maintenance of the city’s open space and conservation lands.1
     5.2       RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     The Open Space and Conservation Element relates to several other plans and programs,
     including the following:
         •     Draft Tulare Basin Riparian and Wildlife Corridor Plan, 2009. A draft plan
               completed by Tulare Basin Wildlife Partners focusing on riparian and wildlife corridors
               that connect the Tulare Basin with the foothills on three sides: the Sierra Nevada to the
               east, the Transverse Ranges to the south, and the Coast Ranges to the west; as well as the
               San Joaquin Valley to the north. The Tulare Basin Wildlife Partners have completed four
               comprehensive conservation plans including three regions in the Tulare Basin: Sand
               Ridge - Tulare Lake, Goose Lake and Buena Vista Lake – Kern Lake, as well as a fourth
               plan evaluating 32 riparian and wildlife corridors which flow into the Basin. Portions of
               the City of Taft and the proposed Planning Area are located within the Buena Vista
               Lake-Kern Lake planning area boundary and within the Lokern/Elk Hills/Buena Vista
               Hill Wildlife, Bitter Creek Riparian and Wildlife, San Emigdigo Creek Riparian and
               Wildlife, and Tejon/El Paso Creek Riparian and Wildlife corridors.
     1 This element combines the contents of both the required Open Space and Conservation Elements (Government
     Code §65302(d) and (e)).

                          5.0 OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
         •    Draft Kern County Valley Floor Habitat Conservation Plan. A program involving
              various government, environmental, and industry representatives who are developing a
              strategy to protect state and federally listed threatened and endangered species in the San
              Joaquin Valley portion of Kern County through the issuance of state and federal
              incidental take permits. The plan will identify high priority conservation lands
              surrounding Taft and seek to preserve these lands with conservation easements or fee
              title acquisition. This plan is in process and has not been adopted.
         •    City of Taft Historic Preservation Plan, 2007. Provides guidance for the preservation
              and protection of historic buildings in support of conservation efforts.
         •    Quimby Act. State legislation that allows local jurisdictions to require dedication of land
              and/or payment of fees for park and recreation purposes during the subdivision process.
         •    Williamson Act Contract Program. State legislation that allows landowners to enter
              into 10-year contracts to retain agricultural uses on the contracted land in exchange for
              reduced property tax incentives.
         •    Farmland Security Zone Contract Program. As part of the Williamson Act Contract
              Program, landowners may enter into 20-year contracts to retain agricultural uses on the
              contracted land in exchange for reduced property tax incentives.
    5.3       RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
    Provision of a comprehensive, well-connected, and integrated parks and open space network
    requires planning for future service demands and policies for the siting and design of those
    facilities. Conserving areas of special importance requires policies to allow for the preservation of
    such areas and the protection of these lands from incompatible uses. Therefore, the Open Space
    and Conservation Element works in conjunction with several of the other elements of the
    General Plan, most specifically the following:
         •    The Land Use Element (Chapter 3.0) through designation of lands for agricultural and
              natural resource uses to support the continuation of agricultural practices and
              preservation of natural resources.
         •    The Circulation Element (Chapter 4.0) through policies identifying the standards for
              location and design of bikeway and pedestrian facilities.
         •    The Energy Resources Element (Chapter 7.0) through policies encouraging the
              efficient use of energy and the development of alternative energy facilities.
         •    The Public Facilities and Services Element (Chapter 10.0) through policies to
              protect the quantity and quality of the water supply.

             the continuation and expansion of the agricultural industry.
     Where overlaps in policy issues can be identified, cross-references are provided to alert the
     reader to the specific policy groups of the related elements.
     5.4     ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
     This Open Space and Conservation Element addresses issues identified during the preparation of
     the City’s General Plan through discussions with the Vision Steering Committee, its
     subcommittees, and City staff, and feedback received during the various public meetings. The
     goals, policies, and actions included in this element have been prepared in consideration of these
     issues, which include the need to:
         •   Provide green space, including recreational opportunities, that is accessible to all
             residents.
         •   Prevent the loss of and preserve sustainable agricultural lands and economies.
         •   Conserve and preserve native wildlife, plant communities, and cultural, historic, water,
             and scenic resources.
         •   Address air quality and climate change issues relative to new state legislation.
         •   Reduce inefficient use of resources through the use of sustainable development practices.

ENERGY RESOURCES
        ELEMENT

                                    7.0 ENERGY RESOURCES ELEMENT
     7.1      INTRODUCTION
              Taft will assert the City’s position as an energy producer, including development of alternative
              energies, and will be actively involved in the decisions and actions of other agencies as they affect
              energy development in the areas within and surrounding the City of Taft. The City will continue
              to protect mineral and energy resource lands, avoid conflicts between these lands and urban
              growth, and encourage safe and orderly energy development.
     In the City of Taft, as in all parts of the United States, we depend on energy 24 hours a day and
     we continuously benefit from direct and indirect use of energy resources. Energy is so pervasive
     in our daily lives that it can sometimes be taken for granted. From the sun we draw heat, light,
     and solar power; we depend on it to grow our food, forests, flowers, and the like. We depend on
     fossil fuels to get us to work, school, the local shops, and medical care facilities, and to transport
     our food, commodities, mail, and even garbage. Energy generation and transmission is also an
     industry in and of itself. Clearly, reliance on energy resources characterizes a large part of our
     daily lives.
     In the past, the City of Taft, as well as California as a whole, has relied heavily on the oil industry
     to supply energy. Spurred by regulatory measures and tax incentives, however, California’s
     electrical system has become more reliant on renewable energy sources, including wind energy,
     solar energy, geothermal energy, biomass conversion, transformation plants, small hydroelectric
     plants, and waste heat recovery projects.
     The production and consumption of energy also affects our daily lives in more indirect ways,
     particularly with regard to the environment. Many scientists have stated that the burning of fossil
     fuels has led to adverse worldwide environmental effects such as acid rain, smog, water pollution,
     and global climate change. Without prudent practices, exploratory drilling and extraction of
     nonrenewable energy sources (such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas), and their attendant
     infrastructure, have damaged other natural resources, for example forests, coastal communities,
     and rainforests.
     Because of the oil-related heritage of Taft, this Energy Resources Element focuses on energy
     through petroleum extraction and production; however, recognizing the importance of
     renewable energy sources in today’s environment, it also addresses and encourages the use of
     alternative energy and development of alternative energy production methods.
     The Energy Resources Element intends to protect the City of Taft’s energy resources and to
     encourage orderly energy development while affording the maximum protection for the public’s
     health and safety and for the environment.
     7.2      RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     The Energy Resources Element relates to several other plans and programs, including the
     following:
CITY OF TAFT                                                                                                        JULY 2009

                       7.0 ENERGY RESOURCES ELEMENT
        •  Draft Kern County Valley Floor Habitat Conservation Plan. A program involving
           various government, environmental, and industry representatives who are developing a
           strategy to protect state and federally listed threatened and endangered species in the San
           Joaquin Valley portion of Kern County through the issuance of state and federal
           incidental take permits. Without good planning and foresight, future energy development
           could have potential adverse impacts on Kern County’s natural resources. Environmental
           issues which concern energy production include air quality, water quality, and endangered
           species protection. This plan is in process and has not been adopted.
        •  Kern County and Incorporated Cities Integrated Waste Management Plan.
           Addresses issues pertaining to nonhazardous waste disposal and other waste facilities. Oil
           production and refining generate large quantities of wastes. Most of these wastes are
           nonhazardous; the greatest volume is produced water (brine) and drilling muds (mostly
           clay).
        •  Kern County and Incorporated Cities Hazardous Waste Management Plan, 1991.
           Analyzes information on hazardous waste generation in the county, describes existing
           disposal facilities and assesses the need for new and expanded facilities, analyzes potential
           for waste reduction, and creates programs for local hazardous waste management. There
           is hazardous waste produced in conjunction with oil-producing operations. These wastes
           are transported to licensed recycling or disposal facilities. The state, however, is facing
           decreased hazardous waste disposal capacity.
           Waste disposal is regulated by several federal and state agencies. Hazardous waste control
           laws are becoming more stringent and it is becoming increasingly difficult to site new
           hazardous waste disposal facilities.
        •  Bureau of Land Management, Caliente Resource Management Plan (RMP), 1997.
           This plan encompasses Kern County west of the crest of the Sierra Nevada, Tulare
           County, Kings County, San Luis Obispo County, Santa Barbara County, and Ventura
           County. The revision will address new opportunities for public use and resource
           protection. The RMP also outlines the permitted uses on federally owned parcels of land.
           A revision of the Caliente RMP commenced in March 2008.
    7.3    RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
    Energy resource development requires an adequate supply of land, protection of resource lands,
    proper environmental regulations, and a properly trained workforce. Therefore, the Energy
    Resources Element works in conjunction with several of the other elements of this General Plan,
    most specifically the following:
        •  The Land Use Element (Chapter 3.0) through designation of lands for natural
           resources, including the protection of energy and mineral resources, and through policies
           allowing the development of energy-related facilities in multiple land use designations.

     8.1     INTRODUCTION
             The City will strive to ensure comfortable and safe noise levels throughout the community so that
             residents, employees, and visitors may enjoy indoor and outdoor spaces without the intrusion of
             harmful levels of noise.
     Noise is any unwanted sound that interferes with an individual’s ability to perform a task or
     enjoy an activity. Removing or reducing the impact of significant sources of noise will improve
     quality of life for Taft’s residents, employees, and visitors. The City will remove major sources of
     noise when possible and mitigate the impacts of all other noise-producing activities.
     This Noise Element is intended to address unwanted sounds for the health, safety, and welfare
     of the community, while protecting existing noise-producing uses from encroachment by
     sensitive uses. The goals, policies, and actions provided will, when implemented, improve the
     noise environment in the Planning Area.
     8.2     RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     The Noise Element relates to several other plans and programs, including the following:
         •   Kern Council of Governments Destination 2030 Regional Transportation Plan
             (RTP), 2007. In addition to setback recommendations when siting future transportation
             facilities near land uses that are sensitive receptors for noise, the RTP, administered by
             Kern COG, also recommends particular setbacks for sensitive land uses adjacent to
             airports in Kern County.
         •   County of Kern, Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, September 1996, amended
             June 2003, March 2004, and November 2008. The Taft-Kern County Airport, a public
             use, general aviation airport, is located within the Planning Area. The airport site
             comprises approximately 71 acres of land and contains one runway. The airport is owned
             and operated by the County Department of Airports in accordance with planning and
             land use procedures and criteria contained in the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
             (ALUCP). This plan establishes planning boundaries for height, noise, and safety around
             the airport and also determines compatibility of surrounding land uses based upon noise
             levels associated with the airport operations and exposure of persons to crash hazards
             associated with aircraft and height restrictions.
             A study is currently being conducted to determine the feasibility of retaining the Taft-
             Kern Airport at its existing site. The airport may be upgraded to meet design standards
             and future demands at the existing location or an alternative site evaluation for a
             replacement airport will be initiated. The feasibility study is anticipated to be completed
             in late 2009.

                        8.0 NOISE ELEMENT
    8.3     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
    Protection from potential noise issues requires regulation and good design policies. Therefore,
    the Noise Element works in conjunction with several of the other elements of this General Plan,
    including the following:
        •   The Land Use Element (Chapter 3.0) through designation of land use patterns as well
            as development and design policies to ensure land use compatibility.
        •   The Circulation Element (Chapter 4.0) through the identification of the city’s
            circulation network where potential noise sources may occur.
    Where overlaps in policy issues can be identified, cross-references are provided to alert the
    reader to the related elements.
    8.4     ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
    This Noise Element addresses issues identified during the preparation of the City’s General Plan
    through discussions with the Vision Steering Committee, its subcommittees, City staff, and
    feedback received during the various public meetings. The goals, policies, and actions included in
    this element have been prepared in consideration of these issues, which include the need to:
        •   Utilize best land use practices to more effectively address the impact of noise on sensitive
            land uses.
        •   Minimize the use of soundwalls to eliminate their impact to the community such as
            unsightly streetscapes and disruption to pedestrian movement.
        •   Maintain livable neighborhoods in the community by locating noise-producing land uses
            away from noise-sensitive land uses.
        •   Retain existing businesses by providing protection for noise-producing uses from
            encroaching noise-sensitive uses.

             The City of Taft will strive to protect the personal health, safety, and welfare of the people of
             greater Taft from natural and manmade hazards and disturbance.
     Safety is an important aspect in ensuring the general well-being of city residents, and it
     encompasses the response to many manmade and naturally occurring hazards. The City’s
     response to general safety concerns will determine its success in maintaining and attracting
     residents and businesses. Taft will seek to create an enjoyable environment that keeps all
     residents, employees, and visitors safe from harm.
     This Safety Element seeks to recognize and remedy both present and anticipated concerns about
     the ongoing well-being of city residents, employees, and visitors. The goals, policies, and actions
     identify viable solutions to minimize the potential risk of death, injuries, property damage, and
     economic hardship and social displacement resulting from fires, floods, earthquakes, landslides,
     and other hazards. Additionally, this element addresses safety and hazards related to the potential
     release of hazardous materials into the community and general issues related to police and fire
     protection services.
     9.2     RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     The Safety Element relates to several other plans and programs, including the following:
         •   Kern County Disaster Preparedness Guide, 2008. A guide for the citizens of Kern
             County to help prepare for disasters such as dam inundation, wildfires, earthquakes, and
             floods.
         •   Kern County Emergency Operations Plan, 2008. The Kern County Emergency
             Operations Plan establishes an emergency management organization and provides for the
             integration and coordination of planning efforts of the County/Operational Area with
             those of its cities, special districts, and the state. The plan content is based on guidance
             provided by the California Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Emergency
             Management Agency, and the Department of Homeland Security and is intended to
             facilitate emergency response and short-term recovery by providing a framework for
             response to all significant emergencies, regardless of the nature of the event.
         •   Kern County Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan, 2005. The plan puts forth several
             mitigation goals and objectives that are based on the results of a risk assessment. The
             plan includes specific recommendations for actions that can mitigate future disaster
             losses. The plan also includes a review of the County’s current capabilities to reduce
             hazard impacts. The multi-jurisdictional plan includes the County and the incorporated
             municipalities including Taft. This plan also covers 45 special districts including school,
             recreation and park, water, community service, and other districts. This plan has been

                         9.0 SAFETY ELEMENT
        •   Kern County Terrorism Response and Recovery Contingency Plan, 2003. This plan
            is designed to establish responsibilities and to coordinate preparedness, response, and
            recovery from a terrorist-initiated incident, with emphasis placed upon incidents
            involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). This plan supplements the Kern
            County Emergency Operations Plan and is intended to provide general guidance. Actual
            response will be dependent upon conditions existing at the time of the emergency,
            including the availability of local and mutual aid resources.
        •   County of Kern Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, September 1996, amended
            June 2003, March 2004, and November 2008. The Taft-Kern County Airport, a public
            use, general aviation airport, is located within the Planning Area. The airport site
            comprises approximately 71 acres of land and contains one runway. The airport is owned
            and operated by the County Department of Airports in accordance with planning and
            land use procedures and criteria contained in the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
            (ALUCP). This plan establishes planning boundaries for height, noise, and safety around
            the airport and also determines compatibility of surrounding land uses based upon noise
            levels associated with the airport operations and exposure of persons to crash hazards
            associated with aircraft and height restrictions.
            A study is currently being conducted to determine the feasibility of retaining the Taft-
            Kern Airport at its existing site. The airport may be upgraded to meet design standards
            and future demands at the existing location or an alternative site evaluation for a
            replacement airport will be initiated. The feasibility study is anticipated to be completed
            in late 2009.
        •   City of Taft Downtown Specific Plan, 1999. Identifies actions to remediate
            unreinforced masonry (URM) in its overlay area, including establishing a program of
            incentives to remediate URM properties.
    In addition to the plans and programs listed above, the following agencies provide support and
    oversight on safety related issues within the Planning Area:
        •   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA is the federal agency
            charged with preparing the nation for all hazards and effectively managing federal
            responses and recovery efforts following any national incident (e.g., major flood,
            earthquake, tornado, and hurricane). FEMA also initiates proactive mitigation activities,
            trains first responders, and manages the National Flood Insurance Program and the U.S.
            Fire Administration. FEMA will coordinate with the City’s designated emergency
            responders.
        •   Plans and Actions of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The
            EPA regulates cleanup of groundwater contamination and other pollutants that may be
            unsafe to humans and the natural environment. There are cleanup sites within the
            Planning Area, which must comply with the regulations of the EPA.

         •   Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (OES). The OES coordinates overall state
             agency response to major disasters in support of local government. The office is
             responsible for assuring the state’s readiness to respond to and recover from natural,
             manmade, and war-caused emergencies and for assisting local governments in their
             emergency preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. OES will review and support
             the City’s adoption of a local Emergency Management Plan.
     9.3     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
     The protection of personal health, safety, and welfare from both natural and manmade hazards
     requires proactive planning to minimize potential conflicts and procedures for emergency
     preparedness. Therefore, the Safety Element works in conjunction with several of the other
     elements of this General Plan, most specifically the following:
         •   The Land Use Element (Chapter 3.0) through designation of lands to minimize
             potential conflicts between land uses and through policies addressing land use
             compatibility.

AND SERVICES ELEMENT

        10.0 PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
     10.1    INTRODUCTION
             The City will be a regional draw for businesses, families, and cultural activities by providing
             efficient and well-maintained infrastructure systems and public services. Taft will seek to ensure
             high-quality water, wastewater, schools, health care, and multipurpose public facilities are
             available to all Taft citizens and businesses.
     Creating a successful, healthy community requires good land use planning, development of
     sound infrastructure systems, and the provision of services to meet the needs of the community.
     The City will prioritize public facilities infrastructure and services, increasing Taft’s regional
     desirability. The City will strive to assure that adequate public services and infrastructure systems
     are provided to residents in all current neighborhoods and future developments. Ultimately, the
     infrastructure and services will be provided at the time they are needed.
     This element seeks to identify the ideal level and type of infrastructure and service provision
     necessary to achieving the goal of providing a high service level to the residents of Taft. The
     goals, policies, and actions contained in the element set forth methods for ensuring that Taft
     provides the highest service levels possible.
     10.2 RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     The Public Facilities and Services Element relates to several other plans and programs, including
     the following:
         •   City of Taft, Master Grading/Drainage Plan, March 2002. The goal of the plan is to
             facilitate orderly development within the city and promote efficient use of city resources
             in addressing stormwater needs, with as much stormwater runoff as possible to be routed
             by a combination of drains, open channels, culverts, and streets to the existing creeks,
             thereby preventing flood damage. This plan will be updated to reflect new policies
             including the use of Low Impact Development (LID) techniques, bio swales and natural
             drainage, and other measures related to flood control and drainage.
         •   Draft 2020 Municipal Service Plan, City of Taft. The 2020 Plan has been developed
             to assist the City of Taft and its many clients/partners, including other governmental and
             public agencies and private sector businesses as well as the public at large, in effective
             planning for the future installation of public infrastructure. The basic infrastructure
             services addressed in this plan are water services, wastewater services, and traffic
             circulation and local streets.
         •   Kern County and Incorporated Cities Integrated Waste Management Plan.
             Addresses issues pertaining to nonhazardous waste disposal and other waste facilities. Oil
             production and refining generate large quantities of waste. Most of these wastes are
             nonhazardous; the greatest volume is produced water (brine) and drilling muds (mostly
             clay).
CITY OF TAFT                                                                                                    JULY 2009

                        10.0 PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
        •    Kern County and Incorporated Cities Hazardous Waste Management Plan, 1991.
             Analyzes information on hazardous waste generation in the county, describes existing
             disposal facilities and assesses the need for new and expanded facilities, analyzes potential
             for waste reduction, and creates programs for local hazardous waste management. There
             is a certain amount of hazardous waste produced in conjunction with oil-producing
             operations. These wastes are transported to licensed recycling or disposal facilities.
             Waste disposal is regulated by several federal and state agencies. Hazardous waste control
             laws are becoming more stringent and it is becoming increasingly difficult to site new
             hazardous waste disposal facilities.
    10.3 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
    First-rate public facilities and services require planning for current and future service demand
    needed for construction and maintenance of those facilities. Therefore, the Public Facilities and
    Services Element works in conjunction with several of the other elements of this General Plan,
    most specifically the following:
        •    The Land Use Element (Chapter 3.0) through designation of lands for public facilities.
             The planned development identified on the Land Use Map also influences the demand
             for public facilities.
        •    The Open Space and Conservation Element (Chapter 5.0) through policies
             supporting water conservation and the use of reclaimed water as well as policies
             encouraging the shared use of public and private facilities.
        •    The Safety Element (Chapter 9.0) through policies addressing the provision of
             adequate emergency and health care services and personnel.
        •    The Economic Development Element (Chapter 11.0) through policies encouraging
             education and training of the workforce by way of coordination with Taft area schools
             for the retention and expansion of educational institutions.
    Where overlaps in policy issues can be identified, cross-references are provided to alert the
    reader to the specific policy group of the related elements.
    10.4 ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
    This Public Facilities and Services Element addresses issues identified during the preparation of
    the City’s General Plan through discussions with the Vision Steering Committee, its
    subcommittees, and City staff, and feedback received during the various public meetings. The
    goals, policies, and actions included in this element have been prepared in consideration of these
    issues, which include the need to:

             ELEMENT

                        11.0 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
     11.1     INTRODUCTION
              Taft’s economic development efforts will provide a continuing favorable business climate for new
              and existing businesses in order to maintain the high quality of life in our family-friendly and
              growth-oriented community.
     Economic development is the enhancement of a community’s productive capabilities, largely
     through the creation and retention of jobs and revenue. Concentrating efforts on economic
     development will provide more job opportunities for Taft residents and will produce more
     revenue, allowing the City to provide higher levels of service. The process of economic
     development also increases economic opportunity for local businesses and property owners.
     Redevelopment and other tools will help form public-private partnerships to revive existing
     buildings, stimulate infill and catalyst projects, and upgrade and replace the city’s aging
     infrastructure. Taft will promote economic development as a way to improve the city’s regional
     desirability, revitalize existing commercial areas, and improve the quality of life for all city
     residents and businesses.
     This Economic Development Element attempts to provide a full range of employment,
     retail/service, and entertainment options and addresses the jobs-to-housing balance. The element
     establishes goals, policies, and actions to improve the city’s prosperity, maintain regional
     competitiveness, and market the city. This element is also intended to create and retain wealth
     for the citizens of Taft by providing opportunities to increase property values, offering
     continuing education opportunities, and supporting entrepreneurship.
     11.2     RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     The Economic Development Element relates to several other plans and programs, including the
     following:
         •    Taft Community Development Agency (TCDA) Redevelopment Plan. The
              Redevelopment Plan currently covers approximately 900 acres in central Taft, which
              allows collection of tax increment revenue for the purpose of improving and
              redeveloping commercial and residential areas and supports the production of mixed-
              income housing in the city. The TCDA is currently working on an expansion of the
              Redevelopment Plan Area from the existing 900 acres to 2,205 acres.
         •    Taft Community Development Agency (TCDA) 3rd Five-Year Implementation
              Plan and Housing Plan, 2005–2009. The TCDA’s five-year plan outlines goals and
              objectives for the purpose of eliminating blight and providing affordable housing and
              specifically designated project areas of the city.
         •    City of Taft Five-Year Economic Development Strategy. Identifies strategies to
              grow a diversified economy, improve the jobs-to-housing ratio, and create opportunities
              from existing community resources.
CITY OF TAFT                                                                                                   JULY 2009

                        11.0 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
         •   Enterprise Zone. An Enterprise Zone is a specific geographic area targeted for
             economic revitalization through encouragement of economic growth and investment in
             distressed areas by offering tax advantages and incentives to businesses locating within
             the zone boundaries. Taft, in conjunction with Kern County, is currently applying for
             establishment of an Enterprise Zone.
    11.3     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
    Economic prosperity requires an adequate supply of land and structures, a strong adequately
    trained local workforce, trade opportunities, and a sound infrastructure system. Therefore, the
    Economic Development Element works in conjunction with several of the other elements of
    this General Plan, most specifically the following:
         •   The Land Use Element (Chapter 3.0) through designation of lands that support the
             use of the local labor force for jobs in the community by encouraging a mix of uses that
             would allow retail and office uses to locate proximal to residential uses, thereby achieving
             a healthy jobs-to-housing balance. The Land Use Element also contains policies that
             elevate design standards to improve the overall community image and encourage
             business investment.
         •   The Energy Resources Element (Chapter 7.0) through policies encouraging retention
             and training of the workforce as it relates to energy technology and advancement.
         •   The Public Facilities and Services (Chapter 10.0) through policies that require
             adequate infrastructure systems are available to support new business and expansion of
             existing businesses.
    Where overlaps in policy issues can be identified, cross-references are provided to alert the
    reader to the specific policy group of the related elements.
    11.4     ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
    It is the intent of this Economic Development Element to address issues identified during the
    preparation of the City’s General Plan through discussions with the Vision Steering Committee,
    its subcommittees, and City staff, and feedback received during the various public meetings. The
    goals, policies, and actions included in this element have been prepared in consideration of these
    issues, which include the need to:
         •   Create a diversified and resilient economy through expanding opportunities for retail,
             industry, and amenities.
         •   Attract businesses that are economically sustainable, create new wealth, and give back to
             the City in the form of new taxes, jobs, and opportunities.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

                                                12.0 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
     Although the General Plan is a policy document, serving as the foundation for Taft’s Ordinances
     and expenditures, it also includes “Action Items” intended to indicate how the City will
     implement goals and policies within the body of the Plan.
     Action Items are included in all elements of the General Plan except the Housing Element,
     which includes its own implementation plan and quantified objectives.1 In general, Action Items
     are scattered throughout each of the other elements, appearing immediately after the
     corresponding policy.
     12.1      IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION ITEMS
     This Implementation Plan repeats the Action Items from each of the eight elements contained in
     this General Plan and indicates who will be the lead entity responsible for their implementation.
     The responsible implementing department/agency has been identified with a parenthetical
     reference at the end of each Action Item (refer to the Legend at the end of Section 12.2: Action
     Items for department/agency codes).
     The department/agency identified represents the entity with the primary role in implementing
     the identified Action Item. It is assumed that the identified responsible party would coordinate as
     necessary with other departments and agencies to carry out the specified Action Item.
     Many of these actions will require both human and financial resources to implement, thus
     making them difficult to definitively schedule given the annual nature of the budgetary process
     and changing priorities over the years. However, each of the Action Items has been identified
     with a parenthetical reference to the letters A, B, or C to indicate a relative priority for
     implementation.
     More specifically, the letter A implies that the Action Item will be implemented with the highest,
     first tier priority. The letter B implies a second tier priority for implementation. An Action Item
     accompanied by the letter C indicates a third tier priority for implementation.
     In other cases, the reader may notice the use of the term “ongoing” which refers to actions
     already being undertaken by the City or those that are expected to continue on either a periodic
     or perpetual basis. In some situations there may be an Action Item with a priority such as A, B,
     or C identified in conjunction with the term “ongoing”. This indicates that the Action Item
     requires both an initial action and ongoing maintenance by the responsible party to implement
     the designated item.
     Implementation of any policy document like a General Plan will take careful consideration over
     many years. In addition to supporting the pursuit of Action Items listed below, Taft’s decision-
     makers will implement this plan each time they adopt an ordinance or authorize a capital

    expenditure. When taking these actions, Taft’s decision-makers must affirmatively find them to
    be consistent with the General Plan. In this way, the General Plan will be implemented by a
    series of incremental decisions informed by its goals and policies.
    The City will carefully assess potential consequences and alternatives preceding every action, and
    individual decisions will be scrutinized for their potential impacts and their consistency with this
    General Plan.
    In addition, this General Plan itself is likely to require careful monitoring and updating over time
    through an “adaptive management” approach to allow the City to respond to changing
    conditions and keep this document relevant. By adopting an adaptive management approach,
    this General Plan assumes that as technological advances occur and as conditions on the ground
    change, the City’s policy framework should change accordingly. Thus, General Plan
    amendments—while never a simple or common occurrence—should be expected from time to
    time.

    Subdivision – The division of a lot, tract, parcel, or other unit of land for the purpose of sale,
    lease, or financing.
    Sustainable Energy Source – See Alternative Energy.
    Tax Increment Financing – A method to use the future gains in taxes to finance the current
    improvements that will create those gains. When a public project such as a road, school, or
    hazardous waste cleanup is carried out, there is often an increase in the value of surrounding real
    estate, and perhaps new investment (new or rehabilitated buildings, for example). This increased
    site value and investment generate increased tax revenues. The increased tax revenues are the tax
    increment. Tax increment financing dedicates tax increments within a certain defined district to
    finance debt issued to pay for the project. Tax increment financing is designed to channel
    funding toward improvements in distressed or underdeveloped areas where development would
    not otherwise occur. Tax increment financing may be used to create funding for public projects
    that may otherwise be unaffordable to localities. See Tax Increment Funds.
    Tax Increment Funds – Monies resulting from the use of tax increment financing. See Tax
    Increment Financing.
    Telecommuting – A work arrangement in which employees enjoy flexibility in working location
    and hours. The daily commute to a central place of work is replaced by telecommunication links.
    Also known as e-commuting.
    Universal Access – The ability of all people to have equal opportunity and access to a service or
    product from which they can benefit, regardless of their social class, ethnicity, background, or
    physical disabilities.
    Urban Forestry – The care and management of urban forests, i.e., tree populations in urban
    settings for the purpose of improving the urban environment. Urban forestry advocates the role
    of trees as a critical part of the urban infrastructure.
    Vanpool – A form of transportation that allows groups of people to share a ride from home or
    one or more common meeting locations and travel together to a common destination or work
    center. Similar to a carpool but on a larger scale.
    Watershed – A region or area over which water flows into a particular lake, reservoir, stream, or
    river.
    Wayfinding – Encompasses all of the ways in which people orient themselves in physical space
    and navigate from place to place.
    Williamson Act Land Contracts – A minimum 10-year contract for the purpose of restricting
    specific parcels of land to agriculture or related open space uses. Contracts renew automatically
    every year unless a “notice of nonrenewal” is filed. In return, the parcels under contract are
    assessed for property tax purposes at a rate consistent with their actual use, rather than potential
    market value.

     to convert the kinetic energy of wind into mechanical or electrical energy that can be used for
     power, often through the use of turbines.
     Xeriscape – Method of landscaping that uses plant materials whose natural requirements are
     appropriate to the local climate, resulting in low water use and low maintenance.
     Zero Net Energy Buildings – Buildings with zero net energy consumption and zero carbon
     emissions annually.
     Zero Waste – The theory that a society, organization, or process can reduce, re-use or recycle all
     of its waste, so that it does not produce any waste with economic value needing final disposal.
     Zoning – A division of a community into districts and the application of different regulations in
     each district.
     Zoning Ordinance – A law consisting of a map and text that divides all land in a community

      SUSTAINABLE
GOALS AND POLICIES

       APPENDIX A: SUSTAINABLE GOALS AND POLICIES
     In order to move toward a sustainable community, this General Plan established principles of
     good planning and a proactive approach to future development. These sustainable principles
     have been incorporated throughout the elements of this General Plan and address the City of
     Taft’s role in the implementation of California law and address each of the three E’s of
     sustainability – Environment, Economy, and Equity (refer to Chapter 2.0: Planning for a Sustainable
     Community).
     Goals and policies based on sustainable or “green” principles have been incorporated
     throughout each of the General Plan elements and are identified through the use of a leaf
     symbol. Appendix A provides a summary of all of the Goals, Policies, and Action Items that
     support sustainable principles.
     3.0     LAND USE ELEMENT
     LAND USE GOALS
     Goal LU-2: A sustainable community.
     Goal LU-4: A vibrant, active, healthy, walkable Downtown.
     Goal LU-5: Protection of the natural resources and agricultural uses in the
                      Planning Area.
     Goal LU-6: A pattern of land use which enhances the community character of
                      Taft, provides employment and shopping opportunities to serve
                      residents and the region, provides for use of transit, and protects
                      Taft’s unique historical and natural features.
     LAND USE POLICIES: GENERAL
     Policy LU-1: Encourage infill development in the existing urban areas of the Planning Area.
     Policy LU-3: Promote sustainable development practices.
     Policy LU-4: Support alternative development techniques to promote the conservation of land
                      for open space, natural resource, or agricultural uses.
     LAND USE POLICIES: LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
     Policy LU-7 The following standards apply to lands designated as Agriculture on Figure
                      3.0-1a and Figure 3.0-1b (Land Use Maps) of the General Plan.
                      Intent: To provide areas where the predominant land use is agriculturally oriented
                      and to identify areas in the Planning Area in which agriculture is now and should
                      continue to be the predominant land use, where land uses incompatible with
CITY OF TAFT                                                                                    JULY 2009
PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT GENERAL PLAN                                                                         A-1

                     APPENDIX A: SUSTAINABLE GOALS AND POLICIES
                  agriculture should be precluded, and where the development of urban type land
                  uses would be detrimental to the continuance of agriculture which is an economic
                  and aesthetic attribute to the area. Continuance of existing non-agricultural
                  development may be allowed. It is expected that this designation will have a very
                  low population to acre ratio, anticipating less than one person per acre.
                  This land use designation also allows the City to implement Williamson Act Land
                  Contracts, including Farmland Security Zones, to ensure the continued viability
                  of agriculture.
                  Maximum Dwelling Density: 1 dwelling unit per 20 gross acres (0.5 DU/Ac);
                  except, 1 dwelling unit per 80 gross acres (0.0125 DU/Ac) for land subject to the
                  Williamson Act/Farmland Security Zone Contracts.
    Policy LU-8: The following standards apply to lands designated as Natural Resources on
                  Figure 3.0-1a and Figure 3.0-1b (Land Use Maps) of the General Plan.
                  Intent: This designation is applied to lands that have proven petroleum, mineral,
                  or biotic resources. Most of the land within this land use designation is utilized
                  for oil-related uses, including exploration, reserves, pipelines, and storage
                  facilities. Much of this land also provides added benefits, such as open space and
                  wildlife habitat. It is expected that this designation will have a very low
                  population to acre ratio, anticipating less than one person per acre.
                  This land use designation also provides for the continuation of agricultural uses
                  and allows the City to implement Williamson Act Land Contracts, including
                  Farmland Security Zones.
                  Maximum Dwelling Density: 1 dwelling unit per 5 gross acres (0.2 DU/Ac); 1
                  dwelling unit per 20 gross acres (0.5 DU/Ac) for land subject to the Williamson
                  Act Contract; 1 dwelling unit per 80 gross acres (0.0125 DU/Ac) for land subject
                  to the Williamson Act/Farmland Security Zone Contracts
    Policy LU-14: The following standards apply to lands designated as Mixed Use on Figure 3.0-
                  1a and Figure 3.0-1b (Land Use Maps) of the General Plan.
                  Intent: To encourage a mix of residential, office, and retail uses in designated
                  areas of the community. The Mixed Use designation is concentrated in the
                  Downtown area and other appropriate areas as shown on Figure 3.0-1 (Land Use
                  Map). It is expected that this designation will have a population to acre ratio of
                  up to 78 persons per acre. Building intensity in this designation may cover the
                  entire parcel and reach to several floors.
                  Maximum Dwelling Density: 29 dwelling units per gross acre (29 DU/Ac)

                   3.0-1a and Figure 3.0-1b (Land Use Maps) of the General Plan.
                   Intent: This designation is applied to lands that will remain generally free of
                   buildings, except buildings incidental to active and passive parks. Land uses
                   allowed include passive and active recreational facilities, including but not limited
                   to parks, golf courses, and trails. It is expected that this designation will not have
                   population as the uses are not intended to include residential development.
                   However, there may be some associated residential uses but the population to
                   acre ratio is expected to be very low, anticipating less than one person per acre.

                   in all neighborhoods.
     Policy LU-31: Provide for ancillary commercial development in office parks, such as training,
                   day care, restaurants, cleaners, mail centers, and financial institutions.
                   Commercial uses should be limited so as to complement the developments they
                   are serving.
     Policy LU-32: Encourage clustered, smaller-scale office and professional land uses throughout
                   the community to meet the needs of nearby neighborhoods.

     Policy PF-3: Except when prohibited by state law, require that infrastructure systems be
                   available on time to maintain desired service levels and avoid capacity shortages,

                   facilities.
     PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES POLICIES: INFRASTRUCTURE
     Policy PF-6: Phase public facilities in a logical manner to avoid “leapfrog” development and
