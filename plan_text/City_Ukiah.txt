Updated General Plan Housing Element

Housing Element
2014-2019 Ukiah General Plan Housing Element Update
Background
Every California city and county is required to include a housing strategy in its general plan that
establishes housing goals, policies, and programs that respond to the community’s housing
conditions and needs. The City of Ukiah adopted its last updated Housing Element in 2011.
The California Department of Housing and Community Development found the Element to be in
substantial conformance with State law later that same year. This Housing Element updates
that document, discusses who we are as a community, what the City has accomplished in the
past in regard to housing, what the key issues are for the next five years, and how the City
intends to respond to those issues and address the housing needs of the community.
The primary housing challenge for the City of Ukiah over the next five years is how to meet
local housing needs with a slumping economy, municipal structural deficit and the loss of the
City Redevelopment Agency that has provided millions of dollars in funding over the past 20
years.
The City updated its General Plan Housing Element in 2011 (2009-2014) and it was certified by
the State Department of Housing and Community Development. The City, with limited staff
resources and funding has had success implementing the programs contained in the Element.
The 2014-2019 updated Housing Element builds on this success and focuses on what can
realistically be achieved in the coming years given anticipated limited Staff and financial
resources.
What is Required?
The Housing Element responds to Ukiah’s housing needs by identifying policies and
implementing actions for meeting those needs. State law defines the general topics that Ukiah’s
Housing Element must cover. Specifically, the element must: (1) document housing related
conditions and trends; (2) provide an assessment of housing needs; (3) identify resources,
opportunities and constraints to meeting those needs; and (4) establish policies, programs and
quantified objectives to address housing needs.
Overview of State Law Requirements
                                                                                                  5
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

State law establishes requirements for all portions of the General Plan. However, for the
Housing Element, the State requirements tend to be more specific and extensive than for other
elements. The purpose of a Housing Element is described in Government Code
§65583.
         “The housing element shall consist of an identification and analysis of existing
         and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified
         objectives, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and
         development of housing. The housing element shall identify adequate sites for
         housing, including rental housing, factory-built housing, and mobilehomes, and
         shall make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all
         economic segments of the community.”
While jurisdictions must review and revise all elements of their General Plan on a regular basis
to ensure that they remain up to date, State law requires that Housing Elements be reviewed
and updated at least every five years. The process of updating Housing Elements is to be
initiated by the State through the regional housing needs process, as described later in this
document. The regional housing needs process was recently conducted in 2008.
State law is also quite specific in terms of what the Housing Element must contain:
     1. “An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant
         to meeting these needs . . .”
     2. “A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to the
         maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing . . .”
     3. “A program which sets forth a five-year schedule of actions the local government is
         undertaking or intends to undertake to       implement the policies and achieve the goals and
         objectives of the housing element            through the administration of land use and
         development controls, provision of            regulatory incentives, and the utilization of
         appropriate federal and state financing      and subsidy programs when available . . .”
     4. The Housing Element must: (1) identify adequate sites with appropriate zoning densities
         and infrastructure to meet the community’s need for housing (including its need for very
         low, low and moderate income households); and (2) address, and where appropriate
         and legally possible, remove governmental constraints to housing development.
     5. An assessment of homeless needs and the opportunity for the creation of emergency
         shelters and transitional/supportive housing. The opportunity must encourage these
         facilities while providing flexibility for existing local strategies and cooperative efforts.
     6. An evaluation of Military Compatibility and whether or not the City of Ukiah meets one of
         the three criteria that require measures to ensure compatibility.
This updated General Plan Housing Element contains these required ingredients, but begins
with who we are as a community, what we’ve accomplished in terms of housing, and what our
guiding principles are.
                                                                                                       6
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

Who Are We?
Ukiah is a diverse community with a variety of cultural influences. There is a significant senior
population and a growing Hispanic population. There is also a significant homeless population
with an increase in homeless persons unwilling to utilize the local shelter facility and other
services. Even so, the local Plowshares Peace and Justice Center dining hall served 60,678
meals to those in need in 2012.
There is also a dedicated number of people working in the public and social service fields who
are committed to creating opportunity for and developing affordable shelter. While local, State
and Federal funding has decreased for affordable housing projects, the City of Ukiah has
explored new ways to provide assistance. The City has also modified its zoning code to provide
more opportunity for affordable housing, and purposefully maintained low fees for planning
permits for affordable housing projects.
Interestingly, according to the State Department of Finance Demographic Unit, the City’s
population declined between 2004 and 2008. Overall, the population has decreased 187 people
since the 2004 Housing Element was adopted and certified.

The median home price is have increased slightly from approximately $240,000 to $250,000
since 2011. In June of 2009, there were 148 foreclosure homes for sale on the Ukiah market.
In September of 2013, there were between 36 and 53 foreclosure homes in the City limits.
Overpayment: U.S. Census data reveals that 1,909 of 6,523 (29) lower income households
used more than 30% of their income for housing costs. This reflects the slow growth and

Implementing Tasks are included in this Housing Element to address the overpayment issue.
These include limiting the conversion of rental units to condominiums, limiting the conversion of
single family homes to professional offices, pursuit of the consideration of an inclusionary
housing ordinance, supporting applications for affordable rental housing financing, amending
the zoning code to allow single room occupancy developments by right, permitting small lot
subdivisions, and working closer with affordable housing advocates and developers to facilitate
affordable rental housing.
What Have we Accomplished in the Past?
Since 1990, 169 single family residential units and 349 multiple family units have been
constructed in the City for a total of 518 residential housing units. The relatively low numbers
over the past five years are a result of the lack of vacant land, a lack of unconstrained land,
increased land prices, and a slumping economy.
The majority of new residential units over the past ten years have been affordable and market
rate apartments, sweat-equity affordable units, and special needs housing. Even still, shortages
remain for these types of housing.
The major affordable housing accomplishments the City has achieved include:
        The contribution of over 4-millon dollars of Redevelopment Agency Housing funds to
         affordable housing projects since 1991.
        Established and maintained lower planning permit fees for affordable housing projects.
        Modified the commercial zoning district regulations to permit affordable and high density
         housing in all commercial zones.
                                                                                                  10

         Lane sweat equity single family homes, Main Street Village mixed use project, and
         others.
         The Summer Creek Village affordable Apartments were financed in part with a City

         The Clara Court affordable apartment project was financed in part with City
         Redevelopment 20% set-a-side funds and is comprised of 32 units available to
         extremely low, very low, and low income residents. It is ideally situated on a major
         transportation corridor and bus route in close proximity to retail shopping, the Ukiah
         Valley Medical Center, and other services. Ground breaking is expected in 2010.
         In October, 2010, the City deferred the $413,284 water, wastewater, and electrical
         connection fees when it issued the building permit for the Clara Court project. These

        2009-2014 Housing Production: Housing production in the City and surrounding Ukiah
         Valley has been sluggish for many years. Due to the significant economic decline
         beginning in 2008, the lack of housing production has slowed even further and new
         units within the City limits were essentially non-existent.
    o     2015 the City donated a 1.4 acre site for the construction of 42 low and very including
          5 extremely low-income senior units. The City also deferred over $500,000 in sewer,
          water and other fees to assist the project.

What are we currently working on?
Even with reduced Staff and limited resources, the City is currently engaged in a number of
affordable housing projects.
HOME Grant: In 2013, the City, with the assistance of the Community Development
Commission of Mendocino County, completed administering a CDBG grant for first time home
buyer assistance program. Four participants secured loan funding that enabled them to
become home buyers in the community. The four loans/grants totaled $302,300. The City is
currently seeking an additional grant to continue the program in 2014.
Downtown Zoning Code: The City adopted and is implementing a new Downtown Zoning
Code (Form Based Code), which provides new opportunities for medium and high density
residential development in and near the historic downtown. Incentives are being discussed for
projects involving affordable housing that may include density bonuses, relaxation of parking
requirements, and fast-track permit processing.
City-Owned Property: The City is working with an affordable housing developer on an
affordable senior housing project to be located on City-owned property (to be sold to
developers) near the urban core of the City near medical services, shopping, transit, etc.
The City is also in preliminary discussions with another interested housing partner regarding a
second City-owned property in close proximity to the historic downtown core.
CDBG Grant: The City recently secured a $1 million dollar CDBG grant for 1) low income
residents to participate in the City’s residential sewer lateral testing and repair program; and 2)
Major repairs and upgrades for an existing RCHDC affordable housing project.
Local Housing Development: The City Staff have been working with a local developer on a
number of housing projects ranging from a new duplex in the downtown to a 30+ unit
apartment complex adjacent to major shopping, offices and the local transit system. Further
the City donated 1.4 acres of infill parcels to PEP Housing for the construction of 42 low income
senior units.
In 2015, the City approved a 28-unit multi-family infill market rate project. Also in 2015 the City
approved a 2-unit duplex located on an infill parcel.
New Approaches: The City is developing new approaches to affordable housing facilitation
due to the loss of the Ukiah Redevelopment Agency.
                                                                                                   13
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

What are our Guiding Principles for Housing?
The foundations for our guiding principles for housing are to provide housing for all in need and
to do so in a way that responds to climate change.
     1. Supply affordable housing to the full range of our workforce and all economic segments
         of our diverse community.
     2. Protect the surrounding agricultural lands and avoid urban sprawl.
     3. Carefully focus new housing development on vacant, underutilized, and redevelopment
         infill sites taking care to ensure compatibility and neighbourhood preservation.
     4. Increase energy efficiency in our homes and promote green, sustainable building and
         careful infill development to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the City’s carbon
         footprint. These steps will decrease our contribution to global warming and will reduce
         energy costs to renters and owners.
Do We Have a New Housing Strategy?
There were mixed results with implementing the 2009-2014 Housing Element. A lack of
resources, the loss of the Ukiah Redevelopment Agency, and competing community driven
priorities precluded full implementation success. These constraints and limiting factors are
expected to remain to some degree so the updated Housing Element takes these factors into
account. It is acknowledged that the regional fair share of housing units was dramatically
reduced for Mendocino County and consequently for the City of Ukiah to account for the
slumped economy, lack of population growth and historically low housing production numbers.
This more realistic approach to defining the regional need creates a better chance for success.
The strategy involves creating more opportunity for small infill housing in the urban core areas
near transportation and other services, and where infrastructure is available to serve the units.
The primary program to implement this strategy is to further reduce regulatory constraints for
this type of development. The types of housing to be encouraged and targeted will be primarily
for extremely low, very low, and low income households with an emphasis on rental units,
smaller for-sale housing units, special needs housing, affordable student housing, and
affordable senior housing. Above moderate income housing, while not the primary need, is still
recognized as a need in the community. There will be continued assistance to homeless service
providers as resources allow, and a zoning code amendment to allow homeless shelters in the
C-2 (Heavy Commercial) zoning district. The strategy also calls for the same inclusionary
housing ordinance called for in the adopted 2009 Housing Element, possible housing impact
fees, and zoning code modifications to provide opportunities for farm worker housing.
The overall strategy also involves developing or increasing existing incentives for energy
efficient, and green and sustainable housing projects. Also to preserve existing housing,
promote more rental housing, and develop a housing rehabilitation program for extremely low,
very low, and low income property owners that would be focused on improving energy
efficiency in existing homes. Finally, the new strategy includes working with the Ukiah Police
Department and local apartment housing managers to develop strategies for increasing safety
in their facilities through improved and consistent management practices. Copies of the Housing
                                                                                               14

section 65589.7.
Implementing programs are included to fulfil this overall strategy.
Community Participation
The elimination of the Ukiah Redevelopment Agency dissolved the RDA Low and Moderate
Income Housing Advisory Committee, whose charge was to seek applications and distribute the
RDA 20% set-a-side funds. The Committee had broad representation and participated in the
General Plan Housing Element update process over the years. The loss of this Committee,
coupled with the struggling economy, reduction of available outside funding, non-profit lay-offs,
etc., has negatively impacted the energy and enthusiasm for participating in the 2014-2019
Housing Element update process.
The public outreach campaign for the 2014-2019 Housing Element update project consisted of a
two public workshops conducted at City Hall, one with Northern California Legal Services, direct
phone calls to and interviews with community stakeholders, letters to interested parties, public
notice of the project sent to the local newspaper and broadcast via fax to all local media
sources, and the posting of flyers in key locations throughout the City. The City also conducted
three public hearings in the process of adopting the Housing Element. On March 17, 2016 the
Mendocino County Airport Landuse Commission conducted a public hearing and found the
Housing Element consistent with the Airport Landuse Plan.

Who Needs Housing in Ukiah?
Discussions with affordable housing providers and social service organizations, as well as the
review of statistical data reveals that the primary housing needs in the City of Ukiah are
unchanged from those identified in the 2009-2014 Housing Element:
        Lower Income Households. Extremely low, very low, low and moderate income
         households are in need of housing in the City of Ukiah. There is an overcrowding
         problem and an increase in makeshift unsafe and unhealthy housing accommodations.
        Young Adults. Rental housing for students and both rental and first-time home buying
         opportunities for young adults.
        Persons with Special Needs. People living with disabilities who require specific
         design or service considerations, such as full wheelchair-accessible apartments; people
         in group homes with semi-independent living; the homeless; people in need of mental
                                                                                                     16
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

         health care; farm workers; and people with severe illnesses. All of these groups are
         represented in the City of Ukiah.
        Local Service Workers. The increase in service oriented jobs and the increase in
         housing prices and rental costs have led to an increased need for housing affordable to
         local service workers.
        The Senior Population. Seniors with extremely low, very low and low incomes, and
         others who may desire to scale down and sell their homes for smaller housing units
         closer to services.
        Female Heads of Households.            Single women with children who head their
         households.
        Upper Income Households. Higher level wage earners seeking upper end detached
         single family residences.
What services are provided to the homeless and what are their
special needs?
In 2007 Mendocino County prepared a Continuum of Care Plan that found that local homeless
individuals and families had a wide range of needs, including emergency shelter, transitional
housing, and permanent supportive housing. Emergency shelters provide immediate short-term
housing typically limited to less than six months. Transitional housing provides housing
between six months and two years, and typically includes specialized treatment for alcohol and
drug abuse, intensive case management, mental health treatment, life skills and employment
training, etc. Permanent supportive housing offers a stable residential environment with mental
health counseling, job training, among other services.
Homeless populations are often transient rendering city/county jurisdiction lines meaningless.
According to the Continuum of Care Plan, there are approximately 1,400 homeless people in
Mendocino County at any given time. In 2009, another count was taken by the Mendocino
County Social Services Department, which revealed a total homeless population of 1,206
persons. While it is impossible to determine is how many homeless people are in the City of
Ukiah at any given time because the population is very transient. However, it is safe to assume
that the number is significant because the majority of services for the homeless population are
located within City limits.
An updated homeless people survey was conducted by the Mendocino County Department of
Social Services in 2011 and found the following:
        The highest percentage of homeless persons are Caucasian men between the ages of 31
         and 50.
        The number of homeless military veterans has increased by approximately 2% since
         2009.
                                                                                             17
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

        The number of homeless persons with physical and mental illnesses has increased 15%
         (physical) and 8% (mental) since 2009.
        The number of homeless persons experiencing chronic health issues has increased 11%
         since 2009.
        The majority of homeless persons continue to live outdoors.
        Long-term homelessness (6 months to 10 years) has increased since 2009.
        The main reasons for homelessness are no job/no money, can’t pay the rent, no
         transportation, and alcohol/drug addiction.
The Ford Street Center – Transitional Homeless Housing Facility
The Ford Street provides a transitional homeless housing facility with a capacity of 18
individuals, and 3-4 families. The program provides a home like environment that is child
friendly. Those admitted into the program are expected to be clean and sober.
In the winter of 2015-2016, with funding provided by the City of Ukiah, County of Mendocino
and private donations, MCAVHN (a local non-profit) operated a temporary winter shelter
providing shelter for 46 homeless individuals. The local Homeless Services Planning Group
is meeting regularly to develop a plan for moving forward.
The Ford Street Project Transitional Housing Facilities
Transitional housing, as defined by H.U.D., is from six months to two years, and it is meant to
be a housing bridge between shelter and permanent housing. During one’s stay in transitional
housing, tenants are case managed and provided services designed to increase tenant skills
toward the self-sufficiency required for successful independent living. The Ford Street Project
provides transitional housing for homeless single adults and to homeless families with children.
Some of these units are in “scattered sites” in Ukiah:
        748 Waugh Lane - Six two-bedroom units for homeless individuals and families. This
         housing cluster has been successfully housing the homeless since 1988. Since these
         units are “off site,” a residential manager occupies one of the apartments. Services and
         case management are provided.
        “Progress House” at 200 Ford Street - This facility is located across the street
         from Ford Street’s main campus and houses homeless single males who have completed
         an aftercare program. Abstinence from alcohol and drugs is the goal for all these
         houses and apartment units.

The Ford Street Project Supportive Housing Program
Since 1996, the Ford Street Project has received funding from HUD’s Supportive Housing
Program (SHP) through the department of Health and Human Services of Mendocino County to
provide housing and services for homeless families and homeless individuals with disabilities in
Mendocino County. This funding is used in a variety of ways. Currently it is used to fund
transitional housing units. In addition, SHP funds are utilized to provide case management and
drug/alcohol counseling to homeless clients. The SHP has been instrumental in Ford Street’s
work with the homeless, not only in creating more housing and service options for this
population but in promoting intensive collaboration on behalf of the homeless among a number
of concerned agencies throughout the county.
The Ford Street Project Garden Court Apartments
A 10-unit apartment complex (formerly “The Garden Court Motel”) for homeless, low-income
adults, generally with psychiatric disabilities. Housing is “permanent”, meaning that there is no
target date for residents to move out to other housing. A resident manager is on the premises.
There are 6 one-bedroom apartments and 3 two-bedroom apartments. Rents are based on
criteria established by the State HOME Program and are pegged to resident income as
determined at intake. Applications are available at the Manager's Unit at 1175 South State
Street, Ford Street Project's Main Office at 139 Ford Street or through the Department of Mental
Health Housing Coordinator.
Needs of the Homeless
The homeless population and homeless services providers need continued support from the City
of Ukiah to address issues and problems. The City should support the local Homeless Services
Planning Group and its members, and other active groups and organizations when practical to
assist in their efforts to provide shelter, clothing, food, counselling, and life’s essentials to the
homeless population.
According to homeless population support advocates, the primary needs of the homeless
population are:
        A well-defined and clearer path from shelter to permanent housing, with clear goals and
         client attainments for each housing stage.
        An effective day shelter program which can actually train homeless persons and prepare
         them for full independent living, including job training that emphasizes specific skills for
         various kinds of jobs, how to be an effective tenant, developing parenting skills, learning
         to take instructions from authorities, developing communication skills, etc.
        Additional homeless facilities given the fact that the majority of the Mendocino County
         homeless population congregates in the Ukiah area to utilize available services, and the
         existing permanent shelter only has 64 beds.
                                                                                                   19
2014-2019 City of Ukiah

Some have argued that the current permanent shelter has too many rules for a number of the
chronically homeless who can’t stop drinking, using drugs, etc., but operating and managing an
“open” facility with no rules that would allow for virtually any sort of behavior may not be
practical or reasonable. However, because of the high number of homeless persons and the
low number of available homeless facility beds, opportunity for an additional facility or facilities
has been identified as a local need that must be addressed in the next planning period.
Where can homeless facilities be located?
The Ukiah Zoning Code currently permits Homeless facilities to be proposed and approved in
the following zoning districts with Planning Commission approval of a Use Permit: CN
(Neighborhood Commercial); C-1 (General Commercial); C-2 (Heavy Commercial/Light
Industrial); PF (Public Facilities); M (Manufacturing); R-1 (Single-Family Residential); R-2
(Medium Density Residential) and R-3 (High Density Residential).
There is no location in the City where a homeless facility can locate without the approval of a
Use Permit. However, an Implementation Task/Program is included in this Housing Element to
allow homeless create a homeless shelter overlay zone that will allow homeless facilities by
right. The homeless shelter overlay zone comprises 12 acres in the northern section of Ukiah.
The Planning Commission conducted recommended the northern part of Ukiah as the location
for a homeless shelter overlay zone. On September 2, 2015 the City Council adopted a
homeless shelter overlay zone, in accordance with the provisions of Senate Bill 2 (SB2) (Cedillo
2008),
The need for an additional homeless shelter has not been identified as a high priority in the
community. Moreover, the cost and lack of available resources are overwhelming. Regardless,
the task of amending the zoning code to allow homeless shelters in the Homeless Shelter
overlay zone without a Use Permit has been completed. .
What can the City do to assist the homeless over the next five
years?
There are two primary ways the City can assist the homeless over the next five years. First, it
can continue to provide support and possible funding to homeless services providers with a
focus on helping to define the path from shelter to permanent housing, and helping to establish
an effective life-skill building day shelter program. Second, the City shall examine its zoning
districts and consider making homeless facilities an allowed use rather than requiring
discretionary review.
Is farm worker housing needed in the City of Ukiah?
Ukiah is located in the most urbanized portion of Mendocino County paralleling the Highway 101
corridor. There are no working farms within the City limits, but there are working orchards and
vineyards adjacent to the City, particularly to the east along the Russian River.
                                                                                                  20

The Assessment of the Demand for Farm Worker Housing and Transportation in Mendocino
County prepared in 2008 by the California Institute for Rural Studies found that in 2006, there
were 4,163 farm workers in Mendocino County. Of those, 1,416 worked in Mendocino County
for seven months or more, 673 worked in Mendocino County for 3 to 6 months, and 2,074
worked in Mendocino County for less than 3 months. The Assessment found that the majority
of farm workers Countywide live in single family residences, rent individual rooms in single
family residences, live in labor camps, apartments or trailers.
The Assessment found that 47% of the farm workers or approximately 1,957 live in the Ukiah
Valley. Based on the findings in the Assessment, it is concluded that the majority of farm
workers who live within the City limits live in single family homes, apartments, or mobile
homes/trailers.
State Public Health and Safety Code Section 17021.5 requires employee housing with
accommodations six or fewer employees to be allowed by right and treated as a single family
residence rather than a dormitory, boarding house, hotel or other similar term implying that the
employee housing is a business run for profit.
The City zoning ordinance allows single family residences by right in the R-1 (Single Family
Residential) zoning district. It also does not limit the number of persons living in a residence, or
preclude a group of employees, students, or other non-related persons from occupying the
residence.
In both the R-2 (Medium Density Residential) and R-3 (High Density Residential) zoning
districts, single family dwellings, duplexes, condominiums, apartment houses, and room and
board residences are allowed by right without the requirement for a use permit.
The City zoning ordinance also contains an Agriculture Exclusive (A-E) zoning district. While no
land within the City is zoned A-E, the regulations allow by-right “one family dwellings, trailers
and accessory buildings, and farm buildings of all kinds, including labor camps when located
upon farms and occupied or used by the owner, farm tenant, or other persons employed
thereon or the non-paying guests thereof.” Nothing in the statutes limits the number of
dwelling units or how many persons can occupy the units.
It is concluded that the current zoning standards comply with the requirements of State Public
Health and Safety Code Section 17021.5, and no new program involving code amendments is
required.
Is transitional and supportive housing needed?
Supportive housing is generally defined as permanent, affordable housing with on-site services
that help residents transition into stable, more productive lives. Services may include childcare,
after-school tutoring, career counseling, etc. Most transitional housing includes a supportive
services component. The City regulates supportive housing as a residential use, provided
supportive services are subordinate to the residential use.
There are a number of existing transitional and supportive housing facilities in the City of Ukiah,
some of which are described above. The City zoning ordinance defines these types of facilities
                                                                                                 21
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

as “Community Care Facilities,” and allows them for up to six persons in all residential zoning
districts and in the C-1 (Community Commercial) zoning district without a use permit. Larger
facilities housing between 7 and 12 persons are permitted in these zoning districts with a use
permit. “Community Care Facility” is defined in the zoning ordinance as being “consistent with
the definition contained in Section 1502(a) of the State Public Health and Safety Code.” Section
1502(a) of the PHSC includes 12 different types of community care facilities including
“transitional shelter care facility” and “transitional housing placement facility.”
Currently, if a transitional or supportive housing use does not involve medical treatment or
other formal services, and it is simply a residential living use, it is treated as a single family
dwelling, duplex, or apartment complex identical to other single family dwellings, duplexes, or
apartment complexes. However, this may not be completely consistent with Senate Bill 2,
which states that all transitional and supportive housing constitutes residential uses.
Accordingly, a program has been added to amend the zoning code to be consistent with Senate
Bill 2.
Is there a high number of female heads of households in Ukiah?
The 2010 census revealed that there were 866 female heads of households in the City, down
from 944 in 2000. Of the 866, 63% or 547 were living under the poverty level.
                                     Table 8 - Female Heads of Household

Mendocino County (unincorporated)                       2268 (3.8%)
Ukiah                                                   866 (5.4%)
Willits                                                 309 (6.3%)
Fort Bragg                                              437 (6.0%)
Many female heads of household have children under the age of 18. These households
generally require affordable housing, since their incomes are often less compared to two-parent
households. Housing for female heads of household is a high priority for the City of Ukiah.
Is there a high number of extremely low income households in
Ukiah?
Extremely low-income is defined as households with income less than 30 percent of area
median income. The area median income in the City is $58,900 for a family of 4. . For
extremely low income households, this results in an income of $24,250 or less for a four-
person household. For example, most families and individuals receiving public assistance, such
as social security insurance (SSI) or disability insurance are considered extremely low-income
households. At the same time, a minimum wage worker could be considered an extremely low-
                                                                                               22
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

income household with an annual income of approximately $17,000 or less. The service worker
who makes your sandwich at the local deli and your server at a local coffee shop could be
earning $8.00 per hour. These people have jobs that could qualify them as extremely low
income households.
Existing Extremely Low Income Needs: In 2014, 819 extremely low-income households
resided in the City, representing 13% of the total households. This was down from 2010 when
there were 819 extremely low income households or 20% of the total households. Most
extremely low-income households are renters (769) and experience a high incidence of housing
problems. For example, many of extremely low-income households faced housing problems
(defined as cost burden greater than 30 percent of income and/or overcrowding and/or without
complete kitchen or plumbing facilities) and most were in overpayment situations.
Projected Extremely Low Income (ELI) Needs: The Comprehensive Housing Affordability
(CHAS) data indicates that there are 172-owner and 769-renter ELI households in the City of
Ukiah. Of the ELI households, 70 percent of owners and 82 percent of renters pay greater than
30 percent of their income on housing costs.
To calculate the projected ELI housing needs, the City assumed 50 percent of its 2012 low-
income regional housing needs are extremely low-income households. As a result, from the low
income need of 11 units, the City has a projected need of 6 units for extremely low-income
households. Many extremely low-income households will be seeking rental housing and most
likely facing an overpayment, overcrowding or substandard housing condition. Some extremely
low-income households could be with mental or other disabilities and special needs. To address
the range of needs, the City will employ a detailed housing strategy including promoting a
variety of housing types, such as single-room occupancy (SRO) units and small lot subdivisions.
To address the housing needs of extremely low-income households, the City will undertake two
programs during the planning period:
     1. Identity and meet with nonprofit builders who specialize in building housing for
         extremely low-income households. This effort is designed to build a long-term
         partnership in development, gain access to specialized funding sources, identify the
         range of local resources and assistance needed to facilitate the development of housing
         for extremely low-income households, and promote a variety of housing types, including
         higher density, multifamily supportive, single room occupancy and shared housing.
Work in conjunction with other agencies to address the needs of the extremely low income
households in the City. At least annually and on an on-going basis contact agencies and
developers to facilitate implementing the program. Actions to be considered for inclusion in the
program include prioritizing City funding, supporting grant and other applications for funding,
and exploring housing types and construction methods to promote housing for ELI citizens.
                                                                                              23

Is there overcrowding in Ukiah?
A common method of measuring overcrowding is to compare the number of persons to the
number of rooms in the unit. The Census defines an overcrowded household as one that has
more than 1.01 persons per room (not including kitchens and bathrooms), while units with
more than 1.5 persons per room are considered severely overcrowded. In Ukiah, the data
collected from the 2011 American Communities Survey shows that four percent of all occupied
units were overcrowded.

Are there other types of special needs housing?
Persons with disabilities in Ukiah face unique problems in obtaining affordable and adequate
housing. This segment of the population, which includes individuals with mental, physical, and
developmental disabilities need affordable, conveniently-located housing which, where
necessary, has been specially adapted for wheelchair accessibility, along with other physical
needs.
The living arrangements for persons with disabilities depend on the severity of the disability.
Many persons live at home in an independent environment with the help of other family
members. To maintain independent living, disabled persons may require assistance. This can
include special housing design features for the physically disabled, income support for those
who are unable to work, and in-home supportive services for persons with medical conditions.
Accessible housing can also be provided via senior housing developments.
The majority of persons with disabilities live on an income that is significantly lower than the
non-disabled population. Many disabled individuals live on a small fixed income which severely
limits their ability to pay for housing. The Task Force on Family Diversity estimates that at least
one-third of all persons with disabilities in the United States lives in poverty. Persons with
disabilities have the highest rate of unemployment relative to other groups. For most, their only
source of income is a small fixed pension afforded by Social Security Disability Insurance (SDI),
Social Security Insurance (SSI), or Social Security Old Age and Survivor's Insurance (SSA),
which will not adequately cover the cost of rent and living expenses even when shared with a
roommate. In addition, persons with disabilities oftentimes experience discrimination in hiring
and training. When they find work, it tends to be unstable and at low wages.
                                                                                                24

Description of Need
A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life
activities. According to the 2000 Census, an estimated 25% of Ukiah residents (3,494
persons) have one or more disabilities. The most pervasive disabilities for the general
population are physical and mental disabilities.
Physical Disabilities: While there are a number of well-managed affordable housing facilities that
are accessible to persons with a physical disability, there is a need for additional accessible
units. In 1990 only one percent of the City's housing units were accessible. In order to
accommodate the City’s population with physical disabilities, there is a need to adapt houses or
apartments for wheelchairs and other special requirements. Both federal and State housing laws
require certain features of adaptive design for physical accessibility in all multifamily residential
buildings with four or more units built for first occupancy starting March 13, 1991. However,
numerous dwelling units built before that date are not subject to these accessibility
requirements. This, however, does not assist individuals – particularly seniors – who choose to
remain in their homes rather than move to assisted living facilities and/or other newly
constructed units.
Mental Disability: According to 2000 Census data, there are a number of persons with a severe
mental disability in Ukiah. This includes a large proportion of the homeless which are often
thought to have mental disabilities. Persons with mental disabilities are a critically under-served
population with respect to housing. Approximately 20-50 percent of these are capable of living
semi-independently in their own supported housing units with assistance in maintaining their
apartment, the provision of meals and obtaining transportation, as do other persons with
disabilities.
While there is a number of well-managed permanent living and day treatment facilities and
programs to serve persons with mental disabilities, there remains a need for additional facilities.
The 2000 Census recorded the disability status of the civilian non-institutional population of City
residents. Approximately 21 percent of residents in the City reported as having a disability. The
disability breakdown can be seen in the table below. The largest percentage (26 %) of the
disabled population has a physical disability. The second largest populated group is that of
employment disability of 22 percent.

Elderly Population
An analysis of the needs of elderly or senior households or persons is important for four
reasons: 1) many elderly have fixed, limited incomes; 2) many elderly persons are “over-
housed” (living alone or with two people in a three or four bedroom house); 3) some elderly
have mobility and health problems that can create special housing needs; and 4) recent
projections indicate an increase in the elderly population in the planning period, both those
currently living in the area City of Ukiah.
According to the 2010 Census, there are a total of 1,375 owner-occupied housing units and 665
renter-occupied housing units of which 2,040 are senior households. Table 3-16 represents
householders by tenure and age in the City of Ukiah.

Large Households
Large families can have special housing needs if they cannot find affordable, large housing units
then and living conditions may become overcrowded. The Table below shows the total occupied
housing units by the number of persons living within each unit. This information is shown for
owner-occupied and rental housing.
For owner-occupied units, the highest percentage is for a two-person unit (59%).
Approximately twelve percent of the owner-occupied households are occupied by five or more
persons. For renter-occupied units, the highest percentage is a two-four-person household

Strategies and Programmatic Responses to Meet Projected Needs
Appropriate housing for persons with mental or physical disabilities include very low cost units
in large group home settings (near retail services and public transit), supervised apartment
settings with on- or off-site support services, outpatient/day treatment programs, and
inpatient/day treatment programs, crisis shelters and transitional housing.
In 1984, Title 24 of the State Uniform Building Code mandated that all multiple-family
residential construction projects containing in excess of 5 units under construction after
September 15, 1985, would conform to specific disabled adaptability/accessibility regulations. In
1988, the Federal government enacted the U.S. Fair Housing Amendment Act, also with the
intent of increasing the number of rental units being built that would be accessible to
handicapped individuals. In July 1993, the State of California issued “California Multifamily
Access Requirements” based upon the Act. Unfortunately, the actual increase in the number of
handicapped-accessible units available on the current rental market has been small.
The City does not require special building codes or onerous project review to construct,
improve, or convert housing for persons with disabilities. Both the federal Fair Housing Act and
the California Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an affirmative duty on local
governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications or exceptions) in their
zoning and other land-use regulations when such accommodations may be necessary to afford
disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example, it may be a
reasonable accommodation to allow covered ramps in the setbacks of properties that have
already been developed to accommodate residents with mobility impairments. The City allows
homeowners to build ramps into single-family dwellings to allow first floor access for physically
disabled residents. Such ramps or guardrails are permitted to intrude into the standard setbacks
required under zoning, and are subject only to a building permit. This provision eliminates the
need to obtain a zoning variance.
The City also makes rehabilitation funds available to income qualified households for
accessibility improvements. The Housing Rehabilitation Program, funded with a HOME grant has
been designed in part to address these needs by providing affordable loans to assist disabled
tenants to improve their rental units to meet their physical needs.
The housing needs of several other categories of disabled persons, including developmentally
disabled persons and the mentally ill are typically not addressed by Title 24 Regulations. The
housing needs of persons with these types of disabilities, in addition to basic affordability, range
                                                                                                  27

from needing slight modifications of existing units to the need for a variety of supportive
housing arrangements. Some of this population can only live successfully in housing which
provides a semi-sheltered, semi-independent living state, such as clustered group housing or
other group- living quarters; others are capable of living independently if affordable units are
available.
Group-home living quarters for a variety of specific disabled clientele groups have traditionally
been found intermixed within Ukiah’s residential neighborhoods. Consistent with State law,
group homes with six or fewer residents per facility are allowed by right in all residential zones.
Care facilities with seven or more persons are also permitted in all residential districts and
several commercial districts, subject to a conditional use permit.
What types of housing are needed?
        Rental Units. Rental units for larger families, particularly for extremely low, very low
         and low income households. Small rental and for sale units, such as single room
         occupancy studios, particularly for seniors, students, low wage earners, female heads of
         household, and farm workers.
        Smaller For-Sale Housing. Smaller attached and detached for-sale units affordable
         to low and moderate income households, and first-time homebuyers. Also, small lot
         subdivisions. In addition, the preservation of mobile home parks as a contributor to the
         local affordable housing stock has become significantly important.
        Special Needs Housing.             Special needs housing and housing with service
         components. This includes housing for persons with physical and mental impairments,
         and/or other special needs, as well as farm worker housing that may be seasonal.
        Student Housing. Rental housing for Mendocino College students has been a priority
         for the College and is a priority for the City. This could include dormitory style housing
         with living units and a communal kitchen/ding facility.
        Senior Housing. Affordable housing demand for the Senior citizen population has
         increased and is expected to continue growing in the future. In particular, housing units
         for those seniors in the Extremely Low income category.
        Above Moderate Income Units. Detached for-sale units, rental apartments, and for-
         sale and rental condominiums available to higher income households.
What types of housing does Ukiah have?
Table 13 provides a breakdown of the total housing units by type of structure for 2000 and
2008. In 2013, it was estimated that there were 6,523 housing units in the City. As indicated,
the majority of the units (55%) in Ukiah are single-family units. The variety of housing types in
Ukiah fairly diverse.

How much housing is needed?
   MCOG Regional Housing Needs. Under California law, every city and county has a legal
    obligation to respond to its fair share of the projected future housing needs in the region in
    which it is located. For Ukiah and other Mendocino County jurisdictions, the regional
    housing need is determined by the Mendocino Council of Governments, based upon an
    overall regional need number established by the State. The fair share numbers establish
    goals to guide local planning and development decision making.
    In 2013, the MCOG in partnership with representatives from local City and County
    jurisdictions met and agreed upon the local fair share housing needs.
                                                                                               29

Limited Population Growth. As noted in Table 1, there has been very little population
growth over the past five years. However, housing needs remain, particularly for extremely low,
very low and above moderate income households. This interesting need statistic reflects the
lack of overall housing starts in the community due to the slumping economy and the loss of
the City’s Redevelopment Agency.
Housing Production since 2009: Even with a reduction of regulatory constraints and
continued City support, housing production since 2009 has dropped dramatically. Four single
family residential units were constructed in since 2009, and the Clara Court 34 unit affordable
housing project was constructed and opened in 2010.

Where can new housing be located?
The 2009 Vacant and Underutilized Land Map was updated in January 2014 (Appendix 3). Over
the past 4-5 years there has been a very minor reduction in vacant and underutilized land
available for housing development (3 acres).
                                 Table 17 – Vacant and Underutilized Land
Year                                               Total Vacant and Underutilized Land
2009                                               108 acres
2014                                               105 acres
The vacant and underutilized land continues to be spread out in the City with a very limited
amount of large vacant parcels. Of the last remaining larger properties, most can be developed
with residential land uses, but because of location (prime commercial) it is not probable.
However, the enabling zoning and regulatory framework for the development of these parcels
will continue to permit residential development.
The primary opportunity sites for very low, low and moderate priced rental and ownership
housing are vacant infill parcels, underutilized land, and parcels ripe for redevelopment. To
successfully develop these sites, traffic, design compatibility, infrastructure, neighbourhood
compatibility, and other issues must be analysed.
                                                                                            31

Updated General Plan Housing Element

          Infill Parcels. The Vacant and Underutilized Land Map updated in 2014 shows a
           number of important infill opportunity sites within the City Limits. These parcels are
           close to existing infrastructure and situated along transportation corridors, and are close
           to the downtown, retail opportunities, medical services, and professional offices.
           Development of these parcels will promote increased pedestrian activities and will lower
           the City’s overall carbon footprint.
          Underutilized Land. There is underutilized land throughout the City which provides
           opportunity for all types of needed housing.
          Redevelopment Sites. There are a number of key developed properties in and
           around the downtown and along important transportation corridors that are poised for
           redevelopment. The sites listed in the following table represent sites with the greatest
           potential for redevelopment within the planning period.
          Site Consolidation. There are a number of key sites that are contiguous to one
           another with the potential to be combined to accommodate larger projects.

Updated General Plan Housing Element

    1.   The potential number of units was determined by factoring in the number of units allowed by zoning, the
         applicable development standards, the size of the parcels, the shape and configuration of the parcels, the
         percentage of existing development, surrounding land uses, on-site field work, and in some cases,
         subjective, yet professional opinions. Additionally, the existing development on all of the identified sites is
         aged and in some cases dilapidated, which increases the opportunities for redevelopment and infill
         affordable housing.
         The Ukiah General Plan and Zoning Code permits high density residential development in the C-1
         (Community Commercial) zoning district. While full high density residential development is possible, the
         potential number of units assumes a mix of residential and commercial (25% to 50% residential). This
         assumption is based on the mix of recently constructed mixed-use projects, and discussions with local and
         regional developers concerning how mixed-use projects must “pencil-out” to be financial successful.
    2.   The maximum density allowed in the high density and commercial zoning districts is 28 units per acre.
    3.   There is a need for 18 extremely low, very low, and low income units. There is opportunity for 280 units on
         residentially zoned land (vacant, underutilized and redevelopable parcels).
    4.   It should be noted that not all commercial zoned sites are anticipated to be developed residentially.
         However, as noted above, there are more than enough opportunity sites to meet the local need.
    5. The Ukiah Airport Master Plan limits some parcels to two-stories which is considered a constraint because it
         could disallow maximum density under the zoning. The Airport compatibility zone maximum density in
         these areas is 90 people per acre, which does not represent a constraint because it far exceeds the
         maximum density under the zoning (28 units per acre).
    6. No other land use controls significantly constrain the parcels. The City zoning code does not contain a floor
         area ratio standard, and the height limit, yard setback, and lot coverage standards in the C-I zoning district
         are generous, which encourages infill affordable housing development.
    7.   The Medium Density Residential (R2) and High Density Residential (R3) zoning districts allow owner
         occupied and rental multifamily residential land uses by-right without a use permit.
    8.   The maximum density allowed in the high density and commercial zoning districts is 28 units per acre.
         There is a need for 18 extremely low, very low, and low income units. There is opportunity for 280 units on
         residentially zoned land (vacant, underutilized and redevelopable parcels)
    9.   The Cleveland Street parcels were donated to PEP Housing for the construction of 42 senior affordable
         units. These parcels have been combined.
The regulatory incentives that provide increased opportunity for these sites to redevelop include
the availability of the Planned Development (PD) zoning tool, no floor are ratio standard, a
generous height limit, limited yard setbacks in the commercial zones, (grants) for façade and
infrastructure improvements.
The sites were chosen because of existing worn or dilapidated structures, near-by successful
revitalization efforts, reasonably foreseeable near-by future projects, and other factors. As
indicated in footnote number 1, on-site field work was performed on each parcel to determine if
and how much affordable housing could be added to the sites given the location and type of
existing development, parcel configuration, and other factors.
Additionally, it should be noted that the City has been successful in attracting housing projects
in the C-1 (Community Commercial) zoning district. Approved and constructed projects with full
residential development on commercially zoned parcels include a 6-unit apartment complex on
North Main Street and a 12 unit apartment complex on South Main Street. Both of these
                                                                                                                    34

projects are situated in the downtown area and in close proximity to commercial services,
medical services, bus routes, and governmental services.
Standard practice of the City of Ukiah Planners is to promote residential development on the
commercially zoned property identified as prime for affordable housing development. Programs
has been added to post the suitable sites map and associated information on the City’s website
and to prepare hard-copy hand-out material for property owners and developers.
Is there enough suitable land available to meet the housing need?
The City’s share of the regional housing need is 46 units and there is plenty of appropriately
zoned, unconstrained land to accommodate this desired number of units. The total probable
units for the vacant, underutilized and redevelopable land within the City is 738 units. The
primary reason for this is because the City permits medium and high density residential
development in its commercial zoning districts. Another reason is that there are a substantial
number of underutilized older commercial properties where residential units could be added.
The zoning code permits mixed commercial/residential land uses in all commercial zoning
districts. Additionally, the City’s Planned Development zoning tool provides for creative, well
planned residential development and the flexing of typical development standards and
densities.
The Housing Element strongly encourages carefully infill medium and high density residential
development because of the close proximity to existing infrastructure, transportation corridors,
social services, commercial uses, and medical facilities, and to prohibit impacts on surrounding
agricultural lands that results from urban sprawl.
Are there constraints to housing development in Ukiah?
The City has regulatory constraints (fees/exactions and zoning standards), as well as
environmental constraints just like every other community in California. The environmental
constraints include traffic, drainage/flood zones, mature trees, and airport compatibility. All of
these constraints affect future development to varying degrees, and each site listed in the
Vacant and Underutilized Land Survey (Appendix 3), was examined not only for the presence of
constraints, but to what degree the constraints would impact the future development of housing
units.
The following table provides a listing and details of constraints to housing development.
                                       Table 19 - Constraints

Wastewater (Sewer) Treatment             The wastewater treatment plan upgrade and expansion
                                         project has been completed and sufficient capacity is
                                         available to serve the identified vacant, underutilized and
                                         redevelopable parcels.
Water Storage and Capacity               A water storage project has been completed, which added
                                         nearly 2 million gallons of storage to the City’s water
                                         storage system, and an upgrade to the water treatment
                                         plant has been completed. Sufficient water exists to serve
                                         the identified vacant, underutilized and redevelopable
                                         parcels.
Zoning and Land Use Controls (see below) The amendments called for in the 2004 Housing Element
                                         were completed in 2008. Additionally, the City adopted a
                                         Downtown Zoning Code project that provides more
                                         opportunity and certainty for housing development in the
                                         downtown. Medium and high density housing is now
                                         permitted in all commercial zoning districts, and the Planned
                                         Development tool has be used to facilitate unconventional
                                         housing and alternative development standards. Zoning is
                                         no longer considered a constraint.
                                         The City has lot coverage, yard setback, height and other
                                         regulatory constraints to development. While these zoning
                                         standards are typical, the City also does not have a Floor
                                         Area Ration (FAR) standard, which limits development in
                                         other communities.          The City also has a Planned
                                         Development overlay zoning classification, which provides
                                         flexibility for development projects.
                                         Additionally, in 2008, the City adopted new zoning
                                         regulations establishing reasonable accommodations for
                                         persons with disabilities (see procedure below).
Airport                                  There are density limitations and 3-story buildings (other
                                         than for public facilities) are disallowed in the B2 Infill area
                                         north of the airport. However, many of the identified vacant,
                                         underutilized and redevelopable parcels are not located in
                                         the B1 or B2 infill area north of the airport.
Drainage                                 The City adopted new Low Impact Development drainage
                                         requirements which could result in higher costs for housing
                                         projects.
Traffic                                  The City adopted a City-Wide traffic study in 2007 and if
                                         traffic impact fees are considered in the future, reduced
                                         fees for affordable housing projects may be adopted.
                                         Additionally, the City has an adopted Capital Improvement
                                         Program that includes a number of significant street and
                                         intersection improvements that will reduce traffic related
                                         constraints for the identified parcels.
Parking                                  The Ukiah City Code requires 1 parking space for 1-bedroom
                                         apartment units and 2 spaces for 2-bedroom apartment
                                         units. However, the Planned Development zoning tool can
                                         be used to relax this standard if a proposed development
                                         such as senior housing can demonstrate that less parking
                                         would be needed.
Flood Zones                              100-year flood zones and flood-ways exist in the City, but
                                         ample suitable land is available to meet the housing need.
                                         Most of the identified vacant, underutilized and
                                         redevelopable parcels are not situated in a 100-year flood
                                         zone.
                                                                                                        36

Permit Processing Procedures            Permit processing for all permits is generally faster and less
                                        costly than surrounding jurisdictions. Priority processing is
                                        provided for affordable and special needs housing projects.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities   The zoning code was amended in 2008 to include provisions
                                        for reasonable accommodation (procedure listed below).
                                        Additionally, planning permit fees for special needs housing
                                        projects are even less than those charged for affordable
                                        housing projects.
Building Codes                          The City has adopted the 2007 California Building Codes.
                                        These codes have not presented a hardship to affordable
                                        housing developers. The State of California and the City of
                                        Ukiah will adopt the new 2010 California Codes on January
                                        1, 2011. All building permit applications which are submitted
                                        after January 1, 2011 will be required to comply with these
                                        new regulations. One of the most significant changes that is
                                        anticipated in the new codes is that all new residential
                                        occupancies will be required to have fire suppression
                                        systems (fire sprinklers). This will add addition costs to
                                        affordable housing projects.
                                        The City is examining the possibility of using Redevelopment
                                        Housing 20% set-a-side funds to offer grants or low interest
                                        loans to assist affordable housing developers to comply with
                                        this anticipated new requirement.
                                        The City of Ukiah code enforcement activities have become
                                        complaint driven ever since the loss of the Code Compliance
                                        Coordinator position due to budget cuts. However, City
                                        staff due initial code compliance cases when they are
                                        observed during routine inspection and field observations.
Cost of Land and Financing              Currently, the cost of land is lower than it has been in many
                                        years. This is primarily due to the economic downturn.
                                        Similarly, the availability of land is higher than it has been
                                        with a larger than average number of properties on the
                                        market.
                                        While financing is tight, there is local optimism that lending
                                        institutions are relaxing recent restrictions and the financing
                                        market is opening up.
                                        Additionally, interest rates are remaining low, and the City’s
                                        first time home buyer program has been very active over
                                        the past year.
Cost of Construction                    According to PEP Housing, a local affordable housing
                                        builder, the cost of construction in Ukiah is comparable to
                                        that of neighbouring counties of Sonoma and Lake. Typical
                                        construction costs are between $190 and $215 dollars per
                                        square foot.
High Density Housing Management         The Ukiah Police Department have expressed concern about
                                        the development of new affordable housing projects that do
                                        not have requirements for updated and consistent
                                        management practices that support safety. The Police have
                                        found that the key to safe affordable housing is strong
                                        management. A new policies and implementing task have
                                        been added to address this concern.

    Request: A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a
    disability as defined under the federal fair housing act and California fair employment and
    housing act, or his/her representative or any entity, when the application of a regulation
    under this chapter acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. In general, a person with a
    disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially
    limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment
    or anyone who has a record of such impairment. A request for reasonable accommodation
    may include modifications or exceptions to the regulations, standards, policies and practices
    for the siting, placement, construction, development or use of housing or housing related
    buildings, structures and facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide
    persons with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice.
    Application Submittal: A request for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted on an
    application form provided by the director of the department of planning and community
    development including documentation of the disability and any other information required to
    make the determinations required by this section.
    Review Of Application: Applications for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the
    director of the department of planning and community development or designee, or may be
    referred to the authority taking action on a concurrent application.
In granting an application for reasonable accommodation, the director may impose any
conditions of approval relating to the findings above as deemed practical and necessary
including, but not limited to, restoration of the property to its former condition and recording in
the office of the county recorder notice thereof.
Can certain constraints be overcome or resolved to provide more
opportunity for housing?
Since adoption and certification of the last General Plan Housing Element in 2011, progress has
been made to resolve constraints. These efforts include the adoption of the new Downtown
Zoning Code which encourages more housing in and around the downtown, street
improvements (East Perkins Street), drainage infrastructure improvements (East Perkins
Street), etc.
The wastewater treatment plant and water treatment plant were recently upgraded and have
the capacity to serve future housing development on the identified vacant, underutilized, and
redevelopable parcels.
Additionally, the City has secured a CDBG grant to help fund sewer lateral inspections and
repairs for extremely low, very low and low income residents.
The HOME grant First Time Home Buyers program has enabled very low and low income
residents to purchase homes in the community.

          * If development projects in these zones can meet these requirements, they can proceed without
          an Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan consistency determination from the Mendocino County
          Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC). However, if any project involves a General Plan
          amendment, rezoning, or specific plan, it is required to be submitted to the ALUC for a CLUP
          consistency determination.
          As noted in the Table, the Ukiah Airport Master Plan indicates that residential subdivisions and
          multi-family residences are not normally acceptable in the B1 and B2 airport compatibility zones.
          However, the Plan also indicates that “These uses typically do not meet the density and other
                                                                                                                  39

         development conditions listed. They should be allowed only if a major community objective is
         served by their location in this zone and no feasible alternative exists.”
         There have been a number of multi-family residential projects proposed in the B1 and B2 Infill
         compatibility zones north of the airport over the past several years. The most notable of these is
         the 64-unit Summer Creek Village affordable housing project and the PEP Housing 42-unit
         affordable senior project. While this project served the major community objective of providing
         much needed affordable housing, it also complied with the density and other requirements of the
         B2 infill compatibility zone. Based on the long-standing procedural agreement with Mendocino
         County, the project did not need a formal consistency review from the Mendocino County Airport
         Land Use Commission because both City and County Staff determined that it was clearly
         consistent with all the requirements for the B2 infill area.
         The Summer Creek Village project was located on a large enough parcel to meet the 60 people
         per acre density standard. The primary vacant and underutilized sites identified in the 2009
         survey that are in the B1 or B2 airport compatibility zones are as large or larger than the Summer
         Creek Village parcel, therefore it is confidently assumed that multi-family residential projects
         could be developed on these parcels.
These constraints result in less opportunity for housing development. However, the City highly
values the airport as an integral component of its economic development strategy. Accordingly,
the City seeks to balance the affordable housing and economic development goals of the City.
It should be noted that none of the identified vacant, underutilized or redevelopable parcels are
located in the “A” compatibility zone.
It should be further noted that most of the identified vacant, underutilized or redevelopable
parcels are not significantly burdened with airport compatibility zone constraints.
In the event, a housing developer proposes to build on land within the airport B1 infill
compatibility area, here is a summary of the required steps and process:
    1. An affordable housing developer applies to construct 28 units on a one-acre parcel in
         the airport B1 infill compatibility zone area which allows a maximum density of 60
         people per acre. Using the 1.92 people per unit factor, City staff determines that the
         project would result in 54 people per acre, and that it would be in compliance with the
         B1 zone.
    2. The developer decides to seek a density bonus of 25% (7 units).
    3. Staff determines that this would add 13 people to the site for a total of 67 people, which
         would exceed the density standard of 60 people per acre. The Ukiah Regional Airport
         Master Plan indicates that projects exceeding the density standard (or other standards)
         should “only be allowed if a major community objective is served by the project in the
         proposed location and no feasible alternative location exists.”
    4. Staff refers the project to the Mendocino Airport Land Use Commission for a
         “consistency determination”, making the argument that the project serves the major
         community objective of providing affordable infill housing, and that no feasible
         alternative location exists.
                                                                                                         40

    5. If the Land Use Commission finds that even though the project exceeds the allowable
         density in the B1 zone, it serves a major community objective, and that no feasible
         alternative sites exists, and then approves the project, it would advance to the City
         Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission for final action.
    6. If the Land Use Commission finds that the project does not meet an important
         community objective and/or other alternatives sites exist, and says “no” to the proposal,
         City staff could schedule the matter for a final determination by the City Council, who on
         a 4/5 votes could override the Mendocino County Airport Land Use Commission.

Updated General Plan Housing Element

                                     The City of Ukiah Flood Zone Map
A number of vacant and/or underutilized parcels are situated within the 100-year Flood Zone,
which requires structures and roads to be elevated and potentially other measures to protect
life and property in the event of a 100-year flood event. This represents potential increased
cost associated with the future development of these parcels. The City is currently examining
the Flood Zone Maps (1985) to determine if any of the zones warrant a Map Correction
application to the Federal Emergency Management Association. This exercise could result in a
reduction in the flood zone constraints.
An implementation program has been added to identify a prime affordable housing infill site
currently burdened by flood zone issues and pursue an engineering study and possible FEMA
map correction to eliminate this constraint.
Traffic: Traffic congestion, particularly along the City’s major street corridors can affect the
developability of some parcels. However, the City’s adopted 2010-2011 Capital Improvement
Program (CIP) identifies street and intersection improvement projects and funding sources to
remedy many traffic congestion problems.
                                                                                                 42

Future development projects may require the preparation of traffic studies to determine
potential impacts and reasonable mitigation measures for projects outside the area covered by
indentified CIP projects.

NOTES:
1.       * 20’ or the maximum height of the main building whichever is less
2.       ** If abutting an R-1, R-2, or R-3 parcel, then the setback for that residential district applies
3.       The B1 and B2 Airport Compatibility Zones list multiple story offices as “normally not acceptable.” The B2 Infill Policy
         north of the airport limits buildings to 2-stories.
4.       Various residential housing types are allowed or permitted in all of the above zoning districts
5.       Parking requirements vary, but are generally less than nearby jurisdictions in an effort to reduce the size of parking lots
         and to discourage automobile use.
6.       Deviation from lot coverage standards are possible with discretionary review.
Zoning and Housing Types: The City’s current zoning code allows for a variety of housing
types throughout the City. For example, multiple family residential apartment units are
permitted in all commercial zoning districts, and second residential units (granny units) are
allowed in the Single Family Residential (R-1) zoning district without the need for a use permit.
Small family day care (6 or fewer children) and community care facilities are allowed in all
residential zones and in the Community Commercial zoning district without a Use Permit. Large
family day care (7 or more) and community care facilities are permitted in these districts with
the securing of a Use Permit. The City code does not include any spacing or concentration
restrictions.
The Planned Development (PD) zoning tool contained in the City Code allows for creative, well
planned housing projects, and provides for the possible relaxation of typical development
standards, as well as permitting unconventional housing types such as cooperative housing and
school dormitories. This tool was used successfully during the past planning period to approve a
compact, nicely designed infill low to moderate income housing development. The tool allowed
for the reduction in parking, street and driveway widths, density, and yard setbacks. This
Planned Development zoning remains an important tool in the City’s toolbox for affordable
housing projects.
The PD tool is an overlay zoning district that technically is a rezoning. For example, an
affordable senior housing project applicant may propose to lay the PD zone over an existing R-3
(High Density Residential) zoning district to reduce parking requirements, relax yard setbacks,
and reduce access roadway widths. The application requires review and a public hearing by the
Planning Commission and a final review and action by the City Council. Affordable housing
projects that successfully used this tool include the Cleveland Lane sweat equity project,
Mulberry Street sweat equity project, and the Cottage Lane project.
Fees and Development Review Process: The City requires payment of different fees as a
condition of development approval. These fees are lower than comparable market-rate fees for
                                                                                                                                44

Example Project: The 32-unit Clara Court affordable apartment project, which received
approximately $350,000 in grants and low interest loans from the Ukiah Redevelopment Agency
for property acquisition and pre-development funds, paid approximately $450,000 in total fees
(planning permit, building permit, water, sewer, public works, electrical, planning, and fire
protection). This amounts to approximately $14,000 per unit (does not include school district
fees collected by the district). This amount appears reasonable when compared to other
jurisdictions. For example, in unincorporated Mendocino County, the cost is approximately
$17,500 per unit (pages 3-20 and 3-21, 2010 Mendocino County General Plan Housing
Element).
Fee Percentage of Development Cost: According to the issued building permit(s) for the Clara
Court project, the total value/development costs for the project are $2,917,944. The total City
collected fees of $450,000 equate to only 15.4 percent of the development costs for the project.
The City is also deferring the electrical, water, and sewer connection fees ($413,284 of the
$450,000) until final inspection and the grant of occupancy. This will significantly contribute to
project feasibility and achievement of affordable targets because it helps to meet construction
loan underwriting requirements and reduces financing costs.
Additionally, in December, 2010, the City RDA provided an additional $450,000 to the project to
assist in clean-up of unanticipated contaminated soil.

Site Development Permit (SDP): The review of a Site Development Permit focuses on
architecture, landscaping, parking, and other site design elements. The landscaping and
parking standards are clear and concise and the Planning Commission has the authority and
flexibility to reduce the requirement on a case-by-case basis. The architectural design findings
are similarly concise and routinely shared with project applicants early in the pre-application
discussions. The finding is not burdensome and allows for flexibility in the design of housing
structures:
        “There is sufficient variety, creativity, and articulation to the architecture and
        design of the structure(s) and grounds to avoid monotony and/or a box-like
        uninteresting external appearance.”
The Side Development Permit Review Process: Processing a typical Side Development
Permit takes approximately 6-8 weeks and includes the following steps:

                                                                                                      47

Updated General Plan Housing Element

Applications are submitted to the City at the Planning and Community Development public
information counter at the Ukiah Civic Center – 300 Seminary Avenue, Ukiah. While pre-
application review (at no cost) is encouraged, it is not required.
Step 2 – Project Review Committee
The project planner will schedule the project for a roundtable discussion between the applicants
and various City Staff members to flush out issues and problems, and to provide the applicants
with a preliminary determination regarding possible conditions that may be imposed on the
project.
Step 3 – Application Completeness
Within approximately 2 weeks after application submittal, the project planner will determined if
enough information has been submitted to fully understand the proposed project. If enough
information has been submitted, the application will be deemed “complete” for processing. If
not, the project planner will send a detailed letter to the applicant indicating exactly what
information is needed to fully understand the proposal.
Step 4 - Environmental Review
Some Site Development Permit applications need a preliminary environmental review (Initial
Study) by the project planner. The purpose of this review is to find out if the project will cause
any adverse environmental impacts. You may be required to give us more information about
traffic, noise, etc. After reviewing all the information, the City Environmental Coordinator will
make an environmental determination.
Step 5 - Public Notice
Once the project planner has completed an analysis of the proposal, and all issues have been
resolved, a public notice is published in the local newspaper describing the proposal and when
the required public hearing will be conducted. A public notice is also sent to all property owners
within 300-feet of the project site, and the project planner will physically post/stake a notice on
the subject parcel.
Step 6 – Public Hearing and Action
The City Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission will conduct a public hearing, make
findings, and take action on the project. If the project is approved, the Zoning Administrator or
Planning Commission may impose conditions on the project. For information regarding the
required findings that have to be made to approve the Site Development Permit project or the
conditions of approval that may be placed on the project, contact the City Planning Staff at the
number listed below.
                                                                                                 48

Use Permit: The primary finding required to approve a Use Permit is that the housing project
would not have a detrimental effect on the health, safety, and general welfare of the public.
The Use Permit review process is the same as the Site Development Permit Review process.
Planned Development Rezoning: The Planned Development Rezoning tool has been the
most successful tool for creating affordable housing in the City. As indicated, it provides
flexibility with development standards such as lot sizes, yard setbacks, driveway widths, etc.
Hundreds of affordable housing units have been constructed as a result of this tool, including
two large “sweat-equity” home ownership projects.
While the process is discretionary and involves public hearings before the Planning Commission
and City Council, it is clear and provides certainty to the community and developers. The
certainty is provided to the community because this rezoning proposal/application includes an
actual development plan rather than just changing the zoning classification. Certainty is
provided to the developer because the pre-application review is intimate with staff and staff is
readily available through-out the process. It is not uncommon for staff to meet with the
developer of a Planned Development project many times during the course of review to discuss
and resolve issues.
Moreover, the process is not time consuming and the cost is not restrictive given the City’s fee
reduction for affordable housing projects. This is why the tool has been so successful in the
City of Ukiah.
Planned Development Rezoning Review Steps:                       The review process for Planned
Development projects takes approximately 3-4 months to complete.
          1. Pre-application review. This is an optional step in the process that is free of change,
              and provides the developer with an opportunity to meet with staff to discuss the
              proposal, identify issues, sound-board solutions, located infrastructure, and confirm
              the steps in the review process.
          2. Application filing. The applicant meets with staff and files the application. If it is an
              affordable housing projects, the applicant pays reduced fees.
          3. Application routing. The application is routed to various departments and agencies
              for review and comment.
          4. Application completeness. Within approximately 2-weeks, staff determines if enough
              information has been submitted to fully understand the project.
          5. Environmental Review. Within 30 days from determining the application to be
              complete for processing, staff makes a determination regarding compliance with the
              California Environmental Quality Act.
          6. Planning Commission public hearing. Once environmental review is completed, the
              project is scheduled for a public hearing before the Planning Commission.
          7. City Council public hearing. The City Council conducts a public hearing to consider
              the recommendation from the Planning Commission and to take final action on the
              project.
                                                                                                    49
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

On and Off-Site Improvement Requirements: The City requires streets, curb, gutter and
sidewalks, water and sewer connections, electrical connections and landscaping for all new
construction, including affordable housing projects.
Street Standards: The City Department of Public Works maintains a Standard Plans document
that provides housing developers with details and specifications for street, sidewalk, curb,
gutter, wheel chair ramps, sewer, water, drains and street tree improvements. All the details
and specifications are typical of a small rural city, and present no hardship or unreasonable
requirement for housing developers.
The specification for a typical residential street, curbs and gutters, and sidewalks are typical of
a small rural city, and have not resulted in a significant barrier to affordable housing projects:
Water service connection fees are typical of a small rural City and have not resulted in a barrier
to affordable housing projects. The City owns its own electrical utility and its electrical service
connection fees are not only considered reasonable, but are in fact are less than those charged
by the Pacific, Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), which provides electrical service outside the
City limits.
The sewer connection fees charged by the City are identical to those charged by the Ukiah
Valley Sanitation District which provides wastewater service to the unincorporated areas outside
the City limits. The fees are considerably less than those charged by cities to the south in
Sonoma County.
Landscaping: Affordable housing projects are required to landscape 20% of the project site,
and this has not presented a significant barrier to past projects. The zoning code does allow a
reduction to the amount of landscaping depending upon the size, scale, intensity, and location
of the project.
                                                                                                   50
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element
Traffic Level of Service: Depending upon the number of units and location of a proposed
project, including affordable housing proposals, a traffic study may be required. As part of the
2010 General Plan Housing Element update, the City amended its General Plan Circulation
Element to relax the roadway level of service from a “C” to a “D” as an interim measure until
the City completed a citywide traffic model and further revisions to its Circulation Element. This
has removed a barrier to affordable housing development.
It is concluded that the City’s required on and off-site improvements do not present a significant
barrier to the development of affordable housing projects. This is evident because of the recent
project approvals for the Clara Court and Summercreek Village affordable housing projects,
where on and off-site improvements were not issues and did not present barriers.
What Affordable Housing Developers Can Expect: Affordable housing developers can
expect professionalism, cooperation, and a team approach from City Staff on issues such as
property identification, constraints and opportunities analysis, potential funding assistance,
reduced development processing fees, and expedited time frames for permit processing.
To assist developers, the City has produced a document entitled “What You Need to Know
About Construction and Development.” It is provided free upon request and is posted on the
City’s website.
The goal and mission of City Staff is to help shape an approvable project, and to provide
certainty to the developer in terms of fees, standards, findings, and the entirety of the permit
review process.
Military compatibility
There are no Military bases in or near the City of Ukiah or Mendocino County. However, the
City is within an SUA (Special Use Airspace) more specifically termed a Military Operations Area
(MOA). An MOA is an area of airspace designated for military training activities and requires
the City to notify the appropriate military office when it proposes to amend or adopt a new
General Plan or when large development projects are proposed. A program has been added
requiring these tasks to be to accomplished.
Crime prevention and environmental design (CPTED)
CPTED is defined as “the proper design and effective use of the built environment that can lead
to a reduction in the fear and incidence of crime and an improvement in the quality of life.”
There are ten key principals and associated strategies communities should consider when
applying the CEPTED framework to the design, development, redevelopment, and maintenance
of buildings and community spaces:
         1. Natural Surveillance— the design and placement of physical features to maximize
              visibility and surveillance. Keeping intruders easily observable by maximizing
              visibility.
                                                                                                51
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

              Key strategies include the design, placement, and lighting of doors, windows,
              walkways, gathering areas, roadways, and structures. The objectives are to eliminate
              hiding places and increase the perception of human presence or supervision.
         2. Natural Access Management— the physical guidance of people and vehicles.
              Designing streets, sidewalks, building entrances, and neighborhood gateways to
              clearly indicate public routes and discouraging access to private areas.
              Key strategies include the use of real or perceived barriers such as fencing or
              plantings, and other way finding elements such as lighting, signage, and artwork.
              The objectives are to provide orientation and a pedestrian-friendly environment and
              to discourage would-be offenders by making noncompliance obvious.
         3. Territorial Reinforcement— the use of physical attributes to delineate space and
              express a positive sense of ownership. Increased definition of private space to create
              a greater sense of ownership and territorial control of an area.
              Key strategies include the use of art, signs, landscaping, and boundary treatments
              as well as the orientation and strategic placement of buildings. The objectives are to
              define borders, express ownership, and communicate a space is cared for and
              protected.
         4. Physical Maintenance—the repair, replacement, and general upkeep of a space,
              building, or area.
              Key strategies include the use of low-maintenance landscaping and architectural
              materials, trash collection and removal, and other programs to maintain a clean and
              orderly environment. The objective is to allow for the continued use of a space for its
              intended purpose.
         5. Order Maintenance—the attention to minor violations and reduction of opportunities
              for inappropriate behavior.
              Key strategies include posting rules and expectations, using graffiti- and vandalism-
              resistant materials, and imposing quick, fair, and consistent consequences for
              violations. The objectives are to foster safe, orderly, and predictable behaviors.
         6. Activity Support—the planning and placement of safe activities.
              Key strategies include sidewalk and street level activities, such as markets, fairs, and
              festivals, in key community areas. The objective is to increase the number of people
              using a space, thereby enhancing visibility, social comfort and control.
         7. Social Capital—the social trust, norms, and networks people draw upon to solve
              common problems, foster civic engagement, and discourage inappropriate
              behaviors.
              Key strategies include designated gathering areas, social events, community
              programs, and communication protocols or equipment. The objective is to encourage
              communication, trust, and collaboration among stakeholders and also with the
              governmental agencies that serve them.
                                                                                                    52
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

         8.    Land Use and Community Design—the distribution, location, and amount of land
              for various uses; their density and intensity; and the design elements, strategies, and
              overall character of a planning area.
              Key strategies include team training for professionals involved in planning and
              development activities, solicitation of community public safety concerns and
              collaboration in problem solving, and incorporation of CPTED principles into planning
              processes. The objectives are to create, or recreate, and manage built environments
              in a manner that includes considerations for public safety.
         9. Target Hardening— the making of potential targets resistant to criminal attack.
              Using features such as window locks and dead bolts that prohibit entry or access.
              The City could naturally reduce crime by encouraging development projects to use
              these CPTED tools. Educating City staff on how CPTED principles can reduce crime
              and offering incentives to residential and commercial builders who incorporate
              CPTED principles into their project design could reduce crime and the overall need
              for policing in the City.
              Key strategies include the reinforcement of entry and exit features, law enforcement
              or security presence, and security devices such as locks, alarms, and cameras. The
              objectives are to increase the efforts that offenders must expend and the risk of their
              being identified or apprehended in committing an offense.
         10. Natural Imperatives—ensuring access to necessary goods and services including
              natural light, clean air and water, healthy foods, physical activity, employment, and
              housing.
              Key strategies include pedestrian amenities, public parks, accessible transit systems,
              quality food sources, and education and employment opportunities. The objective is
              to promote healthy behaviors and reduce mental fatigue and associated risky
              behaviors by meeting the biological, social, and economic needs of the population.
A program has been added to require the use of CPTED when reviewing housing development
projects.
Safety and high density housing management
The Ukiah Police Department has participated in a program that brings law enforcement
together with the owners and managers of high density housing complexes to devise strategies
for keeping the facilities safe. While funding for the program remains uncertain, the Police
leadership believe it represents the best approach to increasing safety and reducing police calls
to high density apartment complexes.
Are there affordable housing units in the community that are at-
risk of being converted to market rate units?
There are affordable housing units throughout California which were built 30 years ago with
federal low-interest mortgages from the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
with an agreement that the rents of these units be kept at a level affordable to low income
                                                                                                   53

Updated General Plan Housing Element

households. State Government Code §65863.10 requires owners of such projects to provide at
least nine months notice of contract termination or prepayment of federal assistance to tenants
and public agencies. State law requires an analysis cover a ten-year period, and be divided into
two periods, coinciding with updates of the Housing Element. There are three general cases
that can result in the conversion of publicly assisted units:
    1. Prepayment of HUD Mortgages: Section 221(d)(3). Section 202 and Section 236: A
         Section 221(d)(3) is a privately owned project where the U. S. Department of Housing
         and Urban Development (HUD) provides either below market rate loans or a subsidy to
         the tenants. With Section 226 assistance, HUD provides financing to the owner to
         reduce the costs for tenants by paying most of the interest on a market rate mortgage.
         Additional rental subsidy may be provided to the tenant. Section 202 assistance provides
         a direct loan to non-profit organizations for project development and rent subsidy for
         low income tenants. Section 202 provides assistance for the development of units for
         physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, and chronically mentally ill residents.
    2. Opt-outs and expirations of project based Section 8 contracts: Section 8 is a federally
         funded program that provides subsidies to the owner of a pre-qualified project for the
         difference between the tenant’s ability to pay and the contract rent. Opt-outs occur
         when the owner of the project decides to opt-out of the contract with HUD be pre-
         paying the remainder of the mortgage. Usually, the likelihood of opt-outs increases as
         the market rents exceed contract rents.
    3. Other: Expiration of the low income use period of various financing sources, such as the
         Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), Bond financing, density bonuses, California
         Housing Finance Agency (CFHA), Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and
         HOME funds and redevelopment funds. Generally, bond-financing properties expire
         according to a qualified project period or when the bonds mature. Former properties
         funded with Redevelopment Agency funds generally require a minimum affordability
         term of 30 years.
There is one subsidized housing development that was at risk of conversion to market rate.
However, according to ownership, Ukiah Autumn Leaves, a non-profit tax exempt corporation
has extended its Section 8 project based voucher financing. The result is the project will not
convert to market rate for at least an additional 10 years.
While the need is limited, this Housing Element includes a Program calling for the establishment
of an At-Risk Unit Program to address the issue of at-risk unit loss.

The City will contact qualified non-profit organizations or other agencies and explore
opportunities to assist and facilitate the transfer ownership of “at risk” units. Potential funding
sources may include:

         State Department of Housing and Community Development
         Mendocino County Housing Authority
         Burbank Housing Development Corporation
A Note on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Global Warming
The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon whereby the Earth’s heat is trapped in the
atmosphere by certain gases. Greenhouse gases thus contribute to maintaining a surface
temperature on Earth favorable to life. Industrialization and the population explosion that have
occurred over the past 200 years have been accompanied by a substantial increase in the use
of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, thus leading to an equally considerable increase
in greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. The additional greenhouse gas emissions have
in turn exacerbated the greenhouse effect, which appears to be the cause of the increase in the
temperature of the Earth’s surface and the lower layers of its atmosphere.
According to California Assembly Bill 32, "Global warming poses a serious threat to the
economic well-being, public health, natural resources, and the environment of California. The
potential adverse impacts of global warming include the exacerbation of air quality problems, a
reduction in the quality and supply of water to the state from the Sierra snowpack, a rise in sea
levels resulting in the displacement of thousands of coastal businesses and residences, damage
to marine ecosystems and the natural environment, and an increase in the incidences of
infectious diseases, asthma, and other human health-related problems."
The Legislature also found that Global warming "will have detrimental effects on some of
California’s largest industries, including agriculture, wine, tourism, skiing, recreational and
commercial fishing, and forestry. It will also increase the strain on electricity supplies necessary
to meet the demand for summer air-conditioning in the hottest parts of the state."
What Are the Sources of Greenhouse Gases? In the U.S., our greenhouse gas emissions
come mostly from energy use and fossil fuel combustion (automobiles). These are driven
largely by automobile use, the current manner of economic growth, fuel used for electricity
generation, and weather patterns affecting heating and cooling needs. Energy-related carbon
dioxide emissions, resulting from petroleum and natural gas, represent 82 percent of total U.S.
human-made greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation causes 38% of greenhouse gas
emissions in California.
Land Use and Greenhouse Gas: Over the past 50 years, urban sprawl in the immediate
vicinity of Cities has increased dramatically. Locally, urban development has occurred in an
unstructured manner outside the Ukiah City limits.
                                                                                                  55
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

These resulting areas are characterized by low-density; have increased distances between
residential areas and workplaces, businesses and services; are ill suited to modes of
transportation other than the automobile; have relatively less attractive central areas; and many
have vacant lots and underused or abandoned buildings.
Increase in automobile trips: Sprawling low density urban development generates
automobile trips that lead to substantial greenhouse gas emissions and, more specifically,
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Indeed, the automobile is the preferred if not the only
possible choice for transportation. As public transit choices, walking and cycling are often
unavailable, uneconomical, or inaccessible. Moreover, in urban areas, an increase in the use of
the automobile is accompanied by an increase in the number of vehicle trips and in the
distances traveled.
Conclusion: In response to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, as well as other
basic planning principals, a Guiding Principle for future housing development is to promote
green and sustainable building, water conservation, energy efficiency, pedestrian orientation,
and careful infill development.
Implementing programs are included to fulfil this Guiding Principle.
Opportunities for Energy and Water Conservation
There are positive opportunities for fulfilling the Guiding Principle to increase energy and water
conservation and efficiency in housing developments.
Energy Conservation: The City is currently operating a housing rehabilitation program with
the use of HOME grant funds. This program requires recipients to focus on energy efficiency
measures and to date nearly $400,000 has been utilized to improve existing housing units. The
City is poised to continue this program if successful in securing additional HOME grant funds in
the future.
The City also owns its own electric utility and offers a number of energy conservation incentives
and rebates for residential development. These include:
    Energy Efficiency & Solar Program
    Energy Efficiency Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Rebate Program
    Weatherization Rebate Program
    Energy Efficiency Water Heater Rebate Program
    Energy Efficiency Appliance Rebate Program
    Residential Lighting Program
The programs include higher incentive rebate amounts for lower income households.
The City is committed to continuing these programs and not only encouraging energy
conservation, but taking the steps to really making it happen.
Water Conservation: The City has been proactive in water conservation matters and offers
both indoor and outdoor water conservation tips on its website. The Planning Commission has
                                                                                               56

consistently raised water conservation issues when reviewing proposed development projects
and routinely requires native drought tolerant plant species in landscaping plans.
The City is committed to continuing these approaches to water conservation.

                                         Tracking Progress
                                  How Success Will be Measured
Measuring success is the key to knowing if the goal of Conserve, rehabilitate, and improve the
existing housing stock is being pursued and if progress is being made. To track progress, the
annual General Plan Housing Element Progress Report must ask and answer the following
questions:
                                                                                                   58
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

             What progress has been made to Conserve, rehabilitate, and improve the existing
              housing stock?
             What specific tasks are planned for the next year that will increase success?
                  Has internal consistency with other Elements of the General Plan been achieved
                   and maintained?
Why is this Goal important?
The 2008 Housing Conditions Survey revealed that 77% of the local housing stock was more 25
years old, and that 37% or 1,445 units needed moderate repairs, 0.9% need substantial
repairs, or and (23.4%) minor repairs. Additionally, the survey found that 567 residential units
needed window replacement or repair, and only 44% of the units showed evidence of window
insulation. In 2014, this housing stock has aged further.
A decent place to live is basic to human dignity and helps define a community’s quality of life.
The current housing situation in Ukiah does not provide enough decent housing for extremely
low income, very low income, low income, and persons in special need. It restricts opportunity
for seniors and young adults to remain in the community. It limits the ability of teachers and
other public service employees, people who work in local businesses and people who provide
child care and elder care to find housing so that they can live in the community where they
work.
How do the Goal and Policies Relate to the Guiding Principles?
One of the Guiding Principles is to promote and support green and sustainable building,
increase energy efficiency, and respond to climate change. This goal and associated policies
correspond directly to this Guiding Principle.
                                               Goal H-2
        “We want to provide housing for all economic segments of the community.”
                                    Policies to Support Goal H-2
H-2.1: Ensure that adequate residentially designated land is available to accommodate the City’s
share of the Regional Housing Need.
H-2.2: Continue to allow placement of manufactured housing units on permanent foundations in
residential zoning districts.
H-2.3: Encourage new condominium development to provide housing for persons desiring to
“scale-down” their housing circumstances and to provide broader opportunities for first-time
                                                                                                  59

home buyers and moderate income persons.
H-2.4: Continue to consider and explore HOME grant, CDBG and other funding sources to
facilitate housing affordable to extremely low, very low and low income households.
H-2.5: Continue to support the Ukiah Homeless Service Planning Group and homeless support
services in all ways feasible.
H-2.6 Promote the construction of new market rate single-family units.
                                        Implementing Tasks
                                   How Results Will be Achieved
H-2.a: Provide copies of the inventory of vacant and underdeveloped land for public distribution.
H-2.b: Work with public transit providers and developers to encourage housing development
located close to public transit facilities.
H-2.c: Provide reduced planning permit application fees for residential second dwelling units.
H-2.d: Review the zoning code and determine if any constraints to condominium developments
and cooperative living projects exist, and if so, eliminate the constraints.
H-2.e: As Staff and resources allow, assist the Ukiah Homeless Services Planning Group in all
ways possible.
H-2.f: The zoning code shall be amended to allow homeless facilities without the requirement
for a Use Permit in the M Manufacturing zoning district. The zoning code shall require a Site
Development Permit and facility management plan, and reasonable site development standards
for homeless facilities, pursuant to California Government Code Section 65583.
H-2.g: Do not permit the conversion of rental units to condominium units unless the City’s
amount of rental units is sufficiently adequate.
H-2.h: Do not permit the conversion of single family residential homes to professional offices
unless the City’s amount of residential units is sufficiently adequate.
H-2.i: Adopt an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance by 2017 that requires below-market rate
housing to be included as part of residential projects as follows:
     1. 20 percent of the units in a rental housing project of five or more units shall be
          affordable to very low and low-income households.
     2. 20 percent of the units in a for-sale project of five or more units shall be affordable to
          very low to moderate-income households.
     3. All housing projects involving 2 to 4 units shall pay a housing impact fee if established by
          the City.
                                                                                                     60
2014-2019 City of Ukiah
Updated General Plan Housing Element

    4. Alternative methods of meeting the intent of the inclusionary requirements such as the
          payment of an in-lieu fee deposited in the Housing Fund, or providing land for the
          construction of affordable units may be permitted under certain circumstances.
    5. Inclusionary units shall be constructed, rather than in-lieu fees being paid for larger
          housing developments. The threshold for this requirement shall be established in the
          Zoning Ordinance.
    6. The amount of in-lieu fees shall be established by a resolution of the City Council and
          bear a relationship to the difference between the sales price between market-rate versus
          affordable housing units.
    7. The allocation of inclusionary units among the income categories shall resemble the
          proportion of extremely low, very-low, low, and moderate income units identified in the
          Regional Housing Needs Determination to the maximum feasible extent.
H-2.j: Adopt the following minimum standards for inclusionary housing units:
    1. The exterior appearance of inclusionary units shall not be different than for other units in
          the housing development of which they are a part; and
    2. Inclusionary units shall be dispersed or distributed throughout the development rather
          than being concentrated in one portion of the development.
H-2.K: Prepare a Nexus Study by 2017 to determine if a nexus can be established requiring the
developers of large residential and commercial projects to construct needed affordable housing
units on site or in another appropriately zoned location near the place of employment and/or pay
a housing impact fee. If a nexus can be established, adopt the affordable housing requirement
or housing impact fee. The Nexus Study shall include an analysis of housing impacts on public
safety and the possible development of a Public Safety Impact fee for certain types of
development.
H-2.l: Identify and meet with nonprofit builders who specialize in building housing for extremely
low-income households. This effort is designed to build a long-term partnership in development,
gain access to specialized funding sources, identify the range of local resources and assistance
needed to facilitate the development of housing for extremely low-income households, and
promote a variety of housing types, including higher density, multifamily supportive, single room
occupancy and shared housing.
H-2.m: Work in conjunction with other agencies to jointly develop and implement a program
that is designed to address the needs of the extremely low income households in the City. At
least annually and on an on-going basis contact agencies and developers to facilitate
implementing the program. Actions to be considered for inclusion in the program include
prioritizing City/RDA funding, supporting grant and other applications for funding, and exploring
housing types and construction methods to promote housing for ELI citizens.
H-2.n: Amend the zoning ordinance to be consistent with Senate Bill 2. All transitional and
supportive housing shall be considered a residential use and only those restrictions that apply to
other residential uses of the same type (single family residential, duplex, multi-family, etc.) shall
be imposed.
H-2.o: Post the sites inventory map and housing development in commercial zones information
on the City’s website and prepare hard-copy informational handout material for property owners
                                                                                                      61

and developers.
H-2.p: Within 1-year of adoption of the Housing Element, conduct a roundtable meeting with
non-profit housing sponsors and developers to educate and share information about vacant and
underutilized sites, the planned development tool, the lot consolidation process, and incentives
offered by the City.
H-2.q: To ensure adequate sites are available throughout the planning period to meet the City’s
RHNA, the City will continue to annually update an inventory that details the amount, type, and
size of vacant and underutilized parcels to assist developers in identifying land suitable for
residential development and that also details the number of extremely low-, very low-, low-, and
moderate-income units constructed annually. If the inventory indicates a shortage of available
sites, the City shall rezone sufficient sites to accommodate the City’s RHNA.
The City has identified residential capacity within the mixed use zone to accommodate 284 units
of the City’s RHNA for lower-income households. To ensure sufficient residential capacity is
maintained within this zone to accommodate the identified need of 284 units, the City will
develop and implement a formal ongoing (project-by-project) evaluation procedure pursuant to
Government Code Section 56863. Should an approval of commercial development result in a
reduction of capacity within mixed use zones below the residential capacity needed to
accommodate the remaining need for lower-income households, the City will identify and zone
sufficient sites to accommodate the shortfall on land zones exclusively for residential multifamily
use allowing at least 16 du/acre.
H-2.r: Facilitate the consolidation of smaller, multi-family parcels by 1) publicizing the
underutilized sites inventory on the City’s website, and 2) providing technical assistance to
property owners and developers in support of lot consolidation. To encourage development of
quality housing at prices lower income households can afford on smaller, multi-family parcels, the
City will meet with non-profit sponsors and developers to promote strategies and the creation of
lot consolidation incentives.
H-2.s      Pursue annexation of land that can accommodate single-family residential development.

                                  How Success Will be Measured
Measuring success is the key to knowing if the goal of providing housing for all economic
segments of the community is being pursued and if progress is being made. To track progress,
the annual General Plan Housing Element Progress Report must ask and answer the following
questions:
             What progress has been made to housing for all economic segments of the
              community? What specific tasks have been accomplished?
             What specific tasks are planned for the next year that will increase success?
             Has internal consistency with other Elements of the General Plan been achieved and
              maintained?

                                               Goal H-5
     “We want to use land effectively to meet housing needs and to implement smart
    growth, green building, and sustainable development policies with a focus on infill
                                            development.”

                                  How Success Will be Measured
Measuring success is the key to determining if land is being used effectively to meet housing
needs and to implement smart growth, green building, and sustainable development policies, and
if progress is being made. To track progress, the annual General Plan Housing Element Progress
Report must ask and answer the following questions:
                  What progress has been made to determining if land is being used effectively to
                   meet housing needs and to implement smart growth, green building, and
                   sustainable development policies,? What specific tasks have been accomplished?
                  What specific tasks are planned for the next year that will increase success?
                  Has internal consistency with other Elements of the General Plan been achieved
                   and maintained?
Why are this Goal and these Policies important?
The goal and its associated policies are important because the City recognizes that the way in
which housing is designed and constructed, and where it’s constructed can adversely impact
                                                                                                   67

neighborhoods, the City, the region, the state, and ultimately the health of the planet. We
want progressive, healthy, and safe housing for all residents.
How do the Goal and Policies Relate to the Guiding Principles?
This goal and its policies directly relate to Guiding Principle No. 4
                                               Goal H-6
       “We want to maintain a collaborative working relationship with all groups and
  organizations dedicated to providing affordable housing in the community, and ensure
        broad public participation in the development of housing goals and policies.”
                                    Policies to Support Goal H-6
H-6.1: Continue to encourage and facilitate public participation in the formulation and review of
the City's housing and development policies.
H-6.2: Assume a Leadership Role in the development of all types of needed housing in the
community.

H-6.b: Develop a Housing Resources webpage that may be used to facilitate the development
and improvement of affordable housing. Included on the webpage could be items such as
funding resources, affordable housing development agencies and developers, energy
conservation and green-building resources and services.
H-6.c: Conduct periodic meetings with developers, non-profit housing development agencies,
the Ukiah Police Department and others to identify constraints to development of affordable
housing and use the information gained to consider zoning code amendments.

Construction: Construction of housing and housing starts of all types has slumped dramatically
over the past several years. However, the City is working with a number of local housing
developers to potentially create new senior and student housing opportunities.
Rehabilitation: The City is currently administering a housing/sewer lateral testing and
rehabilitation program using $500,000 of HOME grant funds. The eligible recipients extremely
low, very low and low income property owners. It is anticipated that the average sewer lateral
rehabilitation project will utilized approximately $20,000 in funds, so that the City expects to
complete a total 25 projects with the currently available funding.
Conservation/Preservation: Implementation measures are included to preserve and conserve
existing residential units. Measure H-1.d calls directs the City to consider steps to preserve and
conserve the existing 462 affordable mobile home units that house a significant number of
extremely low income seniors. Such steps could potentially include a specific rehabilitation
program for mobile home units. The 462 mobile home units were surveyed in 2009 and it was
discovered that the majority of the 135 survey responses received were from senior tenants in
the extremely low and very low income category. These are the units that are targeted for
preservation/conservation.

Consistency with Other General Plan Elements
The Draft General Plan Housing Element Update has been guided by the Vision Statement and
goals and polices of the existing General Plan. The General Plan Vision Statement includes the
following:
       We Envision……..development that provides a mix of housing types and
       process.”
The Draft updated Housing Element fulfils this vision.
Preliminary review of the goals and polices of other General Plan Elements reveals no
inconsistencies and therefore no need to amend the General Plan. Specifically, no proposed
goal, policy, or implementing program requires a modification to General Plan land use
classifications, street levels of service, infrastructure policies, open space goals, or natural
resource protection policies.
As housing development projects are proposed and the City or Redevelopment Agency
undertakes housing activities, the goals and policies of all General Plan Elements/Chapters are
examined to ensure consistency. In the event that a proposed project or housing activity is
inconsistent with the General Plan, the project applicant or City Staff could initiate an
amendment to the Plan to accommodate the project or activity. This process involves internal
staff review, CEQA compliance, a public hearing before the Planning Commission, and a public
hearing before the City Council.
                                                                                             72

    1.   The probable number of units takes into consideration property ownership, known long range plans of the property owner,
         location, market forces, and other constraints to development.
    2.   The traffic and access constraints are subjective and based on empirical observations and knowledge of the area
         surrounding each parcel. The potential number of units takes these observations into account and reflects a best guess or
         estimate of total probable units.
    3.   The drainage, creek, and flood zone constraints are listed because the sites are either located adjacent to or in close
         proximity to a creek or they are located in a 100-500 year flood area as mapped by FEMA. The potential number of units
         takes these observations into account and reflects a best guess or estimate of total probable units.
    4.   The Infill constraint merely recognizes that the sites are identified infill parcels that typically experience infill “issues” when
         proposed for development or redevelopment. These issues include neighborhood compatibility, noise, congestion, etc.
         Each site was evaluated independently with these “issues” in mind and the probable number of units were estimated
         accordingly.
    5.   The Airport B1 Zone limits the number of people on a site at any given time, and precludes multi-family residential
         development if the density standard cannot be met and other alternatives sites exist. The B2 Airport Compatibility Zone
         (Infill) allows a higher density than the B1, so that typical multi-family residential development (28 units per acre) can be
         achieved.
    6.   The same percentage reduction factor (36%) used in 2004 to arrive at the “Probable” units was used in 2009.
    7.   The 2009 land survey utilized GIS technology and more detailed field work than the 2004 land survey. As a result, additional
         vacant and underutilized parcels were discovered, and exact acreages were determined. In most cases, the size of the
         2004 parcels were reduced somewhat with the more exact GIS technology for determining their sizes.
    8.   In regard to the Underutilized Land, Staff made assumptions regarding potential additional units based on such factors as
         where existing buildings were located on the parcels, the presence of mature trees, creeks and other natural “constraints”,
         etc.
    9.   As indicated 3 of the 4 Northwest Pacific Railroad parcels are vacant. They are included in the list of underutilized parcels
         because they represent a prime lot consolidation opportunity with the 1 partially developed parcel.
    10. The Orchard Village/Manor parcels are listed as underutilized because the development on these parcels includes large
         expansive lawn/turf areas that could be utilized for additional affordable housing units.
    11. The residential development potential in the C-1 and C-2 zones is high. The maximum density allowed is 28 units per acre.
         Recently constructed housing developments in commercial zoning districts (non-mixed use) include a 6 unit apartment
         complex on North Main Street and a 12 unit apartment complex on South Main Street.
    12. The maximum density allowed in the high density and commercial zoning districts is 28 units per acre.
    13. There is a need for 234 extremely low, very low, and low income units. There is opportunity for 280 units on
         residentially zoned land (vacant, underutilized and redevelopable parcels).
    14. It should be noted that as of March, 2011, the railroad depot site owned by the North Coast Railroad Authority
         was being considered by the State of California for the new Courthouse location.

                                  Implementation Accomplishments
The City of Ukiah is committed to continually improving programs in the Housing Element to
ensure that the housing needs of the community are met. Reviewing past accomplishments is
an important step in developing housing strategies that are effective and address identified
community needs. State law requires the City to report on progress made in meeting the goals,
policies, and objectives set forth in the prior Housing Element. This includes reviewing progress
made in implementing programs included in the adopted element, and evaluating their
effectiveness and continued appropriateness for the City.
The last Housing Element was adopted in 2011 and covered the RHNA period from 2009 to
2014. Even with the loss of the Redevelopment Agency and a lack of staff and financial
resources, moderate to good progress was made implementing the 2009-2014 tasks.
