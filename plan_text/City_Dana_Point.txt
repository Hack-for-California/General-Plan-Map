Executive Summary
Community Profile
From its beginnings as a resort community by the sea, Dana Point has always prided itself on its beach
lifestyle, quality neighborhoods, and expansive views. After extensive growth and incorporation, the City
now consists of 4,134 acres, of which 1,993 are in the coastal zone. At buildout, nearly 40,000 residents
are expected to call Dana Point home and live in just over 16,500 units. The City is nearly built out and is
expected to add growth through the development of its few remaining vacant acres and reuse of
underutilized lands.
Dwelling units within the City vary considerably in size, from small apartments of 400 to 500 square feet
to large single-family homes exceeding 5,000 square feet. Existing and new home prices in Dana Point are
generally out of reach for lower and moderate income households, except for smaller condominium units,
and above moderate income households may also be priced out of larger homes. In a built-out coastal
community such as Dana Point, where undeveloped land is rare and valued much higher than in inland
communities, the downturn of the housing market has not softened prices to the point of broad
affordability.
DataQuick estimates an existing median home value of $539,750 in Dana Point, and new homes
constructed between 2000 and 2011 were largely sold at prices exceeding $1 million dollars. For renters,
housing is more affordable, although the 2010 Census estimates median gross rent at $1,783. As a result,
affordable housing remains a unique challenge that must be addressed at a citywide level in the context of
the General Plan.
Purpose of the Housing Element
The Housing Element of the Dana Point General Plan identifies and establishes the City's strategy for the
maintenance and development of housing to meet the needs of existing and future residents. It establishes
policies that will guide City decision making and an action program to implement housing goals for the
state-designated planning period: January 1, 2014, through September 30, 2021. These commitments are
an expression of the statewide housing goal of “early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living
environment for every California family,” as well as an expression of the concern of Dana Point residents
for the attainment of a suitable living environment for every Dana Point household.
The City’s housing strategy is based on a comprehensive evaluation of existing housing programs and
policies; an assessment of the City’s population, economic, and housing characteristics; and a discussion of
the physical and regulatory resources and constraints for housing production.
The Housing Element has been designed to address key housing issues in the City. These issues include
the provision of a mix and balance of housing types and costs to meet the needs of all segments of the
community while enhancing and preserving the community’s character, provision of affordable housing for
special needs groups in the community, and the maintenance of the existing affordable housing stock. The
Housing Element has also been designed to meet the legislative requirements of housing element law.

Regional Housing Needs Assessment
California’s housing element law requires that each city and county develop local housing programs
designed to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all income groups. This effort is
coordinated by the jurisdiction’s council of governments when preparing the state-mandated housing
element of its general plan. This “fair share” allocation concept is intended to ensure that each jurisdiction
accepts responsibility for the housing needs of not only its resident population, but for all households who
might reasonably be expected to reside within the jurisdiction, particularly lower income households.
The “fair share” allocation process begins with the State Department of Finance’s projection of total
statewide housing demand, which is then apportioned by the State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) among each of the state’s official regions. The City of Dana Point is in
the six-county Southern California region, which includes Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino,
Ventura, and Imperial counties. The agency responsible for assigning fair share targets to each jurisdiction
in this region is the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). In this Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA) cycle, SCAG delegated the responsibility for disaggregating housing needs for
Orange County jurisdictions to the Orange County Council of Governments (OCCOG).
A local jurisdiction’s “fair share” of regional housing need is estimated in terms of four factors:
  •    The number of units needed to accommodate forecast household growth;
  •    The number of units needed to replace demolitions due to attrition in the housing stock (i.e., fire
       damage, obsolescence, redevelopment and conversions to non-housing uses);
  •    Maintaining an ideal vacancy rate for a well-functioning housing market; and
  •    An adjustment to avoid an overconcentration of lower-income households in any one jurisdiction.
The new construction need must be allocated to four household income categories used in federal and
state programs: Very Low, Low, Moderate, and Above Moderate Income, defined operationally as
households earning up to 50%, 80%, 120%, and more than 120% of the Orange County median income.
The allocations are further adjusted to avoid an overconcentration of lower income households in any one
jurisdiction. The fair share allocation must also consider the existing “deficit” of housing resulting from
lower income households that pay more than 30% of their incomes for housing costs. This is the threshold
used by the federal government to determine housing affordability.

2014–2021 Growth Needs
The City of Dana Point’s allocation of the region’s housing need for the January 1, 2014, through
September 30, 2021, planning period is 327 units divided into income categories: 76 very low, 53 low, 61
moderate, and 137 above moderate income units.

City’s Response
The City of Dana Point is actively pursuing several avenues to preserve and create affordable housing
opportunities and accommodate the 327 units allocated in the RHNA. For new construction needs, the
City’s main resources are vacant land and underutilized land. The City has also identified numerous
programs to preserve the housing stock and facilitate the construction of additional housing.
As a highly desirable coastal community, the market for new housing in Dana Point is expected to remain
strong regardless of the downturn and slow recovery of the housing market. The City’s current
development pattern generally builds to the maximum density permitted by zoning. Dana Point seeks to
continue to yield the highest and best use of residential land, and understands that this vision includes
providing housing for all segments of the community. With this in mind, the City has increased
multifamily and affordable housing potential by permitting multifamily housing in the Community
Facilities zone and reduced regulatory barriers to mixed-income and affordable housing in multifamily
zones.
Vacant and Underutilized Lands
Vacant residential land and underutilized sites in Dana Point offer a variety of development opportunities,
ranging from single-family estates with ocean views to Single Room Occupancy efficiencies. The potential
buildout of each vacant parcel is calculated based upon existing densities, development standards, and
market conditions. Realistic capacity buildouts on vacant land result in the potential for 247 new units
(not including second units), of which 157 could serve lower income households. The breakdown by
income category is a hypothetical analysis based upon development standards, product types, tenure,
market trends, and financial and regulatory incentives.
A similar analysis for underutilized sites revealed a potential for 442 new units—87 for lower income, 76
for moderate income, and 279 for above moderate income households. The potential to achieve housing
development on underutilized sites within the planning period is bolstered by the Town Center Plan and
through ongoing discussions with property owners.

Quantified Objectives and Implementation Plan
The City’s Housing Element must establish goals, policies, quantified objectives, and action programs to
address the following needs:
  •    Providing adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity of housing.
  •    Assisting in the development of affordable housing.
  •    Removing governmental constraints if necessary.
  •    Conserving the existing stock of affordable housing.
  •    Promoting equal housing opportunity.
  •    Preserving "at-risk" housing.
In total, the City’s approved units, remaining vacant lands, and underutilized parcels are of sufficient
number, zoning, and size to accommodate the potential growth for all income levels prescribed in the
City’s RHNA. Special programs for housing assistance, rehabilitation, and preservation will help meet the
City's existing and future housing needs during the 2014–2021 planning period. A summary of quantified
objectives is provided in Table HES-2.
The City of Dana Point, in adopting the Housing Element, adopts the goals and programs that follow as
the framework for implementing its housing policies and strategies during the planning period. A detailed
summary table, Table HES-3, is provided in the following pages.

Introduction
Purpose
The Housing Element of the Dana Point General Plan identifies and establishes the City's strategy for the
maintenance and development of housing to meet the needs of existing and future residents. It establishes
policies that will guide City decision making and an action program to implement housing goals for the
state-designated planning period: January 1, 2014, through September 30, 2021. These commitments are
an expression of the statewide housing goal of "early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living
environment for every California family," as well as an expression of the concern that every Dana Point
household has a suitable living environment.
The City’s housing strategy is based on a comprehensive evaluation of existing housing programs and
policies; an assessment of the City’s population, economy, and housing characteristics; and a discussion of
the physical and regulatory resources and constraints for housing production.
The Housing Element has been designed to address key housing issues in the City. These issues include
the provision of a mix and balance of housing types and costs to meet the needs of all segments of the
community while enhancing and preserving the community’s character, provision of affordable housing for
special needs groups, and the maintenance of the existing affordable housing stock. The Housing Element
has also been designed to meet the legislative requirements of state housing laws in Government Code
Section 65580–65589.8.
Citizen Participation
Public outreach for the current planning period occurred through contact with residents, business owners,
developers, other governmental agencies, and nonprofit organizations. Outreach efforts presented
information and provided open forums for sharing input with regard to the City’s housing needs and
programs.
During 2012 and early 2013, the City heard from representatives of several housing nonprofits, including
South Orange County Alliance for Housing Our Community, Jamboree Housing Corporation, St. Joseph
Health, the Regional Center of Orange County, the Kennedy Commision and Mary Erickson Community
Housing. Input from these local affordable housing groups has furthered the City’s understanding of the
housing needs and constraints facing Dana Point and other nearby coastal communities. Some of the
housing problems raised included the lack of financial resources and community support for affordable
housing.
The Housing Element describes a variety of available resources and demonstrates the City’s commitment
to collaborating with the nonprofit housing community. The City seeks to decrease unnecessary costs of
housing development through studying fees and parking requirements in Programs 3.1 and 3.2. The City
will also continue to participate in county-administered programs that fund lower and moderate income
household home buying assistance, rental subsidies, and home maintenance through Programs 2.1, 2.2,
2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, and 6.3. The City will promote affordable housing opportunities to the public through
second units and the Housing Resources Directory (Programs 1.3 and 5.3).

                                       Dana Point         General Plan
On January 28, 2013, the City of Dana Point held a housing workshop at a publicly noticed Planning
Commission hearing at Dana Point City Hall. The workshop was advertised through the Dana Point
Times, The Dana Point News, the City’s website, and through direct invitations to local housing advocates,
nonprofits, developers, faith-based organizations, schools, the Chamber of Commerce, Senior Services,
local major employers, and anyone who asked to be notified of Housing Element events. The workshop
provided an opportunity for the City to explain the RHNA, explain why affordable housing is important
in Dana Point, and ask for input from the community on existing and future housing needs. While the
workshop was designed to elicit input from a variety of residents, there was a special focus on reaching
those who are lower income, including seniors, the disabled, families, and individuals in the workforce.
The City invited a wide variety of stakeholders to ensure participation from a cross-section of the
community.
Opportunities surfaced from the public comments received during the workshop and throughout the
course of the housing element update. The first was to increase housing support for special needs groups,
especially the developmentally disabled. The second opportunity was the need for readily available
affordable rental homes for seniors and families, as well as large families, and low wage workers (Kennedy
Commission letter January 28, 2013).These comments were incorporated into the programs of this
Housing Element. Program 5.3 addresses support of organizations seeking to provide housing
opportunities for special needs groups (e.g., developmentally disabled) through co-application for funding,
letters of support, and evaluating the use or reuse of existing housing stock. Additional input for the
Housing Element was provided by a professional study. In 2008 and 2011Mission Hospital and
Saddleback Memorial Hospital sponsored a Community Health Assessment, prepared by Professional
Research Consultants, Inc., to study the communities of Dana Point, San Clemente, and San Juan
Capistrano. The community health assessment was a systematic, data-driven approach to determining the
health status, behaviors, and needs of residents in these three communities. The goals of the assessment
were to: improve residents’ health status, increase their life spans, and elevate their overall quality of life;
reduce the health disparities among residents; and increase accessibility to preventive services for all
community residents. Using telephone interviews, 1,001 individuals aged 18 and over were randomly
selected to participate in the study. Of these 1,001 participants, 272 were from Dana Point, 418 were
from San Clemente, and 311 were from San Juan Capistrano. One of the four priority health and quality
of life issues for the region was reported to be “access to affordable homes.”
The community health assessment has two sections: housing and disability and secondary conditions. The
housing section looks at tenure characteristics, housing costs, availability of affordable housing, and
condition of neighborhood homes; the disability and secondary conditions section looks at activity
limitations. Need levels for these three communities were determined by St. Joseph Health System at the
block group level. Each block group population was examined for key demographic and socioeconomic
variables associated with community need (either positively or negatively). Selected characteristics are
analyzed based on the respondents’ level of need (high/highest need or average/lower need). Some key
findings from the assessment are described later in the Housing Element.
The outreach efforts described above resulted in a collection of input from residents, affordable housing
advocates, and housing developers. Their contributions shaped the ultimate outcome of the housing goals
and strategies for the City of Dana Point.

                                      Dana Point        General Plan
Upon receipt of approval from the state, public hearings will be held with the Planning Commission and
City Council to adopt the Housing Element.
Consistency with State Law
State housing law requires every city and county to prepare and adopt a housing element of the
community's general plan. The purpose of this update is to comply with the state housing law for the
current planning period of January 1, 2014, to September 30, 2021. Pursuant to state housing law, Dana
Point's Housing Element must include four major components:
  •    An assessment of the community's housing needs.
  •    An inventory of resources to meet those needs and the constraints that impede public and private
       sector efforts to meet them.
  •    A statement of the community's goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to the
       maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing.
  •    An implementation program that describes a schedule of actions that the local government is
       undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives
       of the housing element.
General Plan Consistency
The Housing Element of the General Plan is only one segment of a city’s comprehensive planning
program. The California Government Code requires that general plans contain an integrated, consistent
set of goals and policies. The housing element is thus affected by the other elements of the general plan:
for example, the land use element, which establishes the location, type, and density of residential
development throughout the City.
The Housing Element has been reviewed for consistency with the City’s other General Plan elements. As
portions of the General Plan are amended in the future, the Housing Element will be reviewed for the
purpose of maintaining internal consistency.
Organization of the Housing Element
The Housing Element consists of an executive summary, introduction, housing strategy, community
profile, and evaluation of the previous Housing Element. The executive summary encapsulates the critical
information presented in the Housing Element, including a brief description of the City’s community
profile, the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA), and the City’s regulatory, land use, and
programmatic responses and objectives.
The introduction discusses the purpose of the Housing Element, public participation activities, and
consistency with state law and the City’s other General Plan elements. The housing strategy describes the
RHNA, the City’s goals, policies, and implementation measures, and provides quantified objectives. The
community profile contains an assessment of supporting background information consistent with the
                                              December 2013

                                        Dana Point         General Plan
provisions of state housing law. Included at the end of the Housing Element is an evaluation of the
previous Housing Element programs and objectives.
Other specific components required by state housing law (Government Code Section 65583) include:
  •    Population and employment trends
  •    Housing stock characteristics
  •    Inventory of land suitable for residential development
  •    Units at-risk of conversion to market rate
  •    Governmental and non-governmental constraints on affordable housing
  •    Existing, future, and special housing needs of the population
  •    Opportunities for energy conservation in relation to residential development
Housing Strategy
The Housing Strategy presents the goals, policies, and quantified objectives of the City for the 2014–2021
planning period. This section is based on an evaluation of the City’s existing housing conditions, current
and future needs, and community input.
Regional Housing Needs Assessment
California’s housing element law requires that each city and county develop local housing programs
designed to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all income groups. This effort is
coordinated by the jurisdiction’s council of governments when preparing the state-mandated housing
element of its general plan. This “fair share” allocation concept is intended to ensure that each jurisdiction
accepts responsibility for the housing needs of not only its resident population, but for all households who
might reasonably be expected to reside within the jurisdiction, particularly lower income households.
The “fair share” allocation process begins with the State Department of Finance’s projection of total
statewide housing demand, which is then apportioned by the State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) among each of the state’s official regions. The City of Dana Point is in
the six-county Southern California region, which includes Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino,
Ventura, and Imperial counties. The agency responsible for assigning fair share targets to each jurisdiction
in this region is the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). In this Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA) cycle, SCAG delegated the responsibility for disaggregating housing needs for
Orange County jurisdictions to the Orange County Council of Governments (OCCOG).
A local jurisdiction’s “fair share” of regional housing need is estimated in terms of four factors:
  •    The number of units needed to accommodate forecast household growth;
                                                December 2013
                                                       -4-

                                      Dana Point          General Plan
  •    The number of units needed to replace demolitions due to attrition in the housing stock (i.e., fire
       damage, obsolescence, redevelopment, and conversions to non-housing uses);
  •    Maintaining an ideal vacancy rate for a well-functioning housing market;
  •    An adjustment to avoid an overconcentration of lower income households in any one jurisdiction.
The new construction need must be allocated to four household income categories used in federal and
State programs: very low, low, moderate, and above moderate income, defined operationally as households
earning up to 50%, 80%, 120%, and more than 120% of the Orange County median income. The
allocations are further adjusted to avoid an overconcentration of lower income households in any one
jurisdiction. The fair share allocation also considers the existing deficit of housing resulting from lower
income households that pay more than 30% of their incomes for housing costs. This is the threshold used
by the federal government to determine housing affordability.
2014–2021 Growth Needs
The City of Dana Point’s “fair share” of the region’s housing need for the January 1, 2014, through
September 30, 2021, planning period is 327 units: 76 very low, 53 low, 61 moderate, and 137 above
moderate income units.
Policy and Implementation Plan
The data for each of the needs cited in the state housing law are presented and discussed in the
Community Profile. This community profile also contains information on the housing resources and
constraints that must be included in the City’s Housing Element per state requirements. In addition to the
community profile data, the City’s Housing Element must establish goals, policies, quantified objectives,
and action programs to address the following needs:
  •    Providing adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity of housing
  •    Assisting in the development of affordable housing
  •    Removing governmental constraints if necessary
  •    Conserving the existing stock of affordable housing
  •    Promoting equal housing opportunity
  •    Preserving "at-risk" housing
The City of Dana Point, in adopting the Housing Element, adopts the goals that follow as the framework
for implementing its housing policies and programs during the planning period. A summary table, Table
HI-1, is provided first, followed by goals, policies, quantified objectives, and program descriptions.

Program Category #1: Identify Adequate Sites for a Variety of Housing Types
State housing law, section 65583 (c)(1), states that the City's housing program must include actions to:
    "Identify adequate sites which will be made available through appropriate zoning and
    development standards … to encourage the development of a variety of types of housing for all
    income levels…"
The purpose of this program category is to describe the actions that the City will take to ensure that a
variety of housing types can be accommodated, including multifamily rental housing, factory-built
housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters, and transitional housing. The City’s Land Use Element,
specific plans, and zoning code regulate the housing types permitted in the community.
GOAL 1:
Provide a variety of residential developments and adequate supply of housing to meet the existing and
future needs of City residents.
Policies
         1.1     Encourage affordable housing construction beyond levels identified by the RHNA.
         1.2     Provide a variety of housing opportunities for all income levels of the City through land
                 uses and densities.
         1.3     Coordinate new residential development with the provision of infrastructure and public
                 services.
         1.4     Locate higher density residential development close to public transportation.
Programs
1.1      Housing Element Sites Monitoring
Maintain an inventory of vacant and underutilized lands suitable for residential development to ensure
adequate capacity to meet the RHNA during the planning period.
Objective: Maintain capacity to meet the RHNA.
Timeframe: 2014–2021
1.2      Density Bonus Housing
Continue to comply with state density bonus housing laws by maintaining the City’s Density Bonus
Ordinance. Future housing projects will be encouraged to provide affordable housing in accordance with
the Density Bonus Ordinance.

                                       Dana Point           General Plan
Objective: Promote the development of 10 lower income units in the Town Center area through density
bonus incentives and/or a separate SRO project. Target extremely low income households (those earning
up to 30% of median income).
Timeframe: 2014–2021
1.3      Second Units
The City is aggressively seeking to encourage single-family homeowners to construct second units. The
City publishes a second unit information sheet that defines a second unit, provides an outline of
development requirements, and explains the permitting process. By disseminating this information the
City is increasing the potential for affordable housing on lots zoned for single-family residential
development, which would otherwise be unlikely locations for affordable housing. It is projected that by
2021 approximately 10 second units could be developed. In accordance with the City’s Second Dwelling
Unit Ordinance, these units will target lower to moderate income households and remain affordable for
the life of the project. This objective is based in part on past development trends and on increased efforts
of the City to promote and encourage the development of second units. Objective: Permit 1 to 2 lower
income second units annually, for a total of 10 units. Update the City’s Housing Resource Directory to
include information on second dwelling units as a housing option for residents with special needs, continue
to promote second units in the City’s Housing Resources Directory, with brochures, and on the City’s
website.
Timeframe: 2014–2021
Program Category #2: Assist in the Development of Affordable Housing
The City’s existing needs include 3,120 renter households that are cost burdened, expending more than
30% of their income toward housing. The City’s new construction need includes 76 very low income, 53
low income, and 61 moderate income housing units, which can be supported by vacant and underutilized
land.
GOAL 2:
Assist in the provision of housing affordable to lower income households.
Policies
         2.1      Support innovative public, private, and nonprofit efforts in the development and
                  financing of affordable housing, particularly for lower income households, the elderly,
                  large families, the physically impaired, and single-parent households.
         2.2      Support the participation of federal, state or local programs aimed at providing housing
                  opportunities for lower and moderate income households.
         2.3      Require that housing constructed for lower and moderate income households is not
                  concentrated in any single portion of the City.

                 resort developments.
         2.5     Provide for mixed commercial/residential land uses to create additional housing
                 opportunities.
2.1      Mortgage Credit Certificates
The Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC) program is a Federal Income Tax Credit program offered
through the County of Orange. The MCC increases the loan amount offered to a qualifying homebuyer
and reduces federal income taxes by 20% of the annual interest paid on the home mortgage. Home buyers
seeking to participate in the program must apply through a participating lender. The program requires
the buyer to purchase a single-family detached home, condominium, or townhouse within the program
boundaries, including the City of Dana Point. The buyer’s household income and home purchase price
cannot exceed limits established by the County.
Objective: Continue to apply with the County of Orange to maintain eligibility for Dana Point residents.
Timeframe: 2014–2021, annually
2.2      Mortgage Assistance Program
The Mortgage Assistance Program (MAP) provides silent second loans to assist very low and low income
first-time homebuyers. The 3% simple interest, deferred payment loan has a term of 30 years or upon sale
or transfer of property and a maximum loan amount of $40,000. The buyer must purchase a single-family
home, condominium, or home within a planned unit development to occupy as a primary residence. The
buyer must contribute a minimum 1% of the purchase price. The buyer’s household income and home
purchase price cannot exceed limits established by the county.
Objective: Continue to apply with the County of Orange to maintain eligibility for Dana Point residents.
Timeframe: 2014–2021, annually.
2.3      CalHome First-Time Homebuyer Assistance
The state allowed the County of Orange to apply for funds for those cities participating in their CDBG
program that provided a letter of interest. First-time homebuyers who qualify and wish to purchase a
home in Dana Point can apply for those silent second loans.
Objective: Continue to apply with the County of Orange to maintain eligibility for Dana Point residents
to participate in the CalHome First-Time Homebuyer Assistance program.
Timeframe: 2014–2021
2.4      Housing Initiative Program
The City partnered with Mary Erickson Community Housing to manage the housing subsidy program for
The St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort and Spa in 2002. As a condition of building the hotel, the City
mandated the housing subsidy program, which benefited 69 employees of the hotel in 2012. In 2007, the
amount of money to be spent on housing subsidies was $278,767 (annual in-lieu fees paid by the hotel).
                                             December 2013
                                                    -15-

                                       Dana Point        General Plan
The program allocates between $50 and $390 to eligible employees, with an average allocation of $251
using Section 8 guidelines.
Life skills programs are also held quarterly, with two meetings per speaker (one in English with a
Mandarin translator and one in Spanish). Topics covered include income tax awareness, preparing for
home ownership, credit counseling and money management, as well as legal aid question and answer
sessions and the program’s annual certification process.
Objective: Continue to collect in-lieu fees and support Mary Erickson Community Housing in operating
the Housing Initiatives Program. Assist 20 hotel employees who are Dana Point residents annually.
Timeframe: 2014–2021
Program Category #3: Remove Governmental Constraints to the Maintenance, Improvement, and
Development of Housing
State housing law requires the inclusion of program actions to:
     “Address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental constraints to the
     maintenance, improvement, and development of housing."
The City addresses these issues through implementation of the Zoning Code, by establishing a preference
for affordable housing projects, by streamlined processing of affordable housing proposals, and by working
with private developers on other programs such as density bonus units. The City does not unduly
constrain the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing. As a policy matter, the City will
facilitate the evaluation and processing of proposals and applications, which will help to attain the
affordable housing objectives set forth in the Housing Strategy.
GOAL 3:
Provide for a regulatory system free of governmental constraints to the maintenance, preservation,
improvement, and development of housing.
Policies
         3.1     Encourage incentives to assist in the development of affordable housing.
         3.2     Evaluate housing cost increases resulting from any new City requirements.
         3.3     Implement the provisions of the City's zoning ordinance that permit the development of
                 single room occupancy units, second units, transitional, supportive, and emergency
                 housing in specified zones.
Programs
3.1      Parking Standards Study
The City will perform a study of parking standards to identify appropriate reduced parking standards for
affordable housing units and reevaluate parking standards for special needs housing projects, such as
                                              December 2013
                                                    -16-

                                       Dana Point         General Plan
housing for the elderly and/or disabled. For example, less parking may be justified due to lower income
levels and decreased car ownership of senior residents.
Objective: Conduct a parking study to identify appropriate reduced parking standards for affordable and
special needs housing.
Timeframe: Conduct study in fiscal year 2013–2014; depending on findings, the City will adopt new
standards by December 31, 2015
3.2       Development Fee Study
The City will periodically conduct a study to ensure that development fees are reasonable and identify
possible reductions for affordable and special needs housing projects.
Objective: Conduct a fee study.
Timeframe: Conduct study every four years; depending on findings and at City Council’s discretion the
City will revise fees; the next study will be conducted by December 31, 2015.
3.3       Priority Water and Sewer Services
Service providers, particularly water and sewer, can assist in the facilitation of expediting affordable
housing development by providing priority service to housing developments that serve lower income
households. Service providers are impacted by residential development and therefore should be aware
of the City’s housing plans. SB 1087 requires local governments to provide the adopted Housing
Element to the appropriate water and sewer provider, and the service provider must adopt procedures
to facilitate priority servicing and future planning for lower income water and sewer needs.
Objective: Route the adopted Housing Element to the South Coast Water District (SCWD) and
coordinate with the SCWD on future housing projects and changes to the Housing Element.
Timeframe: Forward the adopted Housing Element within one month of certification
3.4       Energy Conservation Study
During the upcoming update to the General Plan evaluate the most cost-effective measures for
energy savings and indoor air quality improvements in new construction and rehabilitation projects.
Form a partnership with San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) to capitalize on their existing energy
conservation programs. By educating the public and providing resources for utility programs and
home improvement programs the City will encourage home upgrades and construction methods that
reduce energy reliance, water waste, and air pollutants.
Objective: Provide the findings of this research and available SDG&E programs to the public and
development community through brochures at City Hall and on the City’s website..
Timeframe: Conduct study during the General Plan update. At City Council discretion adopt an
energy conservation incentive program by December 31, 2015. Form a partnership with SDG&E and
promote their programs by June 30, 2014. Continually disseminate information on SDG&E energy
conservation programs.

3.5      Exemptions for Extremely Low Income Affordable Housing
The City and other agencies collect a variety of fees and assessments to cover the cost of processing
development permits and providing local services. At City Council’s discretion the City will consider
fee exemptions and deferrals on a case-by-case basis and will adopt incentives such as reduced impact
fees to encourage the development of housing affordable to extremely low income (<30% of AMI)
households. Reduced or exempt fees could include the fees for parks, transportation, general
government, fire, and public art.
Objective: Adopt incentives for the development of housing affordable to extremely low income
(<30% of AMI) households through exemptions or reductions in development fees for deed-
restricted, extremely low income affordable housing. Fee study to be conducted in FY 2013/2014 and
incentive program, at City Council discretion, to be adopted by December 31, 2015.
Timeframe: December 31, 2015
Program Category #4: Conserve and Improve the Condition of the Existing Stock of Affordable Housing
According to the state housing law, the City's housing program must include actions to:
    "Conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing stock, which may include
    addressing ways to mitigate the loss of dwelling units demolished by public and private action."
The emphasis of this program category is the maintenance and improvement of Dana Point's existing
affordable housing supply. Another purpose of this program category is to describe actions that will
mitigate the loss of housing to both the housing market and the residents of the existing dwelling units.
Many of the City's current activities satisfy the requirements of this program category: for example, code
enforcement, neighborhood conservation, and zoning code regulations pertaining to condominium
conversions.
GOAL 4:
Conserve and improve the existing stock of affordable housing.
Policies
         4.1     Support a code enforcement program to help maintain the physical condition and
                 appearance of neighborhood areas.
         4.2     Encourage the retention of existing single-family neighborhoods, apartments, and mobile
                 home parks that are economically and physically sound.
         4.3     Provide neighborhood conservation and residential rehabilitation programs that offer

                                      Dana Point          General Plan
Programs
4.1      Owner Rehabilitation
The City will continue to apply to the County of Orange for CDBG and HOME funds, upon issuance of
Notice of Funding Announcements, so Dana Point households will remain eligible to participate in the
programs. Under the Neighborhood Preservation Program, the county offers funding for housing
rehabilitation focused on owner-occupied single-family homes and mobile homes. The funds are
distributed on a competitive basis. The City has applied for CDBG through the County to implement
housing rehabilitation programs to address health and safety needs and preserve the existing housing
stock. Explore CDBG funding directly through the State if the County of Orange is unlikely to provide
funding.
The program can provide rehabilitation assistance to owner-occupied properties for low income households
by:
  •    Providing reduced interest rates
  •    Expanding loan eligibility
  •    Matching funds from banks
  •    Expedited loan processing
Objective: Provide assistance to 4 lower income households annually, up to a total of 20 households.
Timeframe: 2014–2021, apply upon issuance of NOFAs
4.2      Rental Rehabilitation
The County offers rental rehabilitation funding for various housing types, including multifamily and
mobile homes. The City has applied for CDBG through the County to implement housing
rehabilitation programs to address health and safety needs and preserve the existing housing stock.
Objective: Provide assistance to 2 lower income households annually, up to a total of 10 households.
Timeframe: 2014–2021, apply upon issuance of NOFAs
4.3      Neighborhood Conservation
This program will involve the continued implementation of a system of monitoring neighborhood
conditions (i.e., structures, public amenities such as sidewalks) and utilize General Funds, CDBG funds
and the Code Enforcement Program to maintain the integrity of these neighborhoods. For example,
CDBG funding supported the improvements to storm drains and the construction of the Lantern Village
Community Park. The City completed a Neighborhood Maintenance and Improvement Guide in 2008
and also has a Capital Improvements Program (CIP) that helps to revitalize infrastructure. Future
improvements could include repair or replacement of concrete curb, sidewalk, curb/gutter, and cross-
gutters. Roadway renovation techniques include total reconstruction, slurry seal, and asphalt overlays.
These projects will ensure safe, structurally sound, and functionally adequate facilities to improve target
area neighborhoods.

organizations and other resources are appropriate to meet their needs.
Additionally, the City will support organizations seeking to provide housing opportunities for special
needs groups (e.g., developmentally disabled) through co-application for funding, letters of support, and
evaluating the use or reuse of existing housing stock. The City will include a section highlighting housing
options such as second dwelling units that are suitable for persons with special needs in the housing
directory and on the City’s website.
Objective: Continually update the Dana Point Housing Resources Directory and assist individuals and
organizations on an as-needed basis.
Timeframe: 2014–2021
5.4      Housing for Persons with Disabilities, including persons with Developmental
Disabilities
To implement this program the City will establish regulatory incentives such as reduced impact fees
and/or fee waivers to facilitate the development of new or rehabilitation of existing housing for persons
with disabilities, including persons with developmental disabilities.
Prior to adoption of program, at City Council’s discretion, the City will consider fee exemptions and
deferrals on a case-by-case basis to encourage the development of housing for persons with disabilities.
In order to meet the needs of disabled residents the City will continue to maintain its relationship with
the Regional Center of Orange County and foster new relationships with developers of supportive
housing.
Objective: Assist in the development or rehabilitation of up to 10 housing units for persons with
disabilities including persons with developmental disabilities. Conduct regulatory incentives study as

Program Category #6: Preserve Existing Assisted Housing Developments
According to state housing law the City's housing program must include actions to:
    "Preserve for lower income households the assisted housing developments" …existing in the City.
The purpose of this program category is to describe actions that the City will take to preserve the
affordability of existing housing units that are eligible to change from low income housing uses due to
termination of subsidy contracts, mortgage prepayment, or expiration of restrictions on use. "Assisted
housing developments" include: federally assisted projects; state and local multifamily revenue bond–
financed projects; developments assisted by CDBG and local in-lieu fees; and density bonus units.In
addition, this program category describes other actions of the City to preserve the affordability of the
existing housing supply.
GOAL 6:
Preserve the existing and future supply of affordable housing that is financially assisted by the City,
county, state, or federal governments.
Policies
         6.1     Monitor and protect the supply of affordable housing.
         6.2     Facilitate the purchase by existing tenants of rental units converted to condominium
                 ownership where conversions are considered appropriate.
         6.3     Conserve affordable housing opportunities in the City through implementation of state
                 requirements for replacement of lower and moderate income housing.
         6.4     Ensure the long-term affordability of future affordable housing developments.
Programs
6.1      Affordable Housing Monitoring
The Community Development Department annually monitors deed-restricted units through existing
databases. The City will include affordable housing monitoring as a condition of approval for projects with
an affordable housing component. Monitoring may include identifying the location, size, type, and sales
price of affordable units as well as other means of furthering the City’s understanding of their affordable
housing stock. The City will continue its program of annual monitoring of income-restricted rental
housing units. The City will provide ongoing preservation technical assistance and educational materials to
affected tenants and the community at large on the need to preserve the existing affordable housing stock
through brochures at City Hall.

                                      Dana Point          General Plan
Objective: Adopt affordability monitoring as a condition of approval for affordable housing projects and
distribute educational materials on affordable housing conversion to the public at City Hall.
Timing: As affordable housing projects are approved during the planning period.
6.2      Conservation of Existing Assisted Housing
The Community Development Department will continue to monitor the affordability terms of existing
assisted housing and notify qualified entities when affordable units are at risk of converting to market
rents. The City will work with existing owners and qualified entities to ensure long-term affordability to
lower income households. A brief description of a potential partnership program is given below:
  •    The existing building will contain units at risk of converting to market rate by 2024.
  •    The City and nonprofit organization will jointly estimate the acquisition and rehabilitation costs
       associated with different building sites in the City.
  •    The City and nonprofit organization will leverage their financial resources with those that the
       County of Orange is obligated to allocate to community based nonprofit housing corporations.
Objective: Monitor at-risk projects on an annual basis, in coordination with other public and private
entities. Identify funding resources and development partners to preserve 44 at risk units.
Timing: 2014–2021
6.3      Section 8 Rental Assistance
The City will continue to implement the participation agreement with the Orange County Housing
Authority (OCHA). The Section 8 program provides rental assistance to very low income families and
elderly persons who spend more than 30% of their income on rent. The rental assistance is the difference
between the excess of 30% of the monthly income and the federally approved fair market rent.
Objective: Provide rental assistance to extremely low, very low, and low income households through
participation in the Section 8 Rental Assistance program.
Timeframe: 2014–2021

Community Profile
An evaluation of population and housing characteristics is the foundation for establishing housing goals,
programs, and quantified objectives. This section provides statistical information and analysis of
demographic and housing factors that influence the demand for and availability of housing. The purpose
of this section is to identify existing housing needs for all segments of the City’s population.
Please note that the Housing Element draws from the most current data available. A variety of trusted
sources are cited, including the United States Census (Census), American Community Survey (ACS),
California Department of Finance (DOF), and Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
RHNA Methodology Technical Appendices. The data, even when from the same overall source, may
occasionally appear inconsistent and are subject to rounding. The inconsistencies are most commonly the
result of internal differences in Census data, which collects and presents data from two different survey
methodologies. Some data are collected for every United States citizen (also referred to as 100% or
Summary Tape File 1), while other data are statistically inferred (also called sample data or Summary Tape
File 3). The differences are not significant and have been vetted to ensure the analysis remains valid.
Population Trends and Characteristics
Population Growth
The City of Dana Point is one of 34 cities in Orange County. As indicated in Table H-1, the county’s
population rapidly grew from 2.4 million in 1990 to 2.8 million in 2000, an increase of 18%. By 2010 the
county population grew to 3 million, a 6% increase from the 2000 population. Growth in the City of
Dana Point has been significantly slower than the county, due largely to the built out nature of the City.
Between 1990 and 2000 Dana Point’s population increased by 9%, or 3,214 persons. In 2010 the
population decreased by 1,500 people to 33,351, down 4.3% from 2000.

Age Composition
Age composition is an important factor in determining housing demands. As shown in Figure H-1, the
City of Dana Point has experienced a major increase of residents from the “retirement” and “senior
citizens” population subgroups. This indicates a potential need for affordable senior housing opportunities.
Between 2000 and 2010, the median age increased from 39.8 to 44.8. This indicates that residents are
able to age in place.
In 2010, the largest percentage of the population (42%) fell within the “prime working” population
subgroup, which also correlates to the “preschool” and “school” subgroups, representing another 20% of
the population. In general, families create demand for homeownership opportunities and rental
opportunities with two or more bedrooms.
Race and Ethnicity
The City of Dana Point remains primarily white with no change in the non-white population between
2000 and 2010. According to the 2010 Census, 86% of the City’s population is white. It should be noted
that persons of Hispanic origin are included within the various ethnic categories and may be of any race.
The 2010 Census estimates that 17% of the City’s population is Hispanic or Latino. Figure H-2 displays
the breakdown of Dana Point residents by race and ethnicity.
Employment Industries in the City
According to the U.S. Census Bureau Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) there were
8,624 jobs within the City of Dana Point in 2010. Approximately half of the jobs within the City are in
the “accommodation and food services” and “retail trade” sectors (35% and 15%, respectively). Jobs in the
service sectors are the largest employers due to popular recreational activities, hotels, and resort facilities in
the City. Jobs in these sectors are expected to increase slightly following the anticipated construction of a
hotel and various commercial uses in the Headlands and Town Center planning areas. Although both
projects incorporate residential uses, job creation could create additional demand for affordable housing.

Employment of Residents
Residents of Dana Point work in an array of industries. As show in Table H-3, Educational Services,
Retail, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services as well as Health Care and Social Assistance are
some of the most popular. The “accommodation and food services” and “retail trade” sectors employ
about 20% of residents, which means that at least 30% of the workers in these industries commute to
the City. Providing housing for these workers is an opportunity for the City.

Household Characteristics
Analyzing existing household characteristics and trends will identify potential household issues and needs.
By definition a “household” consists of all the people occupying a dwelling unit, whether or not they are
related.
Household Growth Trends
In 2010 14,708 households (occupied residences) resided in Dana Point, with approximately 64% (9,402)
owner occupied and the remaining 37% (5,419) renter occupied. The City added 1,263 housing units
between 1990 and 2010, growing to an estimated 15,924 units in 2010. Housing units have increased
slowly, averaging only 24 units per year since 2000. Household size in 2000 was 2.4 persons; with the
decrease in population it fell to 2.3 in 2010.
The majority of housing units added between 1990, 2000, and 2010 were single-family detached;
historically the most commonly added attached housing unit type was in developments of five or more
units, which includes apartments and condominiums. Apartments are renter occupied and can be
considered more affordable for lower income residents. Condominiums, however, are owner occupied and
are generally highly priced in a beach community such as Dana Point. Condominiums that are made
available for rent are sometimes used as seasonal or recreational housing units.
Household Type
As shown in Table H-6 for 2010, the City’s households comprise primarily three types: married couples
with no children (32%), people living alone (28%), and married couples with children under 18 years
(16%). The majority of households in the City are occupied by married-couple families without young
children. This category is likely to include couples in the “young adult” and “prime working” population
subgroups, as well as retired couples and senior couples. Retired and senior couples may be primarily
residing in large homes they once occupied with their children, whereas young couples are more likely to
occupy apartments and other small rental units. However, young childless couples may also create a
demand for homeownership opportunities as they desire investment opportunities and consider having
children.
The segment of the population that lives alone can generate a need for small rental and ownership units,
especially those designated for seniors, while married-couple families with children typically create a
demand for ownership opportunities of single-family detached units.

Tenure
The 2011 American Community Survey indicates that just under 60% of the City's housing units are
owner occupied. Most of the owner households are single-family detached and single-family attached
housing units, as reported in Table H-7. There was an 80% increase in renter occupied single-family
detached housing units between 2000 and 2010. Multifamily units saw a decline in owner occupancy
indicating that more owners are renting out their condominium units, most likely due to a tough housing
market and a down economy. Renter households reside primarily in multifamily structures of two to four
units. While the large number of renters in duplex to fourplex structures can indicate a need for first-time
homebuyer assistance, rental housing is also a valuable resource for many singles and young couples
seeking to live in Dana Point.

Vacancy Rates
The vacancy rate is a measure of the general availability of housing. It also indicates how well the housing
units meet the current housing market demand. A low vacancy rate may increase market rents and
housing costs, because shortages tend to result in higher prices and may further limit the choices of
households seeking adequate housing. A high vacancy rate may indicate either the existence of a high
number of units undesirable for occupancy or an oversupply of housing units. The availability of vacant
housing units provides households with choices on different unit types to accommodate changing needs.
Excluding seasonal, recreational, and occasional-use homes, the 2010 Census indicated a vacancy rate of
7.0% for rental units and 2.0% for ownership units for the City of Dana Point. A vacancy rate within this
range is considered enough to ensure the continued upkeep of rental and ownership properties without

escalating housing costs. This high vacancy rate is most likely due to an oversupply of housing units
relative to a slightly declining population and second homes typical of beach communities.
Housing Conditions
Housing is considered substandard when physical conditions are below the minimum standards of living,
which are defined by Section 1001 of the Uniform Housing Code. A housing unit is considered
substandard if any of the following conditions exist:
  •    Inadequate sanitation                      •    Fire hazards
  •    Structural hazards                         •    Inadequate maintenance
  •    Nuisances                                  •    Overcrowding
  •    Faulty weather protection                  •    Hazardous wiring, plumbing, or
                                                       mechanical equipment
Households living in substandard conditions are considered in need of housing assistance even if they are
not actively seeking alternative housing arrangements. In addition to structural deficiency and standards,
the lack of certain infrastructure and utilities often indicates substandard conditions.
According to the 2009–2011 ACS, there were 28 owner units and 152 renter units without complete
kitchen facilities. There were 120 renter units without complete plumbing facilities, of which 8 were
inhabited by households considered overcrowded (more than one occupant per room). Households in Dana
Point use a variety of heating sources: 78% use utility gas, 17% use electricity, 3% do not use a fuel
source, and 0.5% use an alternative fuel. These figures indicate that only a small proportion of units in the
City reflect substandard infrastructure and utility conditions.
Age of Housing Stock
The proportion of the housing stock that is older than 30 years can also indicate the extent of minor and
major rehabilitation needs. The majority of the City’s housing supply was constructed prior to
incorporation in 1989. Table H-8 indicates that as of 2010, an estimated 60% of the City's housing stock
was over 30 years old. Approximately 30% of owners and 20% of renters occupy the City’s older housing
stock.

Code enforcement data from 2007 estimated that 3,000 housing units were in need of minor, moderate,
or substantial rehabilitation. As of 2012, it is estimated that this figure remains accurate, or has been
slightly reduced as economic recovery has led to improved investment and maintenance of properties
throughout the City. Of the housing units that continue to need minor, moderate, or substantial
rehabilitation, about one-half are in the Lantern Village neighborhood and in the form of small,
multifamily structures. In 2007 the City created an additional Code Enforcement Officer position to
specifically serve Lantern Village, bringing Code Enforcement Division staff to three full-time employees.
Code Enforcement cases indicate the need for housing rehabilitation programs.
In addition to housing rehabilitation needs, there are also housing units in need of replacement. Some
units may need to be replaced due to conversions or casualty losses such as fires. Units needing
replacement because of these reasons have already been considered in SCAG’s allocation of the regional
housing need allocation. Other housing units require replacement because they are too deteriorated to
merit rehabilitation. Based on the housing supply greater than 60 years old, the City estimates that there
are about 50 to 100 units beyond repair and, therefore, needing replacement.
Household Income
Each year the California Department of Housing and Community Development establishes four income
categories for the purpose of determining housing affordability and need in communities. State law defines
the income groups in terms of the percentage of the median income:
   •   0–50% of the median income refers to very low income
   •   51–80% of the median income refers to low income
   •   81–120% of the median income refers to moderate income
   •   120%+ of the median income refers to above moderate income

According to SCAG estimates, approximately 36% of Dana Point households have incomes of less than
80% of the County median income. The majority of lower-income households are renter households,
indicating a need for affordable rental opportunities.

Housing Inventory and Market Conditions
This section summarizes the housing inventory and prevailing market conditions in the City of Dana
Point. Analysis of current market conditions provides insight into the City’s existing stock of affordable
housing. Understanding past housing trends can also indicate the City’s future ability to meet housing
needs.
Housing Costs and Affordability
This section discusses the costs and affordability of existing housing and new housing, both for owner and
rental households. The affordability of housing concerns the balance between a household’s financial
means and the cost of adequate housing and amenities. The costs of homeownership and renting can be
compared to a household’s ability to pay for housing, based on a percentage of the median income for
Orange County and current market prices.
State housing policy defines housing affordability as housing costs equaling no more than 30% of a
household’s annual income (although the equity and tax benefits of homeownership may permit a higher
percentage of income [e.g., 35%] to be used for moderate income housing costs). Table H-10 identifies
the maximum affordable rents and purchase prices by income category for a one-person, two-person, and
four-person household based on 2012 state income limits.
The cost of homeownership assumes a 30-year mortgage with a 10% down payment and allocations for
annual real estate taxes, insurance, and utilities. Note that the various local, state and federal housing
programs may require different calculations of maximum affordable rent or purchase prices.

Affordability of Ownership Units
Existing and new home prices in Dana Point are slowly rising as the community recovers from the
recession of the mid-2000s. Although home prices in Orange County’s coastal communities generally were
not as severely impacted as those in inland communities, foreclosures and short sales significantly
increased, which weakened the local housing market. According to DataQuick, the median home sales
price in Dana Point was $539,750 in 2011 and $561,750 in 2012.

Based on this data, buying a new home in the City of Dana Point is an unlikely option for lower and
moderate income households without substantial financial assistance. The existing stock of resale units will
provide some homeownership opportunities for lower income households, particularly for smaller units in
older areas of the community and in condominium projects.
Affordability of Rental Units
The 2009–2011 ACS reports the median gross rent of all rental units in the City at $1,783. While rental
prices have increased more slowly than sale prices, relatively few rental properties have been recently
constructed in Dana Point. In December 2012, the average apartment rent was $1,466 for a one
bedroom, $1,689 for a two bedroom, and $2,722 for a 3 bedroom condo or single-family home
(Trulia.com).
A comparison of market prices with the rental affordability limits presented in Table H-10 indicates that
the 2012 rental market could serve the moderate and above moderate income households. Rental units
require less land and can be built at higher densities than many ownership products. Additionally, rental
units do not require the same level of amenities as is expected in ownership developments. The
construction of additional rental units represents a key step in providing affordable housing opportunities
for current and future moderate income households. For lower income households, two rental assistance
programs are available. Through the City’s participation with the Orange County Housing Authority
(OCHA) and the Section 8 program, 33 Dana Point households received assistance as of October 2012.
Additionally, the Housing Initiative Program operated by Mary Erickson Community Housing in
collaboration with the St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort and Spa provides rental assistance to hotel
employees. In 2012, approximately 69 employees received assistance, 16 of whom found affordable
housing in Dana Point.
Perceived Housing Affordability and Neighborhood Home Conditions
The 2008 and 2011 Community Health Assessment conducted by Mission Hospital of over 1,000 South
Orange County residents, including 272 in Dana Point, investigated the perceived availability of
affordable housing. Of the Dana Point residents surveyed, 75.2% rated the availability of affordable
housing in their community as “fair” or “poor” (the full range of ratings included excellent, very good,
good, fair, or poor). This was in line with the average response from all individuals surveyed (75.3%). In
Dana Point 63.6% of high or highest need adult respondents rated the availability of affordable housing as
“fair” or “poor” while 78.4% of average or lower need respondents rated the availability of affordable
housing as “fair” or “poor.”
Based on the same rating options, 5.2% of Dana Point residents surveyed considered the condition of their
neighborhood homes to be “fair” or “poor.” This is less than the 9.7% overall response from all individuals
surveyed in the Community Health Assessment. Respondents from the high or highest need areas of Dana
Point were virtually the only Dana Point residents to rate the condition of their neighborhood homes as
“fair” or “poor.”

Housing Needs
The following analysis of current City housing conditions presents housing needs and concerns relative to
various segments of the population. Several factors will influence the degree of demand or need for new
housing and housing assistance in Dana Point in coming years. The three major categories of existing need
considered in this element include:
  •    Overpayment: Overpayment refers to renters and homeowners who pay more than 30% of their
       gross incomes for shelter.
  •    Overcrowding: In response to higher housing prices, lower income households must often be
       satisfied with smaller, less adequate housing for available money. This may result in overcrowding
       where more than one person per room occupies a housing unit.
   •   Special Needs: Special needs are those associated with relatively unusual occupations or
       demographic groups that call for very specific program responses, such as preservation of residential
       hotels or the development of four-bedroom apartments. State law specifically requires analysis of the
       special housing needs of the elderly, the disabled, single-parent households, large families, farm
       workers, and homeless persons.
Overpayment
Overpayment is generally defined as a renter household spending more than 30 percent or an owner
household spending more than 35 percent of gross monthly household income on rent or a mortgage.
Eventually this high cost of housing causes individuals with fixed incomes, particularly the elderly and
lower income families, to spend a disproportionate percentage of their income for housing. This may cause
a series of related financial problems, which may result in a deterioration of housing stock because
maintenance must be sacrificed for more immediate expenses such as food, clothing, health care, and
utilities. It may also result in the selection of inappropriately sized units that do not suit the space or
amenity needs of the household. SCAG estimates that there are 1,686 renter and 1,293 homeowner
households moderately overpaying and 1,434 renter and 2,014 homeowner households severely
overpaying. Based on 2011 ACS data, 56% of renters overpay and 43% of homeowners contribute more
than 30 percent of their income for housing. Additionally, about 80 percent of lower income renters and
roughly 60 percent of lower income owners allocate more than 30 percent of their income for housing
costs. The ACS acknowledges error rates of 25 to 50 percent (based on sampling methodology), so these
figures may be exaggerated. Nevertheless, it is safe to assume that a majority of lower income households
currently pay more than 30 percent of their income in housing costs.
The Mission Hospital 2011 Community Benefit Report studied the number of households that
worked extra in order to make housing payments throughout the past year. Of the survey respondents
from Dana Point, San Clemente, and San Juan Capistrano, 17% indicated that they or a member of
their household worked an extra job or extra hours in order to afford a housing or rental payment. As
might be expected, adults with the highest needs were more likely to indicate working extra in the
past year in order to make a housing payment than those with average or fewer needs.

Overcrowding
In response to higher housing prices, lower income households often settle for smaller, less adequate
housing. This may result in overcrowding. Overcrowding places a strain on physical facilities and does not
provide a satisfying living environment. While some families with low incomes may opt for overcrowding
to derive additional income, the cost of housing usually necessitates overcrowding for many lower-income
residents.
Both state and federal housing law define overcrowded housing units as those in which there are more
persons than rooms. Severe overcrowding is measured by the number of housing units with 1.51 or more
persons per room. The rooms do not include bathrooms, kitchens, and hallways, but includes other rooms
such as living and dining rooms. An overcrowded housing unit does not necessarily imply one of
inadequate physical condition.
According to a SCAG estimate, there are 268 overcrowded households in Dana Point, representing less
than 2% of all households. The overwhelming majority of overcrowded households were renters, but
overcrowding is not prevalent in the City.

Special Needs Groups
Certain population groups are considered to have special housing needs. These groups include disabled
persons, the elderly, large households, farm workers, female householders, extremely low income
households, and homeless persons and persons in need of emergency shelter. In many cases, the needs of
these population groups are met in housing specifically designed for them.
The City publishes a Housing Resources Directory to assist Dana Point residents in finding affordable
housing and related support. The directory describes programs operated by the City and other agencies
and lists appropriate contact information. Many of these programs serve the special needs populations
such as the disabled, homeless, and those in need of transitional housing.
Disabled Persons
The Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 104.3(j) defines a disabled person as "any individual who
has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities, has record
of such impairment, or is regarded as having such impairment." The disabled population encompasses
several distinct groups such as, but not limited to, the physically handicapped, developmentally disabled,
and severely mentally ill. The special housing needs of these populations include independent living units
with affordable housing costs, supportive housing with affordable housing costs, and housing with design
features that facilitate mobility and independence.
Many physically disabled or handicapped persons are living on state disability income benefits. The
following type of supportive housing may be desirable for this population:
  •   Affordable to low and moderate income persons;
  •   Wheelchair accessible;
  •   Equipped with roll-in showers, grip bars, ceiling fans with extended cords, low sinks and light
      switches, automatic door openers;
  •   Close to public transportation and stores.
The State department of Developmental Services provides community-based services to developmentally
disabled persons through contracted regional centers. The Regional Center Orange County (RCOC) is
charged by the State of California with the care of people with developmental disabilities, defined as those
with severe, life-long disabilities attributable to mental and\or physical impairments. RCOC has served
124 people in Dana Point with a developmental disability. Table H-13 provides a breakdown by age and
zip code of those helped through RCOC programs.

According to the 2009–2011 American Community Survey approximately 2,550 residents in Dana Point
have a disability: 149 children, 1,099 adults, and 1,299 elderly. The ACS collects data on people with a
disability in six categories. They include difficulty with hearing, vision, a cognitive impairment,
ambulatory ability, self-care, and independent living. Approximately 5% of adults (age 18–64) in the City
are affected by a disability. The greatest challenges for disabled adults are cognitive impairment and
independent living. About 24% of elderly residents (age 65 and over) are impacted by a disability. They
have the greatest difficulty with ambulatory ability and living independently.
Elderly Population and Households
Elderly persons may experience special housing needs related to fixed income, health care support, and
transportation. These characteristics indicate a need for smaller, lower-cost housing units with easy access
to transit and health care facilities.
The City conditionally permits “Senior Citizen Housing,” defined as licensed housing for persons 62 years
of age or older or unlicensed housing for persons 55 years of age or older—including such housing
facilities as retirement villas, apartments, and condominiums, (but not including state-licensed rest homes,
group homes, or convalescent hospitals, which are separately regulated)—in the highest density residential
single-family zone (RSF 22), several residential multifamily zones (RMF 7, 14, 22, and 30), and in mixed-
use zones (Commercial/Residential and Professional/Residential). Senior citizen housing can provide a
source of affordable housing because it is permitted at densities up to 30 units per acre and enjoys reduced
parking requirements (only required to provide one covered and assigned stall, plus one-half of a guest
stall per dwelling unit).
As of 2010, there were an estimated 7,170 persons who were 62 or older residing in Dana Point. The ratio
of females to males in this age group is 1.2 (3,858 females, 3,312 males). Table H-14 reports on the age of
householder by tenure distribution for the City. There are an estimated 3,652 senior households in the 65
to 75 years and 75+ age groups. The majority of Dana Point’s senior households are in the 65–74 year
bracket—1,980 of the 3,652 households—and approximately 13% out of all householders are 75 years or
older. Of the total senior households older than 65 years, 85% are owners and 15% are renters.

The high percentage of senior homeowners may indicate a need for programs that assist seniors in
maintaining their homes and facilitate independent living. The Dana Point Senior Center conducts free
senior home assessments and provides case management to foster safe independent living. The Dana Point
Senior Center performs an average of eight senior home assessments per year. Other Senior Center
programs that facilitate independent living include meal delivery, no-cost Medicare and insurance
counseling, no-cost legal consultation, visual aide consultation for low-vision seniors, and social activities.
According to Table H-15, 70% of all seniors 65+ years live in families. Approximately 27% of Dana
Point seniors live in nonfamily households; of those 98% live alone. An estimated 21% of all seniors in this
age group are women living alone. Seniors who live alone may greatly benefit from the free home
assessment and social activities organized by the Dana Point Senior Center. Activities include a group
lunch each weekday as well as special luncheons, twilight dinners and day-long outings each month.

                                              Dana Point           General Plan
Some elderly persons need supportive housing assistance if they are disabled and/or frail. According to the
data in Table H-16, there are an estimated 2,998 seniors (age 65+) with disabilities out of a total of
5,512 seniors (24%). Disabled seniors may need assisted living facilities or basic support services in order
to maintain independence. For seniors ages 60 and over whose limited mobility impairs shopping and
cooking, the Dana Point Senior Center will deliver three meals each weekday for a donation of five dollars
per day. Transportation is also a critical concern for many seniors, particularly those who are disabled. The
Orange County Transportation Authority operates the nonemergency South County Senior
Transportation Program to provide South County residents aged 60 years and over with affordable and
safe weekday transportation. Since January 2007 the cost of each trip has been two dollars.
An estimated 2% of the seniors 65+ years in nonfamily households live in group quarters. Group quarters
include state-licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons. These facilities are permitted by
right in any residential zone within Dana Point. In 2012, the California Department of Social Services
Community Care Licensing Services reported six small residential care facilities with a collective capacity
to house 33 persons in Dana Point. The City also has two large residential care facilities with the ability to
serve 164 persons. The nearby cities of San Clemente, Laguna Niguel, and San Juan Capistrano also
provide additional means for seniors to remain in the area. The combined cities offer 74 residential care
facilities, providing over 1,000 beds in South Orange County.

Dana Point seniors also greatly benefit from the resources made available by the County of Orange Office
on Aging, the lead advocate for seniors residing in Orange County communities. The goals of the Office
on Aging include improving transportation, health and safety, and access to affordable housing for the
county’s elderly population. The Office on Aging operates the InfoVan, a traveling library of outreach
materials for seniors and their caregivers that makes scheduled stops throughout the county. Another
resource is the Office on Aging’s website, which provides an extensive database of useful information, such
as guides for financial and legal matters, nutrition and exercise, safety, prescription medicine, diseases and
conditions, and transportation.

Large Households
In 2010, Dana Point had an estimated 14,182 total households, of which 1,004 were defined as large
households—five or more persons. These large households accounted for 7% of the City's total households,
as indicated by the data in Table H-17. Approximately 6% (522) of the City’s owner households and 8%
(482) of the City’s renter households are large households. Large households need more space at affordable
housing costs. In 2010 about 51% of all large family households resided in owner occupied housing.

Farm Workers
Low wages and the seasonal nature of many agriculture jobs create special needs for farm workers.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics, there are an
estimated 77 Dana Point residents employed in the “agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting” sector,
many of which are fishermen likely due to the Dana Point Harbor and easily accessible ocean. The need
for housing generated by farm workers is estimated to be nominal and can be adequately addressed by the
City's affordability programs, particularly in the expansion of opportunities for Single Resident Occupancy
hotels in the Town Center and CF zone.
Single-Parent Householders
According to the 2010 Census, 6% of householders in the City are single parents with children under 18
years of age. Of those single-parent householders, 67% are female and 33% are male. Female-headed
households are considered a special needs group because of reported lower incomes than their male
counterparts. There are approximately 2,342 female-headed households in Dana Point. Of these, 1,232
are female-headed households without a husband and 560 have children. These single-income households
may have a need for lower and moderate income rental and homeownership opportunities.
Extremely Low Income Households
Extremely low income households are defined as those earning no more than 30% of the area median
income. According to the Southern California Association of Governments, approximately 1,540
households in Dana Point were categorized as extremely low income households in the 2011 RHNA
                                                  December 2013
                                                      -44-

                                     Dana Point          General Plan
Methodology. Many of these extremely low income households are likely seniors, who are no longer
working and are living on a fixed income.
The future housing need for extremely low income households can be estimated (per state law) at one-half
of the City’s very low income housing allocation. The City’s very low income housing allocation for the
2014–2021 planning period is 76 units (see Table HI-1). Accordingly, the City’s projected need for
extremely low income households is approximately 38 units.
Such households could be on the verge of becoming homeless. An extremely low income household of four
would earn less than $28,900 per year and would be able to spend only $722 per month in rent before
overpaying for housing. A two-person household earning less than $23,150 would only be able to spend
$579 per month in rent before overpaying for housing.
This population can be most effectively served by Section 8 Housing Certificates and Vouchers and
through the construction of second units, small apartments, single room occupancy units, and could
benefit from low-cost senior housing. The Dana Point Town Center Plan, as described in the Residential
Land Resources section of the Housing Element, conditionally permits high density housing, including
SROs, and could accommodate approximately 10 extremely low or very low income units. Additionally,
the City updated its Community Facilities zone to conditionally permit SRO projects during the last
planning period.
Homeless and Those in Need of Transitional or Emergency Shelter
Homeless persons and families lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; their primary
nighttime residence is a supervised, publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary
living accommodations, such as welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing for the
mentally ill; an institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be
institutionalized; or a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping
accommodation for persons.
A homeless individual is defined as a youth (17 years or younger) not accompanied by an adult (18 years
or older) or an adult without children. A homeless family is defined as a family that includes at least one
parent or guardian and one child under the age of 18, a pregnant woman, or a person in the process of
securing legal custody of a person under the age of 18 who is homeless. Other subpopulations of the
homeless include persons with service needs related to severe mental illness (SMI) only; alcohol/other drug
abuse (AODA) only; both SMI and AODA; domestic violence; AIDS/related diseases; and other special
service needs.
A "Continuum of Care" system for homeless persons involves five components:
   •   Outreach/Needs Assessment: a Continuum of Care begins with a point of entry in which the
       needs of a homeless individual or family are assessed. In most communities, the intake and
       assessment component is performed by an emergency shelter or through a separate assessment
       center. To reach and engage homeless persons living on the street, the homeless service system
       should include a strong outreach component.
   •   Emergency Shelter: The County’s 2011 Homeless Census & Survey identifies a countywide unmet
       need for almost 4,272 emergency shelter beds.
                                              December 2013
                                                    -45-

                                       Dana Point          General Plan
  •    Transitional Housing: Transitional housing provides rehabilitative services such as substance abuse
       treatment, short-term mental health services, and independent living skill classes. Appropriate case
       management should be accessed to ensure that persons receive necessary services. According to the
       county’s 2010 Ten-Year Plan to End Homelessness there is an existing countywide unmet need for
       5,724 beds in transitional housing facilities.
  •    Permanent Supportive Housing: Once a needs assessment is completed, the person/family may be
       referred to permanent housing or to transitional housing where supportive services are provided to
       prepare them for independent living. For example, a homeless person with a substance abuse
       problem may be referred to a transitional rehabilitation program before being assisted with
       permanent housing. Some individuals, particularly persons with chronic disabilities, may require
       ongoing supportive services once they move into permanent housing.
The County of Orange conducts a countywide housing needs assessment every other year. Needs
assessments, point-in-time counts, and gap analysis are not conducted on a city-by-city basis. Instead,
information is combined from local organizations that serve the homeless. One organization may respond
to the needs of homeless persons originating from several cities, thus the County’s reports provide a
countywide overview of the homeless and not any information specific to the City of Dana Point.
The County’s 2011 Homeless Census & Survey provided the following estimates of persons and families
that compose homeless subpopulations. These estimates are summarized below:
  •    It is estimated that on any given day there are 1,651 chronically homeless persons in Orange
       County.
  •    17% of the homeless population cited alcohol/drug use as the primary reason for their homelessness.
       Furthermore, 33% reported that they were currently using alcohol and/or other drugs. It is
       estimated that 20% of the homeless population suffers from a serious mental illness. As with the
       homeless substance abusers, this subpopulation often requires proactive outreach programs in order
       to be assessed and served.
  •    Of the homeless surveyed in Orange County, 57% indicated that they had a disabling condition.
       These conditions included a physical or developmental disability, mental illness, post-traumatic
       stress disorder, chronic health problem or substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or hepatitis C.
It is difficult to estimate the number of victims of domestic violence in the County since many cases go
unreported. Within the network of service providers in the county, several programs operate that
specialize in services for homeless subpopulations. Through proactive outreach or referrals, homeless
individuals and families may reach any one of the components of the county’s system of care. Once in the
system, the region’s network of service providers is geared toward moving the individual or family through
the continuum toward self-sufficiency.
The transient nature of the homeless population makes obtaining a firm count difficult. Dana Point Police
Services division of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department estimated the year-round population of Dana
Point between 60 and 80 individuals, increasing to approximately 100 during summer months. Year-
round homeless residing in vehicles or motorhomes are estimated between 20 and 25, increasing to 40 to
50 during summer months. An estimated 8% of the City’s transient homeless population is couples and
the rest are individuals. There are no known transient homeless families in Dana Point. Dana Point’s
transient homeless and extremely low income residents could benefit from construction of single room

occupancy, second units, emergency shelters, transitional housing, and permanent supportive housing
facilities.
The City’s Zoning Code allows emergency shelters of any size in all zones, subject to a conditional use
permit (CUP). In conjunction with emergency shelters, the Zoning Code allows supportive services such as
food, counseling, and access to other social services. In establishing conditions for all uses requiring a CUP,
the City seeks to ensure the health and safety of the use and surrounding uses. The factors that are usually
considered include parking, noise, and operational features of the use. Emergency shelters of up to 20 beds
are permitted by right in the Community Facilities (CF) zone. There are 62.1 acres of CF, 5 of which are
vacant. Emergency shelters for a maximum of 10 beds are permitted by right as an accessory use in places
of worship or up to 20 beds with a CUP.
There are several options for providing emergency shelters in Dana Point, ranging from new construction
to small modifications to existing facilities. Places of worship often have volunteer committees that serve
the homeless and provide supportive services for people in transition to self-sufficiency. Such places of
worship may be well positioned to provide emergency shelter. The Zoning Code allows emergency shelters
providing up to 10 beds as accessory uses to places of worship without a conditional use permit or other
discretionary permit. There are approximately 11 places of worship in Dana Point. By allowing new
emergency shelters in the CF zone, conversion of existing buildings in the CF zone to shelters, and
accessory shelters in places of worship, the City has the potential to accommodate 100 or more emergency
shelter beds.
Transitional housing and supportive housing are permitted as a residential use in Dana Point. They are
only subject to those restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same
zone. Facilities of this nature offer an interim home for homeless individual and families as they transition
into permanent and maintainable housing.
Homeless persons in the City of Dana Point and its environs are served by a variety of South Orange
County organizations. Table H-18 identifies the organizations and homeless shelters and facilities in or
close to Dana Point.

Governmental Constraints and Resources
Governmental constraints are policies, development regulations, standards, requirements or other actions
imposed by the various levels of government on land and housing ownership and development. Although
federal and state agencies play a role in the imposition of governmental constraints, these agencies are
beyond the influence of local government and are therefore not addressed in this document.
Housing element law requires an analysis of the following governmental factors:
  •   Land use controls (land use element and zoning)
  •   Building codes and their enforcement
  •   Site improvements
  •   Local processing and permit procedures
  •   Fees and other exactions
Land Use Controls
Land use controls provided by the land use element of the City’s General Plan and Zoning Code guide the
location, distribution, density, and design of all development within the City.
General Plan Land Use Element
State law requires each city to have a general plan that establishes policy guidelines for future
development. The land use element identifies the location, distribution, and density of land uses
throughout the City. The land use element describes five residential land uses and one mixed, commercial
and residential land use, ranging in density from 3.5 to 30 dwelling units per acre for the residential
designations and 10 dwelling units per acre for the mixed-use designation. The Dana Point Town Center
Plan incorporates development standards and allows for a mix of commercial and residential uses at
densities reaching over 30 units per acre. The Community Facilities land use designation allows housing
between 14 and 30 units per acre. Less than 16% of the City’s land area or approximately 10% of
dwelling units are within the lowest density General Plan designation of Residential 0–3.5.
These use categories allow for a variety of housing types to accommodate a range of owner and rental
housing opportunities. The program provided by the General Plan Land Use Element establishes five
goals for future land development within the City. These goals facilitate:
  •   Balanced development in Dana Point
  •   Compatibility and enhancement among land uses
  •   Directing growth to maintain and improve the quality of life
  •   Preservation of natural resources
  •   Protection of resident-serving land uses

                                          duplexes, condominiums, and townhomes.
         Residential 7–14                 Primarily attached single-family homes and multifamily dwellings such
                                          as apartments.
         Residential 14–22                Primarily attached single-family homes and multifamily dwellings such

         Commercial/Residential           The standard of 10 dwelling units per net acres is allowed when
                                          residential development is combined in the same building or parcel as
                                          commercial retail or office uses.
         Town Center                      A mix of pedestrian-friendly commercial and residential uses at higher
                                          densities than elsewhere in the City. Densities are extremely variable in
                                          the Town Center, and residential units are to be developed in a mixed-
                                          use format. When constructed, however, residential densities are
                                          generally expected to reach an equivalent of 30 units per acre.

Zoning Code
Zoning regulations control development by establishing requirements related to height, density, lot area,
yard setbacks, and minimum parking spaces. Higher residential zoning densities reduce land cost per unit
and thus facilitate the development of affordable housing. Restrictive zoning that requires unusually large
lot and building size can substantially increase housing costs.
The City’s Zoning Code regulates community development by establishing allowable uses and
development standards for numerous residential, mixed use, and other zones. Additionally, a Planned
Residential Development (PRD) overlay zone ensures that new development can be built with similar,
more flexible standards (such as setbacks and minimum lot size) as those of development existing at the
time of incorporation. Residential uses are permitted in the City’s mixed-use zones, and specific residential
uses—including Single Room Occupancy units and residential care facilities—are conditionally permitted
in commercial and industrial/business zones.
Dana Point’s exclusively residential zones range from a maximum of 2 units per acre in the Residential
Single Family 2 (RSF 2) zone to 30 units per acre in the Residential Multiple Family 30 (RMF 30),
exclusive of density bonus provisions. High density residential uses are also allowed in the Community
Facilities district (CF). Additionally, the City allows manufactured housing in single or multifamily zones.
The use of manufactured homes can reduce housing costs by as much as 30–40%, according to the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development. The City furthers this affordability by not requiring
special design and use standards for manufactured housing.
A summary description of each zone permitting residential uses is given in Table H-20. The summary
description identifies the principal housing types permitted in each zone. Table H-21 indicates the specific

housing types that are allowed in some form in each residential zone. The Zoning Code provides for a
variety of housing types to accommodate a range of owner and rental housing opportunities, including
housing for special needs groups. Table H-22 lists the minimum acceptable standard for development
within the City’s residential districts necessary to assure quality development and attractive local
residential areas without hindering the production of affordable housing. The City’s development
standards are not considered a constraint to affordable housing.

   Source: Dana Point Municipal Code, Chapter 9.09.
   (1) See Chapter 9.75 of the Dana Point Municipal Code for definitions and illustrations of development standards.
   (2) Development standard applies to any proposed subdivision of land. These standards do not apply to existing lots where no
        subdivision is proposed or to proposed condominiums or other common lot subdivisions.
   (3) Land Area per Dwelling Unit may not be rounded up. (Example: 14,250 square feet/2,500 square feet of land per dwelling unit
        = 5.7 dwelling units which equals 5 dwelling units, not 6 dwelling units).
   (4) Subject to the measurement and design criteria in Section 9.05.110(a).
   (5) For existing lots less than fifty (50) feet wide and/or less than one hundred (100) feet deep, see Section 9.05.190 for reduced
        front, side and rear building setbacks.
   (6) If the side yard of a flag lot is adjacent to the rear yard of a residentially zoned lot, that side yard setback shall be a minimum of
        ten (10) feet.
   (7) Additional rear yard building setback from a bluff top may be required by Section 9.27.030.
   (8) For RBR 12 and RBRD 18, maximum building height is twenty-eight (28) feet as measured eighteen (18) inches above the Flood
        Plain Overlay 3 (FP-3) requirement or Beach Road, whichever is higher. Mezzanines may be allowed subject to compliance with
        the applicable provisions of the Uniform Building Code.
   (9) See Section 9.09.040(a) for special building setbacks and standards for maximum projections into required yards applicable to
        properties on Beach Road.
   (10) Setback for the first floor as measured from the right-of-way line of Beach Road. The second floor may project a maximum of
        five (5) feet into the required front yard setback.
   (11) A minimum of ten (10) percent of that portion of the lot area bounded by the side property lines.
        (Added by Ord. 93-16, 11/23/93; amended by Ord. 94-09, 5/24/94; Ord. 94-21, 12/13/94; Ord. 96-10, 8/13/96; Ord. 96-13,
        11/26/96; amended during 8/99 supplement).
The land use and development regulations for the Town Center District are contained in the Dana Point
Town Center Plan, which can be found on the City’s website. In general, the development standards are
more flexible than the standards required in other zoning districts.
Parking Requirements
Parking requirements in the City of Dana Point are similar to those imposed by other cities in Orange
County. Parking facilities are required to be located on the same lot and reduce the amount of available lot
area for housing. Parking requirements generally relate to the housing type and number of bedrooms or
units. Some uses, however, require fewer parking spaces, such as granny flats, second units, and senior
housing facilities. To facilitate the production of affordable housing, the City maintains reduced parking
standards for these uses. The City also permits shared parking between adjoining residential and
commercial uses.
Furthermore, the Housing Element includes a program to study additional reductions in required parking
for affordable housing developments. The reduction in parking would be permitted if a study
demonstrates that less parking is needed because of the income, car ownership, and special needs of the
population that would reside in the proposed development. Although the current parking standards do
not appear to constrain the development of housing, the City will undertake a parking study to determine
the financial impacts of parking spaces, particularly for multifamily and affordable housing.

Density Bonus
The City’s Zoning Code regulations on density bonuses is consistent with Government Code Section
65915–65918, which require jurisdictions to grant a density bonus of 20% above the maximum
permitted density if a development provides at least 5% of the units at rates that are affordable to very
low income households or 10% of the units at rates that are affordable to low income households. If 10%
of units are affordable to moderate income households, then the project is eligible to receive a 5% density
bonus.
Second Dwelling Unit Requirements
AB 1866 (Government Code Section 65852.2) provides that the permit process for second units is
ministerial, an action that does not require public notice, public hearing, or discretionary approval. The
state law acknowledges that second units not only provide housing at below market prices, but also serve
to meet the special population needs of the elderly, frail elderly, disabled, and low-income persons such as
students.
The City amended the Zoning Code in 2003 to provide standards and procedures for the development of
second dwelling units in accordance with state mandates. According to the Zoning Code, a second unit is
an attached or detached residential unit, including complete and independent living facilities for one or
two persons, on the same parcel as the primary unit (i.e., the unit includes permanent provisions for living,
sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation). A “granny flat” is intended for occupancy by persons who are
62 years of age or older pursuant to Government Code Section 65852.1.
A second dwelling unit may only be established on a lot of an existing single-family home that is zoned for
single-family residential development. Additional development standards and conditions are provided in
the Zoning Code (Chapter 9.07.210), including the requirement that second dwelling units must be
affordable to persons of lower and moderate income and remain affordable for the life of the project. The
life of the project shall be determined as the length of time the second dwelling unit is occupied.
One second dwelling unit was constructed in 2011 and was, per the City’s Zoning Code, restricted to low
and moderate income households. Through reviews of the permit applications and recorded covenants,
these units are restricted to low income occupants. An additional second unit application is currently
under review and is also expected to serve a low income occupant.
The City is aggressively seeking to encourage single-family homeowners to construct second units. The
City publishes a second unit information sheet that defines a second unit, provides an outline of
development requirements, and explains the permitting process. By disseminating this information, the
City is increasing the potential for affordable housing on lots zoned for single-family residential
development, which would otherwise be unlikely locations for affordable housing.
Single Room Occupancy
The City of Dana Point conditionally permits the development of SRO projects in multifamily residential,
mixed-use, and commercial districts, including the Town Center area. The Zoning Code requires rates for
the rental of units in an SRO project to be restricted so that 50% of the units in the project are affordable
to persons of very low income and 30% of the units are affordable to persons of low income. Twenty
percent of the units may be unrestricted.

                                                     -65-

                                       Dana Point        General Plan
Each unit within an SRO project shall be furnished with a bed, chair, table, and telephone. The minimum
size of each one-person unit is 150 square feet. A two-person unit must be at least 250 square feet. Each
SRO project must provide full or partial kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry facilities. Such facilities may be
enclosed within each unit or provided in a common area. Laundry facilities may be deleted if the project is
within 1,000 feet of an existing laundromat.
All proposed SRO projects must be renter occupied and contain at least 10 SRO units, not including the
required onsite manager's unit. Each SRO project shall provide 0.5 parking stalls for every one-person
unit, and 0.8 parking stall for every two-person unit. In addition, each SRO project shall provide 0.4
secure bicycle stall for each unit excluding the onsite manager's unit.
To ensure that SRO projects remain safe and maintained, each SRO project must be guided by a
management plan, which includes, among other things, a provision for an onsite, 24-hour manager.
Housing for Disabled Persons
In accordance with Senate Bill 520 (SB 520), which became effective January 1, 2002, the City analyzed
its procedures, policies, and practices to identify any existing or potential constraints on housing for
disabled persons. In 2007 the City of Dana Point engaged in a review its regulations, administrative
policies, and procedures and studied how those regulations and practices affect the availability of housing
for disabled persons. The study found that the City supports several policies, regulations, and programs
that remove constraints to housing for disabled persons.
Under the provisions of California Code of Regulations, Title 24, the City of Dana Point has the
enforcement authority for state accessibility laws and regulations when evaluating requests for new
construction. Similar to the requirements of the Federal Fair Housing Act of 1998 and the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), Title 24 provisions include standards and conditions to be applied to new
development to ensure full accessibility for the physically disabled. Compliance with building codes and
Title 24 may increase the cost of housing construction and rehabilitation; however, such standards are the
minimum necessary for the City to ensure safety and adequate accessibility for all residents.
The City has adopted the 2010 California Building Standards Code and the most recent California
Amendments. This code includes provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act. To further address the
needs of disabled residents, the City has added ADA coordination responsibilities to the role of the
Certified Building Official. The City of Dana Point seeks to provide people with disabilities reasonable
accommodation in rules, policies, practices, and procedures that may be necessary to ensure equal access to
housing. Additionally, the City’s Building Department helps residents with the retrofitting of their homes.
Preliminary onsite inspection can be requested by homeowners seeking advice on Building Code
requirements when modifying their home.
In November 2007 the City adopted a Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance. The ordinance enacts
a process for disabled individuals or those acting on their behalf to make requests for reasonable
accommodation in regard to relief from the various land use, zoning, or building laws, rules, policies,
practices, and/or procedures of the City, and includes a provision of assistance in making the request,
as well as for appealing a determination regarding the reasonable accommodation to the Community
Development Director.

                                          Dana Point           General Plan
There are no maximum concentration requirements in the Zoning Code for residential care facilities or
other facilities that serve the disabled. There is also no definition of family, and therefore no City
restrictions on the number of nonrelated persons allowed per housing unit. The City permits a wide
variety of uses to assist and care for the disabled. Uses such as community care facilities, convalescent
facilities, and residential care facilities for the elderly are permitted in any residential district with a CUP.
These uses are also permitted with a CUP in any Commercial/Residential or Professional/Residential
district. These uses act as unique commercial uses and have special requirements for employee parking,
visitor parking, and service access for delivery vehicles (e.g., for delivery of food and medical equipment).
There are no special regulations restricting the siting of senior care facilities in relationship or distance to
one another. Group homes (any state-licensed residential care facility for six or fewer persons) are
permitted by right in any residential zone. This allows proponents flexibility in locating such facilities
without additional development or permitting costs. A public comment period request is not required for
the establishment of a residential care facility for six or fewer persons. Residential care facilities serving
seven or more residents are conditionally permitted in all residential and mixed-use zones and several
commercial zones. Typical findings of approval for residential projects requiring a conditional use permit
include consistency with the General Plan; that the nature, condition, and development of adjacent uses
has been considered and the proposed use will not adversely affect adjacent uses; and that the proposed
site is adequately sized to accommodate the necessary space for parking, landscaping, and other
development features.
The City’s Zoning Code requires that all parking lots and structures include at least one handicapped
parking stall; the number of required handicapped stalls increases as the number of standard parking stalls
increases. Handicapped parking stalls are required to be between four and six feet wider than standard
stalls. One in every eight handicapped parking stalls, and always at least one handicapped stall, shall have
a minimum dimension of 17 feet by 18 feet (9-foot-wide parking stall and 8-foot-wide access area by 18
feet deep) and shall have appropriate signage designating the stall "van accessible." The Zoning Code
provides reduced off-street parking standards for uses such as convalescent facilities, senior housing
complexes, and congregate care facilities. Reduced parking standards help reduce the cost of developing
projects oriented toward serving disabled or elderly persons. The reduced parking standards are as follows:
   •    Convalescent Hospital: 1 stall for every 4 beds plus parking for onsite employee housing
   •    Senior Citizen Housing Complex: 1 covered and assigned stall, plus 0.5 guest stall per dwelling
        unit, plus 1 stall for the resident manager
   •    Senior Congregate Care Facilities: 1.25 stalls per unit (may be reduced to .67 stall per unit subject
        to CUP to reflect presence of special transportation services).
Coastal Zone
Dana Point consists of 4,134 acres, of which 1,993 fall within the coastal zone. Approximately 48% of the
City of Dana Point is in the coastal zone; the remaining 52% is within three miles of the coastal zone. A
variety of land uses are in the coastal zone in Dana Point, including Dana Point Harbor, beaches, parks,
conservation areas, residential uses, and commercial uses providing over 1,900 hotel rooms and a 122-
space campground at Doheny State Beach.
California Government Code Sections 65588 and 65590 require the Housing Element to take into
account any low or moderate income housing provided or required in the Coastal Zone, including:

                                      Dana Point         General Plan
1.     The number of new housing units approved for construction in the coastal zone since January
       1982.
2.     The number of housing units for persons and families of low and moderate income required to
       be provided in new housing developments either in the coastal zone or within three miles.
3.     The number of existing residential dwelling units occupied by low and moderate income
       households required either in the coastal zone or within three miles of the coastal zone that have
       been authorized to be demolished or converted since January 1982.
4.     The number of residential dwelling units for low and moderate income households that have
       been required for replacement.
The City of Dana Point incorporated on January 1, 1989, and established itself as a separate local
government entity from the County of Orange. From incorporation in 1989 through 2007, the City
contracted with at least two private firms to provide Building Division services, including building
permits, plan check, inspection, and permit records services. The building permit records did not
differentiate between housing units constructed in the coastal zone from those not in the coastal zone.
In 2007, the City converted its Building Division staff from contract to City employees, including hiring a
Building Official, three Building Inspectors, and two Permit Technicians. The City also has obtained GIS
services to provide higher levels of service, maintain more precise building permit records, and better
monitor residential activities in the coastal zone.
Table H-24 describes the units constructed and demolished in the coastal zone and within three miles of
the coastal zone from 1998 through 2012. The units were tabulated from available building permit record
annual summaries provided to the State Department of Finance, and were constructed and demolished in
both the coastal zone and within 3 miles of the coastal zone.

According to City records, there are approximately 111 deed-restricted affordable units within three miles
of the coastal zone in Dana Point. The multifamily projects below are described in detail in the
“Preservation of At-Risk Units” section.
  •   Second Units: 3 units required to be affordable per Section 9.07.210 of the Zoning Code
  •   Domingo/Doheny Apartments: 24 3-bedroom lower income family units
  •   Monarch Coast Apartments: 42 very low and 42 low income units
According to City records, no affordable units in the City of Dana Point have been demolished. The only
identified demolition of development of 3 or more units occurred in 1992 when 32 market rate units at
the Monarch Coast Apartments were demolished following a landslide. These market rate units are slated

to be replaced, with increased affordability requirements on the existing affordable units as a condition of
their approval. To date, no affordable units have required replacement in the coastal zone.
Building Codes and Code Enforcement
Building and safety codes adopted by the City are considered necessary to protect public health, safety,
and welfare. However, these codes have the potential to increase the cost of housing construction and
maintenance. The City has adopted the 2010 California Building Standards Code along with amendments
specific to Dana Point. Other development codes enforced by the City include the most recent editions of
the California Housing, Electrical, Fire, Plumbing, Mechanical, and Administrative Codes.
Code enforcement is a critical component of preserving and improving neighborhood quality and
preventing situations that may damage residential structures and resident safety. The City employs three
full-time and one part-time code enforcement officers. Code enforcement officers proactively identify and
prescribe solutions to code violations and respond to public complaints. The most common housing code
violations relate to building maintenance, construction activities without a permit, landscaping (weed
abatement), and trash. Violators are notified and referred to appropriate sections of the City’s Municipal
Code and relevant programs. In some cases, such as illegal construction, the violator is fined and may be
ordered to dismantle the activity. The City created a Neighborhood Maintenance and Improvement Guide
to inform residents about legal requirements and resources to assist in preserving and improving
neighborhoods and homes.
Site Improvements
Residential developers are required to provide the improvements necessary to enable the use of developed
sites and to pay a pro rata share of offsite improvements. Most of the City's remaining vacant land is of an
infill character, and necessary infrastructure systems are already in place and in good condition. The
developer of a residential project is required to provide the connections to public infrastructure to serve the
project. This includes, but is not limited to, the provision of storm drains and water and sewer
connections. Utility lines, including but not limited to electric, communications, street lighting, and cable
television, are required to be placed underground in any new, revised, or reactivated residential
subdivision. The subdivider works directly with the utility companies for the installation of such facilities.
Though most of the City is currently served by adequate roadways and sidewalks, improvements for access
or internal navigation may be necessary. Vehicular access to roadways will be determined in accordance
with driveway locations and design specifically approved by Public Works. The width of roadways
providing access to parking facilities for residential projects depends on street parking conditions; without
street parking the road may be less than 32 feet, at least 32 feet but less than 40 feet for roadways with
parallel stalls on one side, and at least 40 feet for roadways with parallel stalls on both sides. A five-foot-
wide sidewalk is required on at least one side of the roadway unless an alternative pedestrian route is
provided.
Considering that development and revitalization efforts will be infill in character, the need for
extensive site improvements is limited and should not be considered a constraint to affordable
housing. Residential developers pay fees for school facilities; park and recreation facilities;
transportation fees; transportation corridor fees; and connections to capital facilities such as water and
sewer.

Local Processing and Permit Procedures
The City of Dana Point’s development review process is designed to accommodate development while
ensuring safe and attractive development projects. There are three levels of decision-making bodies in the
City that govern the development review process: the Community Development Director, the Planning
Commission, and the City Council. The City also has Coastal Commission permit authority for most of its
jurisdiction, thereby avoiding dual processing by the City and Coastal Commission.
The City offers “over the counter” plan checks and administrative review for several types of residential
development projects. In all cases, applicants are encouraged to meet with City staff to discuss a project
prior to submitting an application. When an application is submitted, it is briefly reviewed at the public
counter to identify any potential issues and determine if discretionary review is needed. This counter
review provides the applicant with an opportunity to make changes to the application, if necessary, which
may result in saved time and money if the application would otherwise have been deemed incomplete.
Ministerial Review
New single-family residential housing projects on existing subdivided lots require only ministerial review if
outside of the coastal zone. For such projects, the Planning Division routes the completed application to
various City departments for a 10-day code conformance review. The average time for residential
ministerial project review is estimated to be four weeks. Most proposed residential projects in the coastal
zone can be reviewed ministerially. Only properties in the sensitive oceanfront or coastal bluff top areas
require a Coastal Development Permit that necessitates discretionary review.
Discretionary Review
Depending on the scope and size of proposed residential development, there are two levels of discretionary
review for development beyond single-family dwellings. Residential development with less than 10,000
square feet of new floor area and/or four or less residential units require a minor site development permit.
This permit requires an administrative hearing and allows the Director of Community Development, who
grants approval, to review the project for conformance with City regulations. Residential development
that exceeds those parameters requires approval of a major site development permit, which must be
approved by the Planning Commission and/or City Council.
The discretionary review process for a minor site development permit, which includes public noticing time
frames, typically takes from two to four weeks if not appealed to the Planning Commission. The
discretionary review process for a major site development permit, which includes public noticing time
frames, typically takes from four to eight weeks if not appealed to the City Council.
Similarly, there are two levels of conditional use permits for new residential development. A minor CUP is
typically triggered by projects needing a shared parking program or minor deviations from development
standards that may have adverse impacts. A minor CUP is approved by the Director of Community
Development through an administrative hearing. A major CUP applies to certain residential uses that may
have adverse impacts on existing residential areas, as listed in Section 9.09.020 of the Zoning Code. For
example, a congregate care facility has special parking needs that may impact a surrounding residential
neighborhood. Typical findings of approval for residential projects requiring a minor or major conditional
use permit include consistency with the General Plan; that the nature, condition, and development of
adjacent uses; has been considered and the proposed use will not adversely affect adjacent uses, and that
the proposed site is adequately sized to accommodate the necessary space for parking, landscaping, and

                                        Dana Point          General Plan
other development features. Typical conditions of approval require the applicant to follow through with
the project as proposed or face nullification of the conditional use permit. For example, relocation;
substantial alteration; or addition to any use, structure, feature, or material not approved will nullify the
conditional use permit.
In all cases, the planner assigned to a project will assess the adequate level of environmental review per the
requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Under CEQA, many infill projects
and other small projects are exempt. For larger, more complex developments, a consultant may be
retained to perform environmental studies. Upon completion of environmental documentation, the project
is presented to the applicable approving body, which may approve the project, deny, or approve with
conditions. If a project is denied, the applicant may revise the project and resubmit or withdraw the
application entirely. If a project is approved, planning entitlements are issued; if conditionally approved,
certain conditions may need to be met prior to receipt of permits.
A Coastal Development Permit is required for proposed uses within the City's coastal zone, as established
by the California Coastal Act. All development projects undertaken within the coastal zone require the
approval of a coastal development permit unless exempted. A coastal development permit must be
approved by the Planning Commission at a public hearing. In approving such a permit, the Planning
Commission must find that the specific use or activity proposed is consistent with the applicable land use
regulations, the Certified Local Coastal Program for the area, and the California Coastal Act. Typical uses
or activities subject to approval of a coastal development permit include:
   •   Development of properties atop coastal bluffs
   •   Development of properties on sandy beaches
   •   Development of any other vacant property, modifications to existing property which constitute an
       intensification of use, and significant changes of landform
As stated above, the City maintains Coastal Commission permit authority for most of its jurisdiction,
thereby avoiding dual processing by the City and Coastal Commission. Accordingly, for the majority of
housing projects, the coastal development permit requirements do not add significant costs or processing
time.
Coastal development permit requirements can increase the cost and processing time for housing projects.
This requirement is beyond the City’s control and is required by the California Coastal Act. Dana Point is
modifying the City-guided development processes (as detailed below) to minimize the permitting and
processing procedures as a constraint.
Development Fees
A variety of fees and assessments are charged by the City and other agencies to cover the cost of processing
development permits and providing local services. These fees are necessary to ensure quality development
review and adequate public services. However, development fees and exactions are passed down to the
homeowner and renter, and therefore affect housing affordability.
Most cities collect fees on a cumulative basis (i.e., multiple fees for each entitlement sought for any given
project), but Dana Point charges only the single highest fees for entitlements that are processed

concurrently. For example, if a project requires a General Plan Amendment, Zone Change, and Tentative
Tract Map, rather than charging all three fees, only the highest fee for the General Plan amendment
would be charged. This provides for lower overall fees to the developer. The City’s fees for a variety of
applications are described in Table H-25.

In addition to fees charged for discretionary permits, fees also are charged for the actual construction of
the project. Examples of the fees include plan check fees (building and infrastructure plans) and building
permit fees (inspections conducted by building inspectors). All of these fees are used to offset City expenses
incurred by the construction of the project.
Other fees are imposed to mitigate potential impacts created by new development. These fees are typically
referred to as development impact fees. These fees may include: traffic impact fees, school fees, drainage
fees, and fire fees. These types of fees vary widely from city to city and within areas of a given city. Some
of these fees may be imposed directly by a city (e.g., park, library, and police) or collected by a city for
another entity (e.g., traffic fees).
Some south Orange County cities, including Dana Point, collect traffic fees on behalf of other entities.
These fees include fees for the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor, Foothill/Eastern Transportation
Corridor, and the Coastal Area Road Improvements and Traffic Signals (CARITS). These fees are outside
the direct control of the City of Dana Point. Again, these fees vary from city to city and within a city, and
may not be imposed at all depending on a project's location.
Table H-26 displays development fees for three types of residential projects in Dana Point: a single-family
house, a 20-unit condominium project, and a 50-unit apartment project. Dana Point last updated its fee
structure in 1998, which has kept costs lower for recent development. The City periodically conducts fee
studies to ensure fees are appropriate. The studies may result in adjustments to the fees; however, the City
will also examine how to preserve, lower or reduce fees for affordable projects. Overall, the City’s fee
structure is not considered a constraint to housing.

Non-Governmental Constraints and Resources
A local housing element incorporates an analysis of potential and actual non-governmental constraints
including: environmental, infrastructure, residential land resources, land prices, construction costs, and
financing.
Environmental Constraints
The City has identified areas affected by environmental hazards where land development should be
carefully controlled. Local geologic conditions vary throughout the City and can even differ from lot to lot,
creating the need to study each development proposal individually. The following environmental
constraints may impact future housing development in the City.
                                                            December 2013
                                                                   -74-
                                       Dana Point          General Plan
Coastal Erosion
There are two types of coastal erosion in Dana Point: the retreat of coastal bluffs and the loss of beach
sands. Most beach sand comes either from sediment transport during river and stream runoff or from
erosion of coastal cliffs and bluffs. Because both of these processes have been impeded by urbanization,
both in Dana Point and elsewhere, beach replenishment has been affected. Some portions of the Dana
Point coastline have been more impacted than others, since impact is highly dependent on local factors,
including beach configuration and location relative to manmade improvements, such as jetties and
harbors.
Blufftop Erosion
Extending for approximately 6.7 miles, the Dana Point shoreline includes areas of sandy and rocky shore,
coastal bluffs, and the rocky Dana Point Headlands. These areas have been subjected to continual erosion
from oceanic, climatological, and developmental forces. Urbanization has accelerated the erosion process in
many locations and created areas of instability.
Seismic Hazards
Dana Point, like the rest of southern California, is in a seismically active area. However, no known active
faults cross the City. The nearest significant active fault is the Newport-Inglewood Zone, approximately
four miles to the southwest. Major active faults that could affect Dana Point include the Whittier Elsinore,
San Andreas, Palos Verdes, San Clemente, and Rose Canyon faults. Because no known active faults cross
the City, the potential for surface rupture is believed to be limited. Ground shaking, liquefaction,
landslides, and rockfalls along coastal bluffs are the primary hazards to Dana Point in the event of an
earthquake.
Watercourse Flooding
Flooding is a natural attribute of any river or stream and is influenced by many factors, including the
amount, intensity, and distribution of rainfall; soil conditions prior to storms; vegetation coverage; and
stream channel conditions. All natural rivers and streams have a floodplain, which is the area subject to
flooding during peak storm flows. There are three Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
floodplains designated within Dana Point. The primary floodway is San Juan Creek; secondary floodways
are Salt Creek and Prima Deshecha Canada.
Coastal Flooding
The “Coastal Flood with Velocity Hazard” designation extends the length of the coastline and inland
approximately 150 feet in Capistrano Beach. According to the maps prepared by FEMA, all beachfront
properties are in this coastal hazard zone. These areas are subject to damage from seismic sea waves
(tsunamis) and storm waves.
Infrastructure Constraints
Since the City of Dana Point is relatively built out, the existing infrastructure is extensive and has
adequate capacity to support anticipated population and new residential development growth.
Water and Wastewater
The City of Dana Point is served by two water and sanitary districts of the South Orange County
Wastewater Authority (SOCWA): the Moulton Niguel and South Coast Water Districts. The vast
                                                December 2013

                                       Dana Point          General Plan
majority of the water distribution lines in these districts is under 30 years old and reported to be in good
to excellent condition. Two joint powers agencies, the Aliso Water Management Agency and SOCWA,
provide sewage treatment to the wastewater districts that serve Dana Point. The City shares the Housing
Element with SOCWA and South Coast Water District. The condition of the sewer lines in these districts
is generally very good, with the exception of some lines in Capistrano Beach, many of which are currently
being repaired, upgraded, or replaced. The South Coast Water District is currently in the process of
evaluating the condition of its lines and developing a prioritized plan for repairs and replacement.
Energy Conservation
The City has promoted energy conservation for residential uses on both educational and regulatory levels.
The City supports local utilities in their efforts to provide public information and technical assistance to
developers and homeowners regarding energy conservation measures and programs. On a regulatory level,
the City enforces the State Energy Conservation Standards (Title 24, California Administrative Code).
These standards, incorporated into the City's Building Code, provide a great deal of flexibility for
individual builders to achieve a minimum "energy budget" through the use of various performance
standards. These requirements apply to all new residential and commercial construction as well as
remodeling and rehabilitation construction only where square footage is added. Compliance with Title 24
of the California Administrative Code on the use of energy efficient appliances and insulation has reduced
energy demand stemming from new residential development.
Additionally, there are more opportunities for conserving energy in new and existing homes. The
construction of energy efficient buildings does not necessarily lower the purchase price of housing, but
should reduce monthly occupancy costs as consumption of fuel and energy is decreased. Similarly,
retrofitting existing structures with energy-conserving features can reduce in utility costs. Examples of
energy conservation opportunities include weatherization programs and home energy audits; retrofit to
dual components or piggyback the use of evaporative coolers with air conditioning systems; installation or
retrofitting of more efficient appliances and mechanical or solar energy systems; and building design and
orientation.
A study of rehabilitation and home maintenance activities with potential to improve energy efficiency and
indoor air quality is proposed. The study will highlight the most cost-effective methods, and the City will
provide publications pertaining to energy efficient home upgrades and construction at City Hall and place
links to utility and energy conservation resources on the City’s website. Information gathered during the
study is expected to influence the City’s future General Plan Update.
The City has facilitated more efficient land use patterns by approving the more intense, mixed-use Dana
Point Town Center Plan. Higher density and mixed-use developments can demand less energy than lower
density projects by encouraging walking, a decrease use of automobiles, and smaller housing units that are
more efficient to operate.
Residential Land Resources
An important component of the Housing Element is the identification of remaining sites and future
housing opportunities in the 2014–2021 planning period. There is no “carryover” RHNA from the
2006–2014 planning period. Opportunities for new residential development are located on vacant or
underutilized land that is designated for or may be approved for residential use.
                                                December 2013
                                                      -76-

                                      Dana Point          General Plan
Vacant Residential Land
The purpose of the vacant residential land inventory is to identify sites available for residential
development that may accommodate the City’s housing construction need for all income levels. A
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database, aerials, and site visits were used to identify and verify the
City’s remaining vacant residential parcels.
To more accurately calculate potential unit yields, only vacant parcels meeting the minimum lot size
requirement for their respective zoning designation, without the need for lot consolidation, were
considered to be developable. Fifty-eight vacant parcels on 20.6 acres outside of the City’s specific
planning areas were identified as having residential development potential during the planning period. A
GIS analysis of the existing housing stock indicates that most single-family and multifamily residential
development has occurred at or very near the highest allowable densities. Additionally, recent
development applications indicate that single and multifamily residential development is continuing to
occur near maximum densities.
Assuming future development continues to account for land use controls and site improvement
requirements in similar fashion, the vacant acreage could realistically accommodate approximately 247
units composed of approximately 90 single-family units and 157 multifamily units. This total does not
include the assumed development potential for 10 second units on single-family sites during the planning
period. Tables H-27 through H-29 display the breakdown of vacant potential by zone, parcel, and income
category. Figures H-3 through H-7 show the location of each vacant parcel. According to the General
Plan Environmental Impact Report, adequate infrastructure exists to support this potential development.
Furthermore, no environmental constraints have been identified on the sites that are considered as having
infill residential development potential.
Vacant Land in Traditional Residential Zones
Based on analysis of recent new home sales figures provided by DataQuick, the majority of market rate
units will be affordable only to above moderate income households. Several multifamily zones, including
RD 14, RMF 14, and a single-family zone, RSF 22, have very small minimum lot sizes and high densities.
Smaller lot sizes and higher densities can result in the development of several smaller, more affordable
units. However, the vacant land inventory conservatively estimates that small parcels in these zones will
yield above moderate income units. The City estimates that, based on past performance and increased
efforts of the City to promote second units, an additional 10 units could be constructed as second units
affordable to lower income households on nearly any of the 51 vacant sites zoned for single-family
residential development (second units must remain affordable to lower and moderate income households
per City of Dana Point Municipal Code Section 9.07.210 (b)(5)). These second units could also be
constructed on a large number of the City’s existing single-family lots.
Vacant Land in Multiple Use Zones
To accommodate additional higher density multifamily and affordable housing development
opportunities, the City’s zoning code and development standards allow multifamily housing (rental or
ownership) ranging from 14 to 30 dwelling units per acre in the Community Facilities (CF) zone. The
Vacant Land Inventory identified two vacant CF sites—one is 0.93 acres and the other is 5.3 acres (#28
and #40 shown on Figure H3 and H6). Both sites are under the same ownership, and the City has been in
contact with the property owner. Assuming attached or multifamily housing at a density of 25 units per
acre, approximately 23 units could be constructed on the 0.93-acre site, and 134 units could be
constructed on the 5.3-acre site. Per state law and if desired by the developer, projects on these sites could

                                             Dana Point                General Plan
seek approval for a density bonus of up to 35%, increasing the density and potential for affordable rental
housing. To provide a more conservative estimate, however, the land inventory does not count any density
bonus units in the City’s overall potential.
The City’s vacant land could provide approximately 247 units of new housing, of which 157 units could
be made affordable to lower income households. Even greater development potential could be achieved in
the event of a density bonus.

 standards, product types, tenure, market trends, and financial and regulatory incentives. While the City seeks to facilitate
 and maximize the affordable housing constructed in the city, this housing element illustrates development potential and
 City targets, but does not constitutes a requirement or regulation mandating the construction of affordable housing on a

Underutilized Land
The limited supply of developable vacant land and desirability of this coastal community requires Dana
Point to look for housing opportunities in existing underutilized parcels. The City is dedicated to
encouraging additional housing opportunities and has identified three underutilized areas appropriate for
residential development. Underutilized parcels are developed or utilized at less than full potential.
According to state law, underutilized sites may address a portion of the regional housing need if the
element describes the additional realistic development potential. Table H-30 shows these underutilized
sites have the potential to collectively provide 442 units.
Recent Underutilized Land Development Trends and Market Conditions
As previously mentioned, Dana Point’s high land costs and lack of vacant land necessitate the reuse or
redevelopment of underutilized sites. The City has consistently approved residential development at the
highest allowable densities, allowing it to maximize development opportunities. Dana Point generated a
master plan for the Town Center, the central commercial area of the City, to introduce high density
housing opportunities in a mixed-use setting. The City’s limited supply of vacant land make reuse and
new development of underutilized parcels a favorable option for the development community. The City
has discussed affordable housing opportunities in underutilized areas of Dana Point with several
developers. Table H-30 summarizes the potential yield of the underutilized sites. To be conservative, it is
not reflective of units possible through density bonus provisions.

1. The breakdown by income category is a hypothetical analysis of potential based on development standards, product types, tenure, market
trends, and financial and regulatory incentives, and submitted applications. While the City seeks to facilitate and maximize the affordable
housing constructed in the city, this housing element illustrates development potential and City targets, but does not constitute a
requirement or regulation mandating the construction of affordable housing on a specific site.
2. The Town Center is expected to provide 138 new units within the planning period, a conservative estimate derived from preliminary
proposals from property owners. This development potential includes selected underutilized and vacant land in the Town Center area.
Densities are extremely variable in the Town Center and residential units are to be developed in a mixed-use format. Residential densities
could exceed 30 units per acre, based on prototypes’ densities achieved in the Town Center Plan Development Analysis and Recommended
Planning Concepts document and preliminary proposals from property owners.
3. The assumed density for the Former Marina Mobile Home Estates is based on a submitted application and Mitigated Negative
Declaration. The project description states that 17 units will be affordable to lower income households.

Existing Uses: The Town Center consists of approximately 73 acres between Blue Lantern and Copper
Lantern Streets, fronting or in between approximately one mile of Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) and Del
Prado. In recognizing the true potential of this area, the City has generated a specific plan to facilitate the
new development and addition of residential uses to this area. The Town Center area has potential to
become a vibrant cultural, civic, and commercial city center. The plan will ensure compatibility between
proposed uses and existing uses.
The Dana Point Town Center Plan describes a variety of existing retail and service uses, including nine
structures that date back to the 1920s. The plan recognizes the area has several underutilized and vacant
parcels and identifies important issues, including the limited amount of housing in the downtown and lack
of critical mass. Although there are numerous vacant and underutilized parcels in this area, the City has
identified selected sites that are expected to be developed within the planning period at densities of at least
30 units per acre, based on discussions with property owners and developers.
Proposed Uses: The Town Center Plan amended the zoning ordinance to establish land uses and densities
to provide a mix of land uses and additional housing opportunities. The Fiscal Impact Analysis prepared
for the Town Center noted significant underutilized retail and residential potential, making the area an
ideal location for mixed-use and dense residential development. The analysis set forth two buildout
projections. The moderate model describes a 10-year construction period providing 232 new housing
units, 150 of which are new multifamily housing units expected to be constructed during the 2014–2021
planning period. Land acquisition and lot consolidation is already occurring in this area for future mixed-

                                                    Dana Point            General Plan
use projects. Three of the sites, 1j, 1k, and 1n, are the result of lot consolidation. Other lot consolidations
are currently being discussed with the City. A conservative estimate of the development potential for
underutilized site 1 (Town Center planning area) during the planning period is provided in Table H-31,
below. The Town Center Plan permits mixed-use development (residential to be located on the second
story or above) and conditionally permits residential care facilities for the elderly, senior housing, and SRO
units throughout the entire Plan area. Although the vacant and underutilized sites in the Town Center
could facilitate housing at a variety of affordability levels, including extremely low income SRO units, a
conservative estimate of only 10 lower income units is assumed.
A unique set of development standards was created to enable residential development to be developed
with a maximum Floor Area Ratio instead of a maximum density to facilitate higher densities (see Table
H-32). The intent of the development standards is to maximize the development potential of each site and
facilitate the creation of a variety of unit sizes. The Town Center Plan Development Analysis and
Recommended Planning Concepts evaluated prototypes of the expected development. The prototypes
allow a density of at least 20 units per acre, and many of the prototypes, particularly those maximizing the
allowable percentage of studio units, achieved densities of over 50 units per acre without exceeding the
40-foot height limit. Preliminary plans provided by property owners indicate that densities of at least 30
units per acre could be achieved; however, the development potential described in Table H-31 is a
conservative estimate and does not account for additional lot consolidations or densities over 30 units per
acre.

These vacant and underutilized sites, totaling 4.6 acres, range in size from 0.11 to 0.69 acres without
additional lot consolidation. A conservative estimate of 30 units per acre results in the development
potential for 138 new residential units. Assuming higher densities of 40 units per acre, the vacant sites
could accommodate 184 new units. If developed alone each site could support small projects such as
apartments or townhomes that are ideal for infill sites.
There are no known environmental constraints to residential development in the Town Center area, and
the city’s wet and dry infrastructure system can support the development proposed in the Town Center
Plan.
Development Incentives and Requirements: Previous setback requirements, height limitations, parking
requirements, and uniform zoning in the Town Center planning area resulted in development that does
not create a vibrant, pedestrian-oriented business environment. To allow for a more interesting streetscape
and increased housing opportunities, development standards have been proposed, including establishing
reduced setbacks from street frontages, increasing the maximum height limit from 35 to 40 feet,
establishing an In-Lieu Fee Parking Program, and rezoning for mixed-use development. Building mass is
regulated by development standards designed to encourage buildings to cover at least 75 percent of the
lot. Based on prototypes documented in the Town Center Development Analysis and Recommended
Planning Concepts, an average density of 30 units per acre is a conservative estimate.
The In-Lieu Fee Parking Program allows developers in the core area to buy out of providing onsite
commercial parking requirements to achieve the most efficient use of the land. The fees will help pay for a
centrally located parking facility. The plan also proposes allowing upper-level housing above any use in
the planning area. Allowing housing where residential uses were previously prohibited will bring life back
into the core of the City and support the retail uses below.

While the City could consider the entire Town Center an underutilized area, the Housing Element only
identifies 4.6 acres as readily available to accommodate mixed-use development during the planning
period. Over the past couple of years, the City has entertained an increasing number of discussions with
developers about residential projects in the Town Center.
Underutilized Site 2 (Former Dana Point Marina Mobile Home Estates)

                                       UNDERUTILIZED SITE 2
Existing Uses: Located at 34202 Del Obispo Street immediately north of Pacific Coast Highway (PCH),
the 8.7-acre, 90-unit Dana Point Marina Mobile Home Estates was closed by choice of the property owner
in 2005, and the coaches have been removed. The property is currently zoned for Residential/Commercial
18 (R/C-18). The SOCWA wastewater treatment facility is directly north of the site, the San Juan Creek is
directly east, commercial uses are west and south of the site across Del Obispo Street and PCH, and
Doheny State Beach is south of the property, across PCH. The surrounding uses are not considered to be a
significant constraint to the development of the site. The property’s proximity to the beach provides a
desirable amenity and would facilitate the construction of housing.
Proposed Uses: The property owner has received approval for a General Plan Amendment and Zone
Change for a residential/commercial mixed-use project, with a proposed density of 18 units per acre. The
City Council and Costal Commission approved the General Plan amendment and zone change. A
Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) was prepared for the project. The MND assumed a project size of
169 units, including 17 units set aside for lower income households (with density bonus). Given the
project size and density, density bonus incentives, and inclusionary housing requirements in the Coastal

                                       Dana Point           General Plan
Zone, it is reasonable to assume that a portion of the total units could be affordable to moderate income
households.
The MND includes a plan for mitigation of environmental impacts resulting from the proposed project.
Existing connections to the City’s water, sewer, and dry utilities are located on site, and these
infrastructure systems have the capacity to serve the proposed additional residences.
Development Incentives and Requirements: The residential/commercial mixed-use zoning of the site
allows additional housing units and provide housing opportunities for lower and moderate income
households. Additional incentives for affordable housing and density bonus provisions may increase the
number of affordable units as well as the number of total possible units.
Underutilized Site 3 (Capistrano Unified School District)

                                        UNDERUTILIZED SITE 3
Existing Uses: Located at 26126 Victoria Boulevard, immediately south of the intersection of Victoria
Boulevard and Sepulveda Avenue and north of Pacific Coast Highway, this 5.6-acre parcel was identified
by the Capistrano Unified School District (CUSD) as an excess surplus site. The site is currently being
used as a district vehicle storage yard. There is also a small office building and other maintenance facilities
on site, including fuel pumps. Discussions with school representatives indicated that the fuel storage meets
current standards. At the time of the preparation of this document there are no known on site
environmental constraints. The school district indicated that a Phase I environmental site assessment was

                                                       -91-

                                       Dana Point          General Plan
prepared and the site is developable during the planning period. Existing connections to City water, sewer,
and other dry utilities are on site, and these can support the additional residences proposed. The existing
zoning designation is Community Facilities, which permits multifamily residential uses of 30 dwelling
units an acre without a CUP.
The surrounding parcels are zoned Commercial/Residential. Existing adjacent development includes a fire
station, professional offices, and residential uses, including a 24-unit, rent-restricted residential project
specifically built to accommodate large families. The existing uses are considered compatible with future
residential development.
Proposed Uses: The site may be particularly suitable for higher density multifamily senior housing. As
stated in the Age Composition and Special Needs sections of the Housing Element, the City has
significant retired population. These senior residents are typically more likely to experience overpayment
and be subject to a fixed income, indicating a potential need for additional senior housing in Dana Point.
The site’s size and location also make it a good candidate for family housing. The site may provide
opportunities for workforce housing for employees of local agencies such as CUSD.
Although the size of the structure would be limited by a maximum FAR of 1.0 and a maximum of three
stories, a density of 30 dwelling units per acre could be achieved. Existing development and recent
development applications indicate that most residential development in the City occurs at the highest
allowable density. Moreover, projects that incorporate affordable housing tend to seek the highest density
possible to maximize the land value. With a density of 30 units per acre, the site could accommodate 135
multifamily housing units. With the inclusion of affordable housing and a density bonus, the site could
reach 35–40 units per acre (up to 224 units).
With a public agency as property owner and the size and density of the site lending itself to affordable
housing development, this site is a prime candidate for affordable housing. Although the site could be
developed as a mixed-income housing project (as is assumed for development potential), an affordable
housing developer would be more likely to construct 100% of the units as affordable to lower or moderate
income households. First, it is the mission of affordable housing developers to maximize the number of
affordable units constructed. Second, a project increases its competitiveness for state and federal affordable
housing funding programs as the number and percentage of affordable housing units increases. That is, a
project with 100% affordable housing is more likely to obtain affordable housing funding than a project
with 50% affordable and 50% market rate housing.
Development Incentives and Requirements: Future development of the property is likely to occur through
a public and private partnership. The City may consider a variety of affordable housing incentives such as
reductions in lot size, width, depth, and setbacks, and increases in maximum lot coverage and floor area
ratio. Additional incentives for affordable housing provided by various state and county programs and
density bonus provisions may increase the number of affordable units as well as the number of total
possible units.
Summary of Housing Development Potential
Because Dana Point is a highly desirable coastal community, the market for housing is expected to quickly
return as the economy improves given the lack of available land. Dana Point’s current development
pattern generally builds to the maximum density permitted by zoning. The City intends to continue
making the highest and best use of residential land and understands that this vision includes housing for

                                         Dana Point        General Plan
all segments of the community. With this in mind, the City increased multifamily and affordable housing
potential by permitting multifamily housing in the CF zone and reducing regulatory barriers to mixed-
income and affordable housing in multifamily zones.
Vacant residential land and underutilized sites in Dana Point offer a variety of development opportunities,
ranging from single-family homes with ocean views to apartments and SRO efficiencies. The potential
buildout of each vacant parcel is calculated based on existing densities, development standards, and
market conditions. Realistic capacity buildouts on vacant land outside of the Town Center area result in
the potential for 247 new units, of which 157 could serve lower income households. The breakdown by
income category is a hypothetical analysis based on expected densities and product types.
A similar analysis for underutilized sites, with consideration of feasibility due to existing uses, results in the
potential for 442 new units. Although the potential to achieve housing development on underutilized sites
within the planning period is bolstered by the adoption of the Town Center Plan and through ongoing
discussions with the owners of the two other underutilized sites, conservative affordability assumptions are
provided in Table H-33. In total, the City’s approved units, vacant lands, and underutilized parcels are of
sufficient number, zoning, and size to accommodate the potential growth for all income levels as
prescribed in the City’s combined RHNA.

Price of Land
Typically, land costs increase as land availability decreases. With a very limited amount of available land
the cost of land is a major constraint to housing production in Dana Point. In addition, the desirability of
this coastal community, with ocean views and other local amenities, drives prices up. The most recent
transactions for vacant, residentially zoned land within the City range from approximately $8 to $275 per
square foot. The cost per square foot for vacant residential sites without a coastal view ranged from $8 to
$79 (Zillow.com).
The high cost of land increases home prices, which in turn creates more need for large financial subsidies in
order to bring the total new housing costs within the economic reach of low income households. As in the
                                                 December 2013

past, the City will actively pursue policies and programs to make extremely low, very low, low, and
moderate income housing available. However, to achieve affordable housing goals, a combination of public
and private financing will be needed to overcome the obstacle of high land prices.
Cost of Construction
Construction costs primarily consist of the cost of materials and labor. Both of these factors fluctuate
depending on market demand and market-based changes in the cost of materials. Other influences on the
cost of construction include the type of unit being built and quality of the product being produced.
The cost of labor is based on a number of factors, including housing demand, the number of contractors in
the area, and the union status of workers. Labor cost is usually two to three times the cost of materials,
thus the cost of labor represents an estimated 17–20% of the cost of building a unit. Low income
households can typically financially support about 30–40% of the development costs of a new dwelling
unit. All costs above this level require gap financing to pay for the total costs. Construction costs, along
with many other private market factors, contribute to making new housing unaffordable to lower income
households.
To help mitigate constraints posed by construction costs, the City allows manufactured housing in single
or multifamily zones. The use of manufactured homes can reduce housing costs by as much as 30–40%,
according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Financing
The affordability of owning a home is greatly influenced by mortgage interest rates. Increases in interest
rates decrease the number of persons able to purchase a home. Conversely, decreasing interest rates result
in more potential homebuyers introduced to the market.
Interest rates are determined by national policies and economic conditions, and there is little that local
governments can do to affect these rates. First-time homebuyers are the group impacted the most by
financing requirements. Lower initial rates are available with graduated payment mortgages, adjustable
rate mortgages, and buy-down mortgages. However, variable interest rate mortgages on affordable homes
may increase to the point of interest rates exceeding the cost of living adjustments, which is a constraint
on the affordability.
Mortgage interest rates for new home purchases ranged from 3–7% for a fixed-rate, 30-year loan between
2008 and 2012, with an average rate of approximately 4% in 2012. The recent foreclosure crisis has
generated more conservative lending standards, and down payment requirements have increased.
Flexible loan programs, such as those for first-time homebuyers, still offer flexible down payment
requirements between 5% and 20%. Such programs provide a method to bridge the gap between a
required down payment and potential homeowner’s available funds. The Federal Housing Administration
(FHA) offers loan programs for first time home buyers including low down payments, around 3.5%, low
closing costs, and easy credit qualifying.
At this time the greatest impediment to homeownership is creditworthiness. According to the FHA,
lenders consider a person’s debt-to-income ratio, cash available for down payment, and credit history when
                                               December 2013
                                                     -94-

                                       Dana Point          General Plan
determining a maximum loan amount. Many financial institutions are willing to significantly decrease
down payment requirements and increase loan amounts to persons with good credit ratings.
Persons with poor credit ratings will likely be forced to accept a higher interest rate or a loan amount
insufficient to purchase a house. Poor credit rating can be especially damaging to lower income residents,
who have fewer financial resources with which to qualify for a loan. The FHA is generally more flexible
than conventional lenders in its qualifying guidelines and allows many residents to reestablish a good
credit history.
Preservation of At-Risk Units
State housing element law requires the analysis of government-assisted housing that is eligible to change
from lower income housing to market rate housing within 10 years after the beginning of the planning
period (2024). The reasons why government-assisted housing might convert to market rate include
expiring subsidies, mortgage prepayments, and expiration of affordability restrictions. State law also
requires the development of programs to preserve of at-risk units. The following must be included in each
housing element as part of its preservation analysis:
  •    An inventory of assisted housing units that are at risk of converting to market rate within 10 years
       after the beginning of the planning period (2024).
  •    An analysis of the costs of preserving and/or replacing these units.
  •    Resources that could be used to preserve the at-risk units.
  •    Program efforts for preservation of at-risk units.
                                                   •    Quantified objectives for the number of at-risk units
                                                        to be preserved during the housing element planning
                                                        period.
                                                 Assisted Units
                                                 City records identified three projects currently providing
                                                 148 units of affordable housing. Of these 148 units, 64 are
                                                 preserved for affordable housing in perpetuity. The
                                                 remaining 84 units could be at risk of converting to market
                                                 rate units by the year 2024.

                                                 Domingo/Doheny Park Road: The Orange County
Community Housing Corporation built the Domingo/Doheny Park Road rent-restricted project in 1983
specifically for large families. The project consists of 24 three-bedroom units for very low income
households. Affordability is for the life of the project, so this project is not at risk of conversion by 2024.
Monarch Coast Apartments: Out of 418 units, the Monarch Coast Apartments provides 84 one- and
two-bedroom units for lower income households. Half of these are restricted for very low income
households and half are restricted for low income households as guided by HUD fair market rents. These

units were financed by a $31.8 million bond in 1999 and are restricted for affordable rental housing until
January 2015.
In 1992, 32 of the market-rate units were lost due to a landslide. In March 2006 the City Council
authorized the City Manager to execute an Affordable Housing Agreement with William Lyon Company
to rebuild the 32 units in return for preserving a portion of the Monarch Coast Apartments for affordable
housing in perpetuity. According to the agreement, 20 units would be restricted for low income
households and another 20 units would be restricted for moderate income households in perpetuity, even
if they are converted to condominiums. The agreement results in the preservation of 40 income-restricted
units in perpetuity.
In addition, the agreement provides that William Lyon Company will prepare a dispersal map showing
where the affordable units will be located, which will be subject to City approval. This will enable the City
to ensure that the affordable units are dispersed evenly and appropriately throughout the project. The
other 44 income-restricted units will be able to convert to market rate units starting January 1, 2015. The
City is in talks with Monarch Coast to preserve the affordability of the remaining 44 units throughout the
planning period.
Preservation Options
The City has three basic options for preserving the affordable units at risk of conversion to market rents:
1) continue the present rent subsidy; 2) build new units to replace those lost to conversion; or 3) facilitate
the transfer to another nonprofit. Because the current assisted units are in good condition, an acquisition
and rehabilitation strategy is not considered appropriate.
Replace Rent Subsidies
The first preservation option is to replace the reduced-rent units in return for extending affordability
covenants. The City would negotiate with the owner to extend affordability. The financial cost equals the
difference between the fair market rent of a unit and the maximum rent tenants could pay each month.
Table H-34 calculates the affordable housing subsidy that would be required to preserve the at-risk units.
A short term solution to affordable housing stock limitation is the Section 8 voucher program that
provides rent subsidies to extremely low and very low income households with a housing cost burden or
who are at risk of becoming homeless or being displaced. Voucher recipients rent housing from private
landlords and pay a portion of their income toward rent (usually up to 30% of their income). The County
Housing Authority subsidizes the difference in monthly payments to the owner.
Monarch Coast Apartments
The City can assume that the 44 at-risk units will be divided in the same proportion (and occupied by the
same household size) as the current units. As shown in Table H-34, the City would need to provide
approximately $157,080 in annual financial assistance, translating into $8.64 million over 55 years (a
common affordability covenant time period).
Build New Units
The cost of constructing new units depends on whether the developer needs to purchase land and
whether their initial contribution can be leveraged with other funding sources. Constructing all 44

units in one project would be the most efficient and cost-effective use of land. As shown in Table H-
35, the construction of 44 one- and two-bedroom units is estimated to cost at least $7.4 million. This
new project would also have to be maintained and monitored, adding additional operating costs that
could not be covered by the subsidized rent for many years.

Facilitate Transfer of Units
The City of Dana Point is in frequent contact with the affordable housing community and has positive
relationships with many nonprofit affordable housing organizations. The City could facilitate the transfer
of the units to a nonprofit housing corporation that could purchase the project, rehabilitate it, and extend
the affordability controls.
There are numerous potential resources to help fund acquisition and rehabilitation. One potential resource
is Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). These funds are awarded to participating urbanized
communities including Dana Point. Funding is awarded on a competitive basis to each participating city.
Activities eligible for CDBG funding include acquisition, rehabilitation, economic development, and
public services. The County of Orange was awarded $3,635,618 in CDBG funds for Fiscal Year 2011–
2012.

HOME is a county-administered flexible grant program that takes into account local market conditions,
inadequate housing, poverty, and housing production costs. HOME funding is provided to jurisdictions to
assist rental housing or home ownership through acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and/or
rehabilitation of affordable housing. The County of Orange allocates funds to its participating cities on a
competitive basis. In Fiscal Year 2011–2012, the County of Orange received a total of $1,522,687 in
HOME funds.
Under the federal Section 202 program, nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives can receive
no-interest capital advances from HUD for the construction of very low income rental housing for seniors
and persons with disabilities. These funds can be used in conjunction with Section 811 program funds,
which can be used to develop group homes, independent living facilities, and intermediate care facilities.
Eligible activities include acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, and rental assistance.
Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) is a federally funded, state-administered financial program to
preserve and create new affordable housing. A nonprofit housing corporation could purchase the at-risk
project, rehabilitate it using tax credit financing, and extend the affordability covenant. The California Tax
Credit Allocation Committee oversees the application and allocation process for all LIHTC projects.
Applicants compete for the funds, which are prioritized based on location, affordability terms, housing
needs, and project amenities.
The California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) has multifamily programs that provide permanent
financing for the acquisition, rehabilitation, and preservation or new construction of rental housing that
includes affordable rents for lower and moderate income households. One of the programs is the
Preservation Acquisition Finance Program, which is designed to facilitate the acquisition of at-risk
affordable housing developments and provide low-cost funding to preserve affordability.
Qualifying Entities
The Department of Housing and Community Development lists a number of qualified entities interested
in acquiring and/or managing affordable housing at-risk of conversion. In the event that an affordable
housing development owner decides to sell the property, qualifying entities have the right to submit an
offer matching the terms of any other offer. To qualify, an entity must meet several criteria, including
being able to manage the facility; maintain affordability for at least 30 years or the remaining term of
assistance; preserve the existing occupancy profile and maintain rents at an agreed-upon level of
affordability; and agree to renew subsidies if available and as sufficient to maintain economic feasibility.
Qualifying entities include, but are not limited to:
  •    Civic Center Barrio Housing Corporation
  •    Housing Corporation of America
  •    Jamboree Housing Corporation
  •    Mercy Housing
  •    NeighborWorks Orange County (formerly Neighborhood Housing Services of Orange County, Inc.)

Appropriateness of Previous Housing Goals, Objectives, and Policies
The previous Housing Element included appropriate goals and policies to encourage affordable housing
and meet the requirements of state law. The objectives, however, were often insufficiently specific and did
not require actions or commitments from the City. The Housing Element Update includes revised goals,
objectives, and policies to support and take stronger action toward providing and maintaining quality
affordable and market rate housing in Dana Point. Certification of the update is desired not only to meet
the intentions of state law, but also to assist the City in implementing programs proposed to meet the
housing needs of Dana Point residents.
Table HB-1 identifies and evaluates all of the housing programs in the 2006–2014 Housing Element,
including their level of achievement and recommendations for future activity.

                                                   (GPA95-02(c)/LCPA95-08)
                          INTRODUCTION TO
                    THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT
The Circulation Element is one of seven mandated Elements of the General
Plan and is intended to guide the development of the City's circulation system
in a manner that is compatible with the Land Use Element. A well-planned
circulation system is important, and the State of California has mandated the
adoption of a citywide Circulation Element since 1955. The anticipated level
and pattern of development by the year 2010, as identified in the Land Use
Element, will increase capacity demands on the City's roadways. To help
meet these demands and achieve balanced growth, the City has adopted
specific goals and policies which serve as the basis for the Circulation
Element.
PURPOSE OF THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT
              The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide a safe,
              sensible, and efficient circulation system for the City. The
              current State mandate for a Circulation Element states that the
              General Plan shall include:
                     "...a Circulation Element consisting of the general
                     location for proposed major thoroughfares, trans-
                     portation routes, terminals, and other local public
                     utilities and facilities, all correlated with the Land
                     Use Element of the Plan."
              To meet these objectives, the Circulation Element addresses the
              circulation improvements needed to relieve traffic congestion
              due to future land uses. It also addresses potential demand
              management strategies and mass transit services. Correspond-
              ing goals and policies have been adopted to ensure that all
              components of the circulation system will meet the needs of the
              City of Dana Point.
              The Element establishes a hierarchy of transportation routes
              with specific development standards described for each
              category of roadway. The "City of Dana Point, General Plan
              Traffic Analysis," prepared by Austin-Foust Associates,
              provides background information and acts as a supporting
              document for the Element.
                                                               CIRCULATION ELEMENT
                                                                        1
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
          Several transportation plans have been prepared by the County
          of Orange, focusing on the development of a regional trans-
          portation system to handle the anticipated traffic loads
          expected from future development. A number of plans have
          also been prepared identifying the location of future routes for
          mass transit including light rail and conventional buses.
          Plans and programs related to the City's Circulation Element
          include the following:
          °    County of Orange, Master Plan of Arterial Highways
          °    San Joaquin Hills and Foothill Transportation Corridor
               plans
          °    South Coast Air Basin, Air Quality Management Plan
          °    County of Orange, Congestion Management Plan
          °    County of Orange, Master Plan of Scenic Highways
          °    County of Orange, Master Plan of Countywide Bikeways

SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
          This Element is comprised of several sections which address
          the major components of the circulation system. Each section
          contains summary information on the existing and future
          conditions of the system, relevant plans and programs which
          influence circulation in Dana Point, and the goal and policy
          statements corresponding to each component. Following these
          sections, noteworthy characteristics of each component of the
          system are discussed. Detailed information pertaining to
          existing conditions are documented in the Master Environ-
          mental Assessment, and forecast conditions are analyzed in
          detail in the "City of Dana Point, General Plan Traffic Analysis."
                                                        CIRCULATION ELEMENT
                                                                 2

                Utilities and transmission facilities are described in the Public
               Facilities Element.
        CIRCULATION ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
The Circulation Element is based on a set of circulation-related goals which
reflect and are designed to support the citywide objectives of the General
Plan. The goals acknowledge the changing economic, social and environ-
mental conditions in the City and surrounding regions, and the anticipated
needs of the community. The circulation goals and policies are discussed in
the following sections:
°    Local Thoroughfares and Transportation Routes
°    Intercity and Regional Transportation
°    Transportation System/Demand Management
°    Public Transportation
°    Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Equestrian Facilities
°    Parking
°    Truck Circulation
°    Harbor
°    Rail
°    Airport
The major traffic problem within the City, as identified in the "City of Dana
Point, Circulation Element, Technical Report", exists primarily on the section
of Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) where State Route 1 (SR-1) ends and
becomes PCH. The intersection of Del Obispo Street and PCH is of particular
concern.
LOCAL THOROUGHFARES AND TRANSPORTATION ROUTES
               A well-planned street system facilitates the movement of
               vehicles and provides safe and convenient access to surround-
               ing development. Three classifications of streets are included
                                                              CIRCULATION ELEMENT
                                                                       3

in the local circulation system:
Arterial Streets: Streets which primarily serve through traffic
and provide access to abutting properties as their secondary
function. Arterials are further subdivided into functional
classifications based on distinctions in geometrical characteris-
tics and primary function:
°    Major Arterials: Roadways comprising six travel lanes
     with a raised median divider. Major arterials generally carry
     high traffic volumes and are main thoroughfares through
     the City, as well as acting as links between adjacent
     communities.
°    Primary Arterials: Roadways which are designed to
     accommodate four travel lanes and a raised median. These
     arterials carry high traffic volumes and connect major
     arterials with secondary arterials.
°    Secondary Arterials: Roadways which are composed of
     four travel lanes without a raised median. These arterials
     typically carry traffic along the perimeters of major devel-
     opments but are also used as through streets.
Collector Streets: Streets which provide property access and
traffic circulation within residential, commercial, and industrial
districts.
Local Streets: Streets which are designed to provide individual
property access throughout the City.
The Dana Point community's historical development of local,
collector and arterial streets has provided the basis for a safe,
efficient roadway system. Arterial streets have been built with
sufficient capacity to accommodate long-term traffic growth. In
addition, driveway access has been limited to promote safe and
efficient operations.
GOAL 1: Provide a system of streets that meets the needs of
current and future residents and facilitates the safe and
efficient movement of people and goods throughout the City.

          30212, 30212.5, 30221)
INTERCITY AND REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION
          The Circulation Element provides an analysis of the City's
          existing and future circulation needs based upon their relation-
          ship to the regional transportation network. Planning for the
          effective implementation of the Dana Point Circulation Element
          requires active participation in the transportation planning
          activities of the County, Region and the State.
          GOAL 2: Support development of a network of regional
          transportation facilities which ensures the safe and efficient
          movement of people and goods from within the City to areas
          outside its boundaries, and which accommodates the regional
          travel demands of developing areas outside the City.
          Policy 2.1: Support the completion of the Orange County
          Master Plan of Arterial Highways.
          Policy 2.2: Support the addition of capacity improvements to
          Interstate 5 such as high-occupancy vehicle lanes, general
          purpose lanes, auxiliary lanes, and corresponding noise barriers
          to mitigate the noise impacts of these improvements.
          Policy 2.3: Maintain a proactive and assertive role with
          appropriate agencies dealing with regional transportation
          issues affecting the City.
                                                        CIRCULATION ELEMENT
                                                                 6
         Policy 2.4: Work with adjacent cities to ensure that the traffic
         impacts of development projects in these cities do not ad-
         versely impact the City of Dana Point. (Coastal Act/30253)
         Policy 2.5: Work toward a multi-modal transportation network
         which provides viable transportation alternatives such as
         Amtrak, LOSSAN (Metrolink), shuttle access to airport
         facilities, and congestion management techniques.
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM/DEMAND MANAGEMENT
                                     Effective circulation planning must
         involve the use of Transportation System Management (TSM)
         and Demand Management (TDM) strategies. Operational
         improvements relating to signalization and intersection
         enhancements can help to increase the capacity of the existing
         circulation system. Through participation in Transportation
         Demand Management programs, vehicle trips can be
         significantly reduced. Continued participation in County and
         Regional discussions on TSM/TDM strategies may help to
         create long term reductions in traffic impacting the City of Dana
         Point.
         GOAL 3: Maximize the efficiency of the circulation system
         through the use of Transportation System Management and
         Demand Management strategies.
         Policy 3.1: Implement traffic signal coordination on arterial
         streets to the maximum extent practical, and integrate signal
         coordination efforts with those of adjacent jurisdictions.
         Policy 3.2: Implement intersection capacity improvements
         where feasible.
         Policy 3.3: Encourage the implementation of employer Trans-
         portation Demand Management (TDM) requirements included
         in the Southern California Air Quality Management District's
         Regulation XV of the Air Quality Management Plan. Participate
         in regional efforts to implement (TDM) requirements.
         Policy 3.4: Require that proposals for major new non-residen-
         tial developments (in excess of 50,000 square feet) include
         submission of a TDM plan to the City, including monitoring
         and enforcement provisions. (Coastal Act/30213)

          Policy 3.6: Promote ridesharing through publicity and provi-
          sion of information to the public.
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
          The City of Dana Point supports an efficient public transpor-
          tation system to serve the residents of the City. Developments
          should be planned in a manner that facilitates provision of
          transit services. While increasing the mobility of all the
          residents is important, it is essential to increase accessibility to
          transit services for the elderly and disabled persons.
          GOAL 4: Support development of a public transportation
          system that provides mobility to all City residents and en-
          courages use of public transportation as an alternative to
          automobile travel.
          Policy 4.1: Support the efforts of the appropriate agencies to
          provide additional local and express bus service to the Dana
          Point community, and to provide additional park-and-ride lots
          near the I-5 freeway.
          Policy 4.2: Require new development to fund transit facilities,
          such as bus shelters and turn-outs, where deemed necessary.
          Policy 4.3: Ensure accessibility of public transportation for
          elderly and disabled persons.
          Policy 4.4: Encourage employers to reduce vehicular trips by
          offering employee incentives.
          Policy 4.5: Promote new development that is designed in a
          manner that (1) facilitates provision or extension of transit
          service, (2) provides on-site commercial and recreational
          facilities to discourage mid-day travel, and (3) provides non-
          automobile circulation within the development.               (Coastal
          Act/30213, 30252)
          Policy 4.6:     Encourage developers to work with agencies

           potential for transit use by residents and/or visitors.
           Policy 4.7: Encourage the provision of safe, attractive and
           clearly identifiable transit stops and related high quality pedes-
           trian facilities throughout the community. (Coastal Act/30252)
           Policy 4.8: Require noise impact studies prior to approval of
           new public transportation routes through residential communi-
           ties.
BICYCLE, PEDESTRIAN AND EQUESTRIAN FACILITIES
                                                                 The provision
           of effective vehicular travel is an essential part of the City's
           circulation needs. However, non-vehicular modes of travel are
           also important. Bicycle and pedestrian circulation between
           major activity areas of the City should be provided through
           separate trails, walkways, and bike lanes.
           GOAL 5: Encourage non-motorized transportation, such as
           bicycle and pedestrian circulation.

                                      Adequate and convenient parking
        facilities should be provided as a part of all development in the
        City. Where possible, and especially in commercial areas,
        parking should be consolidated or shared. Access and egress
        to parking areas should be carefully planned so as to facilitate
        the safe flow of traffic on major streets and to minimize conflicts
        with pedestrians.
        GOAL 6: Provide for well-designed and convenient parking
        facilities.
        Policy 6.1: Consolidate parking, where appropriate, to reduce
        the number of ingress and egress points onto arterials.
        Policy 6.2: Maintain public access to the coast by providing
        better transit and parking opportunities. (Coastal Act/30252)

          Policy 6.4: Encourage the use of shared parking facilities, such
          as through parking districts or other mechanisms.
TRUCK CIRCULATION
                                                              The
          establishment of well-defined circulation routes for truck traffic
          will help to increase the efficiency of the street system and also
          address safety concerns. One of the major concerns of City
          residents is noise and safety from large vehicle traffic in or near
          residential areas.
          GOAL 7: Provide for a truck circulation system that provides
          for the effective transport of commodities while minimizing the
          negative impacts throughout the City.
          Policy 7.1: Provide primary truck routes on selected arterial
          streets to minimize the impacts of truck traffic on residential
          areas.
          Policy 7.2: Provide appropriately designed and maintained
          roadways for the primary truck routes. (Coastal Act/30254)
          Policy 7.3: Develop berms, landscape screening or barriers
          along truck routes to minimize noise impacts on sensitive land
          uses.
          Policy 7.4: Provide loading areas and accessways that are
          designed and located so as to avoid conflicts with efficient
          traffic circulation.
          Policy 7.5: Consider safety regulations addressing trucks
          hauling materials within the City.
HARBOR
          The Harbor is one of Dana Point's greatest assets. Through
          sound planning the City can ensure the continued adequacy of
          the Harbor for boating, fishing and other recreational activities.

        GOAL 8: Provide adequate waterway circulation through the
        Dana Point Harbor.
        Policy 8.1: Evaluate adequacy of and maintain sufficient
        capacity within the Harbor for the existing and future patrons of
        the Harbor.
RAIL
        Commuter rail systems presently serve the residents of Dana
        Point from stations in San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente.
        As demands for rail travel increase, opportunities may exist to
        locate an additional commuter rail station in Dana Point.
        GOAL 9: Support the continued development of a commuter
        rail system throughout the City that meets the needs of cur-
        rent and future residents.
        Policy 9.1: Coordinate with Amtrak and Los Angeles-San
        Diego (LOSSAN) Corridor Commuter Rail to expedite commuter
        rail service to the City.
        Policy 9.2: Work with the appropriate entities to evaluate
        development of a commuter rail station for Dana Point, with
        shuttle connections to employment centers and residential
        areas.
AIRPORT
        While airport facilities are not located within Dana Point, it is
        important the public transportation be provided between the
        City and the regional airports. This can also avoid unnecessary
        vehicular trips within the City.
        GOAL 10: Provide public transportation for residents to
        airport facilities in the region.
        Policy 10.1: Work with the Orange County Transit District
        (OCTD) and other appropriate agencies to provide express
        transportation to regional airports.

                           CIRCULATION PLAN
The Circulation Plan describes the approach to be used in implementing the
Circulation Element goals and policies. This section of the Circulation
Element describes the location and extent of circulation facilities and services,
and identifies standards that apply to each. To portray the continuity of the
circulation system, the General Plan graphics include planned facilities
outside the City limits which are inside the analysis area used for the overall
circulation analysis.
ROADWAY FACILITY DESIGNATIONS
                                                                     The future
              roadway system in Dana Point has been defined using a
              classification system which describes a hierarchy of facility
              types.      The categories of roadways included in this
              classification system differentiate the size, function and capaci-
              ty of the roadway links for each type of roadway.
              There are six basic categories in the hierarchy, ranging from
              higher capacity "Major", "Augmented Primary", "Primary" and
              "Secondary" arterials, to "Collector" and "Local" streets with
              the lowest capacity.         Typical cross-sections for arterial
              classifications are provided in Figure C-1. Actual cross-sec-
              tions may vary somewhat from the indicated measurement
              standards, but in order to provide maximum capacity, as well as
              right-of-way protection for landscaping, bike lanes, and future
              roadway improvements, the typical roadway cross-sections are
              recommended as future minimums. Major, primary, and
              secondary arterials are expected to include bike lanes which
              conform to uniform standards documented in the bicycle
              facilities section.
              The desirable goal for every classified street section is that it
              carry the designed volume of traffic at the desired level of
              service. Within this requirement, descriptions of width and
              facilities are offered as non-exclusive alternatives; variation in
              design is expected, depending on different community design
              characteristics. Different optional facilities are also expected
              (on-street parking, sidewalks versus pathways, bicycle lanes or
              paths, extra parkway or median landscape treatment, etc.).

The seven categories of roadways located in Dana Point are de-
scribed in greater detail in the following paragraphs:
Freeway: A six- to ten-lane divided arterial roadway with full
access control and a typical right-of-way width in excess of 150
feet, designed and maintained by the State Department of
Transportation.
Major Arterial: A six-lane divided roadway, with a typical
right-of-way width of 120 feet and a curb-to-curb pavement
width of around 100 feet.
Augmented Primary Arterial: A six-lane divided roadway,
with a typical right-of-way width of 100 feet and a curb-to-curb
pavement width of around 84 feet. This designation allows for
a six-lane roadway within the geometrics of a four-lane primary
roadway.
Primary Arterial: A four-lane divided roadway, with a typical
right-of-way width of 100 feet and curb-to-curb pavement width
of 84 feet.
Secondary Arterial: A four-lane undivided roadway, with a
typical right-of-way width of 80 feet and a curb-to-curb
pavement width of 64 feet.
Collector: A two-lane undivided roadway, with a typical right-
of-way width of 64 feet and a curb-to-curb pavement width of
around 40 feet. Its function is to distribute traffic between local
streets, and major and primary arterials. Although some
collectors serve as through routes, their primary function is to
provide access to surrounding land uses.
Local: This category of roadway is designed to provide access
to individual parcels in the City. Local streets consist of two
lanes with a typical right-of-way width of 60 feet and a pave-
ment width of 36 feet.
As a roadway facility is downgraded, the non curb-to-curb
width increases to allow for landscaping and other amenities.

PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
        Evaluating the ability of the circulation system to serve the
        desired future land uses requires establishing suitable "perfor-
        mance criteria". These are the means by which future traffic
        volumes are compared to future circulation system capacity,
        and the adequacy of that circulation system assessed.
        Performance criteria have a policy component which establishes
        a desired level of service (LOS) and a technical component
        which specifies how traffic forecast data can be used to
        measure the achievement of the criteria. The most commonly
        used standard in urban areas is LOS "D", and there are also
        cases where both LOS "C" and LOS "D" are used, the former
        for average daily traffic table (ADT) link volumes and the latter
        for peak hour intersection volumes.
        The performance criteria used for evaluating volumes and
        capacities on the City street and highway system are summa-
        rized in Table C-3 (and Tables A and B). They include both
        ADT link volume and peak hour intersection volume criteria.
        The specified LOS thresholds recognize two different types of
        roadway:
        ° State highways and major arterials, which carry a significant
            proportion of non-City traffic.
        ° Primary, secondary and local arterials, which largely serve
            City traffic.
        For the first category, LOS "D" is the lowest acceptable level of
        service, and for the second category, LOS "C" is the threshold
        level of service. Table C-4 describes traffic flow quality for
        different levels of service. Such criteria would be applied
        consistently for evaluating land use and circulation system
        changes and are the basis for the General Plan circulation

        from these requirements would be for Congestion Management

        service "E" as the lowest acceptable level of service.

GENERAL PLAN CIRCULATION SYSTEM
                                                            The goals and
         policies included in this Element emphasize the importance of
         developing a circulation system that is capable of serving both
         existing and future residents while preserving community
         values and character.
         Arterial streets included in the planned street system, shown in
         Figure C-2, are classified according to their facility-type
         designation and sized to provide sufficient capacity for
         projected traffic

                                 CIRCULATION SYSTEM PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
The following are the performance criteria used for comparing volumes and capacities on the City street and highway system:
I.         AVERAGE DAILY TRAFFIC (ADT) LINK VOLUMES
                       Level of Service C - Primary arterials, secondary arterials and local streets.
                       Level of Service D - Major arterials and State highways.
                       Table A below shows ADT volumes corresponding to these levels of service.
II.        PEAK HOUR INTERSECTION VOLUMES
                       Level of Service C - Primary arterials, secondary arterials and local streets.
                       Level of Service D - Major arterials and State highways.
                       Level of Service E - Congestion Management Plan (CMP) evaluations (CMP designated roadways only).
                       Table B below shows how these levels of service are specified.

          volumes. The map indicates all of the designated major
          arterials, primary arterials, secondary arterials and collector
          streets. Because the San Diego Freeway and State Route 1
          both traverse the City, freeway facilities are also indicated.
          Intersections which are projected to require more lanes than the
          typical arterial cross-section are indicated as "critical intersec-
          tions". Provisions of additional lanes may require additional
          right-of-way beyond the standard provided within the typical
          arterial cross-sections. Alternatively, these additional lanes
          could be accommodated by removing on-street bike lanes or
          reducing parkway width. Critical intersections typically require
          10-15 feet of right-of-way in addition to that shown for the
          typical arterial cross-sections.
          The roadway network described in Figure C-2 focuses on a
          number of major improvements with regard to the roadway
          system in the City. All roadway improvements are included in
          the County of Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways
          (MPAH) with the exception of those to Camino Capistrano and
          Doheny Park Road. Both are designated as primary facilities on
          the MPAH and are forecast to carry traffic volumes significantly
          in excess of their intended capacities. Both facilities will be
          upgraded to "augmented primary" designations on the City's
          Circulation Element (or "modified majors", as denoted in the
          MPAH.
          Critical intersections will be the subject of detailed engineering
          studies to identify the most effective type of improvements.
          The "City of Dana Point, General Plan Traffic Study" provides
          preliminary guidelines for the type of lane configurations
          appropriate at each location. (The intersections of the I-5
          southbound ramps at Camino de Estrella and Camino
          Capistrano at Stonehill are not located entirely within the City
          boundaries.)
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION PLAN

          plan for public transportation services is shown in Figure C-3.
          As indicated in the public transportation policies, the City
          should continue to coordinate with the Orange County Transit
          District (OCTD) to identify transit needs and improve service to
          meet these needs. The plan shown here will then be expanded
          as such service improvements are implemented.

         Potential transit routes are reviewed each year for ridership
         demand and operational feasibility if implemented. Average
         daily ridership levels, indicating the number of pedestrians
         traveling to or from Dana Point on buses, are approximately 400
         persons for line 1, 510 persons for line 85, 380 persons for line
         91, and approximately 10 persons for line 385.
BIKEWAY PLAN
         The Capistrano Bay Parks and Recreation District operates a
         coordinated system of bike trails and Figure C-4 shows the
         planned system. At completion, bike lanes will be included on
         most of the City's arterial streets and the following outlines the
         three categories of bikeways:
         ° Class I: A paved path that is separate from any motor
             vehicle travel lane;
         ° Class II: A restricted lane within the right-of-way of a paved
             roadway for the exclusive or semi-exclusive use of bicycles;
             and
         ° Class III: A bikeway that shares the street with motor
             vehicles or the sidewalk with pedestrians.
         The longest Class I bike trails each run for slightly over one mile
         and are located along San Juan Creek and Niguel Road. Overall,
         existing Class I bike trails in Dana Point total about 10.5 miles in
         each direction. The longest Class II bike trails run along Pacific
         Coast Highway and Del Obispo Street and are each almost three
         miles long.
         The biking network in Dana Point connects with other trails and
         paths in adjacent communities and throughout Orange County.
          Several new bike trails have been proposed, including a Class I
         bikeway through the open space between Street of the Golden
         Lantern and Sea Bright Drive north of Stonehill Drive and a
         Class III trail through Doheny State Beach Park.

         equestrian trail is located within Dana Point. It follows San Juan
         Creek for about one mile and continues into San

SCENIC HIGHWAYS

          scenic highway plan is shown in Figure C-6. Pacific Coast
          Highway is currently designated as a "type three" urbanscape
          corridor. This type of corridor is defined as:
               "...one that traverses an urban area with a defined
               visual corridor which offers a view of attractive and
               existing urban scenes, and which has recreational
               value for its visual relief as a result of nature or the
               designed efforts of man."
          The remaining routes are considered to be potential scenic
          corridors. As such, these routes would be required to conform
          with the Design Elements and modified to "the Urban Design
          Element Appendix A. Dana Point Landscape Corridors."
RAIL
          Passenger rail service is provided from two Amtrak depots in
          neighboring cities (San Juan Capistrano to the north and San
          Clemente to the south). Neither location is a major hub; both
          provide only platforms for selected arrivals and departures
          during the day. An analysis of the regional rail system between
          Los Angeles and San Diego (LOSSAN) is being undertaken by
          Caltrans, and stops in Dana Point are not currently proposed
          because of the close proximity to the two depots mentioned
          above.
NAVIGABLE WATERWAYS, PORTS AND HARBORS
                                                                             The
          Dana Point Harbor area consists of approximately 278 acres, 159
          of which are under water. Approximately 2,500 boat slips are
          currently provided in the marina and are not expected to
          increase. While the Harbor experiences a high level of activity,
          its utilization is considered to be within the available capacity.

        INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSERVATION AND
                          OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
The Conservation and Open Space Element addresses the preservation and
use of the City's important natural resources and open space areas. The
goals and policies in this Element build upon those in the other elements of
the General Plan, especially the Land Use Element and Urban Design Element.
 The City's Master Environmental Assessment and the Conservation and
Open Space Technical Report provide necessary background information and
are supporting documents for this Element.
The Conservation and Open Space Element also addresses the City's park
system. However, detailed planning and operation of parks and recreation
facilities is the responsibility of the Capistrano Bay Park and Recreation
District. The City has both public and private parks and facilities at the
community and neighborhood level. Opportunities exist to expand and
enhance the recreational components of the City. As a regional center for
tourist activities, the City also has a strong interest in providing open space,
cultural, and recreational opportunities for visitors to the area. By providing
expanded open space, cultural, and recreational opportunities, the City will
balance the long term economic viability of the visitor serving segment of its
economy with the livability of the City for its residents.
PURPOSE OF THE CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
                This Element meets State requirements concerning the Conser-
                vation and Open Space Elements as defined in Sections 65302d
                and 65302e of the Government Code. According to these re-
                quirements, the Conservation Element must contain goals and
                policies that further the protection and maintenance of the
                State's natural resources such as water, soils, wildlife, minerals,
                and other natural resources, and prevents their wasteful
                exploitation, degradation, and destruction.
                The Open Space Element must contain goals and policies con-
                cerned with managing all open space areas, including undevel-
                oped lands and outdoor recreation areas. Specifically, the Open
                Space Element includes open space that is used for the
                preservation of natural resources, for the managed production
                                                  CONSERVATION/OPEN SPACE ELEMENT

         of resources, for outdoor recreation, and that which is left
         undeveloped for public health and safety reasons.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
         There are a number of existing plans and programs which are
         directly applicable to the aims and objectives of this Element.
         These plans and programs were enacted through Federal, State,
         and local legislation and are administered by agencies or special
         districts that have been delegated with powers to enforce
         Federal, State and local laws. Federal laws that are concerned
         with the protection of significant cultural and natural resources
         include the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (as amended in
         1978), the Antiquities Act and the National Historic Preserva-
         tion Act of 1966 and the National Environmental Protection Act
         (NEPA).
         California Environmental Quality Act Law and Guidelines
         The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted
         by the State legislature in response to a public mandate that
         called for a thorough environmental analysis of those projects
         that might adversely affect the environment. The provisions of
         the law, review procedure, and any subsequent analysis are
         described in the CEQA Law and Guidelines as amended in 1986.
          CEQA will continue to be instrumental in ensuring that the
         impacts of all potentially significant projects are assessed by
         City officials (both appointed and elected) and the general
         public.
         California Fish and Game Regulations
         The California Fish and Game Code was adopted by the State
         legislature to protect the fish and wildlife resources of the State.
          Special permits are required for any lake or stream alterations,
         dredging or other activities that may affect fish and game
         habitat.
         California Coastal Act
         The 1976 California Coastal Act is intended to protect the
         natural and scenic qualities of the California coast. The City's
         General Plan, Zoning Ordinance and other implementing action
         will comprise the City's Local Coastal Program. The goals and
                                            CONSERVATION/OPEN SPACE ELEMENT

policies of the Conservation/Open Space Plan implement many
of the objectives and requirements of the California Coastal
Act.
City of Dana Point Land Use Element
The City's Land Use Element contains two land use designa-
tions that encompass open space land uses: Recreation/Open
Space and Community Facility. The Recreation/Open Space
land use designation encompasses most of the open space that
exists in the City including active and passive parkland and
natural open space. Distinctions between the active recre-
ation/open spaces and the passive recreation/open areas
including natural open space areas will be made in the Zoning
Ordinance and the Zoning Map in implementing the General
Plan. The Community Facility land use designation contains
more intensive recreational and/or cultural facilities such as
community or cultural facilities, museums, and art galleries.
Plans and programs that have contributed to the planning in
Dana Point related to conservation and open space include the
following documents:
The Master Plan of Parks and Recreation
This Plan was completed in 1990 by the Capistrano Bay Park
and Recreation District and is the official Master Plan of the
District. The parks and recreation facilities in Dana Point are
operated and maintained by the District. An update to the
Master Plan will be completed in 1991. This Plan, when
completed, will describe the master plan of public parkland for
the City including specific locations, standards, and design
guidelines. The Plan should be consistent with the goals and
policies contained in this Conservation and Open Space
Element relating to the provision of parkland.
County of Orange Master Plan of Local Parks
The County's Master Parks Plan provides goals, objectives and
policies and provides implementation programs for a compre-
hensive county-wide park plan. In conjunction with the Coun-
ty's Local Park Code, specific criteria are intended to provide an
adequate supply of usable county parkland. This Plan provides
a regional park planning context for the Dana Point
Conservation/Open Space Element.

SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
          In addition to the Introduction, the Conservation and Open
          Space Element includes two sections: Conservation Goals and
          Policies and Conservation and Open Space Plan. Conservation
          and Open Space Goals and Policies identify goals and support-
          ing policies addressing open space resources in the City. The
          Conservation and Open Space Plan is concerned with
          protecting and enhancing natural and open space resources.
          The Plan is divided into two sections: Conservation and Open
          Space. The Conservation Section contains policies for the
          preservation and utilization of Dana Point's natural resources.
          The Open Space section focuses on the City's existing and
          future parkland and the policies for the enhancement and
          maintenance of its parkland and recreational facilities.

                 CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
                          GOALS AND POLICIES
A substantial portion of the City's natural open space and biological habitat
has been replaced with urban development. However, there are significant
portions of the community that remain in a natural state. These areas include
the Headlands, portions of Monarch Beach, and the Salt Creek and San Juan
Creek Basins. Although portions of these areas are planned to be developed
in the future, the conservation of open space and the natural landforms can
help to preserve the character of the area. The future development of the
areas should respect these natural features of the community.
The goals and supporting policies included in this Element address specific
issues and opportunities to conserve the City's remaining sensitive lands and
to enhance the open space within the City.
CONSERVATION AND PROTECTION OF WATER RESOURCES
               Although the City of Dana Point has a high percentage of land
               that has been developed, areas for future revitalization may
               have a significant effect on the water resources of the communi-
               ty. Therefore, it is essential to protect the existing drainage
               courses in as natural condition as possible. The depletion or
               pollution of groundwater resources is a concern. Water
               conservation measures should be adopted by the City to
               effectively reclaim water and encourage water conservation
               throughout the development process.
               GOAL 1: Conserve and protect surface water, groundwater
               and imported water resources.
               Policy 1.1: Retain, protect and enhance local drainage courses,
               channels, and creeks in their natural condition, where feasible
               and desirable, in order to maximize their natural hydrologic
               functioning so as to minimize adverse impacts from polluted
               storm water run-off. (Coastal Act/30231)
               Policy 1.2: Protect groundwater resources from depletion and
                                                 CONSERVATION/OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
                                                                  6                AU

sources of pollution.
Policy 1.3: Conserve imported water by providing water
conservation techniques, and using reclaimed water, water
conserving appliances, and drought-resistant landscaping
when feasible.
Policy 1.4: Protect water quality by seeking strict quality
standards and enforcement with regard to water imported into
the County, and the preservation of the quality of water in the
groundwater basin, streams, estuaries, and the ocean. (Coastal
Act/30231)
Policy 1.5: Retain, maintain, protect, and enhance existing
riparian habitat adjacent to drainage courses, channels, and
creeks through methods such as, but not limited to, the
establishment of buffer areas adjacent to such habitats.
(Coastal Act/30231)
Policy 1.6: Channelizations, dams, or other substantial
alterations of rivers and streams shall incorporate the best
mitigation measures feasible to mitigate the loss of any riparian
habitat and any downstream impacts, and shall be limited to (1)
necessary water supply projects, (2) flood control projects
where no other method for protecting existing structures in the
floodplain is feasible and where such protection is necessary
for public safety or to protect existing development, or (3)
developments where the primary function is the improvement of
fish and wildlife habitat. (Coastal Act/30236)
Policy 1.7: Maintain and, where feasible, restore the
biological productivity and the quality of coastal waters, creeks,
and groundwater, appropriate to maintain optimum populations
of marine organisms and to protect human health. Measures
including, but not limited to, minimizing the adverse effects of
waste water discharges, controlling runoff, preventing the
depletion of ground water supplies, preventing substantial
interference with surface water flow, maintaining vegetation
buffer areas protecting riparian habitats, minimizing alteration of
natural streams, and street sweeping, shall be encouraged.
(Coastal Act/30231)
Policy 1.8: Coordinate with the appropriate Regional Water
Quality Control Board, the County of Orange and other
agencies and organizations in the implementation of the
                                    CONSERVATION/OPEN SPACE ELEMENT

CONSERVATION OF SIGNIFICANT NATURAL FEATURES
         The natural features in the Dana Point area have helped to
         create the desirable character of the area. Topographical
         features such as the Headlands, Salt Creek and the San Juan
         Creek watershed, the bluffs, the inland hills, and the beachfront
         should be protected from insensitive development. Public
         views should be conserved and the natural vegetation retained
         as much as possible. The beach areas and bluff area have
         potential for excessive erosion if not protected.
         GOAL 2: Conserve significant topographical features, impor-
         tant watershed areas, resources, soils and beaches.
         Policy 2.1: Place restrictions on the development of floodplain
         areas, beaches, sea cliffs, ecologically sensitive areas and
         potentially hazardous areas. (Coastal Act/30235, 30236, 30240,
         30253)
         Policy 2.2: Site and architectural design shall respond to the
         natural landform whenever possible to minimize grading and
         visual impact. (Coastal Act/30250)
         Policy 2.3: Control erosion during and following construction
         through proper grading techniques, vegetation replanting, and
         the installation of proper drainage, and erosion control improve-
         ments. (Coastal Act/30243)
         Policy 2.4: Require the practice of proper soil management
         techniques to reduce erosion, sedimentation, and other soil-
         related problems. (Coastal Act/30243)
         Policy 2.5: Lessen beach erosion by minimizing any natural
         changes or man-caused activities which would reduce the
         replenishment of sand to the beaches. (Coastal Act/30235)
         Policy 2.6: Encourage public acquisition of significant land
         resources for open space when funds or opportunities are
         available. (Coastal Act/30240)
                                            CONSERVATION/OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
                                                             8                AU

Policy 2.7: Require geotechnical studies for developments that
are proposed for steep slopes (4:1 or steeper), on or adjacent to
coastal or inland blufftops, and where geological instability may
be suspected. (Coastal Act/30253)
Policy 2.8: Minimize risks to life and property, and preserve the
natural environment, by siting and clustering new development
away from areas which have physical constraints associated
with steep topography and unstable slopes; and where such
areas are designated as Recreation/Open Space or include
bluffs, beaches, or wetlands, exclude such areas from the
calculation of net acreage available for determining
development intensity or density potential. (Coastal Act/30233,
30253)

CONSERVATION OF BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
        The existing development and urbanization of Dana Point has
        nearly eliminated sizable expanses of undisturbed native
        vegetation. The remaining vegetation includes small isolated
        pockets of chaparral and coastal sage scrub. The shoreline
        areas from north of Dana Point Harbor and extending along
        Doheny State Beach provide a habitat for a wide variety of
        marine animals and plants. These areas have been designated
        by the State of California as Marine Life Refuges. Although
        there are limited quantities of undisturbed vegetation several
        sensitive species have been observed with the City including
        the California Black Tailed Gnatcatcher, the Monarch Butterfly,
        and the Turkish Ruggish (plant).
        GOAL 3: Conserve significant natural plant and animal
        communities.
        Policy 3.1: Environmentally sensitive habitat areas, including
        important plant communities, wildlife habitats, marine refuge
        areas, riparian areas, wildlife movement corridors, wetlands, and
        significant tree stands, such as those generally depicted on
        Figure COS-1, shall be preserved. Development in areas
        adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall be
        sited and designed to prevent impacts which would
        significantly degrade those areas through such methods as, the
        practice of creative site planning, revegetation, and open space
        easement/dedications, and shall be compatible with the
        continuance of those habitat areas. A definitive determination
        of the existence of environmentally sensitive habitat areas on a
        specific site shall be made through the coastal development

CONSERVATION OF ENERGY RESOURCES
         As with many other communities, Dana Point is facing in-
         creased energy costs, both economically and environmentally.
         These increased costs require expansion into renewable energy
         sources to meet a portion of the City's needs. These renewable
         sources include solar, wind, and thermal resources. The City
         should consider requirements to include solar energy systems
         in new developments and retrofit systems to offset increasing
         energy demands. Development standards can also provide for
         efficient solar use by the siting and the design of buildings.
         GOAL 4: Conserve energy resources through use of available
         technology and conservation practices.
         Policy 4.1: Encourage innovative site and building designs,
         and orientation techniques which minimize energy use by
         taking advantage of sun/shade patterns, prevailing winds,
         landscaping, and building materials.
         Policy 4.2: Maintain local legislation to establish, update and
         implement energy performance building code requirements
         established under State Title 24 Energy Regulations. (Coastal
         Act/30250)

REDUCTION OF AIR POLLUTION
         Air Pollution is a major problem in the rapidly growing areas of
         Orange County. Regional efforts to control air pollution should
         be supported by the City. Through effective land use and
         circulation planning, air pollution can be reduced. The City can
         also reduce vehicular travel by encouraging alternative modes
         of circulation by providing pedestrian, bicycle and transit
         routes serving the entire City.
         GOAL 5: Reduce air pollution through land use, trans-
         portation and energy use planning.
         Policy 5.1: Design safe and efficient vehicular access to streets
         to ensure efficient vehicular ingress and egress. (Coastal
         Act/30252)
         Policy 5.2: Locate multiple family developments close to
         commercial areas to encourage pedestrian rather than vehicular
         travel.
         Policy 5.3: Encourage neighborhood parks close to concentra-
         tions of residents to encourage pedestrian travel to public
         recreation facilities.
         Policy 5.4: Provide commercial areas that are conducive to
         pedestrian and bicycle circulation.
         Policy 5.5: Actively participate in regional discussions regard-
         ing new regional airport facilities and analyze and evaluate
         potential impacts on the City.
         Policy 5.6:    Encourage bicycle/trail systems to reduce air
         pollution.
         Policy 5.7: Consider the development of shuttle systems, train
         or transit facilities, to help reduce vehicular trips and air
         pollution.

                      THE CONSERVATION PLAN
The Conservation Plan describes the approach to be used in implementing
the Conservation/Open Space Element goals and policies. The Conservation
Plan identifies those undeveloped lands that contain open space for the
preservation of natural resources, open space for the managed production of
resources, and open space for public health and safety. The undeveloped
portions of Dana Point include primarily the Headlands area, parcels in the
Monarch Beach area and areas near the San Juan Creek Channel. Several
exiting canyon areas have been developed and/or designated as private
recreation areas. The Conservation Element's goals and policies were
formulated in order to effectively preserve portions of these remaining areas
as open space opportunities for the City.
CONSERVATION/OPEN SPACE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF
NATURAL RESOURCES
              The most significant natural resources in Dana Point include the
              Pacific Ocean, land with open space potential, lands with
              significant biological resources, water resources, significant
              landforms, and those sites or structures which have historical,
              archaeological or paleontological significance. The Headlands
              is the largest remaining undeveloped area within the City. This
              area contains coastal sage scrub vegetation which supports a
              variety of animal species. The Pacific Ocean and shoreline
              provides important marine habitats for many species. Certain
              sections of the City's coast have been designated by the
              California Department of Fish and Game as three separate but
              contiguous marine life refuges. The other area of natural
              resource open space includes San Juan Creek and Salt Creek
              and the beaches and bluff areas along the coast.
              These important natural resource areas are shown on Figure
              COS-1. Other areas of natural resource open space include San
              Juan Creek and Salt Creek and the beaches and bluff areas
              along the coast.

CONSERVATION/OPEN SPACE USED FOR THE MANAGED
PRODUCTION OF RESOURCES
          Open Space areas for the managed production of resources
          with regard to this section include agricultural lands, areas of
          economic importance for the production of food or fiber, and
          areas containing major mineral deposits.
          The City of Dana Point is a predominantly residential
          community and contains limited undeveloped land. None of
          this undeveloped land is currently used for commercial
          agriculture, and it is unlikely that any will be used in the future.
          No mineral resources have been identified within the City of
          Dana Point. However, sand and gravel resources are located in
          San Juan Creek north of the City. The extraction of these
          resources may affect the preservation of the City's and region's
          beaches. Offshore oil drilling could have a significant effect on
          the water resources and beaches in the City.
          The conservation of open space areas for the managed produc-
          tion of resources does not directly affect lands within the City
          of Dana Point. However, activities relating to mineral extrac-
          tions and offshore drilling in areas outside the City limits could
          have a substantial effect on the open space resources within
          the City.
CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH
AND SAFETY
          Dana Point must protect the public health and safety of the
          community. This involves the identification of areas that pose
          a potential threat to health and safety; along with the imple-
          mentation of proper planning techniques to minimize potential
          threats to health and safety. Figure COS-2 depicts the areas in
          the community which require special planning considerations to
          avoid potential hazards. These areas include the floodplain
          zones along the San Juan Creek and Salt Creek as well as along
          the coastal areas. In addition, areas along the coast that may
          have potential for coastal erosion are also identified. Specific
          public safety recommendations and emergency preparedness
          procedures are addressed in the Public Safety Element of the
          General Plan.

CONSERVATION MEASURES
         To protect and conserve sensitive lands that occur within the
         City, the following measures will be utilized:
         ° Excavation or grading shall not be permitted unless site
            specific geologic/soils study indicates no safety problems
            will result from such grading.
         ° Archaeological and biological surveys shall be required for
            any development projects on lands identified in this Element
            as potentially paleontologically, historically or biologically
            sensitive. Mitigation measures shall be developed and
            implemented to mitigate any significant impacts.
         The following techniques may be used to acquire or dedicate
         land for open space purposes:
         Open Space Easements - pursuant to the Open Space Easement
         Act of 1974 (Government Code Section 51070 et seq.).
         Conservation Easements - pursuant to the Conservation Ease-
         ment Act (Civil Code Sections 815-816).

                           THE OPEN SPACE PLAN
The Open Space Plan describes the approach to be used in implementing the
Conservation/Open Space Element goals and policies. The open space in
Dana Point plays an important part in the lives of Dana Point residents. Dana
Point has been developed with several open space amenities including local,
County and State parks, public and private recreational facilities, pedestrian
and bicycle trails, equestrian trails and other public open spaces. Opportuni-
ties exist to provide strong linkages between these open space resources to
form a contiguous system of open space.
RELATION TO LAND USE ELEMENT
               The City's Land Use Plan places open space, parkland and
               recreational facilities into the two designations of
               Recreation/Open Space and Community Facility. The following
               is a description of each of these land use designations.
               Recreation/Open Space
               The Recreation/Open Space designation includes both public
               and private recreational uses necessary to meet the active and
               passive recreational needs of area residents and visitors.
               Recreational activities include golf courses/driving ranges,
               community recreational facilities, public parklands and indoor
               and outdoor sports/athletic facilities. Recreation uses include
               museums, galleries, outdoor theater, designated open space
               and similar uses.
               Community Facility
               The Community Facility designation includes a wide range of
               public and private uses distributed throughout the community
               such as schools, churches, child care centers, transportation
               facilities, government offices and facilities, public utilities,
               libraries, museums, art galleries, community theaters, hospitals
               and cultural and recreational activities. In addition, open space
               and recreation uses can be accommodated in the other land use
               designation including the Harbor Marine and Transportation
               Corridor Designations.

PARK CLASSIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS
         The Open Space Plan establishes a classification system that
         applies to all existing and future park and recreation facilities in
         the City. The existing parks and recreational facilities are listed
         on Table COS-3. Specific standards, based upon existing
         parkland, have been developed for each category of park or
         recreation area. Proposed park and recreation facilities are listed
         on Table COS-4.
         The following is a breakdown of the parkland classification
         system in Dana Point. Parkland is categorized into mini-parks,
         neighborhood parks, community parks, open space linkages,
         County and State parks and school playgrounds.
         Mini-Parks
         Mini-parks are small, passive local parks, generally less than
         one acre in size. Many of the small parks overlooking Dana
         Point Harbor can be classified as mini-parks. Most mini-parks
         are established in higher density areas as a substitute for
         backyards. Size and location are usually determined by the
         availability of vacant land. These parks may serve any age
         group, depending on the characteristics of the neighborhood.
         They usually feature play apparatus, a paved area for wheeled
         toys, benches, and landscape treatment. They may also feature
         children's play areas, quiet game areas, and some sports
         activities such as multi-purpose courts, if space allows. Some
         mini-parks are natural areas with minimal improvements (e.g.,
         benches)       which     safeguard      identified     archaeologi-
         cal/paleontological sites or other natural resources, or serve as
         viewpoints. As the City approaches build-out, it becomes more
         important to take advantage of opportunities available to the
         City for the establishment of park space. Mini-parks could be
         established in areas that lack conveniently accessible parkland.

  The Park and Recreation areas and features are based upon preliminary surveys and studies. Final determinations will
be made by the City and/or the Capistrano Bay park and Recreation District.

Neighborhood Parks
A neighborhood park is any general use local park developed
to serve the active recreation needs of a particular neighbor-
hood within the City. The size of a neighborhood park depends
on the population within its service area and the extent of
desired amenities. Typically, neighborhood parks have a
maximum service radius of one-half mile to be within walking or
cycling distance of park patrons. The neighborhood parks in
Dana Point feature such amenities as landscaping, children's
play areas, active ball fields, multi-purpose play fields, game
courts, open turf areas and lighting for night use. In some
cases, the neighborhood parks provide off-street parking and
rest rooms. Most of the parks in Dana Point are categorized as
neighborhood parks serving individual neighborhoods.
Preferably, a neighborhood park should be located adjoining an
elementary school and near the center of a defined
neighborhood so that it can best serve the local pedestrian
user.
Community Parks
The community park is typically designed to meet the active
recreational needs of several neighborhoods. These parks are
intended to serve pedestrian and motorists within a radius of up
to three miles. They contain facilities which require more space
than neighborhood parks and which may include: extensive
landscaping; nature areas; multi-purpose playfields for softball,
baseball, soccer and football; court sport facilities for basket-
ball, racquetball/handball and tennis; swimming pools; and
community centers with adequate off-street parking. Communi-
ty parks provide the greatest economy of scale in terms of
active and passive recreation benefit versus cost of
maintenance and operation.
Open Space Linkages
Open space linkages are usually linear strips of open space
along lands such as easements, floodplains, and canyons.
These linkages form trails and open space systems that connect
parkland or neighborhoods. Pedestrian, bicycle, and equestrian
trails are usually located along the open space linkages. Natural
open space along hilltops, within canyons, or along riparian
corridors form excellent linkages to other open space. Continu-
ation of the blufftop trail represents an Open Space Linkage
that can provide access to scenic vistas and provide pedestrian

connections between lookouts and park areas.
County Parks and Facilities
The County of Orange owns and maintains several regional
recreational facilities in the City of Dana Point. Policy for the
development, maintenance and improvement of these parks is
provided by the Orange County Recreation Element, which
includes a Master Plan for regional recreational facilities in the
County.
County parks and recreational areas in the City include two
beach areas, Salt Creek Beach Park and Capistrano Beach
County Park. Dana Point Harbor, created in the late 1960s and
early 1970s, is also managed by the County, as are the nine-acre
Bluff Top Park, near the Ritz-Carlton Resort, and the 16-acre
Lantern Bay Park overlooking Dana Point Harbor.
State Recreation Areas
Doheny Beach State Park (62 acres) extends along the beach
from Del Obispo Street southeast to Capistrano Beach County
park. Doheny Beach is the only park in Dana Point that permits
overnight camping with tents and trailers.
School Playgrounds
Three school playgrounds under the jurisdiction of the
Capistrano Unified School District are within the City of Dana
Point and open to the public after school hours. Organized
sports leagues such as those for baseball, soccer and football
utilize ballfields through a permit process with the School
District. The playgrounds are: Dana Hills High School (16.4
acres), Palisades Elementary School (6.8 acres) and Richard
Henry Dana School (3.9 acres). The high school offers the most
facilities including handball courts, a community pool,
volleyball courts and three softball fields.
Other Parks and Facilities
The City of Dana Point includes a variety of other recreational
facilities open to the general public. These include: the Marine
Studies Institute, which offers sailing from Dana Point Harbor;
the Dana Hills Tennis Center with six courts; and the Links at
Monarch Beach 18-hole golf course.             Several residential
developments also include their own tennis courts and swim-

ming pools, which are available only to residents and guests.
Biking/Hiking Trails
The Capistrano Bay Park and Recreation District operates a
coordinated system of trails, including bikeways, equestrian
trails and hiking trails. The District's trails system is described
in the District Master Plan which is updated annually and
constitutes the most current source of trail information. Figure
COS-3 shows the location of these trails. The one existing
hiking trail in Dana Point extends approximately one mile
through Salt Creek Beach Park.
Bikeways comprise the most extensive part of the District's trail
network. There are three categories of bikeways:
° Class I: a paved path that is separate from any motor vehicle
   travel lane;
° Class II: a restricted lane within the right of way of a paved
   roadway for the exclusive or semi-exclusive use of bicycles;
   and
° Class III: a bikeway that shares the street with motor
   vehicles or the sidewalk with pedestrians.
The biking network in Dana Point connects with other trails and
paths in adjacent communities and throughout Orange County.
 Several new bike trails and paths have been proposed.
Other Recreational Facilities
In addition to its beaches, parks, and trails, Dana Point includes
many private recreational facilities, such as those identified in
Figure COS-3 and Table COS-3. While some private facilities
(e.g., private parks, tennis courts, swimming pools) are available
only to the residents of the general particular complex in which
they are located, others are available to the public for a fee (e.g.,
The Links at Monarch Beach).
In addition, the City offers resort accommodations for tourists.
Therefore, the City's open space and recreational opportunities
must be planned not only for Dana Point residents, but also for
regional and even international visitors and tourists.

FUTURE PARK SITE SELECTION STANDARDS
         The State of California Planning and Zoning Law and the
         Subdivision Map Act Code Section 66477 (The Quimby Act)
         indicate that the legislative body of a City or County, may, by
         Ordinance, require the dedication of land, the payment of fees
         in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, for park and recre-
         ational purposes as a condition to the approval for a final tract
         map or parcel map. In cases where such dedication/fees have
         not been obtained for particular lots through a map, they may
         be imposed at the time that building permits are issued. Among
         other requirements, the following conditions must be met:
         ° The Ordinance must include definite standards for determin-
            ing the proportion of a subdivision to be dedicated and the
            amount of any fee to be paid in lieu thereof; and
         ° The legislative body has adopted a General Plan containing a
            Recreation Element, and any proposed park and recreational
            facilities are in accordance with definite principles and
            standards contained therein.
         In conformance with this statute, the City of Dana Point
         Conservation and Open Space Element includes standards
         determining land requirements for future park sites. The
         standards identified in Table COS-5 and in the following text
         should be utilized in selecting sites for parks and should serve
         as guidelines governing the acceptance of land dedicated to the
         City. Future acquisition should focus on acquiring land for
         neighborhood and community parks as well as obtaining
         easements and property for trails.
         Figure COS-4 illustrates the open space opportunities that exist
         within Dana Point. These opportunities, combined with the
         City's existing recreational setting, define the City's overall
         Open Space Plan. The opportunities for additional open space
         and recreation in the City relate to the linkage of existing
         parkland to establish an open space system. The Dana Point
         Open Space Diagram is shown in Figure COS-6. The comple-
         tion of the City's Open Space Plan may involve the acquisition
         and development of new parkland based on the objectives
         discussed below.

Neighborhood Parks
Many of the facilities located within neighborhood parks are
associated with active recreation. All neighborhood parks
should contain some area for active recreation depending on
the size of the park.
Neighborhood park size criteria should conform to the District's
Master Parks Plan. The park site should contain consolidated
parcels with appropriate area devoted to active recreation such
as ball fields, court sports, tot lots, picnic facilities, swimming
pools, community buildings, and on-site parking.
Neighborhood parks should be located near the center of a
neighborhood unit and, if possible, adjoining an elementary
school. Easy access should be provided to pedestrians, bicy-
clists, and maintenance and public safety vehicles. The
neighborhood park should serve an area approximately within a
1/2 mile radius. A neighborhood park should not be separated
from its user population by major highways, railroads, or
untraversable obstacles. A neighborhood park should be
situated adjacent to or near greenbelts, open space linkages, or
other community open space/recreation facilities to facilitate an
open space system throughout the City.
Community Parks
Community parks are intended to serve an approximate radius
of one (1) to three (3) miles. Individual community parks should
meet the size criteria outlined in the District's Master Parks Plan.
 No specific shape is required for community parks as they are
intended to incorporate both active recreational facilities and
passive open space in the form of unique physical features
such as a ridgeline. Community parks should encompass
pedestrian and bicycle paths and natural open space and may
be partially linear in shape.
Community parks should contribute to the City's open space
system by connecting to neighborhood parks through open
space linkages or connecting to other recreational facilities.
They should be located at or near the intersection of an arterial
near the center of their service area. Community parks should
contain space for active recreational facilities such as ballfields,
court sports, and play areas as well as on-site parking, restroo-
ms, and picnic areas. Proposed parks and recreation facilities
are shown in the Open Space Diagram, Figure COS-6.

Open Space Linkages
The City recognizes the following as future open space linkages
on its Open Space and Walkways/Bike/Trail Opportunities Map
as shown on Figure COS-4.
Future Joint School/Recreation Agreements
Opportunities exist to establish future school/recreation joint
use agreements with the school districts serving the City. The
City should consider agreements with these schools whenever
feasible to enter into a joint school/recreation use and
maintenance program.
Trail System
A number of policies included in this Element are concerned
with the expansion of the City-wide system of hiking and biking
trails. Precise development standards for the various types of
trails are difficult to establish since trail width and gradient will
depend on topography, surface features, and availability of an
easement. The City's trail system includes pedestrian and bike
trails within open space corridors and along regional trails
which link to local and regional parkland. The bikeways located
along the City's street system are addressed in the City's
Circulation Element.
The Coastal Bluff Trail
The Coastal Bluff Trail is intended to provide a linkage from the
Monarch Beach Area through the Headlands and the Lantern
Bay area to the Doheny State Park Area. This walkway and trail
system will link the various lookout points and parks. While in
certain areas the existing residential and commercial
development precludes a continuous bluff edge easement, the
trail system could continue on local streets around those
existing developments. In the future as areas are redeveloped,
reservations should be considered for the Blufftop Trail.
Where possible, the missing links of the Coastal Bluff Trail
between the Headlands and Doheny State Beach should be
completed. Since existing single family homes prohibit a
continuous bluff edge easement between The Streets of the
Blue and Amber Lanterns and between Streets of the Violet and
Golden Lantern, pedestrian improvements (street trees,

         benches, bike lanes, and graphic markers) should be developed
         along Santa Clara Avenue.
         Scenic Resources
         The scenic resources in Dana Point are a major asset of the
         community. In the western portion of the City, including
         Monarch Beach, high points provide sweeping views of the
         southern California coast and Catalina Island while the lower
         elevations provide whitewater views of the shoreline. In the
         central portion of the City, including the "Headlands", there are
         views and panoramas of the Pacific Ocean, the Dana Point
         harbor, distant views as far as the Palos Verdes Peninsula to the
         north, La Jolla to the south and Catalina Island to the west, and
         inland views to the foothills and valleys. In the Capistrano
         Beach area of the City the blufftops offer panoramic views of
         the coastline.
         A unique sequence of parks and lookouts on the coastal terrace
         offer outstanding views of the ocean. These include the Pine
         Bluffs Park, Gazebo Park, Leyton Park, Lantern Bay Park,
         Heritage Park, Blue Lantern Lookout Point, and Salt Creek
         Beach Park.
         As new development is considered public views should be
         preserved as much as possible. Consideration should be given
         to protecting public views along the ridge lines, views toward
         the inland mountains and along scenic transportation corridors.
          Figure COS-5 conceptually identifies significant public scenic
         view resources in Dana Point. Because of the unique character
         and the environmental setting of the City consideration of
         scenic resource opportunities should be a key factor in
         development and revitalization decisions.
GENERAL PLAN POLICIES AND FUTURE RECREATION FACILITIES
         The Land Use Element describes a land use designation that is
         applicable for identifying areas of the City where existing and
         future parks, trails, and other recreational facilities are or may be
         located. Other sites adjacent to these designated areas may be
         purchased or acquired as development exactions for more
         intensive recreational uses when land is made available. Figure
         COS-6 includes those areas designated on the Land Use Plan

By comparing projected build-out for the City with the
standards and criteria of this Element, it is possible to identify
those areas which will be adequately served by existing park
facilities and those for which new parks will be needed. As part
of its implementation program for this Element, the Capistrano
Bay Park and Recreation District will develop a Master Parks
Plan showing the approximate number and location of
additional park facilities, by category, according to the specific
criteria outlined in the Master Parks Plan and this Element. This
information will be used as a reference tool, along with the
above criteria, for planning the acquisition and siting of park
facilities.

                             INTRODUCTION TO
           THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
This Economic Development Element of the General Plan is intended to guide
economic development planning and initiatives. This Element is characterized under
State planning law as an optional Element.
PURPOSE OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
                The purpose of this Economic Development Element (EDE) is to
                formulate an Economic Development Plan which can guide and shape
                important elements of Dana Point's economy, consistent with other
                Elements of the General Plan. The formulation of the economic
                development plan was based upon an extensive analysis of current
                development conditions, opportunities and constraints in Dana Point.
                This Element identifies the economic factors affecting the City,
                presents the economic development goals and policies, and formulates
                the Economic Development Plan.
ECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECTING THE CITY
                The economic development goals, policies and plan reflect the City's
                response to current and future economic conditions as described the
                Economic Development Technical Report. The following items
                summarize the economic factors which most affect the City's economic
                development.
                Characteristics of the Local Economy
                °   The subregional competitive strength of Dana Point is due to its
                    coastal location and recreational resources. If well managed, these
                    permanent features can be relied upon to provide continued long
                    term development opportunities.
                °   Higher than average income households in Dana Point are a
                    significant source of demand for local goods and services.
                    However, an estimated 42% of all Dana Point household retail
                                                        ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
                                            1                               JULY 9, 1991

   expenditures occur outside the City.
°  Visitors to Dana Point are another important source of demand for
   local goods and services. Lodgings, restaurants and retail stores
   which serve these visitors provide the largest share of jobs in the
   City.
Long Term Development Potential
°  Current household retail expenditure leakage can support an
   estimated 485,000 square feet of additional retail development in
   the City. Additional retail development may also be stimulated by
   attracting visitor serving specialty stores and commercial
   recreational businesses.
°  Recreational visitors to Dana Point will continue to provide the
   largest source of growth of lodging guests, particularly for luxury
   destination hotels which can best use key undeveloped sites in the
   City.
°  Long term demand for office development is limited to smaller
   professional offices serving local residents and businesses.
°  Long term demand for industrial development is limited to mainly
   marine-oriented firms providing repair and equipment services to
   visiting and resident boat owners.
Development Opportunities and Constraints
°  There are only two significant undeveloped parcels and several
   smaller parcels in the City which may accommodate new
   commercial development. Given the long term development
   potential for Dana Point, it is clear that the City will need to
   redevelop some existing commercial areas to accommodate any
   significant portion of the market supportable commercial
   development potential.
°  The City may select from a number of potential non-residential
   uses identified for the Monarch Beach site, the Headlands site, the
   Couplet area, and the Doheny Village area depending upon site
   availability and long term fiscal needs.
°  Dana Point is constrained by the availability of sites to
   accommodate future non-residential land use.            Besides the
   Monarch Beach and Headlands sites, any significant amount of
                                        ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
                            2                                JULY 9, 1991

              non-residential development will require revitalization, a slow and
              incremental process for the newly incorporated City to establish,
              prepare projects, and induce revitalization.
          Economic Development Issues
          °   Since strong market conditions enable Dana Point to select the
              kinds of non-residential uses to allow in the City, the principal
              issue associated with economic development is one of identifying
              which non-residential land uses are most beneficial to the City and
              where they can be accommodated.
          °   How much commercial development to allow can be based upon an
              assessment of the City's long term fiscal needs, the need to provide
              greater local employment opportunities and the need to provide
              residents with convenient retail goods and services.
          °   The amount and type of new visitor serving commercial
              development will need to balance the fiscal and employment
              requirements of the City with the visitor impacts upon the local
              quality of life for residents.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
ELEMENT
          The Economic Development Element is intended as a dynamic
          component of the General Plan. The Element is directed at a wide
          range of economic issues that do not all need to be dealt with
          simultaneously, but at various stages of the community's evolution and
          even on a repetitive basis. Therefore, the economic goals and policies
          are of such general nature as to encompass the directed scope of
          specific initiatives described in the Economic Development Plan,
          whenever and as often as they must be undertaken.
          The City intends to achieve three basic objectives as a result of stated
          economic development goals, application of policies, and
          implementation of program initiatives:
          1) Promote balanced development of resident serving and visitor
              serving commercial uses to ensure sound fiscal health, diverse
              employment opportunities and a vital local economy.

2) Actively involve the business community to assist in shaping and
   implementing economic development initiatives.

   cultural, and social benefits for the City, its residents, and guests.

                           4                                    JULY 9, 1991
                ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
                            GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of this Element address the broad range of long-term economic
development issues faced by Dana Point. These goals and policies reflect the
community's desired response to economic development issues that will be
encountered over the planning period. The following goals and policies focus on
achieving and maintaining a fiscally sound economic base, increasing local job
opportunities, and capitalizing on market opportunities with significant economic
potential for the City.
BALANCED EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING
                Balanced economic development requires that there are both new
                employment opportunities and a local labor force to fill the jobs.
                Imbalances between employment and housing can create excessive
                commuting patterns as workers from adjacent communities fill local
                jobs or local workers commute to jobs outside Dana Point. Lack of an
                adequate labor force can also discourage firms from moving into worker
                scarce areas. Consequently, economic development of Dana Point
                needs to provide a balance between new jobs and suitable housing for a
                localized labor force.
                The high cost of housing in Dana Point has limited the supply of
                affordable housing. This lack of affordable housing has limited the
                number of workers who can be employed locally, mainly in service
                related jobs. Therefore, to help avoid increased commuting and
                provide a more balanced labor force, the City can seek to support job
                growth and affordable housing growth.
                GOAL 1: Encourage a balance between housing and employment
                opportunities.
                Policy 1.1: Implement the goals and policies of the Housing Element
                of the General Plan.
                Policy 1.2: Develop and implement short- and long-range programs to
                stimulate jobs and economic growth.
                Policy 1.3: Develop long-term projections of growth in industrial and
                service-related employment.

                                            5                     (GPA95-02(c)/LCPA95-08)
          Policy 1.4: Encourage the development of housing opportunities in
          targeted areas of the City.
BUSINESS PROMOTION
          Economic development is dependent upon the retention, attraction and
          expansion of business firms. Business growth in Dana Point can be
          stimulated and guided by creating more local opportunities for
          business development. Until now, all business promotion has been
          undertaken privately. As an incorporated city, Dana Point can now
          participate in promoting local businesses by making available a more
          comprehensive public/private approach to promote the kinds of
          businesses that are most beneficial to the community. Jointly promot-
          ing business development can bring greater public and private
          resources to bear and increase the opportunities to expand the
          economic base of the community.
          GOAL 2: Develop a strategy for promoting the types of
          businesses and industries desired by the community.
          Policy 2.1: Develop the physical design guidelines necessary to
          attract the desired types of business in specific locations.
          Policy 2.2: Coordinate local programs with regional programs for
          economic development.
          Policy 2.3: Consider the use of incentives to assist businesses which
          provide important benefits and contributions to the local economy.
          Policy 2.4: Pursue methods to promote economic development
          opportunities beneficial to the City of Dana Point.
          Policy 2.5: Establish revitalization project areas as needed by the
          City.
          Policy 2.6:       Promote a synergistic business environment by
          encouraging new businesses to locate where they can beneficially
          support adjacent businesses and discouraging new businesses that
          would be detrimental to the business environment.
          Policy 2.7: Assure that local amenities and open spaces are
          maintained and expanded in order to assist and attract new businesses
          and promote economic vitality.
                                                   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT

           Policy 2.8: The City will endorse and support the creation of a good
           business oriented infrastructure.
           Policy 2.9: Encourage new business to locate in Dana Point.
FISCAL STRENGTH AND STABILITY
           Municipal revenues are a function of the success, vibrancy and
           development of business enterprises within the City. Since the City
           has a choice among alternative market supportable commercial uses, it
           can select to promote those uses which can help provide greater fiscal
           strength and stability to the City. Consequently, it will be important
           to assess what amount of municipal revenues are needed in order to
           help coordinate local fiscal needs with desired commercial develop-
           ment.
           GOAL 3: Provide for the long term fiscal viability of the City.
           Policy 3.1: Ensure that the City has substantial fiscal surplus to
           assure sufficient financial resources during slow economic periods
           when revenue generation may be low.
           Policy 3.2: Analyze net fiscal impacts of non-residential land use
           types proposed for development.
           Policy 3.3: Identify the types of industrial, office and commercial
           uses that are desired by the community and assess the market demand
           for those types of uses.
           Policy 3.4: Continue with existing plans for revitalization within areas
           of the community where revitalization is warranted.
           Policy 3.5: Promote conference and visitor activities to ensure the
           long term viability of this major revenue generator. (Coastal
           Act/30213)

                                       7                    (GPA95-02(c)/LCPA95-08)
MEET LOCAL RETAIL NEEDS
          Expenditure patterns for Dana Point were analyzed in the Technical
          Report and show a 42% retail sales leakage to stores outside of the
          City. This leakage indicates an absence of certain kinds of stores in
          Dana Point which are available outside of the City. This leakage can
          be reduced by promoting retail goods and services that are not
          currently available in the City including automobiles, general
          merchandise and food stores. Promoting new retail stores helps the
          City in many ways. New stores make shopping more convenient for
          residents by eliminating the need to drive outside the City to purchase
          identical items. New stores also generate greater municipal revenues
          and local employment.
          In addition to attracting new retail stores to serve residents, specialty
          retail stores serving visitors can also be attracted to stimulate additional
          employment and municipal revenues. In combination, residents and
          visitors can be better served when the range of retail goods and services
          expand to meet local needs.
          GOAL 4: Promote development to meet the retail needs of the
          community.
          Policy 4.1: Promote development of retail uses which serve local
          needs and diversify the selection of conveniently located goods and
          services.
          Policy 4.2: Promote visitor serving retail uses to serve the growing
          demand for harbor, beach and coastal facilities, especially day use
          visitors.
          (Coastal Act/30213, 30220, 30221, 30223, 30224, 30234, 30250)
          Policy 4.3: Promote the overlap between visitor and resident serving
          retail uses by encouraging retail goods and services which serve both
          market segments.
MEET VISITOR NEEDS
          Visitor expenditures for lodgings and retail goods and services account
          for a significant portion of the Dana Point economic base. Though not
          without drawbacks, visitors support a large share of the local
          employment and generate needed municipal revenues. Visitors to the
          coastline, harbor and beaches can serve as a long term source of
                                                    ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
                                        8                                 JULY 9, 1991
         business, jobs and revenues to the Dana Point economy. This
         economic resource needs to be carefully monitored and encouraged.
         GOAL 5: Encourage development to meet visitor needs.
         Policy 5.1: Encourage the early development of community, visitor-
         serving and resort properties at the Headlands site. Consider the
         positive economic impact that eco-tourism may generate on this site.
         (Coastal Act/30213, 30250)
         Policy 5.2: Encourage the early development of resort properties at
         the Monarch Beach site.
         (Coastal Act/30213, 30234)
         Policy 5.3: Encourage a balanced mix of visitor serving uses to
         complement the marine environment and commercial activities.
         (Coastal Act/30220, 30221, 30223, 30224, 30234)
PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT OF DOHENY VILLAGE
         The Doheny Village area is an older mixed use area which can benefit
         from development. Economic development can be stimulated in this
         area by creating opportunities for residential and commercial
         development. Much of the area is not feasible for private development
         due to the many small parcels. Revitalization assistance to consolidate
         and prepare suitable development sites can create the conditions to
         attract desired uses to the area.
         GOAL 6: Promote the revitalization of the Doheny Village area.
         Policy 6.1: Encourage a balance in the development of commercial
         uses.
         Policy 6.2: Encourage and assist in the preparation of sites suitable
         for commercial development.
         Policy 6.3: Promote the development of a transportation center with
         adjacent commercial and small office uses.
                                                ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT

PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT OF TOWN CENTER
         The Town Center area is the historic commercial center for Dana Point
         which serves both residents and visitors. The area has a mixture of
         older and new stores, motels, offices and other commercial buildings.
         Many of the uses operating in the area are economically inefficient due
         to small parcel sizes, limited parking and high land costs. Any effort
         to revitalize the area will require that larger sites are made available,
         shopper access and conveniences are provided, and the combination of
         new uses attract interest from residents and visitors alike.
         These needs for the Town Center area can be addressed in part with
         revitalization assistance. In combination with landowners, business
         owners, developers and the community, the Town Center area can be
         revitalized.
         GOAL 7: Promote the revitalization of the Town Center area.
         Policy 7.1: Encourage the development of visitor related retail uses.
         Policy 7.2: Encourage the development of local serving commercial
         uses, especially in the Lantern area.
         Policy 7.3: Encourage development to create a quality environment
         designed to promote interior courtyards and pedestrian ways.
         Policy 7.4: Establish both visual and pedestrian linkages between the
         Town Center and other areas throughout the City.                 (Coastal
         Act/30251)
COOPERATIVE IMPLEMENTATION
         Active participation will be required on the part of all segments of the
         community to help the City stimulate economic development in Dana
         Point. Such participation from residents, business owners and land
         owners can be used by the City to help direct specific actions that are
         targeted to special problems and opportunities.            This valuable
         community participation can be encouraged by the City with the
         formation of a public body which can serve to receive community
         input and coordinate actions.
         GOAL 8: Promote the active involvement of the City govern-
         ment with the residents and business community to implement
         these economic development goals.
         Policy 8.1: Initiate the preparation of a marketing program to maintain
                                                  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT

          needed information, promote the City to potential new business,
          promote the City's visitor attractions and monitor economic
          development conditions. (Coastal Act/30213)
          Policy 8.2: Actively involve the City in assisting Community
          Development.
          Policy 8.3: Encourage local businesses to work closely with the City.
COASTAL DEPENDENT USES
          Because of the importance of coastal resources to the Dana Point
          economy, efforts need to be directed toward ensuring that those land
          uses which can best benefit by coastal location find development
          opportunities by the coast.
          GOAL 9: Encourage the development of coastal dependent uses.
          Policy 9.1: Give priority to the coastal dependent uses on or near the
          shoreline over other developments. (Coastal Act/30255)

                  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN
The Economic Development Plan describes the approach to be used in imple-
menting the Economic Development Element goals and policies. The
economic development goals and policies provide direction to address
economic, cultural, and social needs of Dana Point. These specific goals and
policies provide for continued growth of the City's economic and employment
base and increase its fiscal strength and stability. In order to fully realize
these goals and policies it will be necessary for the City to undertake active
steps by implementing initiatives designed to capitalize on opportunities as
they develop.
This Economic Development Plan presents a broad strategy to help relate and
detail the many initiatives which can help the City achieve its economic
development goals and objectives. These initiatives are undertaken sepa-
rately or in concert to direct the City's economic development with available
resources.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
               The economic development strategy for Dana Point seeks to
               promote balanced non-residential land use development to meet
               the needs of the City, its residents, and visitors. This strategy
               is intended to establish an ongoing and continuous process
               able to respond expeditiously to take advantage of future
               opportunities and avoid future problems.
               The economic development strategy recognizes that specific
               future actions can best be carried out if some or all of the
               following conditions are realized:
               ° Identify a responsible group to oversee and direct economic
                   development initiatives;
               ° Maintain a current information base able to accurately
                   characterize important economic conditions;
               ° Relate economic development initiatives to other City
                   activities such as planning, housing and cultural.
               ° Maintain communications with property owners, businesses
                   and governmental bodies to ensure cooperation and coor-
                                                         ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT

             dination;
         ° Development of a promotional program in partnership with
             the Chamber of Commerce which addresses the needs of
             local businesses and consumers.
         ° Attempt to anticipate future needs and opportunities in
             order to act in a proactive, rather than a reactive, manner.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES
         The economic development initiatives are designed to support
         the City's economic development strategy, to take advantage of
         future opportunities and to avoid future problems.
         Establish a Group to Oversee Economic Development Initia-
         tives.
         Designation of a body responsible for considering economic
         development policies and initiatives in detail is necessary. This
         body may be a permanent committee, a temporary commission,
         a public-private organization, or other type of body capable of
         considering       economic      development       initiatives      and
         recommending actions to the City Council. This body serves as
         the focal point for discussion by public officials, local
         businessmen, local organizations, City staff, residents and the
         community at large.
         ° Establish an Economic Development Commission with
             members representing the City Council, Planning Commis-
             sion, the chambers of commerce, the business community,
             residents and other constituencies, as necessary. The
             purpose of this Commission is to make recommendations to
             the City Council on the need for a permanent body, its
             composition, and its role in promoting local economic
             development.
         ° City staff facilitates Economic Development Commission
             business by making materials available, convening meet-
             ings, and preparing Commission reports to the City Council.
         ° The Economic Development Commission considers how
             best to detail, select and implement the initiatives contained
             in this Economic Development Plan.

° Among the activities that the Economic Development
   Commission considers undertaking are:
   1) Obtaining input from the business community as to the
       best means for assisting local businesses, attracting new
       businesses and maintaining a healthy business environ-
       ment.
   2) Monitoring key sites and advising the City Council and
       Planning Commission on how best to proceed with their
       development.
   3) Preparing marketing information targeted to attract new
       businesses to the City.
   4) Overseeing the business registration procedure for the
       City.
Closely Monitor Key Sites
Because the Headlands and Monarch Beach sites are critical
components for commercial development in Dana Point, the
City is concerned with factors which can shape the ultimate
development of these sites. Lines of communication are
maintained between the owners/developers of the sites and the
City in order to discuss development plans and conditions on a
timely basis.
° City Planning staff continues to formally monitor the de-
   velopment plans of the owners/developers of the Headlands
   and Monarch Beach sites.
° City Planning staff continues to meet informally with the
   owners/developers of the two sites in order to discuss the
   City's aspirations for the sites, hear the owner's/developer's
   objectives, and create a mutually beneficial channel of
   communication.
° City Planning staff works with site owners/developers to
   create new opportunities for developing the sites as soon as
   possible in mutually beneficial ways.
° City Planning staff keeps the City Council, Planning Com-
   mission and the Economic Development Commission

    appraised of any changes of status for the sites.
Analyze Fiscal Needs
A detailed fiscal study is helpful in evaluating the long term
revenue requirements for the City in light of anticipated
municipal service and maintenance costs. Such a study can
reveal the amount of additional revenues that may need to be
generated by new commercial development to secure the fiscal
stability of the City.
° The City initiates a fiscal study to determine the amount of
    future revenue needed to maintain municipal services and
    maintenance. Such a study considers future municipal
    revenues and costs at buildout. In addition, estimates of
    capital improvements paid for by the City are noted.
° The fiscal study yields a net estimated surplus or deficit for
    the City at buildout. This estimate serves as the basis for
    determining the fiscal needs from development of the key
    sites and revitalization areas.
Maintain Information Base
Current and accurate economic development information is
essential to help the City Council make decisions on economic
development goals, policies, strategy or initiatives. A monitor-
ing program is established to gather, estimate and analyze key
economic development measures.
° A standardized information base is to be designed to build
    upon and provide annual updates for the information
    presented in the Economic Development Technical Report.
° The types of useful information that are to be annually
    updated from Technical Report tables include:
    1) Inventory of retail centers (Table 9-5);
    2) Inventory of lodging facilities (Table 9-6);
    3) Inventory of major office (Table 9-7) and industrial
        development.
        These three inventory items are to be updated by annu-
                                           ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT

   ally adding or deleting projects for which a building
   permit or demolition permit has been issued.
4) Inventory of existing businesses (Table 9-2);
5) List of the largest employers in the City.
   These items are to be established with the implementa-
   tion of an annual municipal business permit requirement
   which bases fees upon the reported type of business
   and the number of employees.
6) Retail sales leakage estimates by business type (Table 9-
   8).
   Using the methodology presented in the technical re-
   port, retail sales leakage is to be estimated annually with
   retail sales reports published by the California State
   Board of Equalization.
7) Visitor Expenditure Estimates.
   This estimate is based upon the combined lodging
   expenditures and share of retail sales by visitors. Each is
   briefly described as follows:
   a) Annual transient occupancy tax (TOT) is divided by
       the TOT rate to estimate gross room receipts.
   b) Visitor Share of Retail Sales
       Retail sales attributed to visitors is calculated by first
       estimating the portion of retail sales that each type of
       business sells to visitors, and then summing the
       visitor share of sales for all business types. For
       example, the report estimates that 40% of all "eating
       and drinking" sales are to visitors while 10% of all
       "food store" sales are to visitors. These shares of
       sales to visitors by business type are based upon
       discussions with local merchants, observations on
       local supply/demand characteristics and knowledge
       of visitor related expenditure patterns. Multiplying
       the share of visitor expenditures and the total annual
       retail sales for each type of business will yield the
       estimated annual sales to visitors. A worksheet is

           provided at the end of this plan to assist in this
           analysis (Table ED-3).
    8) Site Availability Inventory
       This inventory lists all currently vacant and developable
       non-residential parcels along with basic characteristics
       of location, size, permissible/desired uses and other
       related information.
    9) Assemble Socioeconomic Characteristics
       Household income, households, household size and
       related information is compiled from the U.S. Census, the
       California Department of Finance and private forecasting
       sources as available.
Promote the Development of Specific Uses
Certain types of commercial uses which are both market
supportable and beneficial to the City have been identified in
the Technical Report. Direct and indirect initiatives can be
undertaken to promote development and attract new business-
es to Dana Point.
° Initiate detailed investigation to determine the feasibility of a
    passenger train station located in the Doheny Village area.
° Work with key site owners/developers to detail specified
    land uses and promote early development.
° Establish and implement a marketing brochure to promote
    new non-residential development in the City.
Undertake Revitalization Activities
Dana Point can initiate revitalization activities and establish
project areas. These actions are focused principally on the
need to assemble larger commercial sites, improve off-site
circulation and parking, and assist in promoting development.
Revitalization actions are to be linked to other economic
development initiatives in order to leverage local development
opportunities.
° Upon establishment of a revitalization project area, work

  with staff to help formulate a revitalization plan which
  integrates revitalization activities with other economic
  development initiatives.
° Consider utilizing revenues to assist in other economic
  development activities such as planning, business
  retention, business attraction and infrastructure improve-
  ments.

Maintain Intergovernmental Coordination
Some of the economic development initiatives require coordi-
nation with other governmental bodies including Federal, State
and County governments and the Coastal Commission. Coordi-
nation among these public sector bodies helps create more
efficient, effective and equitable economic development initia-
tives for the City.
° City staff brings intergovernmental issues, concerns and
    opportunities which affect economic development to the
    attention of the City Council, Planning Commission and the
    Commission for discussion and resolution, if needed.
° Communicate the City's economic development goals,
    policies, strategy, objectives and interests to other govern-
    mental bodies that may be affected by local decisions and
    actions.

                         INTRODUCTION TO
                     THE LAND USE ELEMENT
The Land Use Element is a guide to the allocation of land use in the City and
has major impacts on key issues and subject areas examined in the other
Elements of the Plan. For example, all future land use within the City
described in this Element will affect the transportation system discussed in the
Circulation Element, residential development affects housing policies and
programs contained in the Housing Element, and identified recreational or open
space lands represent the application of Conservation/Open Space Element
policy planning. Land use policy will also affect numerous issues in the
remaining Plan Elements, including those concerned with Economic
Development, Urban Design, Public Facilities and Growth Management,
Public Safety, and Noise.
The Land Use Policy Diagram which describes future planned land uses within
the City is a primary feature of the Element. The Land Use Policy Diagram is
included in this Element and a larger version is included in the pocket of the
General Plan document binder. The land use designations depicted on the
Diagram are described in the narrative portion of the Land Use Element.
PURPOSE OF THE LAND USE ELEMENT
               The City of Dana Point represents the unification of three distinct
               pre-incorporation communities -- Dana Point, Monarch Beach
               and Capistrano Beach. These coastal communities developed
               together, before incorporation, through the efforts of local
               community planning groups with guidance provided by the
               County of Orange. That history of strong local involvement in
               the planning process, and the existence of common goals and
               aspirations led to the incorporation of the City of Dana Point in
               1989. To maintain and improve the quality of Dana Point, the
               City will strive to achieve Land Use desires through the
               implementation of the policies contained in this Element. The
               goals include:
               °      Establishment of a balanced, functional mixture of
                 different types of Land Use that are consistent with the City's
                 long-range goals and values;
                                                               LAND USE ELEMENT
                                         1                             JULY 9, 1991

         °       Quality new development or revitalization of existing
            development within the City and removal of constraints that
            prevent these desirable changes;
         °       Preservation of developed and undeveloped portions of
            the City which have cultural, social and natural resource value
            to the City and it's citizens;
         °       Financially sound investment of public and private funds
            that effectively supports both desirable change and
            preservation within the City; and
         °       Reduction of loss of life, injury and property damage that
            might occur as a result of natural hazards, such as flooding,
            seismic activity, soils erosion and storm waves, and man-made
            hazards, such as unsound construction, poor traffic patterns
            and roadway conditions, and incompatibility among different
            land uses.
         The Land Use Element promotes the achievement of these goals
         by establishing clear, logical patterns and standards for future
         land use. The Element does so through the use of narrative text,
         tables, diagrams and mapping, and its single most important
         feature is the Land Use Policy Diagram. This diagram, a copy of
         which is contained in the Element and in the pocket of the
         General Plan document binder, indicates the location, density
         and intensity of future development for all land uses city-wide.
         Finally, the goals and policies contained in this Element establish
         a constitutional framework for future land use planning and
         decision making in the City.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
         This Element presents the City's goals and policies regarding
         land use for the long-term growth, development and
         revitalization of the City. The Land Use Element contains text
         describing land use goals and policies, land use descriptions, a
         Policy Diagram and a statistical summary of the land use
         distribution illustrated on the Policy Diagram.
         The Land Use/Local Coastal Element Technical Report,
         prepared prior to preparation of the Land Use Element, is a
         supporting background document which contains quantitative
         information about the distribution of land use in Dana Point.

        This technical report may be updated periodically as a means of
        maintaining a data base of current land use conditions in the
        City.
LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM
        As discussed in the Introduction, the General Plan, Zoning
        Ordinance, Zoning Map, and other implementing actions
        constitute the Local Coastal Program (LCP) for that portion of
        the coastal zone within the City's jurisdiction. The LCP includes
        several required components and issue areas which relate to the
        subjects of several different General Plan Elements; therefore,
        specific components of the LCP are distributed among various
        elements of the General Plan and are individually discussed
        within their applicable Plan Element. To fully identify all
        components of the LCP, a matrix is provided which cross-
        references LCP components/issue areas with the supporting
        information included in the elements of the General Plan and
        Zoning Ordinance. The portion of the Local Coastal Program
        Reference Matrix that applies to the Land Use Element is
        provided in Table LU-1, located at the end of the section of this
        Element entitled "Land Use Element - Local Coastal Program
        Reference Matrix".
        The Land Use Element is a major component of the LCP and
        consists of "relevant portions of a local government's General
        Plan...which are sufficiently detailed to indicate the kinds,
        location, and intensity of land uses, the applicable resource
        protection and development policies and, where necessary, a
        listing of implementing actions" (Section 30108.5, Coastal Act).
        The City's LCP requires certification by the Coastal
        Commission. After certification the City assumes responsibility
        for administering coastal development permits in those areas of
        its coastal zone that are not on submerged lands, tide lands,
        public trust lands, or state universities or colleges. Development
        within the City's coastal zone would then be approved only if
        found to be in conformity with the certified LCP.
        Approximately 2,158 of the City's total 4,148 acres lie within the
        coastal zone. The City's coastal zone is identified in Figure LU-
        1.
        Identification of those portions of the Land Use Element, and
        other General Plan elements which constitute components of the
                                                           LAND USE ELEMENT

         City's Local Coastal Program, is provided by the inclusion of
         parenthetical references to the applicable sections of the
         California Coastal Act. For example, a policy statement relating
         to coastal visual resources will be followed by the parenthetical
         reference (Coastal Act/30251) to indicate that the policy relates
         to or addresses scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas as
         required by that section of the California Coastal Act.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
         The scope and content of the Land Use Element is primarily
         governed by the General Plan Law and Guidelines and the
         Planning, Zoning and Development Laws for the state
         (California Government Code Sections 65000-66009). In
         addition, there are a number of other plans and programs that are
         considered in the formulation, adoption and implementation of
         land use policy. Relevant plans and programs are described in
         this section.
         County Of Orange Zoning Ordinance and City of Dana
         Point Zoning Ordinance
         Following incorporation and prior to adoption of a City Zoning
         Ordinance, the City elected to use the County of Orange Zoning
         Ordinance as an interim means of regulating land use. The
         County Zoning Ordinance was supplemented directly by
         City-adopted ordinances which tailored its application to the City
         of Dana Point. The City adopted its own Zoning Code in 1993
         as the primary implementation tool for the Land Use Element,
         and its goals and policies. The City Zoning Ordinance and
         Zoning Map will be consistent with the City's General Plan and
         Land Use Policy Diagram. Together, the Zoning Ordinance and
         Zoning Map will identify specific types of land use, intensity of
         use, and development and performance standards applicable to
         specific areas and parcels of land within the City.

Regional/Local Plans
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is
responsible for the regional planning in Southern California.
SCAG has been preparing long range growth and development
plans for the Southern California region since the early 1970s as
part of the ongoing Development Guide Program. This program
provides a framework for coordinating local and regional
decisions regarding future growth and development. An
important component of this process is the preparation of growth
forecast policies at intervals ranging from three to five years.
The adopted growth forecast policies become the basis for
SCAG's functional plans (transportation, housing, air and water)
for the region. The population totals and growth distribution are
used in planning the future capacity of highways and transit
systems, quantity and location of housing, water supply systems,
and siting and sizing of sewage treatment systems.
Orange County governmental agencies have developed regional
and local facilities and service plans which affect land use policy
in the City. For example, land use policy and circulation
decisions of the City are affected by the planning and anticipated
development of the San Joaquin Corridor, a major freeway
serving the southwest coastal Orange County area. In addition to
County agencies, local water and sewer service districts provide
key development supporting services; school districts offer
educational services and facilities that are essential to City
families; and the local park district provides recreational
opportunities for visitors and residents alike.
Descriptions of relevant State, County and Local Agency
planning are found in the applicable General Plan Element.
Specific Plans/Planned Communities
Much of the City's development has been shaped by the three
pre-incorporation Specific Plans for Dana Point, Capistrano
Beach, and South Laguna, and the Planned Communities of
Laguna Niguel, Dana Point Harbor and Bear Brand. The
Specific Plan and Planned Community documents provided
policy guidance and regulatory control of development before
incorporation and during the preparation of the City's General
Plan and Zoning Ordinance. The three Specific Plan documents
included Local Coastal Programs required by the California
Coastal Act.

Specific Plans may also be used as a method for implementing
the City's General Plan in the future. Specific Plans are
authorized by Section 65451 of the Government Code and are
used by many cities and counties to implement general plan
policy for identified geographic subareas or properties within
their jurisdictions. Specific Plans implement general plan policy
by establishing regulations, conditions, and programs concerning
the following:
° Development standards and precise location for land use and
  facilities;
° Standards and locations for streets, roadways, and other
  transportation facilities;
° Standards indicating population density and building intensity,
  and provisions for supporting services and infrastructure;
° Specific standards designed to address the use, development
  and conservation of natural resources; and
° Other provisions for the implementation of the General Plan.

       LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies contained in this element provide guidance for
development of vacant land, revitalization of existing development, and
preservation of the many stable and desirable areas within the City. The goals
and policies of this element are aimed at:
°Achieving a balanced mixture of residential, commercial, industrial, and other
    land uses;
°Achieving compatibility and enhancement among the various land use types;
°Directing growth to maintain and improve the quality of life;
°Preserving natural environmental resources;
°Providing for suitable development of the Headlands;
°Achieving enhanced development of the Town Center as a primary business
    district;
°Achieving revitalization of the Doheny Village as a primary business district;
°Providing for suitable development of Monarch Beach;
°Protecting resident-serving land uses; and
°Implementing state coastal resources planning and management policies.
As described earlier in this element, identification of those coastal resources

BALANCED DEVELOPMENT IN DANA POINT
        Balancing development within the City requires the inclusion of
        a mixture of different types of land use - residential, commercial,
        industrial, community facilities, recreation and open space, and
        others. A well-balanced community offers a broad range of land
        uses organized in a desirable pattern and intensity which
        enhances the overall living environment. By providing for a
        balanced mixture of land uses, the City can achieve a suitable
        inventory of housing to meet the needs of all income groups, a
        stable commercial and employment base, recreational
        opportunities for inhabitants and visitors, and acceptable public
        facilities and services. An appropriate pattern and balance of
        land use is the key to the fiscal and social health of the City.
        The existing mix of development within the City has been
        shaped by pre-incorporation planning efforts. These previous
        planning efforts generally provided an adequate balance of land
        uses within the City. However, greater and more appropriate
        balance is achieved by increasing the overall proportion of non-
        residential development, particularly in the Town Center and
        Doheny Village areas. Future employment opportunities within
        the City are expanded by increasing the percentage of lands
        designated for industrial, office, and business use and the long-
        term fiscal condition of the City is strengthened. Community
        facilities consist primarily of land owned by school, water,
        sewer, and park and recreation districts. Expansion of the land
        area designated for community facilities is necessary to
        accommodate additional City facilities.
        GOAL 1: Achieve a desirable mixture of land uses to meet
        the residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, open
        space, cultural and public service needs of the City residents.
        Policy 1.1: Develop standards for building intensity, including
        standards      for     ground       coverage,     setbacks,      open
        space/landscaping, maximum dwellings per acre, floor area
        ratios, size and height restrictions.
        Policy 1.2: Establish maximum intensities of development for
        each of the various land use categories.
        Policy 1.3: Assure that land use intensities are consistent with
        capacities of existing and planned public service facilities.

Where existing or planned public works facilities can
accommodate only a limited amount of new development,
services to coastal dependent land use, essential public services
and basic industries vital to the economic health of the region,
state, or nation, public recreation, commercial recreation, and
visitor-serving land uses shall not be precluded by other
development. (Coastal Act/30250, 30254)
Policy 1.4: Assure that adequate recreational areas and open
space are provided as a part of new residential development to
assure that the recreational needs of new residents will not
overload nearby coastal recreation areas. (Coastal Act/30252)
Policy 1.5: Work closely with Orange County to plan for the
future development within the Harbor Area and to assure that
additional development is compatible with existing uses and
enhances the scenic, recreational and visitor opportunities for the
area. (Coastal Act/30220-224, 30233, 30234, 30250, 30252,
30255)
Policy 1.6: The development of unified or clustered commercial
centers and neighborhood commercial centers rather than
continued development of Strip Commercial shall be encouraged
to minimize significant adverse individual or cumulative impacts
on public access. (Coastal Act/30250, 30252)
Policy 1.7: Require comprehensive analysis and mitigation for
any proposed General Plan Amendment to ensure that the
amendment will result in a desirable mixture of land uses
meeting the social and fiscal needs of the City and its residents.
Policy 1.8: The location and amount of new development
should maintain and enhance public access to the coast by
facilitating the provision or extension of transit service,
providing non-automobile circulation within the development,
providing adequate parking facilities or providing substitute
means of serving the development with public transportation,
and assuring the potential for public transit for high intensity
uses. (Coastal Act/30252)
Policy 1.9: New or expanded public works facilities shall be
designed and limited to accommodate needs generated by
development or uses permitted consistent with the certified local
coastal program. Special districts which include the coastal zone
shall not be formed or expanded except where assessment for,

        and provision of, the service would not induce new development
        inconsistent with the City of Dana Point certified local coastal
        program. (Coastal Act/30254)
COMPATIBILITY AND ENHANCEMENT AMONG LAND USES
        As the City develops, new land uses replace existing ones and
        the characteristics of individual land uses which distinguish them
        from one another can also be described as differences which
        cause them to be incompatible when they occur close together.
        For example, the traffic, night lighting, noise, and odors
        associated with an otherwise successful commercial area may be
        perceived as nuisances for nearby residents. An understanding
        of impacts which occur when different types of land use develop
        close to one another leads to proper planning and positive
        impacts on surrounding land uses. The use of horizontal
        separation, vertical separation of buildings and uses, landscaping,
        walls, and proper orientation of buildings, lighting, and street
        access can avoid or minimize land conflicts and impacts, and
        enhance the overall living environment.

         development, but not over agriculture or coastal-dependent
         industry. (Coastal Act/30222)
         Policy 2:11: The location and amount of new development
         should maintain and enhance public access to the coast by
         assuring that the recreational needs of new residents will not
         overload nearby coastal recreation areas through the correlation
         of the amount of development with local park acquisition and
         development plans with the provision of on-site recreational
         facilities to serve the new development. (Coastal Act/30252(6))
         Policy 2:12: Oceanfront land that is suitable for coastal
         dependent aquaculture shall be protected for that use, and
         proposals for aquaculture facilities located on those sites shall be
         given priority, except over other coastal dependent developments
         or uses. (Coastal Act/30222.5)
DIRECTING GROWTH TO MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE QUALITY
OF LIFE
         As the City matures, additional demands will be placed on public
         services and infrastructure (e.g., police, fire and recreation, and
         streets, water lines, sewer lines, power lines, and others). The
         infrastructure system serving Dana Point includes major
         components or "back bone systems" which can provide the
         capacity to accommodate projected growth. The secondary
         components, connecting development with the major
         components of the infrastructure system, must be extended to
         support new development and replacement of aging portions of
         the system needs to occur in the future to maintain the present
         quality of services provided. Continued demand for these public

Lower cost visitor and recreational facilities shall be protected,
encouraged, and, where feasible, provided. Upland areas
necessary to support coastal recreational uses shall be reserved
for such uses, where feasible. (Coastal Act/30213, 30222,
30223)
Policy 3.4: Examine the short term and long term fiscal effects
of development and revitalization decisions.
Policy 3.5: Public facilities including parking areas or facilities
shall, wherever appropriate and feasible, be distributed
throughout the coastal zone area to mitigate against the impacts,
social and otherwise, of overcrowding and overuse by the public
of any single area. (Coastal Act/30212.5)
Policy 3.6: Encourage patterns of development necessary to
minimize air pollution and vehicle miles traveled. (Coastal
Act/30250)
Policy 3.7: Encourage safe and convenient bicycle and
pedestrian access throughout the community.                  (Coastal

PRESERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES
        Portions of the City consist of fragile coastal beaches and bluffs,
        hillsides, and canyons which are sensitive to changes associated
        with land development. These fragile areas provide an important
        sense of place and openness. Preservation of such areas provides
        a physical buffer protecting persons and improvements from
        natural and man-made safety hazards. These areas also present
        opportunities for passive recreation, such as trails for bicycling
        and hiking, which result in only minimal disruption to sensitive
        lands.
        In the General Plan, bluff demarcation is drawn based on a mean
        estimation projected across all parcels impacted by coastal bluff
        areas. The specific location of the bluff line, as it is applied to an
        individual parcel, will be established consistent with existing
        policies and criteria in effect when building plans are submitted.
        GOAL 4: Encourage the preservation of the natural
        environmental resources of the City of Dana Point.
        Policy 4.1: Exclude areas designated as Open Space and areas
        containing wetlands, beaches, and bluffs from the calculation of
        net acreage available for determining development intensity or
        density potential.
        Policy 4.2: Consider the constraints of natural and man-made
        hazards in determining the location, type and intensities of new
        development. (Coastal Act/30240, 30253)
        Policy 4.3: Public access, which shall be conspicuously posted,
        and public recreational opportunities, shall be provided to the
        maximum extent feasible for all the people to the coastal zone
        area and shoreline consistent with public safety needs and the
        need to protect public rights, rights of private property owners,
        and natural resource areas from overuse. (Coastal Act/30210)
        Policy 4.4: Preserve, maintain and, where feasible, enhance and
        restore marine resource areas and coastal waters. Special
        protection shall be given to areas and species of special
        biological or economic significance. (Coastal Act/30230)

        minimize risk of life and property damage. (Coastal Act/30253)
DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEADLANDS
        The Headlands is one of the most significant land forms and
        undeveloped properties in the City. The Headlands offers
        important opportunities for future development and, at the same
        time, includes sensitive coastal bluffs which represent substantial
        constraints to development. The property provides spectacular
        views of the Dana Point Harbor and the coastline to its north and
        south. Thus the Headlands offers a distinct opportunity to
        provide a continuous open space corridor along the coast with
        views and public access to the ocean, coastline and harbor. The
        property is large enough to accommodate a mixture of land uses
        that include visitor-serving commercial, residential, recreation,
        open space, and community facilities.
        GOAL 5: Provide for the development of the Headlands
        area in a manner that enhances the character of the City and
        encourages the protection of the natural resources of the site.
        Policy 5.1: Preserve the opportunity of public views from the
        Headlands site to the coastal areas and the harbor areas. (Coastal
        Act/30251)
        Policy 5.2: Require geotechnical studies to ensure geological

stability in the areas where development is to be permitted and
require adequate setbacks from the blufftop areas in accordance
with those engineering studies and adopted City regulations.
(Coastal Act/30250, 30253)
Policy 5.3: Preserve natural open space in the Headlands area,
especially along the coastal bluffs, and provide open areas
integrated throughout the development. (Coastal Act/30210-
212.5, 30250, 30253)
Policy 5.4: Assure that the height and scale of the development
in the Headlands are compatible with the development in the
community and that the visual impact of the development from
coastal areas below the project be minimized.                 (Coastal
Act/30251)
Policy 5.5: Promote the development of a mixture of land uses
which may include residential, visitor-serving commercial,
recreational, open space, and community facilities. (Coastal
Act/30213, 30250)
Policy 5.6: Require that a scenic walkway be extended
throughout the Headlands and connect to other existing or
proposed walkways. (Coastal Act/30210-212)
Policy 5.7: Provide vehicular access that does not adversely
impact adjoining neighborhoods or create congestion on Pacific
Coast Highway.
Policy 5.8: Provide patterns of land use and circulation in the
Headlands that enhance public and private pedestrian access and
circulation within the area. (Coastal Act/30250)
Policy 5.9: Provide extensive public trails within the Headlands
area. The system shall include access to the existing sandy beach
areas and to the visitor-serving and public places within the
Headlands.
Policy 5.10: Encourage visitor-serving resort facilities and land
uses of a world-class stature.
Policy 5.11: Assure the Specific Plan for the Headlands
provides buffers to achieve a compatible and enhanced
relationship to existing surrounding land uses.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOWN CENTER
        The Town Center area is one of the primary business districts in
        the City, and is the focus of activity for visitors traveling along
        Pacific Coast Highway (PCH). Although the area is segmented
        by the PCH couplet street system and impacted by its vehicular
        traffic, the mixture of commercial retail and service, office, and
        residential uses coupled with a pedestrian character and scale can
        be enhanced through proper planning and the use of physical
        design techniques. The Town Center also has a strong, physical
        connection with the blufftop viewpoints overlooking the Harbor
        at the south ends of Amber Lantern, Violet Lantern, and Golden
        Lantern. Although the Town Center is very accessible to visitors
        and travelers on PCH, it has a strong connection with
        surrounding residential areas. In fact, the La Plaza area is a
        center of neighborhood shops and services oriented toward local
        needs.
        GOAL 6: Achieve development in the Town Center area
        that enhances the area as a primary business district in the
        City.
        Policy 6.1: Provide a diversity of retail office and residential
        land uses that establish the Town Center as a major center of
        social and economic activity in the community.
        Policy 6.2: Encourage retail businesses and mixtures of land
        uses that help to generate positive pedestrian activity in the area.
        Policy 6.3: Establish patterns of land use and circulation that
        promote the desired pedestrian character of the area.
        Policy 6.4: Through effective design guidelines encourage
        building designs, intensity and setbacks to be compatible with
        the desired scale and character of the area. (Coastal Act/30251)
        Policy 6.5: Develop land use and parking regulations to assure
        that adequate and reasonable standards are provided.
        Policy 6.6: Provide opportunities for shared parking facilities in
        the Town Center, such as through the establishment of an off-
        street parking district.

DEVELOPMENT OF DOHENY VILLAGE
        The Doheny Village represents an important gateway to the City
        from the Interstate 5 Freeway. The Village needs improvements
        to infrastructure and general upgrading of development within
        the area. Planned land uses are expected to include a mix of new
        commercial, office, multi-family residential, community
        facilities, and industrial/business development. Revitalization
        efforts could include pedestrian-oriented streetscape and
        landscaping improvements designed to unify and connect the
        Village's various areas. These improvements may also provide a
        means of establishing greater connection between the Village the
        beach and San Juan Creek.

DEVELOPMENT OF MONARCH BEACH
        The Monarch Beach area is indicative of development based on
        master planning efforts and high quality development standards.
        The Ritz Carlton Resort Hotel and an additional resort hotel site
        north of Pacific Coast Highway provide focal uses in a
        community which includes extensive outdoor activities such as
        golf (The Links at Monarch Beach) and coastal recreation (Salt
        Creek Beach Park and Dana Strand Beach). Monarch Beach has
        dramatic public view corridors within the coastal Salt Creek
        Basin.
        GOAL 8: Provide for the development of the Monarch
        Beach area in a manner that enhances the character of the

DEVELOPMENT OF CAPISTRANO BY THE SEA
        The site known as Capistrano by the Sea encompasses 24.7 acres
        of partially developed land, located at the top of a prominent hill
        overlooking San Juan Creek and the Dana Point Harbor. In
        addition, distant views of the valley, the coastline to the south
        and Saddleback Mountain are visible from some locations on the
        site. The site is surrounded by residential uses, predominantly
        single-family homes, and St. Edwards Catholic Church to the
        west. There is a grove of mature trees on the site, mostly
        eucalyptus, which creates a visual background for Doheny
        Village and the eastern section of the City. Onsite uses include
        the historic Dolph House (considered to be the City’s first
        residence) and structures that were previously used as a
        psychiatric hospital and church. Due to the prominent location
        and high visibility of the site, the existing mature trees and the
        surrounding existing residential community, there are constraints
        to development.
        GOAL 9: Provide for the development of Capistrano by the
        Sea site in a manner that enhances the character of the City
        and encourages the preservation of views of the site from

        Doheny Village.
        Policy 9.1: Promote the development of land uses that are
        compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhoods, with
        an ultimate residential density cap of 43 new dwellings plus the
        Dolph House.
        Policy 9.2: Provide vehicular access that does not adversely
        impact adjoining neighborhoods or create congestion on
        surrounding streets.
        Policy 9.3: Assure that the height and scale of development on
        the site are not in conflict with the surrounding residential uses
        by providing for adequate development standards relating to
        height limits, setbacks, and lot coverage.
        Policy 9.4: Provide open space corridors through the site and
        along the southern, eastern and northern perimeter of the site that
        preserves a significant number of mature trees within common
        landscaped areas that conforms to the mitigation monitoring
        program prepared for GPA97-03. Create an opportunity for
        planting new trees to enhance the development and provide a
        visual backdrop similar to the existing views from Doheny
        Village.
        Policy 9.5: Encourage a pedestrian circulation system that
        permits public access through some of the open space corridors.
        Policy 9.6: A majority of the healthy mature trees existing at
        the time of this amendment, shall be preserved on the site and
        incorporated into the development plans within open space areas.
         Should it be necessary to remove any trees from the site, the
        trees shall be replaced in conformance with the mitigation
        monitoring program prepared for GPA97-03.
PROTECTION OF RESIDENT-SERVING LAND USES
        Dana Point citizens have a strong sense of community even
        though Dana Point is an attraction to many visitors. This sense
        of community or sharing of common goals and interests includes
        the desire to protect and maintain those land uses which serve the
        residents of the area. This involves the encouragement of

         resident-serving commercial activity which meets local demands
         for goods and services, as well as locations for offices and
         business uses which employ City residents.
         GOAL 10: Protect the resident-serving land uses throughout
         the City.
         Policy 10.1: Develop regulations to protect and encourage local
         serving retail and office use adjacent to residentially designated
         areas. Promote the overlap between visitor and resident serving
         retail uses by encouraging retail goods and services which serve
         both market segments in transition areas, such as those
         designated “Community Commercial”, located between primary
         visitor serving areas and areas designated for residential use as
         shown on the Land Use Diagram. (Coastal Act/30222)
         Policy 10.2: Encourage a full range of resident-serving land
         uses throughout the City to meet the resident demand for goods
         and services.
         Policy 10.3: Encourage resident-serving uses within walking
         distance of areas designated on the Land Use Diagram for
         residential use, where possible, to minimize the encroachment of
         resident serving uses into visitor-serving areas, to minimize the
         use of primary coastal access roads for non-recreational trips,
         and to minimize energy consumption and vehicle miles traveled
         by encouraging the use of public transportation. (Coastal
         Act/30222, 30252, 30253)

                         THE LAND USE PLAN
The Land Use Plan and Policy Map describe the approach to be used in
implementing the Land Use Element goals and policies. The locations of
future land use are presented on the Land Use Policy Diagram which is a part
of this Element and is included in the pocket of the General Plan document
binder. In guiding future land use, the Element focuses on three basic land use
characteristics of the City:
1)Undeveloped parcels of land which will be the subject of most proposals for
    new development;
2)Existing consistent land use and development which, over time, will
    increasingly require maintenance and preservation; and
3)Revitalization of some land use and development where rehabilitation is
    necessary or conversion to other uses is desired to achieve economic or
    social goals of the General Plan.
LAND USE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS
               A wide range of natural and man-made environmental factors are
               considered in the formulation of land use policy. Areas of
               special environmental significance, potential safety hazards,
               limitations of existing infrastructure, and the nature and character
               of existing development all have influence on land use policy.
               Land Use Constraints and Resources
               The Public Safety Element identifies areas of Dana Point subject
               to such environmental constraints as flooding, landsliding, and
               seismic conditions. In turn, the Conservation/Open Space
               Element identifies areas containing important ecological or
               natural resources. The Circulation and Noise Elements describe
               roadway/transportation system capacities and areas of the City
               impacted by noise levels. These constraints, consisting of both
               natural and man-made factors, influence long-range land use
               planning and are discussed in detail in the Master Environmental
                                                                  LAND USE ELEMENT

LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
         Land use designations indicate the type and nature of
         development that is allowed in a given location. While terms
         like "residential," "commercial" and "industrial" are generally
         understood, State General Plan law requires a clear and concise
         description of the land use categories shown on the Land Use
         Policy Diagram.
         The Land Use Element provides for land use categories or
         designations listed in Table LU-3. Five of these designations are
         established for residential development, ranging from low-
         density single family to high-density multiple family
         development. Three commercial designations, one office, one
         industrial and a community facility category are included. One
         category of mixed use is established to offer some flexibility in
         providing complimentary commercial, office, and residential
         uses. Parkland and open space areas are combined under the
         recreation/open space designation. Major transportation facilities
         are included in a single transportation corridor category.
         Land Use Intensity/Density
         State General Plan law requires that the Land Use Element
         indicate the maximum intensities/densities permitted within the
         City. The land use designations contained in this element and
         shown on the Land Use Policy Diagram are described in this
         way. Table LU-3 lists each of the land use designations for the
         City and provides a corresponding indication of maximum
         intensity/density of development on that parcel. Maximum
         allowable development on individual parcels of land is to be
         governed by these measures of intensity or density. The table
         also includes the standard or expected overall levels of
         development within each land use category on a City-wide basis.
          These standard levels of development represent an anticipated
         intensity/density and are, therefore, less than the maximum
         allowed. For various reasons, not every parcel in the City has in
         the past nor will it in the future develop to the maximum
         allowed.

Future development is expected to occur at the standard level of
intensity/density stated in Table LU-3. Development at an
intensity or density between the standard and maximum levels
can occur only where projects offer exceptional design quality or
important public amenities or benefits above the standards
required by the City’s discussed in detail in the Master
Environmental Assessment for the General Plan. Urban Design
Guidelines and other regulatory documents. For the residential
land use designations, projects are expected to build to a density
at least as high as the lowest density allowed by their respective
designations.
A number of terms are used to define the land use designations
or categories described in this element. The term "intensity"
refers to the degree of development based on building
characteristics such as height, bulk, floor area ratio and/or
percent of lot coverage.
Intensity is most often used to describe non-residential
development levels, but, in a broader sense, is used to express
overall levels of all development types. The overall intensity of
development within the City of Dana Point is lower than the
more urbanized areas of Orange County, such as Anaheim, Santa
Ana, Irvine and Newport Beach.
For most non-residential development categories (commercial,
industrial, office, community facility, and recreation facilities),
the measure of intensity known as "floor area ratio" (FAR)
provides the most convenient method of describing development
levels. Simply stated, the floor area ratio is the relationship of
total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot to the total land area
of that lot expressed as a ratio. For example, a 21,780 square
foot building on a 43,560 square foot lot (one acre) yields an
FAR of .50:1 as illustrated in Figure LU-2. The FAR describes
use intensity on a lot but not the actual building height, bulk or
coverage. As Figure LU-2 shows, the .50:1 FAR can yield a
building of one story in height covering one half of the lot area,
or a taller building which covers less of the lot and provides
more open space.
For purposes of this explanation, both residential density and
non-residential intensity are based on the concept of net acreage.
 Net acreage is assumed to be 80 percent of gross acreage on a
City-wide basis and a net acre of land is assumed to equal 35,000
square feet for purposes of calculating density or intensity of
                                                     LAND USE ELEMENT

land use.
The term "density", in a land use context, is a measure of the
population or residential development capacity of the land.
Density is described in terms of dwelling units per net acre
(du/net ac); thus, the density of a residential development of 100
dwelling units occupying 20 net acres of land is 5.0 du/net ac. A
dwelling unit is a building or a portion of a building used for
human habitation and may vary considerably in size (square
footage) from small apartments at 400-500 square feet to large
single family homes exceeding 5,000 square feet. Along with
this difference in size is a corresponding difference in the
number of persons occupying a given unit (i.e., larger units
usually house more persons that smaller units). For purposes of
calculating population, an average number of persons per
dwelling unit for all dwelling unit types and sizes is assumed as
described in the notes beneath Table LU-4. Within land use
designations density is often described as a range (i.e., 3.5-7
du/net ac).
Descriptions of each of the land use designations shown on the
Land Use Policy Diagram are provided to delineate the general
types of uses allowed and their corresponding intensities or
densities. These use descriptions, types and limitations are
further defined as specific uses within the Zoning Ordinance.
The specific uses and development standards contained within
the Zoning Ordinance and shown on the accompanying Zoning
Map are consistent with the land use designations and standards
contained in this Element or shown on the Land Use Policy
Diagram.
Residential Designations
Residential 0-3.5: The Residential 0-3.5 and use category
provides for the development of low density detached and
attached single family dwellings. This designation allows for the
construction of a maximum of 3.5 single family detached units
per net acre of land. Community facilities which are determined
to be compatible with, and oriented toward serving the needs of
low density detached and attached single family neighborhoods
may also be allowed.

Typical business uses include small food and drug stores,
clothing stores, professional and business offices, restaurants and
hardware stores, child care, specialty retail, and community
facilities. Neighborhood commercial projects typically occur on
less than 10 acres of land and include 25,000 to 75,000 square
feet or less of building floor area. The standard intensity of
development is a floor area ratio of .35:1 and the maximum
intensity of development is a floor area ratio of .5:1.
Community Commercial:              The Community Commercial
designation includes retail, professional office, and service-
oriented business activities which serve a community-wide area
and population. Community Commercial uses include some
neighborhood commercial uses, such as professional and
business offices, retail and commercial services, appliance stores,
sporting goods, child care, restaurants, and community facilities,
along with larger scale indoor uses such as department stores,
furniture and appliance outlets, theaters and entertainment uses.
Community Commercial development usually occurs on 10 to
30 acres of land and includes 100,000 to 300,000 square feet of
building area. The standard intensity of development is a floor
area ratio of .4:1 and the maximum intensity of development is a
floor area ratio of .75:1.
Visitor/Recreation Commercial:             The Visitor/Recreation
Commercial designation includes primarily visitor-serving uses,
such as restaurants, resort hotels and motels uses, commercial,
recreation specialty and convenience retail goods and services,
auto service businesses, open space/recreational uses, and
community facilities. Other supporting uses include conference
facilities and cultural uses, such as museums and theaters. The
average intensity of development for hotels is a floor area ratio of
.75:1 and the maximum intensity of development for hotels is a
floor area ratio of 1.5:1. The standard intensity of development
for other uses is a floor area ratio of .5:1 and the maximum
intensity of development for other uses is a floor area ratio of
l.0:1.

are commercial; residential is only allowable when developed in
conjunction with commercial development. Allowable activities
include those identified in the Community and Neighborhood
Commercial designations, the Profes-sional/Administrative
designation and, when developed in conjunction with
commercial uses, the Residential 7-14, Residential 14-22, and
Residential 22-30 designation. When mixtures of uses occur in
the same building, retail uses or offices are usually located on the
ground floor with residential or office uses above. The mixed
uses are usually located in areas where multiple activities and
pedestrian orientation are considered to be desirable objectives.
All existing residential uses are allowable activities within this
designation;    however, the residential density cannot be
increased, and any changes of use shall include commercial use
as the primary use. The standard intensity of non-residential
development is a floor area ratio of .5:1 and the maximum
intensity of development is a floor area ratio of l.5:1. The
standard of 10 dwelling units per net acre of land (equivalent to
an FAR of .25:1) is allowed when residential development is
combined in the same building or on the same parcel as
commercial retail or office uses.
Office and Industrial Designations
Professional/Administrative: The Professional/Administrative
designation includes primarily single tenant or multi-tenant
offices and other supporting uses. These uses include legal and
medical services, financial institutions, corporate and
government offices, cultural and community facilities and similar
uses which together constitute concentrations of office
employment or community activity. Also included are small
convenience or service commercial activities intended to meet
the needs of the on-site employee population. The standard
intensity of development is a floor area ratio of .7:1 and the
maximum intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 1.0:1.
Industrial/Business Park:          The Industrial/Business Park
designation includes parcels of land with mixtures of industrial
and commercial uses that may include marine/auto supplies and

a floor area ratio of .5:1 and the maximum intensity of
development is a floor area ratio of .75:1.
Community and Other Designations
Community Facilities: The Community Facilities designation
includes a wide range of public and private uses, distributed
throughout the community such as schools, churches, child care
centers, transportation facilities, government offices and
facilities, public utilities, libraries, museums, art galleries,
community theaters, hospitals and cultural and recreational
activities. The standard intensity of development is a floor area
ratio of .4:1 and the maximum intensity of development is a floor
area ratio of 1.0:l.
Recreation/Open Space:             The Recreation/Open Space
designation includes both public and private recreational uses
necessary to meet the active and passive recreational needs of
area residents and visitors as well as open space uses necessary
to preserve public views, scenic natural land forms such as
bluffs, and environmentally sensitive habitat areas. Recreational
activities include golf course driving ranges, community
recreational facilities, public parklands and indoor and outdoor
sports/athletic facilities. Recreation uses include museums,
galleries, outdoor theater, and other similar uses. Open Space
uses include public view preservation, habitat restoration projects
and other similar uses. The standard intensity of development is
only an assumed average City-wide and does not apply to each
parcel of land.
Transportation Corridor:            The Transportation Corridor
designation applies to the land within the corridors for the
Interstate 5 Freeway, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railway,
and Circulation Element roadways. Lands within these corridors
are reserved for transportation purposes as the primary use.
Secondary uses, such as open space linkages and landscaped
areas, public and private parking areas, and other transportation-
related activities and facilities are allowed. The standard
intensity of development is a floor area ratio of .l:1 and the
maximum intensity of development floor area ratio is .2:1.

          The Land Use Policy Diagram for the City of Dana Point is
          described in Figures LU-3, LU-4 and LU-5. The Land Use
          designations depicted on the diagrams are those described in the
          previous section and are represented by patterns which identify
          future planned land uses for the City.

DISTRIBUTION OF LAND USES
         The statistical distribution of planned land uses city-wide is
         described in Table LU-4. Table LU-5 graphically describes the
         percentage distribution of planned land uses City-wide. This
         table identifies each land use designation, its associated land
         acreage, and the total land acreage for all planned land uses in
         the City. The table also provides estimated ranges of the total
         number of residential dwelling units planned and the resulting
         population. For non-residential land uses, such as commercial,
         office, industrial, and community facility, estimates of building
         square footage are depicted.
         Net acreage represents the average remaining after street rights-
         of-way and other public lands are excluded. To establish the net
         acreage associated with densities for residential designations and
         intensities for non-residential designations, 20 percent of the
         gross acreage is assumed to be used for streets or other public
         lands. Therefore, the net acreage equals 80 percent of gross
         acreage, and represents acreage capable of accommodating
         residential dwelling units and non-residential building square
         footage. For each gross acre of land(43,560 square feet), a net
         acre of 35,000 square feet is assumed to accommodate
         development.

(a) For purposes of establishing density/intensity by land use category, the gross acreage for residential
    and non-residential land uses is converted to net acreage by 20% to account for the land area devoted
    to roadways.
(b) Estimated dwelling units are expressed as a range. Dwelling units for residential categories are based
    on the standard density described in Table LU-3, (dwelling unit per net acre) for each category of
    residential use and the cumulative total for this column is 15,919. The bottom end of the range is
    based on estimated development of 252 (or 5 du/ac) dwelling units in the Residential/Commercial
    category. The top end of the range is based on minor upward adjustments to the standard densities for
    Residential 3.5-7 and Residential 7-14.
(c) Population is based on Orange County Analysis Center OCP-88 2010 projections of 2.08 persons per
    dwelling unit for the bottom of the range and 2.38 persons per dwelling unit for the top of the range.
(d) Square footage for non-residential categories is based on the standard intensity (FAR) for uses

SPECIFIC PLAN AREAS
          The estimated numbers of residential dwelling units and
          population are expressed as ranges to coincide with the
          structure of the residential land use designations which are also
          Residential 7-14, and so forth). The population range
          expressed in Table LU-4 is based on the recognition that
          population per dwelling unit varies depending on unit type and
          size, as well as the social or cultural mixture within the City.
          Five areas within the City are identified as Specific Plan areas
          for future development, or revitalization. These areas include
          the Headlands, the Town Center, Doheny Village, Monarch
          Beach and the Dana Point Harbor. The characteristics of
          planned land use for each focal area are described in the
          following sections.
          Headlands
          The Dana Point Headlands represents a significant land
          resource that has the capacity to accommodate a mixture of
          compatible land uses, including visitor/recreation commercial,
          residential, recreation/open space, and community facilities.
          The Headlands area is identified as a Specific Plan area on the
          Land Use Policy Map. The Specific Plan for the Headlands
          will be prepared before development occurs and that plan will
          implement General Plan policy by establishing development
          standards, precise locations for land uses and facilities,
          locations for streets, standards for residential density and non-
          residential intensity, and standards for the use and conservation
          of natural resources.
          Identification of the percentage mixture of planned land use is
          designed to provide both the City and property owner with the
          flexibility needed to allow consideration of alternative
          development designs. Any alternative designs must generally
          meet the basic land use percentage descriptions contained in
          this element and noted on the Land Use Policy Map. Any
          development design for the Headlands must include open space
          linkages connecting on- and off-site open space areas, and any
          land area designated specifically as Community Facility will
          result in a corresponding reduction of land area designated as
          either Visitor/Recreation Commercial or Residential 3.5-14, or
          both. The Land Use Element can be amended when a Specific
          Plan is prepared for the property.
                                                                 LAND USE ELEMENT

The Headlands also includes two small areas of existing
residential development. The westerly area consists of multi-
family units in buildings on adjacent, but separate lots.
Although the actual density of development for this westerly
area varies from lot to lot, the overall designation is Residential
22-30. The southerly residential area consists of single family
detached houses on separate lots with a designation of
Residential 7-14. The level of development for each of these
areas is based on their respective Land Use Element
designations, but where the existing level of development
exceeds the designation, the existing level of development can
be maintained or reconstructed in the event of loss due to
natural hazards or accident.

Town Center
The Dana Point Town Center is a primary business district
within the City which serves both visitors and residents.
Revitalization and economic development of the Town Center
are intended to create a compact pedestrian-oriented, "small
town" atmosphere within Dana Point's central business district.
 The Urban Design Element of the General Plan describes
design concepts useful in creating this desired atmosphere.
The Land Use Policy Diagram for the Town Center is depicted
in Figure LU-7 below and includes Community Commercial,
Visitor/Recreation Commercial, Commercial/Residential, and
Neighborhood Commercial designations.

                              roadway system. The Circulation Element includes discussion of
                              the dual goals of desired pedestrian orientation for the Town
                              Center and acceptable levels of service for vehicular traffic on

Doheny Village
The Doheny Village is a significant entrance or "gateway" to
the City which requires physical and economic revitalization to
realize its potential as one of the City's two primary business
districts. The good visibility and access of Doheny Village to
the Interstate 5 Freeway are assets which support the
investment of public and private funds to install infrastructure
improvements and generally upgrade development in the area.
Planned land use for Doheny Village includes Community
Commercial, Visitor/Recreation Commercial, Commercial/
Residential, Industrial/Business Park, Residential 22-30,
Community Facility, and Open Space. Figure LU-8 identifies
the locations of these land uses, while the Urban Design
Element provides an urban design plan which will unify the
diverse land uses of the Village.

                  Of the five Specific Plan areas, Doheny Village offers the greatest variety of
                  land uses. This variety suggests a self-contained or independent nature for the
                  Village. That self-contained character is strengthened by the balance of
                  residential, non-residential and community land uses. This variety and
                  balance offers potential for creative private and public revitalization efforts,
                  including the creation of open space linkages to and along the east banks of
                  San Juan Creek. The mixture of land uses is listed in Table LU-8 below.
                                                                        Table LU-8

Monarch Beach
The Monarch Beach Specific Plan area is defined
geographically by the Salt Creek Basin, a major drainage
course lying between Crown Valley Parkway and Niguel Road.
 Relatively recent master planning and recent high quality
construction established Monarch Beach as a planned
recreation-oriented resort and residential area. Monarch Beach
includes land planned for a mixture of Visitor/Recreation
Commercial, Community Commercial, Open Space and
Residential development. The locations of these uses within
the focus area are depicted in Figure LU-9.

                              The Monarch Beach Specific Plan area includes opportunities
                              that are similar to the Headlands property in terms of the
                              potential to support a major world-class resort development. The
                              existence of the golf course (The Links at Monarch Beach) and
                              suitable sites for resort development on its east and west sides,
                              with views and access to the coastline represent important
                              additions to resort activity presently provided by the Ritz Carlton
                              Resort. Within the Monarch Beach focus area, these sites for
                              resort development are designated as a Specific Plan area on the

The Harbor
The City wishes to actively participate in the planning for the
future of the Dana Point Harbor. Even though the County of
Orange leases the Harbor from the State of California, the
County controls Harbor design and development. The Harbor
provides a unique blend of the natural and man-made
waterfront setting which includes Visitor/Recreation
Commercial, Community Facility, Open Space, and Harbor
Marine Land and Water uses. These are depicted in Figure
LU-10 below.

The Harbor shares a symbiotic economic and social
relationship with the Town Center and the Headlands, which
suggests that the physical linkages between these areas should
be strengthened. These physical linkages include pedestrian
and vehicular access between the areas, visual connections
from overlooks of the Harbor, and strong entry points which
distinguish the edges of the three related areas.

           INTRODUCTION TO THE NOISE ELEMENT
The control of noise is an essential part of preserving the quality of a
community. The development of effective strategies to reduce excessive
noise in the community is essential to creating a safe and compatible living
and working environment. Since 1971, the Noise Element has been one of the
seven mandatory elements of a California General Plan. Due to California's
rapid growth, noise elements are required to enable cities to limit exposure to
excessive noise levels.
PURPOSE OF THE NOISE ELEMENT
              The Noise Element of a General Plan is a comprehensive
              program for including noise control in the planning process. It
              is a tool for achieving and maintaining environmental noise
              levels compatible with land use. The Noise Element identifies
              noise sensitive land uses and noise sources, and defines areas
              of noise impact. The Element establishes goals, policies, and
              programs to ensure that Dana Point residents will be protected
              from excessive noise.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
              The Noise Element follows the recently revised State guidelines
              in the State Government Code Section 65301(f) and Section
              46050.1 of the Health and Safety Code. The Element quantifies
              the community noise environment in terms of noise exposure
              contours for both near- and long-term levels of growth and
              noise-generating activity. The information will become a
              guideline for the development of goals and policies to achieve
              noise compatible land uses. This information also identifies
              baseline noise levels and sources for the identification of local
              noise ordinance enforcement. The Element is divided into three
              sections as follows:
              1)     Introduction - including a description of the Purpose and
                     Scope of the Element, an Inventory of Current and
                     Forecast Conditions describing the existing and future
                     noise levels in the City, and Issues Identification
                     presenting the noise issues in the City that are to be
                                                                  NOISE ELEMENT
                                       1                             JULY 9, 1991
                 addressed within the Noise Element.
         2)      Goals and Policies - defining the goals and policies of the
                 Noise Element and the City's general approach to
                 achieve stated goals.
         3)      The Noise Plan - defining strategies that the City will
                 implement to achieve the goals of the Element.
INVENTORY OF CURRENT AND BUILD-OUT CONDITIONS
         The inventory contains a detailed description of the current and
         build-out noise environments within the City of Dana Point.
         These descriptions of the noise environments are based on an
         identification of noise sources and noise sensitive land uses, an
         existing community noise measurement survey, noise contour
         maps, and build-out projections of noise.
         Sources of Noise
         Major noise sources in Dana Point include freeways, railroads,
         major and minor arterial roadways, and significant noise
         generating stationary sources. These can be grouped into two
         basic categories, transportation sources (primarily traffic) and
         non-transportation sources. Each source and its impact on the
         noise environment of Dana Point is summarized in the following
         paragraphs and discussed in greater detail in the Technical
         Appendix.
         The most significant and common source of noise in urban
         areas is transportation related. It includes automobiles, trucks,
         buses, motorcycles, railroads, aircraft and harbor activities.
         Motor vehicle noise is of concern because of its high rate of
         occurrence and roadway proximity to noise sensitive areas.
         The City of Dana Point is bisected by a number of arterial
         roadways and is near the San Diego Freeway. The major east-
         west roadways in Dana Point are Camino Del Avion, Stonehill
         Drive, Selva Road, Pacific Coast Highway, Del Prado, and the
         San Diego Freeway. The major north-south roadways in the
         City include Crown Valley Parkway, Niguel Road, Street of the
         Golden Lantern, Del Obispo, Doheny Park Road, and Camino de
         Estrella. Some additional roadways carry significant traffic
         levels and have residential land use directly adjacent to the
                                                              NOISE ELEMENT
                                  2                              JULY 9, 1991
roadway.
The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Rail Road has a railway line
running through Dana Point. The line runs parallel to the San
Diego Freeway; as the freeway turns southeast, the railroad
tracks separate from the freeway to run adjacent to Capistrano
Beach. Traffic primarily consists of passenger trains; however,
a few freight trains pass through the City each day.
Other sources of noise within the City are from non-transporta-
tion sources including industrial and commercial activities,
sport activities within public and private parks, construction,
and human activities. The South East Reclamation Regional
Authority (SERRA) Wastewater Treatment Plant is also a
significant source. Noise from trucks at commercial loading
areas have also been identified as a source of noise.
Ocean waves are also audible, particularly at night, through
much of Dana Point. Noise, however, is commonly defined as
"unwanted sound" and the ocean sounds are not considered a
problem.
Harbor noise can be heard in many of the areas of Dana Point
adjacent to the harbor. Noise sources in the harbor area include
boats, jet skis, and motor vehicle traffic. Periodically, dredging
activities can occur, which can be major sources of noise.
Much of the harbor property belongs to the County of Orange.
 Any activities that occur within the harbor would be subject to
the County of Orange Noise Ordinance.
Noise Sensitive Receptors
The most predominant and noise sensitive land use in Dana
Point is residential. This land use is considered especially noise
sensitive because (1) considerable time is spent by individuals
at home, (2) significant activities occur outdoors, and (3) sleep
disturbance is most likely to occur in a residential area.
Additionally, the City of Dana Point has a number of public and
private educational facilities, churches, a hospital, a library,
senior housing, and park and recreation facilities that are
considered noise sensitive. The location of residential areas,
schools and parks are shown on the General Plan land Use
Policy Map.

Community Noise Measurement Survey
Based upon the identification of the major noise sources and
the location of sensitive receptors, a noise measurement survey
was conducted. The survey is found in the Technical
Appendix. The survey determines existing noise levels at noise
sensitive land uses and provides empirical data for the
correlation and calibration of the computer modeled noise
environment. In addition, the survey provides an accurate
description of the ambient noise levels in various areas
throughout the City. The noise measurements were divided
into two categories; ambient traffic noise and stationary source
measurements.
The ambient traffic noise measurements were designed to
provide a "snapshot" indication of the traffic noise at the
measurement site. The ambient traffic noise measurements were
also used to provide an indication of the validity of the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) traffic noise model used for
the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) noise
projections. CNEL is the average equivalent A-Weighted
sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of five
(5) decibels to sound levels in the evening from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.
and after addition of ten (10) decibels to sound levels in the
night before 7 a.m. and after 10 p.m.
To determine the CNEL noise levels at any one location,
measurements would need to be conducted for at least one 24
hour period and maybe several days. This is impractical to do;
therefore, short-term measurements or a "snapshot" of the
noise environment is made. The "snapshot" is intended to
provide a representative measurement of the noise levels at that
particular location and information on the sources of noise in
the area, and with additional analysis, it provides a check on the
traffic noise model. For Dana Point, the FHWA traffic noise
model appears to estimate the noise levels well, and no
adjustments to the model are recommended.
The stationary source measurements were used to evaluate
several stationary sources of noise in the community and to
evaluate their noise levels in terms of compliance with the
Orange County Noise Ordinance. Noise measurements were
taken near parks, wastewater treatment plants, and other
sources.

The methodology used in the measurements is summarized in
the Appendices of the General Plan (Noise Study). The actual
noise levels, the primary noise sources at each site, and other
pertinent data is also presented in the Appendices.
Community Noise Contours
The noise environment for Dana Point can be described using
noise contours developed for the major noise sources within
the City. Noise contours represent lines of equal noise
exposure, just as the contour lines on a topographic map are
lines of equal elevation. The contours shown on the map are
the 60 and 65 Db CNEL noise level for the traffic noise
contours.
The noise contours should be used as a guide for planning.
The 60 dB CNEL contour defines the Noise Study Zone. This is
the noise level for which any proposed noise sensitive land use
(i.e., residential, hospitals, schools and churches) within this
zone should be evaluated on a project specific basis, the project
may require mitigation to meet City and/or State (Title 24) stan-
dards. The 65 dB CNEL contour describes the noise mitigation
zone. In this zone new or expanded noise sensitive develop-
ments will be permitted only if appropriate mitigation measures
are included such that the City and/or State standards are
achieved.
The contours presented in this report are a graphic representa-
tion of the noise environment. These distances to contour
values are also shown in tabulated format in the Appendices.
Topography and intervening buildings or barriers have a very
complex effect on the propagation of noise.
Noise contours for Dana Point were developed based upon
existing traffic conditions, train operations and environmental
conditions. The assumptions and methods used to develop the
contours are explained in detail in the Appendices of the
General Plan (Noise Study). The contours are expressed in
terms of the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL).
The noise contours for the City of Dana Point are presented in Figures
N-2 and N-3 for existing 1990 and build-out conditions. The 60 and
65 dB CNEL contour levels are shown on these maps. Full size

The bulge in the noise contours on Pacific Coast Highway
between Crown Valley Parkway and Niguel is due to the
absence of soundwalls or topographic effects that would
reduce noise levels. Noise contours were not provided for
many other streets, including Dana Point Harbor Drive and
Camino Capistrano, because the existing traffic levels on these
roadways are currently so low that noise levels do not appear
to be significant at this time (Appendices, Noise Study, Table
A-3).
In Figure N-3, noise contours are only shown for Circulation
Element roadways where the projected 60 CNEL contour
extends beyond the road right-of-way. If the 60 CNEL contour
was not anticipated to extend beyond the road right-of-way
(example, Selva Road), the contour was not plotted. Noise
contours for all roadways with significant noise levels are
plotted. While there are many plans to increase railroad travel,
none of those plans have received environmental clearance;
therefore, the railroad noise levels for the future case were
plotted at the same level as existing. Projects that would
increase railroad usage substantially are subject to California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requirements and would
likely include mitigation measures necessary to bring noise
levels back down to current levels. A noise increase for
Interstate 5 is reflected in the noise contours presented in
Figures N-2 and N-3.
Noise sensitive projects within the 60 CNEL contour may or
may not need noise insulation. A noise study specific for the
project will be necessary to determine what mitigation, if any, is
needed. Noise sensitive projects within the 65 CNEL contour
will definitely need noise mitigation in the form of noise barriers,
additional building sound insulation, etc.
Areas of Special Concern
Interstate 5 Freeway: Some areas of special concern are near
the Interstate 5 freeway. The small section of freeway that
passes through the City from Camino de Estrella to Camino las
Ramblas may exceed City and Caltrans noise standards. Noise
measurements at Site 12 (near Via Lopez and Via Sacramento)
indicate that existing and/or future noise levels are approaching
the Caltrans standard of 67 Leq at the peak hour noise levels
and the City standard of 65 CNEL. A soundwall was not
constructed along this portion of I-5 by Caltrans. However,
Caltrans can be requested to re-evaluate the need for a
                                                       NOISE ELEMENT

soundwall as part of any future projects in this area.
Beach Road: Homes along Beach Road seaward of the railroad
tracks at the south end of Dana Point are in excess of City noise
standards. These homes would benefit from an increase in the
existing noise wall height to bring noise levels down to accept-
able levels. A wall does exist at the site; however, it does not
break line of site to cars on Pacific Coast Highway or the trains
operating on the railroad tracks. Noise attributable to trains was
not directly measured, but is a short-term intensive source of
noise affecting homes in this area.
Golden Lantern: There are several other residential areas that
will experience noise levels in excess of 65 CNEL in future years.
 The residential areas directly adjacent to Golden Lantern
between Pacific Coast Highway and Stonehill will experience
noise levels in the 65 to 70 CNEL range. These noise levels are
not high enough to threaten public health, but will be an
annoyance to residents. This area was constructed before the
County or State had developed noise standards. The homes on
the west side of the street front on Golden Lantern with
driveway access. Sound walls in this area would be ineffective
since sizable gaps in the sound wall would be necessary to
accommodate the driveways.
The homes along the east side of Golden Lantern do not have
driveway access. Improvements along this area, which may be
part of an open space improvement, should consider inclusion
of a noise barrier. The noise barrier may be a berm or a
soundwall.
Pacific Coast Highway/Del Obispo: The mobile home park
north of Pacific Coast Highway, east of Del Obispo, experiences
noise levels in the 65 to 70 CNEL range. Any modifications to
the freeway access ramp or Pacific Coast Highway by Caltrans
should include the construction of sound walls to protect the
mobile home park.
Stonehill Drive: Scattered areas along Stonehill Drive in the
future will experience noise levels in excess of 65 CNEL.
Currently the noise levels along Stonehill Drive are at or slightly
below 65 CNEL. The increase in traffic due to the connection of
Stonehill Drive with Interstate 5 is probably responsible for
most of the noise increase along Stonehill.
Noise impacts on land use were analyzed for the SERRA

Wastewater Treatment Plant. Noise measurements made around and
inside the SERRA Wastewater Treatment Plant suggest that noise
levels attributable to the plant are not in excess of City standards.
Noise Control
A local government has little direct control of transportation noise at
the source. State and Federal agencies have the responsibility to
control vehicle noise emission levels. Mitigation through site planning
and the design and construction of noise barriers (wall, berm, or
combination wall/berm) are the most common ways of alleviating
traffic noise impacts in existing urban environments. Figure N-4
illustrates some of these ways. The effect of site planning and noise
barriers are critically dependent on the geometry between the noise
source and the receiver. Noise reduction generally occurs when the
"line of sight" between the source and receiver is penetrated by a
barrier. The greater the penetration, the greater the noise reduction.
Sound waves will continue to bend around a soundwall; however, the
resultant noise level will usually be at least 5 dB less than noise with a
direct line of sight between the observer and the source. The more the
noise is forced to bend or refract, the greater the noise reduction up to a
maximum of around 20 dB. Setbacks can also be used to provide
partial mitigation or mitigation where a minimal noise reduction is
needed. Moving a residential unit from 50 feet from the centerline to
100 feet from the centerline only reduces the noise levels by 3 to 4.5
dB. That is, doubling the distance from the centerline of the roadway
reduces noise levels by 3 to 4.5 dB. The distance must be quadrupled
to achieve a noise reduction of 6 to 9 dB. This compares to noise
barriers which provide a 5 dB reduction just by breaking line of sight
and can provide up to 29 dB of noise reduction. In general, the higher
the noise barrier the greater the noise reduction. The height necessary,
the barrier materials, and location of barrier are engineered on a project-
by-project basis.
The standards and criteria shown in Tables N-1 and N-2 specify
acceptable limits of noise for various land uses throughout the City.
These standards and criteria will be incorporated into the land use
planning process to reduce future noise and land use incompatibilities.
 Table N-1 presents criteria used to assess the compatibility of
proposed land uses with the noise environment. These criteria are the
basis for the development of the specific

Noise Standards presented in Table N-2 and represent City
policies related to land uses and acceptable noise levels. These
tables are the primary tools which allow the City to ensure
integrated planning for compatibility between land uses and
outdoor noise.
The noise levels presented in Table N-1 represent exterior noise
levels. They should be considered where the receptors are
located. For a residential development, for example, the area of
concern would be the yard areas nearest the roadway. If a wall
or topographic noise barrier exists then this should be
considered in the assessment of the noise levels. The primary
purpose of the noise compatibility matrix is to identify potential
conflicts between proposed land uses and the noise
environment. (The noise standards, Table N-2, should be
consulted for determination of noise compatibility with existing
development). The matrix is usually used at the General Plan or
Zoning level of approvals. If a project falls within Zone A or
Zone B the project is considered compatible with the noise
environment. Zone A implies that no mitigation will be needed.
 Zone B implies that minor soundproofing of the structure may
be needed and should be engineered prior to issuance of
building permits. Zone C indicates that substantial noise
mitigation will be necessary, such as construction of noise
barriers and substantial building sound insulation. However,
projects in Zone C can be successfully mitigated. The project
may be approved for land use and then is mitigated as
necessary to achieve City standards (Table N-2) prior to
issuance of grading permits, building permits, or other
appropriate milestones.
The most effective method to control community noise impacts
from non-transportation noise sources is through application of
the Community Noise Ordinance. Currently the City of Dana
Point uses the County of Orange Noise Ordinance. This
Ordinance is used by the majority of jurisdictions in Orange
County, and is considered to be one of the finest noise
ordinances in the nation. The City will continue to use the
Orange County Noise Ordinance. The County of Orange
Health Department can be contracted by the City to enforce the
Ordinance. To ensure the effectiveness of the Ordinance, the
city staff will receive more education on the application of the
Noise Ordinance and methods of screening potential violators.

    features included in the design.

ISSUE IDENTIFICATION
           Transportation Noise Control
           Within the City of Dana Point are a number of transportation
           related noise sources including railroad operations, a freeway,
           major arterials and collector roadways. These sources are the
           major contributors of noise in Dana Point. Cost effective
           strategies to reduce their influence on the community noise
           environment are an essential part of the Noise Element.
           Noise and Land Use Planning Integration
           Information relative to the existing and future noise environ-
           ment within Dana Point should be integrated into future land
           use planning decision. The Element present the noise
           environment in order that the City may include noise impact
           considerations in development programs. Noise and land use
           compatibility guidelines are presented, as well as noise
           standards for new developments.
           Community Noise Control for Non-Transportation Noise
           Sources
           Residential land uses and areas identified as noise-sensitive
           must be protected from excessive noise from non-transportation
           sources including commercial and industrial centers. These
           impacts are best controlled through effective land use planning
           and the application of a City Noise Ordinance.

                                19                               JULY 9, 1991
             NOISE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
The Dana Point Noise Element's purpose is to provide a quality noise
environment compatible with the public health and welfare and in a reason-
able relationship to land use.
The following goals and policies provide the primary directions for the City of
Dana Point for the effective control of community noise.
TRANSPORTATION NOISE CONTROL
              In those areas where transportation noise represents a threat to
              the public health and welfare, the City will reduce noise hazards
              to safe levels. In those areas where transportation noise
              degrades the environment, but not to an extent that represents
              an immediate hazard to public health and welfare, the City will
              reduce environmental degradation as much as feasible and
              practical within the limits imposed by conflicting objectives.
              Goal 1: Provide for measures to reduce noise impacts from
              transportation noise sources.
              Policy 1.1: Require construction of barriers to mitigate sound
              emissions where necessary or feasible.
              Policy 1.2: Ensure the inclusion of noise mitigation measures
              in the design of new roadway projects in Dana Point.
              Policy 1.3: Reduce transportation noise through proper design
              and coordination of transportation facilities and circulation.
              Policy 1.4: Ensure the effective enforcement of City, State and
              Federal noise levels by all appropriate City staff.
              Policy 1.5: Monitor noise from buses and other vehicular types
              in residential areas, and, when necessary, consider alternative
              circulation routes for those types of vehicles.
              Policy 1.6: Coordinate noise complaints on aircraft overflights
              with the appropriate governmental agency.
                                                                    NOISE ELEMENT
                                    20                                JULY 9, 1991
NOISE AND LAND USE PLANNING INTEGRATION
          Noise and land use incompatibilities can be avoided for new
          developments when noise is properly considered in the
          planning, design, and permitting of a project. The City desires
          to prevent future land use and noise conflicts through the
          planning and approval process.
          Goal 2: Incorporate noise considerations into land use
          planning decisions.
          Policy 2.1: Establish acceptable limits of noise for various land
          uses throughout the community, in accordance with Table N-2.
          Policy 2.2: Ensure acceptable noise levels near schools,
          hospitals, convalescent homes, and other noise sensitive areas,
          in accordance with Table N-1.
          Policy 2.3: Establish standards for all types of noise not
          already governed by local ordinances or preempted by State or
          Federal law.
          Policy 2.4: Require noise reduction techniques in site and
          architectural design and construction where noise reduction is
          necessary.
          Policy 2.5: Discourage locating noise sensitive land uses in
          noisy environments.
NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE CONTROL
          The adoption of a Noise Ordinance consistent with the Orange
          County Noise Ordinance, which is currently in effect, will
          continue to control non-transportation noise impacts. Adop-
          tion of a Noise Ordinance consistent with Orange County's
          Noise Ordinance will facilitate enforcement by the Orange
          County Department of Health.
          The Orange County health Department enforces the current
          Noise Ordinance in the City of Dana Point. Noise complaints
          regarding non-transportation sources received by the City can
          be referred to the Orange County Health Department, and for a
          nominal fee the County will investigate the complaints and
          prosecute violators. The County will only provide this service
          to municipalities whose Noise Ordinance is consistent with the
          County's.

                               21                                JULY 9, 1991
         Goal 3: Develop measures to control non-transportation noise
         impacts.
         Policy 3.1: Adopt a City Noise Ordinance to control excessive
         noise from lawn blowers, trimmers, machinery or other distur-
         bances. This Ordinance should be consistent with the Orange
         County Noise Ordinance to promote mutually enforceable
         standards which result in a quality noise environment.
         Policy 3.2: Evaluate and develop measures to reduce noise
         generated by construction activities.
         Policy 3.3: Establish and maintain coordination among the
         appropriate agencies involved in noise abatement.
RELATED GOALS AND POLICIES
         Certain policies included in the Noise Element serve as coastal
         resources planning and management policies that are part of the
         City's Local Coastal Program (LCP). Table N-3 identifies the
         required components or issue areas of the LCP included in the
         Noise Element.
         The goals and policies described in the Noise Element are
         related to and support subjects included within other General
         Plan Elements. Many goals and policies from the other
         Elements directly or indirectly support the goals and policies of
         the Noise Element. These supporting goals and policies are
         identified in Table N-4.

                             THE NOISE PLAN
The Noise Plan describes the approach to be used in implementing the Noise
Element goals and policies. In order to achieve the goals and objectives of
the Noise Element, an effective implementation program developed within the
constraints of the City's financial and staffing capabilities is necessary. The
underlying purpose is to reduce the number of people exposed to excessive
noise and to minimize the future effect of noise in the City. The following are
the actions that the City should consider implementing to control the impacts
of noise in Dana Point.
TRANSPORTATION NOISE CONTROL
              The most efficient and effective means of controlling noise from
              transportation systems is to reduce noise at the source.
              However, since the City has little direct control over source
              noise levels because of State and Federal preemption (i.e., State
              Motor Vehicle Noise Standards and Federal Air Regulations),
              policies should be focused on reducing the impact of the noise
              on the community. Cooperative efforts with State and Federal
              offices are essential.
              Within the City of Dana Point are a number of transportation
              related noise sources including train tracks, a freeway, major
              arterials, collector roadways and a waste water plant. These
              sources are the major contributors of noise in Dana Point. Cost
              effective strategies to reduce their influence on the community
              noise environment are an essential part of the Noise Element.
              Strategy 1
              Ensure the employment of noise mitigation measures in the
              design of roadway improvement projects are consistent with
              funding capability. Support efforts by the California Depart-
              ment of Transportation and others to provide for acoustical
              protection of existing noise sensitive land uses affected by
              these projects. Consideration of soundwalls will be requested
              as part of any Caltrans roadway project. Of particular concern
              will be the Stonehill Drive/freeway connection and
              improvements to the Pacific Coast Highway freeway connec-
              tion. Additionally, Caltrans will be requested to review the
              sound wall design along the freeway near the east end of the
              City.
                                                                    NOISE ELEMENT
                                        25                            JULY 9, 1991
          Strategy 2
          Encourage the use of walls and berms in the design of residen-
          tial and other noise sensitive land uses that are adjacent to
          major roads, commercial, or industrial areas.
          Strategy 3
          Provide for continued evaluation of truck movements and
          routes in the City to provide effective separation from
          residential or other noise sensitive land uses.
          Strategy 4
          Enforce the State Motor Vehicle noise standards for cars,
          trucks, and motorcycles through coordination with the
          California Highway Patrol and the Dana Point Police services.
NOISE AND LAND USE PLANNING INTEGRATION
          Information relative to the existing and build-out noise environ-
          ments within Dana Point should be integrated into future land
          use planning decisions. The Element presents the existing and
          build-out noise environments so that the City will include noise
          impact considerations in development programs. Noise and
          land use compatibility guidelines are presented, as well as noise
          standards for new developments. Community noise consider-
          ations are to be incorporated into land use planning. These
          measures are intended to prevent future noise and land-use
          incompatibilities.
          Strategy 5
          Enforce standards that specify acceptable limit of noise for
          various land uses throughout the City. Table N-1 shows
          criteria used to assess the compatibility of proposed land uses
          with the noise environment. These criteria ar the bases of
          specific Noise Standards. These standards, presented in Table
          N-2, define City policy related to land uses and acceptable
          noise levels.
                                                              NOISE ELEMENT
                                   26                            JULY 9, 1991
         Strategy 6
         Incorporation of noise reduction features during site planning
         to mitigate anticipated noise impacts on affected noise sensitive
         land uses. New development will be permitted only if appropri-
         ate mitigation measures are included such that the standards
         contained in this Element are met.
         Strategy 7
         Enforce the provisions of the State of California Uniform
         Building Code which specifies that the indoor noise levels for
         multi-family residential living spaces not exceed 45 dB CNEL
         due to the combined effect of all noise sources. The State
         requires implementation of this standard when the outdoor
         noise levels exceed 60 dB CNEL. The Noise Referral Zones (60
         dB CNEL) can be used to determine when this standard needs
         to be addressed. The Uniform Building Code (specifically, the
         California Administrative Code, Title 24, Part 6, Division T25,
         Chapter 1, Subchapter 1, Article 4, Sections T25-28) requires
         that "Interior community noise levels (CNEL/LDN) with
         windows closed, attributable to exterior sources shall not
         exceed an annual CNEL or LDN of 45 dB in any habitable
         room". The code requires that this standard be applied to all
         new hotels, motels, apartment houses and dwellings other than
         detached single-family dwellings. The City will also, as a matter
         of policy, apply this standard to single family dwellings.
NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE CONTROL
         People, as well as areas identified as noise sensitive, must be
         protected from excessive noise from non-transportation sources
         including commercial and industrial centers. These impacts are
         most effectively controlled through the application of a City
         Noise Ordinance.
         Strategy 8
         Adopt and enforce the current County Noise Ordinance as the
         City's and continue to apply the Noise Ordinance to ensure that
         City residents are not exposed to excessive noise levels from
         stationary noise sources. The Ordinance protects people from
         non-transportation related noise sources such as music,
         machinery and pumps, air conditioners, the SERRA Wastewater
         Treatment Plant and truck traffic on private property. The
         Noise Ordinance does not apply to motor vehicle noise on
                                                              NOISE ELEMENT

public streets, but it does apply to vehicles on private property.
 The Noise Ordinance is designed to protect quiet residential
areas from stationary noise sources. The noise levels encour-
aged by the Ordinance are typical of a quiet residential area.
Strategy 9
Require that any proposed development projects, demonstrate
compliance with the City Noise Element and Ordinance prior to
approval.
Strategy 10
Require construction activity to comply with limit established in
the City Noise Ordinance.
Strategy 11
Designate the Community Development Department to act as
the noise control coordinator. This will ensure the continued
operation of noise enforcement efforts of the City.
Strategy 12
Review current policy and contracts with the County of Orange
Health Department to enforce the Dana Point Noise Ordinance.
In cases where the Health Department may have a conflict,
contract with an outside firm or agency to conduct compliance
monitoring.
Strategy 13
Limit delivery hours for stores with loading areas or docks
fronting siding, bordering or gaining access on driveways
adjacent to noise sensitive areas.         Exemption from this
restriction shall be based solely on attaining full compliance
with the nighttime noise limits of the Noise Ordinance.

         INTRODUCTION TO THE PUBLIC FACILITIES/
                  GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
The City of Dana Point is part of a large and fast-growing region. Population
growth and the provision of public facilities must be viewed in this regional
context. However, assuring adequate levels of public service and maintaining
a desirable quality of life through regulation of growth are options available to
the City within certain jurisdictional, fiscal, and legal limits. The Public
Facilities/Growth Management Element establishes a plan for ensuring that
future growth is coordinated with the provision of public services and
facilities so that desirable level of service standards and community qualities
important to the citizens are maintained. This element addresses growth
management issues on a local and regional level. The goals, policies, and
plan contained in this element stem from considerable background research,
which is summarized in the Public Facilities/Growth Management Technical
Report.
PURPOSE OF THE PUBLIC FACILITIES/GROWTH MANAGEMENT
ELEMENT
                The Public Facilities/Growth Management Element has two
                interrelated purposes: to plan for adequate public services and
                facilities, and to coordinate new development with the
                provision of public facilities. While many public facilities issues
                will be addressed independently from growth management
                issues, a significant portion of the Element deals with the
                overlap between the two subjects.
                The Public Facilities/Growth Management Element is an
                optional Element of the General Plan. However, once adopted
                this Element carries the same force and effect as a required
                Element and must be internally consistent with other Elements
                of the General Plan.
                                                                 PUBLIC FACILITIES/

SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
          This Element consists of two main parts: Goals and Policies,
          and the Plan. The introduction describes the purpose, scope,
          content, and related plans and programs. The Goals and
          Policies Section sets forth policies to guide the provision of
          public services and to coordinate new development with the
          provision of these services. The final section focuses upon the
          geographic (locational) aspects of, and standards for, future
          public facilities and growth management planning.
          The public facilities component of this Element addresses both
          infrastructure and public services. Infrastructure includes
          sewer, water, and storm drain systems, as well as utilities, such
          as electrical, gas, and communication systems. Public services
          include police, fire, public schools, emergency medical, civic,
          and cultural facilities and services.
          The growth management component of the Element addresses
          local as well as regional growth management issues, including
          State laws and County initiatives affecting growth management
          in the City.
          The Element includes summary descriptions of existing public
          facilities and services and growth management programs
          affecting the City. More detailed information about existing
          services, facilities, and programs is provided in the Public
          Facilities/Growth Management Element Technical Report.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
          There are several independent agencies involved in the
          planning and operation of public facilities in the City. In
          addition, there are various County, regional and State plans and
          laws affecting growth management in the City.
          The City's sewer collection and treatment and water distribution
          systems are operated by six independent districts. While
          several of the districts have short-term expansion plans, none
          of them have formal master plans; the districts improve and
          expand existing systems on demand.

                                     2                           JULY 9, 1991
The City contracts with the County of Orange for police, fire,
library, and regional flood control services. The financing of
the expansion of these services is provided for in the Facilities
Implementation Plan (FIP) component of the Orange County
Growth Management Plan. The FIPs, updated annually,
analyze existing service adequacy and present plans for future
facilities. Service level standards for many of these services are
provided for in the Orange County General Plan and separate
master plans, and are reflected in the FIPs.
With respect to growth management, there are regional plans,
County plans, State legislation, and a County initiative that
affect growth management in Dana Point. All of these have a
direct bearing on public facilities/growth management planning
in the City.
In August, 1988, the County of Orange adopted a Growth
Management Plan Element which presents a conceptual frame-
work for coordinating traffic facilities and public facilities and
services with new development. The Growth Management Plan
Element also spawned several plans and programs, including
the Development Monitoring Program, which evaluates the
extent of new development and compliance with phasing
requirements, and the Facilities Implementation Plans, which
evaluate public facility needs and propose financing
mechanisms. The Orange County Growth Management Plan
Element and related plans are important to the City because
these plans affect the contract services provided to the City by
the County.
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
has approved a Growth Management Plan for the entire SCAG
region. While SCAG has no authority to implement the Growth
Management Plan, some of the plan's principal goals, such as
improved jobs/housing balance, are being implemented through
the Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP), which the South
Coast Air Quality Management District does have the authority
to implement. Regulation XV, which requires employers of more
than 100 persons to prepare trip reduction plans, is one of the
mandated components of the AQMP.
State Assembly Bill 471, which implements the congestion
management provisions of Proposition 111 (approved by the
California voters in June, 1990), requires all jurisdictions to
participate in preparing a Congestion Management Plan (CMP)
                                                  PUBLIC FACILITIES/

to reduce traffic congestion. The City of Dana Point must
cooperate with Orange County in preparing such a CMP.
The most comprehensive legislation affecting growth manage-
ment in Dana Point is Measure M, approved by the County
voters in November, 1990. The measure requires each jurisdic-
tion in the County to adopt a Growth Management Plan with
specific contents and guidelines. Because its requirements are
so comprehensive, Measure M is perhaps the most important
piece of legislation currently affecting growth management in
Dana Point.
The existence of numerous local agency, County, regional, and
State plans points up the importance of coordinated
inter-jurisdictional planning, one of the key emphases of this
Element.

   PUBLIC FACILITIES/GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
                             GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of this Element focus upon ensuring that the City is provided
with adequate public services and facilities and creates a Growth Management Plan
that ensures coordination between new development and public services and facilities.
 The goals stem from issues raised during the background research and public
meetings.
This section is organized according to eight distinct goals. The first six goals deal
primarily with the provision of public services and facilities on a local level. The last
two goals deal with growth management and the regional issues related to public
facilities and services.
Each set of goals and policies is preceded by a summary of conditions and issues
which have led to their formulation. More detailed information about these conditions
and issues is provided in the Technical Report.
WATER AND SEWER SERVICE
                 The City of Dana Point is served by four water districts: the
                 Capistrano Beach County, Capistrano Valley, Moulton Niguel, and
                 South Coast Water Sanitary Districts. The vast majority of the water
                 distribution lines in these districts are under thirty years old and
                 reported to be in good-to-excellent condition.
                 Four sanitary districts serve the City, including the Capistrano Beach
                 and Dana Point Districts, and the Moulton Niguel and South Coast
                 Water Districts. The condition of the sewer lines in these districts is
                 generally very good, with the exception of lines in the Capistrano
                 Beach Sanitary District, many of which need to be repaired or
                 replaced.
                 The water and sanitary districts serving the City each have their own
                 board of directors and make policy decisions independently from the
                 other districts. This leads to varying levels of service between the
                 districts.
                 The South Coast and Moulton Niguel Water Districts have developed
                 wastewater reclamation facilities which allow for the re-use of
                                                                        PUBLIC FACILITIES/

wastewater for landscaping purposes in certain areas of Dana Point.
However, the Dana Point and Capistrano Beach Sanitary Districts lack
such systems. The South East Regional Reclamation Authority, or
SERRA, which provides sewage treatment for these two districts, is
currently investigating the possibility of developing a reclamation
system that would serve these districts.
The following policies are directed toward maintaining the quality of
water and wastewater service in the City.
GOAL 1: Encourage adequate water and sewer service.
Policy 1.1: Work closely with local-serving water and sewer districts
in determining future area needs and expanding sewer service to the
Headlands area, when necessary. (Coastal Act/30250, 30255, 30254)
Policy 1.2: Encourage the use of drought resistant landscaping to
reduce overall water use.
Policy 1.3: Support public education programs for water conserva-
tion.
Policy 1.4: Support the appropriate regional agencies in developing
and utilizing reclaimed water facilities.
Policy 1.5: Consider requiring new development to pay for the cost
of extending reclaimed water lines in the City.
Policy 1.6: Support the efforts of water and sewer agencies to
encourage recycling of wastes and proper disposal of household
wastes and waste oil.
Policy 1.7: Evaluate the varying levels of service provided by the
water and sewer districts serving the City and support increased
coordination among these districts in order to provide consistent
service levels.
Policy 1.8: Encourage and support water and sewer districts in the
effective management of their revenue resources to ensure equitable
service throughout the City.

STORM DRAINAGE
         The City's storm drain system consists of regional and local facilities.
         The regional facilities, including the San Juan and Salt Creek storm
         channels, are owned and maintained by the Orange County Flood
         Control District. The local storm drains, once owned and maintained
         by the County, became the responsibility of the City upon its
         incorporation. Currently, the City contracts with the Orange County
         Environmental Management Agency to maintain the local storm drains.
         While the Salt Creek channel through Dana Point has undergone all
         necessary improvements to convey a 100-year flood, the San Juan
         Creek Channel has not. The Orange County Flood Control District is
         in the process of planning and executing additional improvements to
         the San Juan Channel so that it will be able to convey a 100-year flood.
         Local storm drains throughout the City were constructed on a
         piecemeal basis as new development was approved. Information
         about the type and age of these facilities has not be assembled, and the
         condition of these facilities is generally not known. One of the City's
         main public facilities tasks is to assess the condition of these facilities
         and develop a capital improvements program for the system.
         A 1989 Orange County report evaluated flooding problems in the
         Capistrano Beach area. The report recommends specific improve-
         ments, such as new curbs and improved storm drains, to address the
         flooding problem; however, these improvements have not yet been
         made. According to Orange County Flood Control District staff, the
         flooding problems in this area require additional study.
         The following policies are incorporated into this Element to ensure that
         local facilities are maintained and replaced as needed.
         GOAL 2: Maintain and improve portions of the storm drainage
         system for which the City is responsible and encourage adequate
         maintenance of other portions of that system.
         Policy 2.1: Identify local storm drainage deficiencies and develop a
         capital improvements program for the correction and
         replacement of aging or inadequate drainage system components.

          Policy 2.2: Work with the Orange County Flood Control District in
          ensuring the adequacy of regional storm drainage facilities. (Coastal
          Act/30235, 30236, 30253)
SOLID WASTE CONTROL
          As landfills rapidly reach their capacities and new landfill sites become
          increasingly difficult to establish, the need to reduce the solid waste
          generation rate has become crucial. Assembly Bill (AB) 939 requires
          that local jurisdictions reduce their solid waste streams by 25% by the
          year 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. In addition, the bill requires all
          cities to prepare a Source Reduction and Recycling (SRR) Element to
          implement the mandated waste reduction goals. The City of Dana
          Point is currently collaborating with the Cities of San Clemente and
          San Juan Capistrano in preparing the SRR Element.
          The City contracts with Solag Disposal, Inc. for trash pick-up and
          disposal. The City has also contracted with Solag to conduct a pilot
          residential recycling program. Initiated in September, 1990, this
          program will be evaluated and possibly extended after the first six
          months.
          By State law, the County of Orange must prepare an Integrated Waste
          Management Plan by 1994 which will be designed to coordinate
          implementation of the SRR Elements prepared by individual cities in
          the County. Therefore, it is important that the City work with the
          County in preparing its SRR Element.
          The following policies are designed to ensure that the City has
          adequate solid waste disposal services and will endeavor to reduce its
          solid waste stream.
          GOAL 3: Provide necessary control of solid waste.
          Policy 3.1: Continue to work with the cities of San Clemente and San
          Juan Capistrano in the development of an SRR Element which will
          include a recycling plan.
          Policy 3.2: Identify and evaluate alternatives to reduce solid waste in
          accordance with AB 939.
          Policy 3.3: Support litter clean up efforts on public and private
          properties.
                                                                  PUBLIC FACILITIES/

         Policy 3.4: Work closely with the County of Orange in developing
         strategies and programs to manage solid and hazardous wastes.
         Policy 3.5: Support recycling by requiring areas for recycling bins.
LAW ENFORCEMENT, FIRE, AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES
         Part of the City's quality of life is dependent upon the ability of
         residents and business owners to receive adequate protection during
         emergencies such as fires or accidents. The City contracts with the
         County of Orange for law enforcement, fire protection, and paramedic
         services. Currently, levels of service for these services meet the
         standards established by the Orange County Sheriff's and Fire
         Departments. According to the Orange County Facilities
         Implementation Plans for the areas including Dana Point, levels of
         service for the Sheriff's Department are affected by traffic congestion.
         Therefore, it is important that traffic and law enforcement service and
         facility planning be coordinated.
         In order to provide more direct contact between the Sheriff's
         Department and the community, the City has set up a special
         community service unit in Dana Point City Hall, staffed by two
         deputies.
         Currently there are approximately 20 neighborhood watch groups in
         the City, ranging in size from small cul-de-sacs to several blocks.
         Interest in forming neighborhood watch groups in the Doheny Park
         Road area has been difficult to generate.
         While there are adequate emergency medical facilities in the City, there
         is a shortage of primary care physicians. The following goals and
         policies focus upon maintaining adequate levels of emergency services
         in the City and enhancing these services where the opportunities and
         needs exist.
         GOAL 4: Maintain desirable levels of police, fire, and emergen-
         cy medical services in the City.
         Policy 4.1: Periodically evaluate services and service criteria to ensure
         the City has adequate police, fire, and emergency medical services.
         (Coastal Act/30254)
         Policy 4.2: Review the space needs for the local sheriff community
                                                                PUBLIC FACILITIES/

         service unit and provide adequate space.
         Policy 4.3: Increase community participation in the neighborhood
         watch groups and other public safety service programs.
         Policy 4.4: Assure adequate sites for primary care (internists, family
         practitioners, and obstetricians-gynecologists) facilities in the
         community.
         Policy 4.5: Coordinate with the Orange County Sheriff's and Fire
         Departments for the continued provision of adequate law enforcement
         and fire protection.
         Policy 4.6: Coordinate sheriff facility and traffic facility planning
         where necessary to maintain adequate levels of law enforcement
         service.
COMMUNITY, CIVIC, EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL FACILITIES
         The City's community, educational and cultural facilities are
         important vehicles for political, social, and cultural enrichment
         in the community.
         The Capistrano Unified School District (CUSD) administers
         public schools for Dana Point. Although two of the District's
         elementary schools are located within the City, most of the
         schools attended by Dana Point students are located outside
         the City. The District has experienced rapid growth in recent
         years, with the result that enrollment at most of the schools
         attended by Dana Point students exceed their original design
         capacity. While temporary classrooms are used to house the
         extra students, new permanent facilities are needed. Because
         State funding sources are scarce and give priority to schools
         with year-round calendars, the District is considering convert-
         ing to year-round operations in order to obtain State funds for
         new facilities.
         The County of Orange library system provides library services
         to Dana Point through the Dana-Niguel Branch Library and two
         other libraries in the Cities of San Clemente and San Juan
         Capistrano. Based upon the ratio of library size to population,
         service levels at these libraries meet County of Orange stan-
         dards. Based upon level of service criteria and planned
         facilities, these levels of service will continue to be maintained
                                                              PUBLIC FACILITIES/

through the year 2010.
Temporarily located in 10,000 square feet of office space on
Golden Lantern, the Dana Point City Hall currently houses
financial management and community development services.
Other City services, such as police, fire, engineering, public
works, maintenance, and parks and recreation, are provided
under contract or by special district. The current City Hall is
staffed to capacity and lacks adequate storage, exhibition, and
public meeting space. For these reasons, and because the City
will likely expand the services it provides directly to the public
in the future, it will be necessary to relocate to a larger site or
increase its current leased space.
Within the City of Dana Point, several civic organizations exist.
The community is served by the Dana Point Arts Council, a
non-profit organization which sponsors art shows and drama;
the Dana Point Historical Society, a non-profit organization
which promotes awareness of the City's past; and, the Orange
County Marine Institute, which operates educational and
cultural programs related to ocean biology and maritime history.
 In addition, the Dana Point City Council has appointed a
five-member Cultural Commission which is charged with
promoting cultural enrichment in the City. However, the lack of
space (public auditoriums, exhibition space, meeting rooms)
limits the cultural activities which can take place in the City.
The goals and policies which follow attempt to ensure the
provision of adequate community, civic, cultural, and educa-
tional facilities in the City.
GOAL 5: Encourage adequate community facilities including
libraries, schools, civic and cultural facilities.
Policy 5.1: Cooperate with the Orange County Public Library
to periodically assess library service needs for the community.
Policy 5.2: Assess the City's needs for a governmental/civic
center and identify suitable sites.
Policy 5.3: Develop a capital improvements plan to include
service standards and a mitigation fee program for new
development.
Policy 5.4: Consider the need for multipurpose meeting rooms

           and space for community events.
           Policy 5.5: Consider the need for a local historical museum
           (Coastal Act/30213).
           Policy 5.6: Assess the cultural facilities needs for the City,
           including the need to expand existing facilities.
           Policy 5.7: Encourage well-planned neighborhood and commu-
           nity park facilities that are within convenient distance to all
           residential areas.
           Policy 5.8: Coordinate the approval of new development with
           the capacity of the Capistrano Unified School District.
           Policy 5.9: Ensure to the extent feasible that adequate sites are
           available for public facilities, churches, schools, museum(s),
           government offices, a civic/cultural center or other facilities that
           may serve the public interest.
           Policy 5.10: Develop a program for public art.
           Policy 5.11: Consider creating various funding mechanisms,
           such as developer impact fees, to contribute toward the cost of
           new civic facilities.
           Policy 5.12: Coordinate the provision of community facilities
           with the development of new parks and recreational facilities.
PUBLIC UTILITIES
           The San Diego Gas and Electric Company and Southern
           California Gas Company provide electrical and natural gas
           service to the City of Dana Point. No deficiency exists in the
           existing electric and natural gas systems in the City, and both
           companies state that they will be able to expand to accommo-
           date any future growth in the City.
           The City relies principally upon conventional energy resources
           to meet its needs. However, active solar heating is relatively
           cost effective and is currently underutilized in the City.

        Pacific Bell provides the City with telecommunications service,
        including telephone service and fiber optics. Pacific Bell
        representatives state that they are able to expand their
        telephone and fiber optic facilities on demand. Although the
        company began undergrounding telephone lines in the City
        during the mid-1960s, many of the lines are still above ground.
        With the exception of one of the City's mobile home parks, all
        areas of the City have access to cable service, provided by
        Dimension Cable. The City is under a 15-year contract with
        Dimension Cable to operate this service in the City. The
        contract, approved prior to incorporation, does not provide
        many services which the City desires, such as coverage of City
        Council meetings, cable equipment for public schools, and
        Public Education Government (PEG) access.
        The following goals and policies are intended to maintain,
        improve, and expand utility systems in the City.
        GOAL 6. Maintain, improve, and expand utilities including
        natural gas, electricity, and communications.
        Policy 6.1: Where feasible, provide underground utility lines in
        all neighborhoods and continue to underground utility lines in
        future developments.
        Policy 6.2: Promote enhanced access to governmental
        proceedings and information through cable television.
        Policy 6.3: Encourage the use of solar energy to supplement
        conventional heating systems.
GROWTH MANAGEMENT
        The City of Dana Point has few remaining large, undeveloped parcels
        of land. As a result, there are relatively few opportunities for major
        new development within its boundaries. However, as part of a
        fast-growing region, the City is strongly impacted by surrounding
        development. In addition, the City receives many of its public services
        through independent agencies, including Orange County.            Most
        importantly, the City is subject to several major County, regional and
        State growth management plans and laws. For these reasons, the
        City's Growth Management Plan must have a strong regional focus.

A brief review of the local and regional issues that provide the basis for
the growth management goals and policies is provided.
Local Growth Management Issues
As indicated, there are relatively few opportunities for major new
development in the City. Roughly 7.5% of the City's land, or 300,
acres, is vacant. Major vacant lands include the Dana Point Headlands,
vacant land in the Monarch Beach area, and a long strip of vacant land
adjacent to the east side of San Juan Creek between Pacific Coast
Highway and Stonehill Drive.
Although the potential for new development in the City is somewhat
limited, the City's public services and facilities, including its
transportation facilities and open space resources, will be impacted.
As a result, the City will have general service standards for all public
facilities and develop periodic monitoring programs to ensure
adherence to service levels.
Regional Growth Management Issues
The State, regional, and Orange County plans and laws affecting the
City are varied and complex. They include the Orange County
Growth Management Plan, the SCAG Growth Management Plan,
State Assembly Bill 471, and Measure M (Orange County). Of all of
these, Measure M will have the most direct and significant impact
upon the City's Growth Management Plan. Nevertheless, the other
plans and legislation are important and must be addressed in the Plan
as well.
Orange County Growth Management Plan: The Orange County
Growth Management Plan Element establishes the conceptual
framework for managing growth in Orange County. The Element
includes provisions regarding jobs/housing balance, traffic levels of
service standards, traffic improvement programs, and public facility
plans. The most important parts of the County Plan for Dana Point
are the Facilities Implementation Plans and the Development Monitor-
ing Program.
The Facilities Implementation Plans (FIPs) analyze existing traffic and
public facility levels of service and, based upon adopted standards,
establish a financing plan for new facilities. Affected facilities include
transportation, sheriff, library, fire, and storm drains. Because the
                                                        PUBLIC FACILITIES/

City contracts with Orange County for these services, these plans
directly affect the City. The City should coordinate with the County
in maintaining and evaluating levels of service for these facilities. The
existing levels of service prescribed by the FIPs are discussed in the
Plan portion of this element.
The purpose of the Development Monitoring Program (DMP) is to
monitor new development, service delivery, and regional and State
growth management legislation, and make recommendations for
responding to new information and changing conditions. Because the
recommendations of the DMP can affect service levels in Dana Point,
the City will need to monitor and perhaps cooperate in the preparation
of the DMP.
SCAG Growth Management Plan: The SCAG Growth Manage-
ment Plan recommends ways to redirect the region's growth in order to
minimize congestion and better protect the environment. While SCAG
lacks the authority to mandate implementation of the Growth
Management Plan, other agencies, such as the Air Quality
Management District, are authorized to mandate implementation of the
Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP), a program related to the
Growth Management Plan which follows its major provisions.
The Air Quality Management Plan mandates a variety of measures to
reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality, including the
Regulation XV Commuter Program and the requirement for each
jurisdiction to develop an Air Quality Element. These and other
measures must be implemented gradually over several years. The City
is subject to all AQMP requirements for local jurisdictions and must
be prepared to implement them.
Assembly Bill (AB) 471: AB 471, as subsequently modified by
Assembly Bill 1791, requires every urbanized city and county with a
population of 50,000 or more to adopt a Congestion Management Plan
(CMP). A city or county which does not comply with the CMP will
lose gas tax revenues to which it would otherwise be entitled. Since
the City of Dana Point has under 50,000 people, adoption of its own
CMP is not required. However, the City is required to participate in
the CMP developed by Orange County.
Among other things, the CMP must include traffic level of service
standards, a trip reduction program, and a 7-year capital improvements
program for traffic and transit. Many of the AB 471 requirements are
the same or similar to the requirements of Measure M (discussed
below). Thus, in addition to working with the County of Orange in
                                                       PUBLIC FACILITIES/

preparing a CMP, the City should identify ways in which the require-
ments of both measures can be satisfied simultaneously.
Measure M: Measure M, the Traffic Improvement and Growth
Management Ordinance adopted by Orange County voters in
November, 1990, requires each City and the County to adopt a
Growth Management Plan according to specific requirements and
guidelines. Although the broad framework for the required Plan has
been established, specific guidelines have not. The specific guidelines
are to be developed by the City-County Coordination Committee or
successor agency by April 1, 1991, and individual jurisdictions will
then have one year to prepare their plans for review.
In order to be certified, each Growth Management Plan must follow an
established framework, which includes specifying traffic level of
service standards, developing a seven year capital improvements
program, adopting a transportation systems management Ordinance,
developing a plan for inter-jurisdictional planning forums, adopting
service standards for various public services, and other measures (see
the Dana Point Public Facilities/Growth Management Plan for a list of
all requirements). Due to its comprehensive nature this Plan must
form the core of the City's strategy for managing growth.
The purpose of the following goal and accompanying policies is to
ensure that the local and regional growth issues outlined above are
comprehensively addressed.
GOAL 7: Develop a Growth Management Plan which ensures
that growth and development are based upon the City's ability to
provide an adequate circulation system and public facilities
pursuant to the Countywide Growth Management Plan Compo-
nent and the Traffic Improvement and Growth Management
Ordinance (Measure M), and which preserves the City's quality
of life and natural resources while protecting its fiscal well-
being.
Policy 7.1: Adopt Orange County level of service standards for law
enforcement, fire, library, and storm drains, and Capistrano Bay Park
and Recreation District standards for parks and open space (see Table
PF-1).
Policy 7.2: Within three years of the issuance of the first building
permit for a development project or within five years of the first
grading permit for said development project, whichever occurs first,
the necessary improvements to transportation facilities to which the

project contributes measurable traffic must be constructed and
completed to attain Level of Service (LOS) "C" at the intersections on
primary arterials, secondary arterials and local streets, and LOS "D" at
intersections on major arterials and State highways under the sole
control of the City/County.
Policy 7.3: Develop a program to monitor new development to ensure
compliance with adopted level of service standards.
Policy 7.4: Require that all development projects participate in
comprehensive public facility financing plans on a pro-rata basis as a
condition of development approval, except where an increased level of
participation exceeding these requirements is established through
negotiated legal mechanisms.
Policy 7.5: Require all new development to pay its share of the costs
of mitigating its traffic impacts, including regional impacts. Work with
other jurisdictions to determine minimally acceptable impact fee levels.
Policy 7.6: Require that all development be phased in accordance with
a Comprehensive Phasing Program (CPP). The CPP shall include
development phasing plans which establish phasing allocation
commensurate with roadway and public facility capacities and an
overall buildout development plan which can be supported by the
implementation of the planned infrastructure.
Policy 7.7: Develop a Capital Improvement Program to meet and
maintain adopted level of service standards for traffic and public
services.
Policy 7.8:      Promote traffic reduction strategies through TDM
measures.

INTER-JURISDICTIONAL COORDINATION AND COOPERATION ON
GROWTH MANAGEMENT ISSUES
          Due to the number of agencies involved in growth managem-
          ent-- including the State of California, SCAG, the South Coast
          Air Quality Management District, the County of Orange, and
          local jurisdictions the City must coordinate its growth manage-
          ment efforts closely with these other agencies.
          There are several key areas discussed below in which
          inter-jurisdictional coordination and cooperation are important.
          Facility Implementation Plans: The Orange County Facility
          Implementation Plans (FIPs) are essentially conceptual planning
          and financing plans for sheriff, fire, storm drain, library, and
          transportation services in the County. These plans address the
          planning and financing of many of the City's contract services.
          The City will evaluate the service standards contained in the
          FIPs in order to make sure they meet the City's needs. Further-
          more, in the FIPs, the County of Orange suggests that local
          jurisdictions may need to assist with financing facilities for
          which funding is uncertain (such as sheriff and library
          services). Therefore, the City will consider working with the
          County to evaluate its potential participation in funding
          mechanisms (i.e., the Fee Program for sheriff and library
          services).

                                    19                            JULY 9, 1991
Development Monitoring Program:              The Development
Monitoring Program (also part of the County Growth Manage-
ment Plan) is both a monitoring and policy advisory document.
The program's main purposes are to monitor the County's
various phasing plans and facility levels of service, examine
State and regional growth management plans and legislation,
and offer recommendations for responding to new information
and changing conditions. The County is considering asking
local jurisdictions to assist in the development monitoring
process. Because the facilities and services evaluated by the
Development Monitoring Program directly impact the City, the
City will consider working with the County on future
development monitoring.
City-County Coordination Committee:            The City-County
Coordination Committee is an interjurisdictional committee
recently formed to address countywide growth issues. The
Committee has a governing board consisting of three members
of the Orange County Board of Supervisors as well as three
City Council members from Orange County cities, including
Dana Point.
The Committee has the potential to serve many functions. One
of these functions will be to develop the guidelines for the
required Measure M Growth Management Plan. According to
the County Administrative Office personnel who staff the
committee, its purposes and functions are still being defined.
The City should continue its involvement with the City-County
Coordination Committee as that committee becomes a more
important vehicle for inter-jurisdictional cooperation and agent
of countywide growth management policy.
Neighboring Cities: Development in neighboring cities, such
as Laguna Niguel, San Juan Capistrano, and San Clemente, has
a direct impact upon traffic levels of service in the City.
Therefore, the amount and location of new development in
these jurisdictions is of major importance to the City. The City
will consider developing agreements with these jurisdictions for
                                                 PUBLIC FACILITIES/

mutual review of future plans and development projects.
The goal and policies below are designed to ensure that the
City coordinate to the greatest extent possible with other local
and regional agencies in managing growth.
GOAL 8: Promote inter-jurisdictional coordination and
cooperation on growth management issues.
Policy 8.1: Work with the City-County Coordination Com-
mittee to formulate a coordinated strategy for dealing with
regional plan requirements, such as requirements of the AQMP
(including jobs/housing balance), AB 471, Measure M, and to
discuss multi-jurisdictional impacts and appropriate mitigation
measures.
Policy 8.2: Work with adjacent jurisdictions to develop agree-
ments for mutual review and conditioning of new development
projects.
Policy 8.3: Consider working with the County of Orange and
other public service and facility providers to develop mecha-
nisms to require new development to pay for a pro-rata share of
the cost of expanding services and facilities.
Policy 8.4: Explore cooperative efforts with the County of
Orange in the Development Monitoring Program, including
monitoring of facility implementation, service delivery, growth
levels, and regional and State growth management legislation.
Policy 8.5: Participate as required under existing agreements in
the Coastal Area Road Improvements (CARITS) Fee Program.
Policy 8.6: Cooperate with the County of Orange in preparing a
Congestion Management Plan pursuant to the requirements of
AB 471 in order to receive the City's share of State gas tax
revenues.
Policy 8.7: Assess and reconcile differences between the AB

                          General Plan are also important in addressing public facility and
                          growth management issues. The provision of acceptable levels
                          of service for law enforcement, fire protection, and paramedic
                          services relate directly to the Public Safety Element. The

                          Safety Element. The maintenance and establishment of new
                          funding mechanisms for City services is an issue in the
                          Economic Development Element that relates directly to this

     PUBLIC FACILITIES/GROWTH MANAGEMENT PLAN
The Public Facilities/Growth Management Plan has two parts: the Growth
Management Plan, and the Public Facilities Plan. The Growth Management
Plan describes the City's integrated approach to growth management and
depicts land areas in the City most likely to be subject to the Plan. The Public
Facilities Plan describes the location and existing level of service standards
for the City's public services.
While these plans are described separately, they are strongly interrelated.
For example, the Growth Management Plan calls for coordinating with the
County of Orange in future public services planning and adopting level of
service standards for public services.
THE GROWTH MANAGEMENT PLAN
               In terms of new development, there are certain areas of the City
               that will be the most strongly affected by the City's Growth
               Management Plan. These include primarily large areas of
               vacant and underutilized land. Figure PF-1 shows the location
               of these lands.
               The City's Growth Management Plan includes all of the
               components required by Measure M, the Traffic Improvement
               and Growth Management Ordinance, as well as additional
               components tailored to the City's unique needs and goals. In
               terms of the Measure M requirements, this Element establishes
               a basic policy framework for managing growth, as well as
               specific level of service standards for public facilities.
               Additional implementation programs independent of this
               Element will be required in order to implement the Growth
               Management Plan.
               The City's Growth Management Plan includes the following
               main components. The first six of these components are
               intended to comply with Measure M requirements:
               Traffic Level of Service Goals: Policy 7.2 of this Element
               requires that development make necessary improvements to the
                                                                 PUBLIC FACILITIES/
                                                     GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT

circulation system to maintain acceptable LOS levels at
intersections under City control. Roadway expansions will be
planned as part of the Capital Improvement Program and
phased according to the Comprehensive Phasing Program. The
LOS goals will be enforced through conditions of approval and
monitored annually through the Performance Monitoring
Program.
Public Facility Standards: Pursuant to Policy 7.1, the City will
adopt performance criteria for law enforcement, fire, library,
storm drain, and parks/open space facilities (see Table PF-1).
Future facilities will be determined as part of the Capital
Improvements Program. Impact fees will be levied on a pro rata
basis, and the balancing of new facilities with development will
be monitored under the Performance Monitoring Program.
Development Phasing: The purpose of development phasing is
to ensure that adequate infrastructure (roadways, utilities) are
added as development proceeds so that the provision of these
facilities is in balance with demand. In Dana Point, the primary
emphasis of the development phasing will be upon roadways,
although the larger undeveloped tracts in the City will also
require new water, sewer, and storm drain service. While the
Comprehensive Phasing Program will provide plans for new
facilities, the Performance Monitoring Program will provide
annual evaluation of compliance with phasing plans in order for
development to continue.
Performance Monitoring:          The Performance Monitoring
Program will establish a system for annual evaluation of
compliance with development phasing allocations. Under this
program, roadway and other public facility improvements or
fundings must actually be provided in order for new
development to continue.
Capital Improvement Plans: The purpose of the Capital
Improvement Plans is to estimate future development over a
seven year period and determine the necessary infrastructure
and associated costs required for this new development. The
Capital Improvement Plans will be closely linked with the
Comprehensive Phasing Plans.
Interjurisdictional Cooperation:       The City will become
involved in interjurisdictional coordination for various
purposes, including:
                                                 PUBLIC FACILITIES/
                                      GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT

          ° Working with interjurisdictional forums (such as the City-
             County Coordinating Committee) to make sure that the City's
             fees are consistent with minimally acceptable impact fees for
             application within the larger Growth Management Area;
          ° Participating in interjurisdictional forums at the Growth
             Management Area (GMA) level to discuss developments
             with multi-jurisdictional impacts and appropriate mitigation
             measures;
          ° Working with these forums to develop strategies for
             bringing about greater jobs/housing balance at the subregi-
             onal level; and
          ° Cooperating with the County of Orange in implementing the
             Facility Implementation Plans and possibly collaborating in
             the Development Monitoring Program.
          Comprehensive Development Plans for Large Projects: The
          City will require that any new large developments (such as any
          development proposed for the Dana Point Headlands) prepare a
          comprehensive development plan and environmental impact
          analysis. A Specific Plan is an example of a Comprehensive
          Development Plan for large projects. This will allow the city to
          anticipate the impacts of large projects prior to development of
          any portion of the projects, and permit more time to plan for
          public services and facilities needed to support the projects.
          Coordination of Adjacent Jurisdictions: Apart from coordina-
          tion with subregional interjurisdictional forums (such as the
          City-County Coordinating Committee), the City will separately
          work with its immediate neighbors to develop mutual
          agreements for review and possible conditioning of
          development projects.
THE PUBLIC FACILITIES PLAN
          The Public Facilities Plan consists of two parts: Infrastructure
          and Public Services. Infrastructure includes water, wastewater,
          storm drain, solid waste, gas, electrical, and telecommunications
          systems. Public services include law enforcement, fire protec-
          tion, emergency medical, educational services and civic and
          cultural institutions.
                                                              PUBLIC FACILITIES/

Figure PF-2 depicts the areas of the City designated for commu-
nity facilities on the City's Land Use Plan. Community facilities
include schools, churches, child care, library facilities, govern-
ment offices, utilities, cultural and recreational facilities. The
Land Use Plan also allows community facilities in three com-
mercial land use categories including the community
commercial, neighborhood commercial, and visitor recreation
commercial categories (See Land Use Element).
Infrastructure
Except for storm drains, virtually all of the City's infrastructure is
operated and maintained by the County or an independent
agency or special district. The policies of this Element empha-
size coordination of services with these agencies and conserva-
tion of such resources as water and energy.
Figures PF-3 through PF-6 depict existing and planned infra-
structure. Because the City is largely built-out, these facilities
are already in place. The location of some of the infrastructure
needed to serve future development on vacant land (such as
the Headlands) has not yet been determined.
Most of the information contained in this section is based upon
plans provided by the County, independent agencies, and
districts.
Water Distribution: The City's water distribution system is
described in the Master Environmental Assessment (MEA) and
Technical Report. Four independent water districts, each with
its own board of directors, serve the City. Figure PF-3 shows
the location of the water districts and facilities in the City.
While the existing water distribution systems throughout the
City are in good condition, as these systems age coordination
among these districts will be necessary in order to have
consistent levels of service in the future. Water conservation is
important in the City.            The Public Facilities/Growth
Management Element policies emphasize support for coordina-
tion between the water districts as well as for water conserva-
tion. As part of its Growth Management Plan, the City will also
investigate the feasibility of involving water districts in a
mitigation fee program.

Wastewater Collection, Treatment, and Reclamation: As
described in the MEA and Technical Report, four sanitary
districts serve the City of Dana Point. The boundaries of the
districts and location of their existing and planned facilities are
shown in Figure PF-4. With the exception of wastewater
collection lines in the Capistrano Beach Sanitary District, the
sewer collection lines in the City are in good condition. The
Capistrano Beach Sanitary District is currently in the process of
evaluating the condition of their lines and developing a plan for
repairs and replacement.
Two joint powers agencies, the Aliso Water Management
Agency (AWMA) and the South East Regional Reclamation
Authority (SERRA), provide sewage treatment to the wastew-
ater districts that serve Dana Point.
As shown in Figure PF-4 and described in the MEA, there are
"pockets" of the City that currently are not part of a sanitary
district. Most of these are public parks, but one area is the
Dana Point Headlands. Currently this area is served by septic
tanks. For the future, the City must determine the agency
responsible for providing wastewater service to the Headlands.
While two of the City's four sanitary districts, South Coast and
Moulton Niguel, are served by reclaimed water systems, the
other two, Dana Point and Capistrano Beach, are not. However,
SERRA is currently studying the feasibility of developing a
wastewater reclamation system that will serve these districts.
The policies of this Element focus upon encouraging coordina-
tion between the various sanitary districts, evaluating varying
levels of service between the districts, and supporting the
expansion of reclaimed water facilities. As part of the Growth
Management Plan, the City will also explore the feasibility of
involving wastewater districts in a mitigation fee program.
Solid Waste: The City of Dana Point contracts with Solag
Disposal to remove solid waste. The Prima Deschecha landfill,
where the City's waste is shipped, is estimated to have a
remaining life of over twenty years.

The State of California has mandated that each jurisdiction in
California prepare a Source Reduction and Recycling (SRR)
Element. In addition, each County must prepare an Integrated
Waste Management Plan to coordinate the individual SRR
Elements. To begin to reduce its solid waste stream and comply
with State requirements, the City has initiated a pilot recycling
program and is in the process of preparing a Source Reduction
and Recycling Element.
The policies in this Element emphasize reducing the City's solid
waste stream through recycling and coordinating with the
County of Orange Integrated Waste Management Department
in preparing the SRR Element.
Utilities: Utilities include gas and electric systems, telecommu-
nications systems, and cable television. The main gas and
electrical distribution lines in the City, owned by San Diego Gas
and Electric and the Southern California Gas Company,
respectively, are shown in Figure PF-5. There is no known
deficiency in these systems. While the utility providers
currently have no plans to expand facilities in the City, they
have indicated that they can expand to meet the needs of future
development, if necessary.
The City underutilizes solar energy, an economically viable
renewable energy source for heating.
Pacific Bell provides the City with telephone and fiber optic
service to the City. Telephone service is available to all
residents, and while fiber optics is only available in certain areas
of the City, the company indicates that they can expand to
serve any area requesting service. The undergrounding of
telephone lines is underway but not yet completed.
The City is currently under a 15-year contract with Dimension
Cable for cable service. While cable service is provided to
nearly all City residents and businesses, there are certain
services not provided for in the contract which the City desires.
 These include Public Education Government (PEG) Access.
The City will promote greater PEG access and encourage the
use of solar energy.

Storm Drains: The City's local and regional storm drain
systems are depicted in Figure PF-6. The Orange County Flood
Control District (OCFCD) manages the regional facilities.
Conceptual master plans for regional drainage are provided in
the Facilities Implementation Plans (FIPs) of the Growth
Management Plan.            The FIPs indicate that existing
improvements in the San Juan Creek Channel are insufficient to
convey a 100-year flood and that additional improvements are
needed to sustain a 100-year flood. The OCFCD is in the
process of planning and executing these improvements.
Little is known about the condition of the local storm drain
facilities, which became the City's responsibility upon
incorporation. While the County has a master plan for
financing local facilities, a comprehensive plan for local storm
drain facilities does not exist; nor has the County maintained
records on the condition of local storm drains. In essence, local
storm drains have been planned and built on an ad hoc basis.
Subdivision plans containing information about the age and
type of these storm drains must be obtained from the County,
and the condition of the lines must be assessed.
The City shall adopt the County standard of providing 100-year
flood protection for residents and non-floodproof structures
and initiate a capital improvements plan for storm drain facilities
which will include level of service standards.
Public Services
Several of the City's public services, such as law enforcement,
fire/paramedic, and libraries, are provided under contract with
the County of Orange. Public education is provided by the
Capistrano Unified School District. Therefore, much of the
City's future planning of these services involves coordination
with other agencies.
The future phasing of law enforcement, fire, and library facilities
for the County is provided for by the Facilities Implementation
Plans (FIPs) of the Orange County Growth Management Plan.
There are separate FIPs for each of the Growth Management
Areas (GMAs) in the County. Dana Point falls within two of
these        GMAs,           as      shown        in        Figure
PF-7.

As part of its Growth Management Plan, the City will adopt
Orange County performance criteria for law enforcement, fire,
libraries, and storm drains. These criteria are summarized in
Table PF-1 in this Element.
Figure PF-8 depicts the location of various public services in
the City.
Law Enforcement: The City of Dana Point receives law
enforcement services under a contract with the Orange County
Sheriff's Department. The station serving the City is located on
Crown Valley Parkway in Laguna Niguel. Existing service levels
in the City meet standards established by the Department.
While the Orange County General Plan establishes no specific
response criteria for sheriff patrol services, according to the
Facilities Implementation Plans for GMAs 2 and 5, in July, 1988,
the Ad-Hoc Growth Management Plan Committee formulated
the following response goal:
    "... to be able to have a deputy at the scene of an
    emergency call for service in five minutes or less, 50
    percent of the time and to all emergencies in eight
    minutes or less. Response to non-emergency calls
    should be in fifteen (15) minutes or less, 75 percent of
    the time."
The Facilities Implementation Plan indicates that adequate
levels of service on roadways will increase the department's
ability to meet these goals. Therefore, the Plan calls for
coordination on future sheriff and traffic facilities.
The Orange County Growth Management Plan Element requires
that the cost of new facilities be borne by new development.
The Facilities Implementation Plan indicates that the station
currently serving the City is temporary and will ultimately be
replaced with a permanent facility. The location and timing of
this replacement has not been determined. The need for any
additional sheriff's facilities will depend upon the timing of
future development, which is monitored by the County.
The policies of this Element call for monitoring levels of police
service to the City, providing adequate space in City Hall for
the community service unit in the City, and increasing public
participation in neighborhood watch groups. Because existing

levels of police service are adequate, the City will adopt County

level of service standards as its own. The City will also
consider participating with the County to develop a mitigation
fee program for sheriff services.
Fire Service: The City of Dana Point receives fire protection
under a contract with the Orange County Fire Department. Four
fire stations, including two within the City's boundaries,
respond to calls in the City. Figure PF-8 shows the location of
the fire stations and service area boundaries within the City.
Existing fire service levels in the City are adequate by the
Department's standards.
The Orange County Public Services and Facilities Element
contains the following criteria for fire station site selection:
    "...for 80 percent of the service area, first fire engine to
    reach the emergency scene within 5 minutes and para-
    medic to reach the scene within 10 minutes."
The FIP indicates that fire service for the City currently meets
these criteria.
The Facilities Implementation Plan indicates that some addition-
al permanent fire stations are needed for GMA 5, but none of
these affect Dana Point. Funding sources for new facilities
come from development fees and agreements.
The policies of this Element call for ongoing coordination with
the County of Orange to ensure the continued provision of
adequate fire protection to the City. Because existing levels of
fire service are adequate, the City will adopt the County level of
service standards for fire as its own. The City will also consider
working with the County to develop a fee program for fire
facilities.
Libraries: The City receives library services though the
Orange County Public Library (OCPL) system. Dana Point
residents are served by the Dana Niguel Branch Library, located
within the City (see Figure PF-8), as well as by two other
libraries in the Cities of San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano.
 Based upon existing service standards, the Dana Point Branch
Library is adequate to serve the City's residents.
According to the Orange County Public Services and Facilities
Element, the service standard for public libraries is .2 square feet

of library space per capita. The Facilities Implementation Plan
for GMA's 2 and 5 indicates that this standard is currently met
and will be met in the year 2010 as well, assuming all planned
facilities are built.
Additional OCPL criteria for locating libraries include the
following:
° Locating libraries centrally within the communities to be
    served.
° Locating libraries within a three-mile radius of the communi-
    ties they serve.
° Maximizing cost construction effectiveness by planning
    facilities to be either 10,000 square feet or 15,000 square feet
    in size.
Funding sources for Orange County public libraries include
development agreements and the Development Fee Program for
Fire Stations and Branch Libraries, developed in 1987.
Policies contained in this element emphasize cooperating with
the OCPL to periodically assess library service to ensure that
residents are adequately served. The City will consider working
with the County to participate in a fee program for library
facilities.
Educational Facilities: Public schools for students in Dana
Point are operated by the Capistrano Unified School District.
Figure PF-8 shows the location of District schools located
within the City limits. Due to a rapid increase in the number of
school-age children in the District, coupled with the shortage of
State funds for new school construction, the District has been
relying upon temporary facilities in order to accommodate
additional students. Several new schools are planned for the
District which will alleviate overcrowding at schools attended
by Dana Point students. The type and location of these
facilities are shown in Table PF-4. However, the facilities are
still awaiting funding. The District is considering switching to a
year-round calendar in order to receive priority for State
funding.
The School District requires accurate population projections to
arrive at long-range enrollment figures for school facility

           planning purposes. For this reason, it is important that the City
           and the District coordinate approval of additional residential
           development with the timing of new schools.
           The School District also contributes to the City's open space
           and recreation system. The Capistrano Beach Park and
           Recreation District has agreements with the Capistrano Unified
           School District for the joint use of school recreational facilities
           for parkland as described in the City's Conservation/ Open
           Space Element.
           The policies of this element call for coordination by the City
           with the Capistrano Unified School District in the timing of new
           development and new schools, as well as for the provision of
           appropriately designated land for new public school facilities.
           Civic and Cultural Facilities: The existing Dana Point City
           Hall, located in Golden Lantern as shown in Figure PF-8, lacks
           adequate space for community meetings, cultural events, and
           expanding staff. A new site which provides adequate space for
           civic and cultural activities must be found.
           The policies of this Element focus upon assessing the City's
           civic center needs and ensuring the availability of adequate
           sites for such purposes. The City will develop a capital
           improvements plan for a new civic center to include service
           standards and a mitigation fee program for new development.

     INTRODUCTION TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
Public safety is of concern to all citizens. For example, in California, natural events
such as earthquakes and flooding occur with some frequency. The citizens of a
community must anticipate these public safety concerns. Public agencies such as the
City of Dana Point have better capacity to anticipate such events and to prepare to
deal with these concerns. Perhaps more importantly the City has a responsibility to
regulate development to minimize the potential impacts of uncontrollable events on
the safety of its citizens and facilities. The Public Safety Element establishes a plan
and program to assure that there is an adequate, coordinated and expedient public
response to public safety concerns.
PURPOSE OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
                The purpose of the Public Safety Element is to identify and address
                those features or characteristics which exist in or near the City which
                represent a potential danger to the safety of the citizens, sites and
                structures, public facilities and infrastructure. The Element establishes
                policies to minimize the danger to residents, workers and visitors; and
                identifies actions needed to deal with crisis situations (e.g., earthquake,
                fire, flood). The manner in which emergency response agencies
                cooperate with one another and with other jurisdictions is a key
                component of the element.
                Issues Overview
                The Public Safety Element is a State-mandated component of a
                General Plan. Government Code section 65302(g) sets forth a list of
                hazards that the Element must cover, if they pertain to the City.
                These hazards are:
                °    seismically induced conditions, including surface rupture, ground
                     shaking, ground failure, tsunami, and seiche;
                °    slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides;
                °    subsidence and other geologic hazards;
                °    flooding;
                                                                   PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
                                                                              1

          °   canyon urban fires; and
          °   evacuation routes.
          State law permits cities to add safety issues to this list and to delete
          issues which are not pertinent and to add safety issues to this listing.
          Potential safety issues were researched and documented for
          preparation of the Master Environmental Assessment (MEA) and the
          Public Safety Technical Report that were completed as background
          document for the General Plan. The following safety issues were
          added:
          °   hazardous materials; and
          °   nuclear hazards from San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
          The Safety Element issues relate closely to certain issues discussed in
          the Land Use and Conservation/Open Space Elements of the General
          Plan; for example, restriction of construction on or near unstable bluffs.
           Dana Point is preparing an Emergency Plan that addresses hazard
          areas including nuclear, seismic, flooding and hazardous materials.
          This Emergency Plan will be reviewed by State and Federal agencies.
          A number of these agencies have their own roles in the event of an
          emergency at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, including the
          U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Federal Emergency
          Management Agency (FEMA), the State Office of Emergency Services
          (OES), and the California Highway Patrol (CHP). In addition, Dana
          Point is a member of the Interjurisdictional Planning Committee (IPC),
          a group of local agencies which meet regularly to coordinate their
          emergency procedures.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
          This Element is composed of two major sections: Public Safety Goals
          and Policies; and The Public Safety Plan. The Public Safety Goals and
          Policies section establishes public safety objectives and a
          decision-making framework for City leaders in evaluating issues for
          their safety impact. The Public Safety Plan provides more detailed
          recommendations for hazard mitigation and ensures adequate
          emergency response to identified hazards.

The Public Safety Plan is built upon the Element's goals and policies
and on the detailed description of local hazards from the Master
Environmental Assessment, the Public Safety Technical Report and
the Coastal Erosion Technical Report.

       PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
This section of the Public Safety Element sets forth Dana Point's goals and policies in
dealing with safety issues. The policies provide directions for implementation and
will be further explored in the Public Safety Plan.
PROTECTION FROM GEOLOGIC, SEISMIC, AND EROSION HAZARDS
                 Geologic Hazards
                 Dana Point's most significant geologic hazards are located within its
                 coastal zone. Geologic hazards were researched in the MEA, the
                 Coastal Erosion Technical Report and the Public Safety Element
                 Technical Report as part of the General Plan program. The technical
                 findings are summarized in the Master Environmental Assessment and
                 the Public Safety Element technical report. These technical findings
                 are the foundation of this Element's coastal geologic hazard goals and
                 policies. For analysis and planning purposes, the Dana Point coastal
                 zone has been divided into six subunits:
                 °   Capistrano Beach/Doheny Beach, including San Juan Creek outfall,
                     the Capistrano Beach private community, Capistrano Beach Park
                     and Doheny Beach State Park;
                 °   Capistrano Bluffs/Palisades, including Dana Bluffs and Doheny
                     Palisades;
                 °   Dana Cove and Harbor, including the Lantern Bay Project Area;
                 °   Dana Point Headlands;
                 °   Niguel Shores, including Breakers Isle, Ritz Carlton headland, Salt
                     Creek Beach ("Ritz Cove") and Salt Creek outfall; and
                 °   Monarch Bay.
                 These subunits are shown in Figure PS-1. All segments of all six
                 subunits possess significant known geologic hazards.
Figure PS-1, Geographic Subunits
                                                                 PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
                                                                           4

The Coastal Erosion Technical Report indicates that generalized
building and grading codes and code enforcement do not necessarily
keep pace with standards of prudent judgment applied by geotechnical
professionals. According to this report geotechnical professionals
believe that local grading codes tend to lag behind the current state of
professional knowledge by five to ten years. Conformance to County
grading codes or the most current Uniform Building Code is not
necessarily adequate for mitigation of all coastal safety hazards.
The Coastal Erosion Technical Report provides detailed recom-
mendations of potential mitigation measures for various segments of
each subunit. This report also stresses the great variability in local
geologic conditions, even on adjacent lots, and the resulting need to
study each development proposal individually. Generalized mitigation
measures for each subunit are discussed in the last section of this
Public Safety Element, entitled The Public Safety Plan.
Coastal Erosion: There are two types of coastal erosion in Dana
Point: the retreat of coastal bluffs and the loss of beach sands. Most
beach sand comes either from sediment transport during river and
stream runoff, or from erosion of coastal cliffs and bluffs. Because
both of these processes have been impeded by urbanization, both in
Dana Point and elsewhere, beach replenishment has been affected.
Some portions of the Dana Point coastline have been more impacted
than others, since impact is highly dependent on local factors,
including beach configuration and location relative to manmade im-
provements, such as jetties and harbors.
Blufftop Erosion: Extending for approximately 6.7 miles, the Dana
Point shoreline includes areas of sandy and rocky shore, coastal bluffs,
and the rocky Dana Point Headlands. These areas have been subjected
to continual erosion from oceanic, climatological, and developmental
forces. Urbanization has accelerated the erosion process in many
locations and created areas of instability.
The causes and effects of blufftop erosion along the Dana Point
coastline were studied as a part of the Coastal Erosion Technical
Report. The report findings, are described in detail in the Master
Environmental Assessment and the Public Safety Element Technical
Report. These background reports have shaped the Public Safety
Element's erosion control goals and policies and are summarized below.
 The Public Safety Plan identifies preliminary specific erosion
protection measures for each coastal subunit.
Development and construction tends to increase runoff and erosion.
Damming of rivers has reduced the contribution of sediment to the
ocean, resulting in narrowing beaches and increasing wave erosion of
                                                  PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
                                                             5
sea cliffs. Blufftop activities, including construction of storm drains,
fences, access stairways, removal of ground cover, oversteepening,
overloading, and both accidental and intentional releases of water along
the bluff face and into the bluff itself, have all increased erosion or
failure.
Construction of residences along the blufftops in Capistrano Bluffs,
Dana Cove, southern Niguel Shores and Monarch Bay has accelerated
the erosion and retreat of blufftop properties and weakened major
zones of bedrock, which can fail during large storms. This occurs
particularly in residential areas where drought-resistent landscaping is
lacking, where structures are set too close to the existing bluff edge, or
where drainage runs toward the ocean. Seepage accumulation fosters
large bluff failures even in nonstorm years.
Construction of residential paved areas along otherwise erodible
blufftops inland from recreational beach zones such as Niguel Shores
significantly reduces sediment contribution to pocket beaches which,
unlike long straight sand beaches, are not easily replenished from
littoral drift.
Construction of the Dana Point Harbor breakwater has caused a
southward shift in longshore current transport of sand to areas
downcoast of Doheny State Beach/Capistrano Beach subunit, and San
Clemente Beach areas. Flood control channelization of San Juan Creek
has reduced the natural river sand supply to Doheny State Beach.
The placement of dredge fills from Dana Point Harbor, or sandy export
materials from inland grading operations, has historically minimized
beach erosion conditions in the Capistrano Beach/Doheny Beach
subunit. However, dredge sediment from the Harbor is currently
considered unusable because it is contaminated above Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) standards, due to the quality of stormwater runoff (Zeiser
Report). Unless the quality of this sediment can be quickly improved,
it is not a readily available source of sandfill for beach nourishment.
Seismic Hazards
Dana Point, like the rest of southern California, is located in a
seismically active area. No known active faults cross the City. The
nearest significant active fault is the Newport-Inglewood Zone, located
approximately four miles to the southwest. Figure PS-2 shows the
location of this and other major active and potentially active faults in
                                                     PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
                                                               6
            relation to Dana Point. Major active faults which could affect Dana
            Point include the Whittier-Elsinore Fault, the San Andreas Fault, the
            Palos Verdes Fault, the San Clemente Fault and the Rose Canyon
            Fault.
            Because no known active faults cross the City, the potential for
            surface rupture is believed to be limited. Ground shaking, liquefaction,
            landslides and rockfalls along coastal bluffs are the primary hazards
            which would affect Dana Point in case of earthquake.
            Tsunamis and seiche, or seismic wave actions, are discussed in the
            Flood Hazards section. Policies described above which are designed to
            mitigate bluff erosion effects will also protect against seismically
            induced landslides and rockfalls.
            Buildings that provide for public gathering with large concentrations of
            people should have increased design standards for protection from
            seismic hazards. The Modified Mercalli intensity scale as shown on
            Table PS-1 provides a description of the potential effect of varying
            levels of earthquake activity. Corresponding Richter Scale intensities
            are also shown on the table.
            Two major types of seismic hazards are evident: ground shaking and
            liquefaction:
            Ground Shaking: The extent of damage within Dana Point from
            earthquake-induced ground shaking will depend on the epicenter of the
            quake, its magnitude, and the characteristics of underlying earth
            materials. The maximum quake likely to occur along the
            Newport-Inglewood Fault is smaller than on other, more distant faults.
             However, because of its proximity, it poses the greatest potential for
            ground shaking damage to Dana Point. The maximum projected
            magnitude from an earthquake from this fault is 7.0 on the Richter
            Scale. A 7.0 magnitude quake along the Newport-Inglewood Fault
            would result in considerable damage even to specially-designed
            structures. Buildings would

                  MODIFIED MERCALLI INTENSITY SCALE OF 1931
 The first scale to reflect earthquake intensities was developed by de Rossi of Italy, and Forel
 of Switzerland, in the 1880's. This scale, with values from I to X, was used for about two
 decades. A need for a more refined scale increased with the advancement of the science of
 seismology, and in 1902 the Italian seismologist, Mercalli, devised a new scale of a I to XII
 range. The Mercalli Scale was modified in 1931 by American seismologists Harry O.
 Wood and Frank Neumann to take into account modern structural features:
 I        (2)       Not felt except by a very few under especially favorable circumstances.
 II       (2)       Felt only by a few persons at rest, especially on upper floors of buildings. Delicately
                    suspended objects may swing.
 III      (3)       Felt quite noticeably indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings, but many
                    people do not recognize it as an earthquake. Vibration like passing of truck. Duration
                    estimated.
 IV       (4)       During the day felt indoors by many, outdoors by few. At night some awakened.
                    Dishes, windows, doors disturbed; walls make cracking sound. Sensation like heavy
                    truck striking building. Standing motor cars rocked noticeably.

be structurally damaged and underground pipes would be broken.
Liquefaction: During liquefaction, water-saturated sandy soils mix
with shallow groundwater, causing soils to behave essentially like a
liquid and to develop a consistency similar to quicksand. These soils
lose their ability to support any structures. As a result, buildings
constructed on such soils usually collapse. The most recent example
of liquefaction damage occurred in the Marina District of San Francisco
during the October 1989 earthquake.
Five areas have been identified as having potential for liquefaction: the
floodplain deposits along San Juan Creek, Doheny Village commercial
area, beach sands along Beach Road in the Doheny State Beach area,
portions of the Palisades Drive, Coast Highway commercial areas, and
the Dana Point Harbor area. These areas are depicted in Figure PS-2 as
artificial fill and undifferentiated alluvium.
GOAL 1: Reduce the risk to the community from geologic
hazards including bluff instability, seismic hazards and coastal
erosion.
Geologic Hazards

PROTECTION FROM FLOOD HAZARDS
         Dana Point participates in the national flood insurance program
         administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency
         (FEMA). Because of this participation, individuals throughout the
         City can purchase federal flood insurance. To participate in the
         program, the City is required to identify flood hazard areas and
         implement a system of protective controls, including land use controls
         within flood-prone areas. This portion of the General Plan identifies
         flood hazard areas within Dana Point.
         Watercourse Flooding: Flooding is a natural attribute of any river or
         stream, and is influenced by many factors, including the amount,
         intensity and distribution of rainfall, soil conditions prior to storms,
         vegetation coverage and stream channel conditions. All natural rivers
         and streams have a floodplain, which is the area subject to flooding
         during peak storm flows. The floodway is the main portion of the
                                                            PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
                                                                     11
watercourse within the floodplain.
In conjunction with the flood insurance program, flood-prone areas of
Dana Point have been delineated on federally-prepared Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). Much of the national flood insurance
program is based on definition of the 100-year flood. The size of the
100-year flood is established based on examination of historical
records. It is the largest flood that could be expected to occur once
within a 100 year period. A 100-year flood would cover the total area
of a designated floodplain. The FIRM maps also identify areas subject
to a 500-year flood. These areas, however, are not subject to the same
land use limitations as areas within the 100-year flood.
There are three Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
floodplains designated within Dana Point. These floodplains are
shown on Figure PS-3, which is adapted from FIRM maps. FIRM
maps should be consulted for more detailed information. The primary
floodway is San Juan Creek. Secondary floodways are Salt Creek and
Prima Deshecha Canada.
San Juan Creek is the watercourse which poses the greatest flood
hazard to Dana Point. The San Juan Creek floodplain varies in width
from 700 feet to 1,200 feet. Although San Juan Creek has a concrete
channel through the City of San Juan Capistrano, according to the
Army Corps of Engineers the channel through Dana Point cannot
contain the volume of runoff water generated by a 100-year storm. An
eastward extension of the floodplain around Victoria Boulevard is
created due to the potential for overflow from the underground
Capistrano Beach Storm Drain. This eastward extension covers much
of the Doheny Village area, which is largely developed. Many
residents and businesses in this area would be at risk of water damage
in
the event of a 100-year storm. Actions may be taken to minimize
damage through improvements to properties.
Salt Creek is a narrow watercourse running through the Links at
Monarch Beach golf course. The 100-year floodplain of Salt Creek is
approximately 100 feet wide and extends only as far south as Pacific
Coast Highway. Salt Creek is fed by Arroyo Salada, which runs just a
short distance through the City to the northwest of Salt Creek, just
below Camino del Avion. The Arroyo Salada 100-year floodplain is
approximately 75 feet wide.
Prima Deshecha Canada runs through the City for approximately 200
feet, forming the City's southernmost border adjacent to Camino
Capistrano. The stream is confined to a channelized spillway, which is
designed to accommodate 100-year flood volumes.

               Coastal Flooding
               The coastal flood with velocity hazard designation within Dana Point
               is depicted in Figure PS-3. This designation extends the length of the
               coastline and inland approximately 150 feet in Capistrano Beach.
               According to the maps prepared by the Federal Emergency
               Management Agency (FEMA) all beachfront properties are in the
               coastal high hazard zone. However, a few of the houses are outside
               the FEMA coastal flood zone as shown on the FIRM maps and Figure
               PS-3. These areas are subject to damage from seismic sea waves
               (tsunamis) and storm waves. These hazards are described in more
               detail in the following sections.
               Tsunamis: Tsunamis are seismically induced sea waves generated by
               offshore earthquake, submarine landslide, or volcanic activity. Great
               magnitude waves have not historically been recorded in Orange County
               because the coastline is somewhat protected from the north by the
               coastal configuration (Palos Verdes Peninsula and Point Conception)
               and the offshore islands (Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands).
               Locally the Headlands also protects most of the Dana Point coastline
               from tsunamis which might originate from the north. However, the
               City's coast is more exposed to damage from a more rare tsunami or
               other storm waves which might come from the south.

                                                                       13
A study of tsunami inundation potential conducted for San Onofre
Nuclear Generating Station found that a 7.5 foot tsunami along
Doheny Beach at high tide would cause flooding and structural damage
to most homes along Beach Road. Depending on the amount of ad-
vance warning, some loss of life could occur. The likelihood of such an
event occurring, however, is not considered great.
Storm Waves: The central and southern portions of Capistrano Beach
and Doheny Beach are characterized by high storm wave runup
elevations. In these areas, breaker elevations of storm waves exceed
the elevations of natural beach and existing structures.
In the southernmost portion of Capistrano Beach, a number of
geotechnical studies documented in the Coastal Erosion Technical
Report have shown that storm wave runup elevations on beaches
protected by seawalls or sloped stone revetments are two to three
times higher than existing residential elevations along Beach Road.
Beach runup elevations are 50 percent higher than existing residential
foundations. These extreme conditions are a result of steeper beach
profiles and increased breaker heights associated with the shoreline
retreat. Policies to control coastal erosion, described in the preceding
section, will also help prevent marine flooding of the low-lying
residential areas along the beach.
Seiche: Seiches are another type of water-related seismically induced
hazard. Seiches are extensive wave actions on lakes or reservoirs.
Since no major lakes or open water impoundments exist in Dana Point
this hazard is considered low.
GOAL 2: Reduce the risk to the community's inhabitants from
flood hazards.
Policy 2.1: Identify flood hazard areas and provide appropriate land
use regulations for areas subject to flooding.
Policy 2.2: Regulate the construction of non-recreational uses on
coastal stretches with high predicted storm wave run-up to minimize
risk of property damage.
Policy 2.3: Coordinate with the appropriate agencies to prepare and
maintain a master drainage plan.
Policy 2.4: Coordinate with the appropriate agencies to assure that
existing bridges are constructed according to the standards to avoid
damage by flooding.
Policy 2.5: Continue to participate in the national flood insurance

              Policy 2.6: Cooperate with the Orange County Flood Control District
              to plan for and make needed improvements or modifications to San
              Juan Creek Channel to enable it to carry runoff from a 100 year storm.
              Policy 2.7: Cooperate with the Orange County Flood Control District
              to plan for and correct the potential for overflow from the underground
              Capistrano Beach Storm Drain to relieve the potential for flooding in
              the Doheny Village area. Until this is accomplished, encourage
              affected residents and businesses to purchase Federal flood insurance.
              Policy 2.8: Require detention basins where applicable to reduce
     the risk from flood hazards.
RISKS FROM HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTES
              State General Plan guidelines define hazardous materials to include a
              variety of injurious substances, specifically pesticides, herbicides, toxic
              metals and chemicals, liquefied natural gas, explosives, volatile
              chemicals, and nuclear fuels.
              Hazardous materials can be classified into four basic categories: toxins,
              corrosives, reactives, and ignitables. Toxins include a broad range of
              industrial chemicals and agricultural pesticides whose ingestion can
              cause serious illness or death. Through body contact rather than
              ingestion, corrosives can cause inflammation or destruction of living
              tissue. When mixed with other substances, reactives can cause damage
              from blast and flash fire. Ignitables pose the threat of combustion at
              low ignition temperatures and rapid burning.
              Local Hazardous Materials Users and Producers: Household
              cleaning products, dry cleaning, film processing, and auto servicing all
              involve substances and waste materials which are to some degree
              hazardous. Primary contributors to the hazardous waste stream are
              individual City residences. Business establishments using and handling
              these materials are located throughout Dana Point. However, because
              there are no major industrial users within Dana Point, the amount of
              hazardous materials present in the City is considered small and limited.
              Transportation of Hazardous Materials: Hazardous materials pass
              through the City in route to other destinations via the City's freeway,
              rail and surface street system. The major transportation routes through
              Dana Point include the San Diego Freeway, Pacific Coast Highway and
              the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. However, the City has
                                                                 PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
                                                                          15
no direct authority to regulate the transport of hazardous materials on
these State highways and rail lines. Transportation of hazardous
materials by truck and rail is regulated by the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT). DOT regulations establish criteria for safe
handling procedures. Federal safety standards are also included in the
California Administrative Code. The California Health Services
Department regulates haulers of hazardous waste, but not of all
hazardous materials.
Although sludge is not considered a hazardous material, transportation
routes for the sludge material should be considered. The South East
Regional Reclamation Authority (SERRA) Wastewater Treatment
Plan transports four to six truckloads of dried sludge to the Prima
Deshecha landfill daily. The Capistrano Beach Sanitation District also
transports sludge to the landfill. The route taken by these trucks
involves a left turn on Del Obispo to Pacific Coast Highway, and
finally to Ortega Highway. This route avoids high population areas;
the number of trips does not pose a significant hazard to City
residents.
Hazardous Waste Management Plan: The Orange County Hazard-
ous Waste Management Plan was adopted in January 1989. Certifi-
cation of the Plan by the State is pending. The Plan provides basic
overall policy direction to address current and future hazardous waste
management issues. The Dana Point General Plan implements
applicable sections of the Hazardous Waste Management Plan. The
City of Dana Point is now in the process of developing a Hazardous
Waste Ordinance. Adoption of this Ordinance will implement many
of the General Plan policies.
GOAL 3: Reduce the risk to the community's inhabitants from
exposure to hazardous materials and wastes.
Policy 3.1: Cooperate with the County to implement applicable
portions of the County's proposed Hazardous Waste Management
Plan.

PROTECTION FROM FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARDS
                                                          PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
                                                                     JUNE 27, 1995

Certain development scenarios pose more difficult fire protection
problems in urban areas. These include multi-story, wood frame, high
density apartment development; multi-story office or research and
development structures; large continuous developed areas with
combustible roofing materials; and structures storing, handling, and
using hazardous materials. Although these types of development
scenarios exist throughout Dana Point, existing fire protection services
have the capacity to provide protection in the event of a fire or
explosion.
According to the Orange County Fire Department, there are no major
urban fire or explosion hazards in the City of Dana Point. The City
has no underground petroleum product transmission lines or storage
facilities. The only significant potential fire/explosion hazard is an
existing natural gas transmission line along Pacific Coast Highway
operated by the Southern California Gas Company which is being
replaced with a new 16-inch transmission line along Pacific Coast
Highway.
GOAL 4: Reduce the risk to the community's inhabitants from
fires or explosions.
Policy 4.1: Establish an education program regarding fire hazards.
Policy 4.2: Establish requirements for fire-resistant roofing materials.
Policy 4.3: Establish a program to provide notice to all residents
located in areas that may have higher risks of fire hazards.
Policy 4.4: Establish and maintain mutual aid agreements with
surrounding cities for fire protection.
Policy 4.5: Encourage building code requirements that assure adequate
fire protection.

           Plan for rescue efforts, medical efforts, emergency shelters, and
           provision of supplies.
           Policy 5.3: Coordinate with Orange County and the Federal Emer-
           gency Management Agency in reducing community risks in the event
           of a disaster.
           Policy 5.4: Establish procedures and necessary actions in the event of
           an offshore oil spill.
           Policy 5.5: Actively participate with appropriate entities which are
           involved in emergency planning and response activities for the San
           Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
           Policy 5.6: Include procedures for dealing with earthquake, offshore
           oil spills, major rail and roadway accidents, flooding and hazardous
           materials and nuclear emergencies in the Disaster Preparedness Plan.
           Policy 5.7: Sponsor and support public education programs for
           emergency preparedness and disaster response. Distribute information
           about emergency planning to community groups, schools, churches,
           and business associations. Hold emergency drills in various parts of
           Dana Point to test the effectiveness of emergency preparedness plans.
           Policy 5.8: Evaluate the feasibility of establishing a storm warning or
           disaster preparedness office, partially a volunteer service, including a
           public hotline which can be contacted for information on proximity
           and severity of storms, including warnings for storm surge, strong
           wind setup and high tide levels.
           Policy 5.9: Encourage occupants of beachfront residential commu-
           nities (Capistrano Bay District and Niguel Shores HOA) to keep
           sandbags on hand in case of elevated flood water and tide conditions.

         run-up for all impacted coastal areas.
NUCLEAR HAZARDS FROM SAN ONOFRE NUCLEAR GENERATING
STATION
         The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) is located
         adjacent to San Onofre State Beach on the grounds of the U.S. Marine
         Corps Base at Camp Pendleton. SONGS is located approximately
         seven miles south of Dana Point. Radioactive by-products are
         contained within the plant, except for small quantities of radioactive
         gases released into the air and liquids released into the ocean. Such
         releases occur continuously and are monitored by SONGS personnel.
         Controlled releases are at a level which is less than the typical exposure
         from natural background radiation. Used fuel rods and assemblies are
         stored in water-filled pools until they can be shipped to federally
         licensed centers for permanent disposal. The two most likely sources
         of radiation contamination from SONGS are transportation accidents
         involving shipments of nuclear materials and wastes and uncontrolled
         airborne release from the plant site.
         Federal and State governments have established several levels of
         emergency zones in the area around SONGS. Dana Point, like San
         Juan Capistrano and San Clemente, is located within the Emergency
         Planning Zone (EPZ). More distant cities such as Laguna Beach,
         Oceanside and Carlsbad are located within a Public Education Zone
         (PEZ). Figure PS-4 shows these two zones and their relationship to
         the nuclear facility. (A third zone, the Ingestion Pathway Zone,
         extends for a fifty mile radius around the facility and is not shown on
         the figure).
         Within the Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ), the United States Nuclear
         Regulatory Commission (NRC) has established emergency warning,
         sheltering and evacuation procedures. Figure PS-5 shows the location
         of warning sirens and the decibel range for each siren within Dana
         Point. The City of Dana Point,

                          Goals and policies contained in the other Elements are also
                          important in addressing public safety issues. A number of
                          goals and policies contained in the Conservation and Open
                          Space Element are concerned with development restrictions in
                          areas subject to environmental constraints that might affect
                          both persons and property. The Housing Element also
                          contains policies that underscore the importance of ensuring
                          that housing is both safe and decent. Other Elements contain-
                          ing policies that serve to support the aims expressed in this

The Public Safety Plan describes the approach to be used in implementing the Public
Safety Element goals and policies. This section of the Public Safety Element discusses
emergency preparedness planning needed to respond to major disasters. When Dana
Point's Disaster Preparedness Plan is complete, the reader or user of this Element
should be able to review that document in conjunction with the material contained
here.
AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES AND COORDINATION
               The City contracts with the Orange County Sheriff's Department for
               provision of law enforcement services and the Orange County Fire
               Department for Fire and Paramedic Services. Fire and law enforcement
               staffing and services provided to Dana Point by these County agencies
               is discussed in the Public Facilities Element. Other agencies which
               have jurisdiction or which provide public safety services within Dana
               Point include the California Highway Patrol, and the Orange County
               Health Department.
               Nuclear Emergency Response Agencies
               In the event of a nuclear incident at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating
               Station (SONGS), State and Federal agencies would have primary
               responsibility for coordinating emergency response. The roles and
               responsibilities of these agencies are as follows:
               °   U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC): The NRC is the
                   licensing agency which certifies that safety standards and regula-
                   tions are being met. Permanent onsite NRC inspectors provide
                   ongoing regulation of SONGS.
                   U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):
                   FEMA regulations are directed at the off-site protection of public
                   health and safety in the event of a nuclear accident, and also
                   provide for coordination among local response agencies if an
                   accident occurs.
                   California Office of Emergency Services (OES): The OES
                   coordinates State resources in the event of a nuclear accident. The

                  which surrounds SONGS.
                  Interjurisdictional Planning Committee (IPC): The IPC is
                  comprised of agencies wholly or partly located within the Emer-
                  gency Planning Zone (EPZ) of SONGS. Although these agencies
                  do not have authority to regulate plant operations, they have a
                  responsibility to protect residents and visitors from nuclear
                  hazards. IPC members meet regularly to confer on coordination
                  and planning, and to conduct training exercises.
              Seismic and Geologic Hazards Management
              The Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project (SCEPP) is a
              State and federally-funded effort to encourage local jurisdictions to
              prepare for catastrophic earthquakes that may occur in southern
              California. SCEPP works directly with local governments, private
              industry, and volunteer groups in a cooperative planning effort. It
              addresses the full range of earthquake strategies, including mitigation
              (long term response), prediction (short term response), emergency
              actions, and recovery. SCEPP recommendations were approved by
              the Orange County Board of Supervisors. Until the Dana Point
              Disaster Preparedness Plan is completed, County-drafted SCEPP
              earthquake procedures will remain in force.
MITIGATION OF COASTAL BEACH AND BLUFF EROSION HAZARDS
              The Goals and Policies section of this Public Safety Element outlined
              the major coastal geologic problems identified by the Coastal Erosion
              Technical Report of Dana Point's coastal zone. This study includes a
              series of maps identifying protective devices and/or mitigation
              measures which might be appropriate to individual beach and bluff
              sections of the Dana Point shoreline. These generalized recommenda-
              tions are shown in Figure PS-6. It should be emphasized, however,
              that the recommendations as shown are preliminary. Because coastal
              conditions vary greatly, even from one parcel to another, erosion
              mitigation measures for any development must be designed on a
              parcel-specific basis by a State-licensed engineering geologist.

         Descriptions of each type of recommended mitigation measure are
         included in the Glossary of the Geotechnical Report.
FORMATION OF GEOLOGIC HAZARD ABATEMENT DISTRICTS
         Geologic Hazard Abatement Districts (GHADs) were recommended in
         Policy 1.14 for portions of the Dana Point Coastal Zone, specifically
         the Capistrano Beach, Capistrano Bluffs, Dana Cove and Harbor,
         Dana Point Headlands, Niguel Shores, and Monarch Bay areas. A
         GHAD is a legal entity permitted under Division 17 of the California
         Public Resources Code (Sections 26500 through 26601). Established
         by property owners to perform remedial earthwork, it is funded by
         local property taxes and revenue bonds. The first GHAD is the
         Abalone Cove Landslide Abatement District in Rancho Palos Verdes.
         There are two ways a GHAD may be proposed: 1) where applicable
         by a Resolution of the City of Dana Point and/or Orange County
         Board of Supervisors; or 2) by a petition signed by the owners of not
         less than 10 percent of the real property to be included within the
         proposed districts.
         A geologic report signed by a Certified Engineering Geologist must
         accompany establishment of the GHAD to serve as a "plan of
         control". Following a public hearing, the GHAD may be established at
         the direction of the City of Dana Point and/or, if applicable, the
         Orange County Board of Supervisors, provided that owners of more
         than 50 percent of the assessed valuation within the District do not
         object. After establishment of a GHAD, the District may secure
         funding through revenue bonds issued under the Improvement Act of
         1911, the Municipal Improvement Act of 1913, or the Improvement
         Bond Act of 1915. Property tax assessment may be made on a
         subjective proportional point basis so that each owner pays a fair
         share.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND ACTION
        The Dana Point Disaster Preparedness Plan will designate proper
        procedures to be followed in case of a major emergency. Pending
        completion of that Plan, Figure PS-7 shows generalized evacuation
        routes for the City. In an emergency, establishment of evacuation
        routes is dependent on the nature and extent of the particular incident.
        Routes may be altered by public safety officials responding to local
        conditions.
        Special planning and coordination would be necessary if evacuation
        from the southernmost beachfront portion of the City became
        necessary. In this area of Dana Point, residents and visitors are
        dependent on Pacific Coast Highway to leave the immediate beach
        area, since there is no vehicular access through the bluffs from
        Palisades Drive south to the City limit.
        Interstate 5 and Pacific Coast Highway, two designated evacuation
        routes, are frequently congested, even under non-emergency traffic
        flow conditions. Special and severe measures may be required to keep
        these routes clear should they be needed for evacuation of more than a
        limited portion of the City.
        Emergency shelters are designated by the Red Cross staff. Public
        schools will most likely be designated as emergency shelters, pending
        completion of the Disaster Preparedness Plan. Public schools would
        be available for shelters only in the event of a major flood, earthquake,
        or other disaster. In such emergencies the schools would be staffed by
        local public safety officials. Shelters would also offer emergency first
        aid and will serve as community information centers, where individuals
        can leave messages to locate friends and family members.

    INTRODUCTION TO THE URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
Urban Design is a process that builds on the foundation of the land use
element. Urban Design focuses more precisely on the form and character of the
natural and built environment; what we experience and how we feel about it.
At its best, the process of Urban Design should persuade the City, private
enterprise and the public to work together to create a community whose quality
and living potential take full advantage of Dana Point's spectacular coastal
setting, landscape, climate and cultural assets.
PURPOSE OF THE URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
               The Urban Design Element provides proposals and policies to
               improve the image, character and quality of life of the City.
               Although this element is not mandatory, urban design is
               important to the City because it relates directly to the physical
               form and character of development resulting from implementa-
               tions of the Land Use, Circulation and Conservation/Open Space
               Elements.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
               The Urban Design Element provides policies and design
               concepts for the preservation of the natural setting, public
               improvements, form and character of new private development,
               and focused plans for areas of the City in need of special design
               attention.
ELEMENT ORGANIZATION
               The Element first presents Dana Point's important Urban Design
               issues, followed by broad Goals and definitive City Policies
               related to each issue. These are cross-referenced with relevant
               goals and policies of other General Plan Elements in Table UD-
               2.
                                                           URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
                                         1                             JULY 9, 1991
         The Urban Design Plan provides concepts to illustrate how the
         goals and policies may be implemented. The Plan is divided into
         two sections, the first containing citywide Urban Design
         concepts. This is followed by design concepts for three specific
         areas of the City. Appendix A of the Urban Design Element
         provides standards for landscape corridors in Dana Point.
         Appendix B provides the selected tree species for the landscape
         corridors. Both Urban Design Element appendices are included
         in the General Plan Appendix.
DESIGN GUIDELINES
         In addition to the Urban Design Element, Design Guidelines for
         the City contain specific design standards for public and private
         projects subject to discretionary design review. The Design
         Guidelines are adopted as a separate document from the General
         Plan. The Design Guidelines are to be used by property owners,
         developers, architects, landscape architects and designers in the
         planning of new projects and major renovations in the City. The
         Guidelines communicate the qualities and characteristics
         expected of development in the City. They are intended to
         promote higher quality design that is sensitive to Dana Point's
         natural setting, surrounding environment and community design
         goals. The Guidelines are used by City Council, Commissions,
         and City Staff as adopted criteria for the review of development
         proposals subject to discretionary design review.

         URBAN DESIGN GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and supporting policies relating to Urban Design establish the overall
framework for the concepts discussed in the Urban Design Plan. These goals
and policies address specific issues and opportunities that will enable the
community to develop in accordance with highest design quality possible.
CITYWIDE VISUAL LINKAGES
             Dana Point's public beaches, parks, coastal lookouts and scenic
             attractions form one of the most spectacular collections of public
             open space in Southern California. Most of the City's residential
             neighborhoods are of similar quality and character.
             Dana Point's overall image needs to be brought up to the quality
             of its best parts. Clearer positive visual and circulation linkages
             between the City's resources are needed, especially along
             primary streets. This can be accomplished by focused landscape,
             graphic, lighting and public art improvements in high-visibility
             places.
             GOAL 1: Create Citywide visual linkages and symbols to
             strengthen Dana Point's identity as a city.
             Policy 1.1: Develop citywide linkages through landscaping and
             lighting along major street corridors. (Coastal Act/30251)
             Policy 1.2:      Improve the visual character of major street
             corridors.
             Policy 1.3: Make focused improvements at major City entrance
             points such as landscaped open space and signage.
             Policy 1.4: Preserve public views from streets and public places.
              (Coastal Act/30251)
             Policy 1.5: Develop the Blufftop Trail from Monarch Beach to
             Doheny State Park. Final designation of the trail alignment

        Plan for the Headlands. (Coastal Act/30210, 30212)
        Policy 1.6: Develop a citywide public signage system with
        identity and directional graphics to mark public places, recre-
        ational opportunities and principal attractions.
        Policy 1.7: Initiate a program for public art.
THE COMMUNITIES OF THE CITY
        The City's residential neighborhoods are, with few exceptions,
        stable and well-maintained. They offer a variety of dwelling
        types from modest, older single family dwellings and apartments
        to newer luxury custom homes and condominiums. Since the
        City developed as an incremental series of land subdivisions
        built over the years without an overall comprehensive plan, most
        residential neighborhoods are self-contained, with access to a
        major arterial street but without linkages to adjacent neighbor-
        hoods. This pattern reduces through traffic and provides quiet
        residential streets, but also lessens the sense of community felt
        Citywide.
        In older neighborhoods of Capistrano Beach and ``The Lanterns''
        residential area, the proper size, bulk and height of new infill
        development is an issue. Escalating land values have encouraged
        oversized houses and additions. The demolition of older, modest
        houses, and their replacement with large scale homes has, in
        some areas, created a discontinuous urban design. This is an
        issue in most older southern California residential areas,
        especially along the coastline.
        GOAL 2: Preserve the individual positive character and
        identity of the City's communities.
        Policy 2.1: Consider the distinct architectural and landscape
        character of each community. To the maximum extent feasible,
        protect special communities and neighborhoods which, because
        of their unique characteristics, are popular visitor destination
        points for recreational uses. (Coastal Act/30251)
        Policy 2.2: Adopt development standards and design guidelines
        for commercial areas that reflect the individual character
                                                      URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT

         of each community.
         Policy 2.3: Improve public places and recreational facilities as
         focus points for each community. (Coastal Act/30213)
         Policy 2.4: Establish a program to preserve buildings and sites
         of historical and architectural significance.
         Policy 2.5: Encourage neighborhood street landscaping pro-
         grams to improve the quality of public spaces in residential areas.
THE DANA POINT TOWN CENTER
         At the present time, the Town Center does not have an environ-
         ment or image that draws residents or visitors, nor does the Town
         Center work well as a ``shopping district'' where businesses
         benefit each other from an overall collective strength. Instead,
         the Town Center functions and feels like a roadside or "strip
         commercial" environment with many small separate commercial
         buildings and shopping centers that are poorly linked. The
         Pacific Coast Highway - Del Prado couplet, accompanied by
         high traffic speeds, has contributed to this problem. The small
         parcel sizes, lack of consistent site design patterns, diversity of
         building types and setbacks, and barren quality of the
         streetscapes are intensify the problems. There are some
         examples, however, that provide potential ideas for the future.
         The Plaza works well as a focus and pleasant pedestrian space -
         more environments like this can be created in the Town Center.
         San Juan Avenue presents a significant opportunity to create this
         additional pedestrian focus.
         The future of the traffic system will be fundamental to develop-
         ing site planning and building design guidelines that integrate the
         area. A major investment in public amenities (street trees, wider
         sidewalks, parking and side street improvements) will be
         necessary to transform the area's image and create stronger
         linkages between the blocks.
         GOAL 3: Improve the Town Center as one of the City's
         primary shopping districts with a small town ``village'' at-
         mosphere.

         Policy 3.1: Increase the Town Center's economic vitality and its
         contribution to the City's economic development goals.
         Policy 3.2: Reduce the disruptive and negative impact of traffic
         movements and high traffic speeds in the Town Center.
         Policy 3.3: Improve pedestrian opportunities and create an
         attractive pedestrian environment within the Town Center.

         Policy 3.4: Encourage mixed-use development in selected areas
         of the Town Center.
         Policy 3.5: Develop a parking concept that emphasizes shared
         parking facilities.
         Policy 3.6: Create safety buffers of street trees, planters and
         street furniture between pedestrian walks and the street along
         both Pacific Coast Highway and Del Prado. Provide widened
         sidewalks with a special Town Center streetscape design.
         Policy 3.7: Develop pedestrian courtyards and other outdoor
         spaces with planting and street furniture.
         Policy 3.8: Encourage pedestrian-oriented building frontages
         with shops opening to the public sidewalk, and encourage a
         minimum amount of retail uses on the first floor.
PUBLIC SPACES
         A wide variety of recreational and scenic opportunities are
         available to the public along the City's 6-1/2-mile coastline.
         Except for a few key locations, public access to the water's edge
         is excellent. Public places on the coast include Doheny State
         Beach, Capistrano Beach Park, Dana Point Harbor, Dana Strand
         Beach and Salt Creek Beach Park.
         A unique sequence of parks and lookouts on the coastal terrace
         above the water offer spectacular views of the ocean and Dana
         Point Headlands. Pines Park, Gazebo Park, Leyton Park,
         Lantern Bay Park, Heritage Park, Blue Lantern Overlook and
         Salt Creek Beach Park are an extraordinary collection of public
         viewing and recreational settings. The “Blufftop Trail” from

         the Headlands to Doheny State Beach is an excellent concept
         which appears to be successfully taking shape.               Future
         development of remaining coastal sites, especially the
         Headlands, raises many issues of public access and presents
         opportunities for additional public open space.
         GOAL 4: Maintain and enhance the City's public spaces
         and resources.
         Policy 4.1: Create a new Civic Center as a focus point of the
         City.
         Policy 4.2: Realize the opportunity for public open space
         throughout the City.
         Policy 4.3: Develop stronger pedestrian, bicycle and visual
         linkages between public spaces and to and along the shoreline
         and bluffs. (Coastal Act/30210, 30212)
         Policy 4.4: Encourage development of community cultural and
         recreational facilities. (Coastal Act/30213)
         Policy 4.5: Protect and enhance existing public views to the
         ocean through open space designations and innovative design
         techniques. (Coastal Act/30251)
         Policy 4.6: Preserve and maintain existing public accessways,
         and existing areas open to the public, located within visitor-
         serving developments in the coastal zone. (Coastal Act/30210,
         30212)
         Policy 4.7: Prohibit the conversion to exclusively private use
         of existing visitor-serving developments open to the public
         within the coastal zone. (Coastal Act/30210, 30213)
DESIGN QUALITY
         Dana Point's commercial districts need stronger design coordina-
         tion, improved circulation linkages, enhanced outdoor pedestrian
         spaces and higher-quality architecture that creates more attractive
         settings for shopping, entertainment and public gathering.
         GOAL 5: Achieve design excellence in site planning,
         architecture, landscape architecture and signage in new
                                                      URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT

         review of all new non-residential and multi-family development
         in the City.
         Policy 5.2: Encourage site and building design that takes
         advantage of the City's excellent climate to maximize indoor-
         outdoor spatial relationships. (Coastal Act/30250)
         Policy 5.3: Encourage buildings and exterior spaces that are
         carefully-scaled to human size and pedestrian activity.
         Policy 5.4: Encourage outdoor pedestrian spaces, sidewalks and
         usable open space in all new development.
         Policy 5.5: Promote extensive landscaping in all new projects
         while emphasizing the use of drought-tolerant plant materials.
         Policy 5.6: Encourage aesthetic roof treatment as an important
         architectural design feature.
         Policy 5.7: Consolidate adjacent parking lots, without
         reducing the number of parking stalls, in order to decrease the
         number of ingress and egress points onto arterials. (Coastal
         Act/30210, 30252)
DOHENY VILLAGE
         Doheny Village has an excellent strategic location at the
         Interstate 5 entrance to Dana Point. Opportunities for commer-
         cial, office and light industrial businesses can help the City work
         toward its economic development goals. The self-contained
         mixed-use nature of the village, combining multi-family housing
         with small businesses, is also a unique quality that can attract
         future investment and improvements.
         GOAL 6: Develop Doheny Village as a unified and improved
         neighborhood of retail shopping, light industrial, offices and
         multi-family components.
         Policy 6.1: Improve Pacific Coast Highway and Doheny Park
         Road as aesthetic entrance boulevards to the City.

                   THE URBAN DESIGN PLAN
The Urban Design Plan consists of two major sections. The first section
addresses City-wide Urban Design concepts. This includes the primary
elements that contribute to the design character of the City as a whole. The
second section focuses on community design concepts for the Capistrano
Beach, Dana Point, and Monarch Beach portions of the City. The Urban
Design Plan concepts illustrate how the goals and policies can be applied to
specific areas of the City. The figures and illustrations are indicative of
concepts only, and are not intended (or interpreted) to establish a specific
standard or requirement.
CITYWIDE URBAN DESIGN CONCEPTS
              The Natural Setting
              Dana Point's spectacular natural setting forms one of the most
              memorable arrangements of sea and landform in Southern
              California.    Its geographical location is marked by the
              ``Headlands'' and coastal bluffs. The Headlands is one of the
              most prominent features of the Southern California coastline
              between Point Loma and the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The City's
              favorable southwestern aspect orients toward Capistrano Bight, a
              subtle bend in the coastline which defines a shallow bay between
              Dana Point and San Mateo Point to the south. Santa Catalina
              Island is prominent as a scenic landmark visible on the open
              ocean to the west.
              Dana Point and its southern neighbor of San Clemente both
              derive their community identities from their coastal locations,
              although each City's development history has interpreted the
              coastal setting in different ways. Dana Point, from its early
              history as the harbor for Mission San Juan Capistrano and visit
              by Richard Henry Dana, has emphasized its maritime identity as
              a place to engage the sea.

The landforms of the Headlands and coastal bluffs are the most
The landforms of the Headlands and coastal bluffs are the most
prominent natural features of the City. They are visible from the
region's coastline and coastal hillsides from a distance of up to 30
miles. Public views and pedestrian access to the bluffs are
significant urban design and public resources of the City.
Urban Design policies and concepts guiding development of the
Headlands are:
° Minimize alteration of existing topography of the Headlands
   to measures necessary for public safety and to accommodate a
   development program consistent with the General Plan and
   Headlands Specific Plan.
° Require setbacks of buildings and site improvements from the
   bluff faces which will assure public and structural safety,
   consistent with detailed geotechnical report recom-
   mendations.
° Encourage building forms that maintain a low profile and are
   visually integrated with the landforms.
° The significance of and treatment of existing ridges, knolls,
   canyons and vegetation on the Headlands and bluffs should
   be determined in the Headlands Specific Plan, EIR, and

° Require all private development and public improvement
  proposals which have potential to impact public views of the
  Headlands and bluffs to submit detailed studies of view
  impacts. All development along the City's coastline, as well
  as several locations in the Dana Point Town Center and
  Monarch Beach areas, have potential to affect public views of
  the Headlands and bluffs.

The Beaches
                 Salt Creek Beach
Dana Point's coastline is unique in the diversity of its beaches.
Capistrano Beach, Doheny State Beach, Dana Strand Beach and
Salt Creek Beach each have a distinct character formed by surf
conditions, orientation, views, landform background and access
pattern. Capistrano Beach, Doheny State Beach and Salt Creek
Beach are all publicly owned facilities operated by State or
County agencies. Dana Strand Beach is a privately owned
property. Most of the beaches enjoy wide strands that provide
excellent public access along the water's edge. Urban design
policies and concepts guiding development along the beachfront
are:
° Require future built improvements adjacent to the beaches to
   consider the natural topography of the coastal terraces,
   embankments and bluffs as an integral part of the beachfront
   natural and visual setting. Development should protect
   existing natural features and be carefully integrated with
   landforms, emphasizing low profile building forms, retaining
   walls and other improvements that do not detract from the

    natural setting of the beach.
° Some older insensitive beachfront development has marred
    the natural setting and blocked public views to the ocean.
    Future improvements or modification of previously-devel-
    oped sites should strive to restore the appearance of the
    natural setting and open additional public views to the water.
    Opportunities to restore the appearance include:
       Sensitive development of the old Mobile Home Park above
       Dana Strand Beach according to a Specific Plan for the
       Dana Point Headlands.
       Encourage opening selective views to the ocean from the
       Pacific Coast Highway.
San Juan Creek and Salt Creek Basins
San Juan Creek and Salt Creek divide Dana Point's land mass
into three components which nearly concur with the communi-
ties of Capistrano Beach, Dana Point and Monarch Beach. The
creek basins and intervening ridgelines give physical definition
to the communities. The creek basins form visual corridors to
and from the inland landscape of hillsides and ridges.
San Juan Creek's history is closely linked to Mission San Juan
Capistrano. Historically, the creek provided irrigation for the
farmland around the Mission and a trail to the small harbor.
Although the flood control channel destroyed the natural
appearance of the creekbed, the hiking/biking path to San Juan
Capistrano is an important recreational resource. Urban design
policies and concepts guiding development near the creek basins
are:
° Future development of the land between the San Juan Creek
    channel and Santa Fe tracks shall provide an open space
    corridor for hiking and biking along the east channel edge.
    The corridor should be landscaped primarily with native
    riparian vegetation.
° Salt Creek and its surrounding basin has retained its open
    space character by location of The Links at Monarch Beach
    and adjacent Salt Creek regional open space, hiking and
    biking trail. Site planning, architecture and landscaping for
    the proposed Monarch Beach Resort development should

   contribute to the open, spacious feel of the valley.
The Capistrano Beach Palisades
Most of Capistrano Beach lies on a coastal terrace rising to
approximately 200 feet above sea level at the Interstate 5
Freeway. The bold line of cliffs (Palisades) along Pacific Coast
Highway define the character of the beachfront and create
exceptional views of the water from the residential neighbor-
hoods on the terrace. Major issues in the area are erosion and
stability of the bluffs, preservation of views of the bluffs from
Pacific Coast Highway through the new developments on the
inland side of the highway, and public views from the bluff top
to the coast. Urban design policies and concepts guiding
development along the Capistrano Beach Palisades are:
° New developments on the inland side of Pacific Coast
   Highway should preserve occasional open spaces to view the
   bluffs, avoiding a solid building line against the bluffs.
° There is potential for selective revegetation with native
   species on some of the bluffs and in the finger canyons along
   the Palisades. However, no further development or alteration
   of landforms should occur in the canyons.

Visual Linkages and Identity
Strengthen Dana Point's identity as a City by creating strong
visual linkages with unifying design elements on major street
corridors.

   Potential visual linkage. Planting on The Pacific
            Coast Highway, Monarch Beach
Dana Point's image, character and identity are highly dependent
upon the design quality of its streets. The City's streets are the
most visible part of the public environment, experienced daily by
all residents and visitors who move about the City. The street
system provides public spaces for walking and biking, scenic
opportunities, and visual-symbolic linkages between open
spaces, public facilities, neighborhoods and shopping districts.
Many of Dana Point's streets offer spectacular panoramic views
toward the ocean. These view opportunities form an important
part of the City's coastal identity, and are important scenic
resources to be preserved.
Improvement of the City's street character requires the
implementation of several design related elements including:
° Street trees and landscape ``focus areas'' along important
    thoroughfares.
° Improved pedestrian and bicycle opportunities connecting
    public parks, recreational facilities, scenic attractions, schools,
    residential neighborhoods and commercial districts.
° City identity graphics with directional signage marking public
    places.
° City entrance markers.
° Pedestrian-oriented lighting in special locations and districts.
° Preservation of public view corridors.
° Design guidelines for private property development to
    promote a coherent design character while allowing flexibility
    to encourage creative efforts.

Landscape Corridors
Initiate a program of street tree planting.
               Crown Valley Parkway
The importance of a comprehensive street landscape program to
Dana Point's image increases with the City's build-out and
resulting loss of natural open spaces to development. Street trees

can play an important role in defining three-dimensional space in
the City. The value of boulevard plantings, and groves of trees
in parks and open spaces, is both psychological and physical. A
high-quality landscape is usually associated with higher value
communities and is seen as an indication of the quality of life
and the value of real estate.
An ambitious street tree program, phased over a ten-year period,
can provide visual structure and design continuity along the
City's most visible public thoroughfares. Fortunately, Dana
Point has examples of recently-planted streets that provide a
model for the future. Recent improvements to the Street of the
Golden Lantern, Crown Valley Parkway and Pacific Coast
Highway northwest of the Street of the Blue Lantern, illustrate
what can be accomplished citywide.
Appendix "A," "Dana Point Landscape Corridors," gives an
Inventory of the City's major street corridors with Recommended
Improvements. The Recommended Improvements are categor-
ized according to the different arrangements of street, sidewalk
and landscape edges in the City.
Appendix "B", developed in conjunction with the Design
Guidelines, provides selected tree species for the City's designat-
ed Landscape Corridors, and general recommendations for other
streets in the City. Both appendices to this Element are
contained in the General Plan Appendix.
Implementation of the street tree program will require site
specific surveys of existing right-of-way conditions, utility
locations and preparation of detailed planting plans for each
street segment to be completed. Recommended improvements
on Pacific Coast Highway will require cooperation and approval
of CALTRANS.

Additional planting in small, highly-visible focus areas through-
out the City can strengthen the landscape character of the City
and street system. Clustered planting in these areas present an
opportunity for flowering shrubs and trees. Opportunities for
such plantings include:
° Business district gateway landscaping at the east and west
    entrances to the couplet at the Dana Point Town Center and
    the north and south entrances to Doheny Village along
    Doheny Park Road (at Camino Capistrano and the Route 1
    Freeway interchange).
° The northwest corner of Doheny Park Road and Pacific Coast
    Highway.
° Viewpoints and gateways or other locations on the Headlands
    site along Pacific Coast Highway.
° Harbor Gateway landscaping at all four corners of the
    intersection of Pacific Coast Highway/Del Obispo-Harbor
    Drive, as properties are renovated.
° Selected locations on the scarred hillside edges along the
    north side of Pacific Coast Highway, between the Street of the
    Crystal Lantern and the Street of the Copper Lantern.
Neighborhood Street Tree Planting
Local neighborhood street tree planting organized by property
owners and homeowners' associations is encouraged throughout
the City as a means of improving the quality of residential
neighborhoods. The City will work with organized groups to
assist with technical advice and the issuance of permits for right-
of-way planting. The funding of improvements and maintenance
is the responsibility of homeowners or the homeowners' groups.

Walking and Biking Linkages
Improve walking and biking opportunities between public parks,
community facilities and scenic attractions throughout the City.
 Heritage Park. Pedestrian and Biking Linkage to Doheny State Beach
Dana Point's parks, open spaces, beaches and scenic lookouts are
among the finest in Southern California. They need to be more
clearly linked, physically and perceptually, to encourage
pedestrian and biking circulation, and less use of the automobile.
The Blufftop Trail, which will eventually connect the Dana Point
Headlands to Doheny State Beach, is an excellent example of the
desired concept.
In addition to completion of the City's bikeway system, more
pedestrian walks and trails need to be developed, and the
pedestrian environment improved in key locations. Opportu-

nities for pedestrian improvements include:
° Complete the trail from the Dana Point Headlands to Doheny
    State Beach, and extend the trail northward along Dana
    Strand Beach to Salt Creek Beach Park and the regional trail
    system along the Salt Creek Basin.
° Develop an open space corridor with landscape and recre-
    ational improvements along the east edge of the San Juan
    Creek Channel.
° Develop a special graphic signage system to locate and
    increase awareness of pedestrian and biking paths, including
    ``scenic walks'' and "scenic bike rides" throughout the City.
° Improve pedestrian opportunities throughout the City, by
    completing the "Landscape Corridors" program and adding
    special streetscape improvements to the Dana Point Town
    Center and Doheny Village districts.
Street trees, wide sidewalks, street furniture, pedestrian lighting,
buildings and signage oriented to the sidewalk, and opportunities
to stop at a park or other public place, are all essential to improve
the City's pedestrian environment. Landscaping should be
provided between the sidewalk and the roadway to protect
pedestrians and buildings from traffic.

° Emphasize pedestrian-oriented site lighting in private
   development as a means to highlight pedestrian spaces and
   circulation patterns. Reduce high-masted site and parking lot
   lighting that contribute to excessive ambient light in the City's
   night-time sky.
° Develop pedestrian-oriented lighting adjacent to schools,

   occasional evening use.
Public View Preservation
Preserve public views from streets and public spaces throughout
the City, and open new views where opportunities exist.

Design Guidelines for Private Development
Adopt Design Guidelines for private development that emphasize
creating a high-quality street character, pedestrian orientation
and continuity of design among adjacent developments.
Future development in Dana Point should place primary emphasis on
the contribution it makes to the public environment of the City's streets
and pedestrian environment. While internally-oriented site and
building groups may be developed, this should not be at the expense of
public street character.
Key design principles to improve the contribution of developments to
public street character are:

° Orientation of principal building elevations toward public streets.
  Avoidance of blank walls, large parking lots and other elements
  void of pedestrian and visual interest along the street edge.
° Careful design of building forms as viewed from the street, with
  particular emphasis on creating building components scaled to
  human size.
° Design of coordinated visual and circulation linkages between
  adjacent developments to create design continuity along public
  streets. Relationships can be drawn from similar building forms,
  heights, materials, landscape patterns and signage; connected
  walkways and driveways; and similar site plan arrangements.
° Emphasis on pedestrian orientation and pedestrian opportunities,
  through widened sidewalks and street-facing plazas, courtyards
  visible from the street, and richly-planted landscape focus points
  oriented to the street.
° Provide appropriate landscape buffer between street and pedestri-
  ans and building site.
° Provision of landscape buffers between streets and new
  developments.

Architectural and Landscape Character
                                   URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
                    37                        JULY 9, 1991
Dana Point enjoys an architectural diversity which reflects the stylistic
preferences and predominant building types which have evolved over
its 75-year built history. The City's earliest buildings were simple
vernacular fishing shacks and shelters built along the coastline. The
earliest permanent buildings were residences designed in a variety of
styles, including the Spanish Colonial Revival, which became popular
in California during the 1920's.
The City's communities each share common design elements that
provide a subtle continuity to their architecture and landscape:
Capistrano Beach has no single architectural style, but the dense
plantings and residential scale of the neighborhood present an informal
character that emphasizes buildings carefully set in the landscape. The
area's most successfully designed commercial buildings, such as the
Edgewater Inn on the Pacific Coast Highway, continue this residential,
informal feel.
The Dana Point Town Center's recent effort to establish an
architectural theme has brought some continuity to the area, but
architectural style in itself is not enough to accomplish the desired
pedestrian orientation and ``village'' character. Design principles for
the orientation of buildings to public sidewalks, provision of
landscaped courtyards and other outdoor pedestrian spaces, removal of
private parking lots from public view, and the scaling of building
elements to human size are needed to build a more unified Town
Center that attracts residents and visitors.
Monarch Beach has a more Mediterranean character of architecture
and landscape. The area's spacious character and lack of mature
vegetation make single building forms more prominent in the
landscape. As the area's planting matures, the image will be
increasingly dominated by vegetation.
Architecture in Dana Point should emphasize the following basic
principles, regardless of location or building function:
° The integration of buildings and outdoor spaces for pedestrian
    activity is encouraged. The use of courtyards, patios, terraces,
    balconies, verandas, covered walkways and other defined outdoor
    spaces for human activity can help provide a rich architectural
    character that takes advantage of the region's climate, is energy
    efficient, and is designed for maximum human use.

° Architecture, landscape design and site planning should contribute
  to the quality and character of the City's streets and public spaces.
  Each development should be carefully designed to benefit the
  character of the surrounding neighborhood and form a
  complementary relationship to neighboring buildings.
° Buildings, planting and site design should promote pedestrian
  activity and pedestrian emphasis whenever an opportunity exists.
  Building frontages at the public sidewalk should be designed to
  maximize pedestrian emphasis and de-emphasize automobile
  orientation.
° Larger buildings should be designed to reduce their perceived
  height and bulk by dividing their mass into smaller parts carefully
  scaled to human size.
° Building forms and elevations should create interesting roof
  silhouettes, strong patterns of shade and shadow, and integral
  architectural detail.
° Building signage should be carefully integrated with the site
  design, architecture, and plantings.

          Historic Residence in Santa Clara Neighborhood
       Development of specific policies and programs to preserve
       historically and architecturally-significant sites is needed. The
       City's Historic Preservation program should contain the
       following procedural steps and elements:
       ° Adopt a City Historic Preservation Ordinance which estab-
           lishes City programs for designation, preservation, review of
           proposed alterations or demolition on designated historic
           sites, and potential preservation incentives. The City may
           consider offering zoning and parking variances to make
           preservation feasible when other alternatives for the
           revitalization or improvement of a property do not exist.
       ° Prepare a citywide Survey of Historic Resources to identify
           potentially-significant historic sites and districts. The Survey
           should prepare a listing of locally-significant historic
           resources for official designation by the City. Sites and
           districts with potential for State or National Register of
           Historic Places designation should also be identified, and
           nominations prepared where applicable.

              Capistrano Beach Residence
The neighborhoods of Capistrano Beach are among Dana Point's
oldest and most distinguished residential areas. Several houses
with potential for historic designation, such as the Dolph
Mansion in Dana Point and Doheny House, are located here.
The mature vegetation and distinct street landscape throughout
the area create a strong identity. Pines Park, as well as the
smaller lookouts at Camino Estrella, Gazebo Park and Louise
Leyton Park, provide exceptional ocean views and limited
recreational opportunities. Palisades Drive, the neighborhood's
only street connecting directly to Pacific Coast Highway, is one
of the City's most dramatic visual sequences as it winds down the
bluff edge to the beach below.
Urban Design Concepts:
° Preserve the scale and character of the existing residential
    neighborhoods.
° Maintain existing residential development standards for yard
    setbacks, minimum lot size and building height. Institute
    Discretionary Design Review for all multi-family residential
    development.
° Provide public street tree improvements along Camino
    Capistrano and Camino Estrella, and encourage neighbor-
    hood-organized landscape improvements on other streets.
° Encourage a new scenic lookout along Camino Capistrano,
    between Camino Estrella and the southern City limit at Del
    Gado Road.
° Provide additional landscape improvements on Palisade Drive
    between Gazebo Park and Pacific Coast Highway.
° Promote applicable portions of Calle Hermosa as a pedestri-
    an-oriented mixed use district of small shops, professional
    services and upper level dwellings.
° Encourage property owners to consider funding pedestrian
    street light and street landscape improvements.

Pacific Coast Highway in Capistrano Beach
The design character of Pacific Coast Highway is dominated by
the continuous wide beachfront and line of coastal bluffs.
Existing residences line the beachfront between Camino
Capistrano and Palisade Drive. Most commercial development,
primarily visitor-serving lodging, restaurants and small shops, is
clustered between Palisade Drive and Doheny Park Road.
Important Urban Design issues are the scale and character of new
commercial development in the area, and completion of
pedestrian and bike paths along and across Pacific Coast
Highway. Urban design policies for improvements along Pacific
Coast Highway are:
° Complete pedestrian and bikeway improvements between
   Camino Capistrano and Doheny Park Road.
   Provide walking paths on both sides of the highway and a
   bikeway on the west side.
° Provide landscape improvements on both sides of the
   highway.
   East side: Street trees
   West side: Color shrubs in groupings, between the walking
   path and Santa Fe tracks.

° Maintain and improve open views of the ocean from Pacific
   Coast Highway through Doheny State Beach and Capistrano
   Beach Park.
   Parking lots, landscaping and other improvements should be
   designed and maintained to maximize coastal view opportuni-
   ties.
   Future improvements on the public beach sites should not
   block ocean views from Pacific Coast Highway.
Doheny Village
Doheny Village lies at the edge of the gateway to the City from
the Interstate 5 Freeway. The district's assets are its close
physical proximity to the beach, good freeway access and high
visibility.
The mixed-use nature of Doheny Village is unique in the City.

However, Doheny Village needs to develop a more unified
character through streetscape improvements and more consistent
architectural and landscape design. Opportunities exist to
develop stronger pedestrian connections to the beach and the
planned hiking/biking path along the edges of the San Juan
Creek Channel. Urban design policies for development in
Doheny Village are:

Regular tree planting is recommended with a single dominant
tree species to help unify the district's character along public
streets and in parking areas. This can be complemented with a
variety of ornamental and canopy trees in yards and courtyards.
Consider trees common in riparian areas to reflect the creekside
setting of Doheny Village.

        business park for marine oriented commercial services, light
        industry, and research and development uses.
        New development should provide landscaped open space with
        dense canopy trees for visual screening of building roofs,
        parking and service areas.
        The parkway adjacent to San Juan Creek shall incorporate the
        hiking/biking path, native riparian vegetation and trees.
San Juan Creek Channel Hiking/Biking Path at Doheny Village
     Emphasize Victoria Boulevard as the primary pedestrian linkage
     between Doheny Village and San Juan Creek. Study alternatives
     for pedestrian crossing at the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
     tracks (surface, subgrade and elevated).

  internal circulation linkages when feasible. Surface parking
  areas should be located to the rear or sides of buildings.
° General architectural, landscape and signage design principles

      Pacific Coast Highway looking Northwest
Revitalization of the Dana Point Town Center is a high priority
design and economic development goal of the City. The Town
Center's future is closely linked to the need to manage traffic on
Pacific Coast Highway and Del Prado, a program that will
require the cooperation of CALTRANS. The primary goal of the
area is to create a compact pedestrian-oriented village with a
“small town” atmosphere and a mix of uses serving both
residents and visitors. The Town Center should become one of
Dana Point's central business districts and a public gathering
place for entertainment, restaurants and shopping.
Urban Design Concepts for the Dana Point Town Center:
Public Spaces and Streetscape:
° Improve pedestrian opportunities throughout the Town Center
   with widened sidewalks, regular street tree planting, street
   furniture, pedestrian-oriented lighting, and building frontages
   oriented to the sidewalk.
° Develop landscape entrance features at each end of the Town
   Center.

Architecture in the Town Center
The
The most important principles for future architecture in the Town
Center is to emphasize creating a strong pedestrian orientation and
carefully scaling building elements into small parts that relate to
human size.
° Provide pedestrian-oriented building frontages with ground-level
   shops and other active uses at the sidewalk. Outdoor pedestrian

    spaces such as courtyards, patios, covered walkways, porches and
    balconies are encouraged in all new private developments.
° Divide large building masses into smaller elements that reflect a
    village feel and scale. Informal proportions and composition are
    encouraged.
° Permit building heights up to 3 stories, provided the third story is
    stepped back along the primary street frontage.
° Pitched and gabled roof forms are encouraged.
° Wood siding painted in earth tone colors is encouraged as a
    primary wall material, but other materials and colors may be
    acceptable if the building is carefully-scaled to the pedestrian, is
    compatible with neighboring buildings, and is sensitive to the
    informal village character desired for architecture in the Town
    Center.
Design policy in the Town Center has encouraged an architectural
character derived from seacoast villages. While this vocabulary is
encouraged in new development, other design approaches may be
acceptable if they achieve sensitively-scaled buildings that contribute
to an improved pedestrian environment and village atmosphere.
La Plaza
° Strengthen the Plaza area as a center of neighborhood shops and
     services. Potential redevelopment of the west side of La Plaza
     presents an opportunity to define the public space with a two story
     building of ground level shops and upper level offices or
     dwellings.

° Promote redevelopment of the northwest (Chevron) and northeast
    (old Post Office) corners of La Plaza and Pacific Coast Highway.
Parking in the Town Center
Create a parking district for public parking and study potential
locations for additional public parking including structures and lots.
Consider reduced on-site parking requirements and institute an in-lieu
fee program to finance public parking facilities when minimum
standard on-site parking requirements are not met.

The Santa Clara Avenue Neighborhood and Blufftop Trail
              Amber Lantern Lookout
The Santa Clara Avenue neighborhood is a small unique
residential enclave between the Harbor and Town Center. The
neighborhood is noted for its well maintained and historic
houses, public lookouts and spectacular views to the ocean.

Several newer multi-family projects have been developed in the
neighborhood to diversify and compliment the area's older single
family character. The recent development of a portion of the
Blufftop Trail has successfully pioneered one of southern
California's most unique and significant open space resources.
° Where possible, complete the missing links of the Blufftop
   Trail between the Headlands and Doheny State Beach. Since
   existing single family homes prohibit a continuous bluff edge
   easement between The Streets of the Blue and Amber
   Lanterns and between Streets of the Violet and Old Golden
   Lantern, develop pedestrian improvements (street trees,
   benches, bike lanes, and graphic markers) along Santa Clara
   Avenue to continue the trail.

The Dana Point Harbor
The City of Dana Point is the local agency responsible for
general planning and zoning of the Dana Point Harbor. The
County of Orange has management responsibility for the Harbor.
 However, as a part of the City of Dana Point, the City and the
General Plan have an active role in shaping the Harbor's future
improvement and development.
Dana Point Harbor Drive, with its plantings, recreational spaces
and views of the bluffs, provides a dramatic open space corridor
along the Harbor edge. The following pedestrian connections in
the Harbor area need to be strengthened:
° Improve the pedestrian linkage between the Harbor and Dana
   Point Headlands along Cove Road.
° Create a stronger pedestrian linkage and design orientation
   between the Harbor and Doheny State Beach. Improve the
   pedestrian and bike paths.
The design of buildings and parking areas in the Harbor district
needs to give greater attention to the unique waterfront setting.
° Future buildings and building additions should form compact
   clusters located along the water's edge, in the same manner as
   historic dockside and marine development. Freestanding
   buildings surrounded by parking lots should be avoided.

° The visual impact of parking lots and trailer storage areas
  needs to be reduced. Visitors to the Harbor should view
  landscape and buildings, with parking and boat storage areas
  screened by vegetation, low walls and buildings.

The Dana Point Headlands
The Dana Point Headlands form the City's most precious land
resource. Urban Design objectives for development on the
Headlands are:
° Preserve a continuous open space corridor along the coastline,
   providing full public access to the bluff edge and coastal
   views.
° Connect the Blufftop Trail to the Headlands, and extend the
   trail to Dana Strand Beach and Salt Creek Beach Park.
° Preserve the relative height and visual prominence of the
   ridge top near Pacific Coast Highway as permanent open
   space, and consider the ridge top for location of a public park.
° Develop a landscaped open space corridor along Pacific Coast
   Highway, preserving the perception of the Headlands as being
   predominantly open land.
° Future buildings on the Headlands should be carefully
   integrated with existing landforms, maintaining a visual
   profile that causes minimum disruption of public ridgeline
   views.

The Lantern Residential District
The Lantern District is a relatively high density neighborhood of
single family, duplex and multi-family dwellings north and
inland of the Dana Point Town Center. The area's close walking
distance to the Town Center, view corridors to the ocean along
streets, and strong neighborhood identity are assets. Needed
urban design improvements are:
° Upgrading of infrastructure. Many streets and alleys need
    reconstruction, and several missing sidewalk segments need
    to be completed.
° The entire area would benefit from a neighborhood-organized
    street landscape effort, provided that view corridors to the
    ocean are not obstructed. Public street tree improvements on
    La Cresta Drive and Selva Road are especially needed.
° Stronger code enforcement to correct dilapidated and poorly-
    maintained properties which degrade positive neighborhood
    identity.

Monarch Beach
             The Ritz Carlton at Monarch Beach
Monarch Beach has a dramatic setting focused on the Pacific
Ocean and Salt Creek Basin. The area has benefitted by master
planning and more current development standards. Salt Creek
Beach Park, Dana Strand Beach and The Links at Monarch
Beach give the community an outdoor recreation emphasis. The
most prominent landmark is the Ritz Carlton Resort Hotel, soon
to be accompanied by the Monarch Beach Resort.
Monarch Beach has few Urban Design issues due to its newness
and quality of recent planning efforts. Planned Urban Design
improvements are:
° Completion of the Salt Creek regional trail from Laguna
   Niguel to Salt Creek Beach. Construction of a public beach
   building at Salt Creek Beach.
° Stronger development standards that provide carefully-sited
   and designed projects that fit the existing topography,
   minimizing mass-grading and large engineered flat pads.
° Completion of roadside landscaping, walkways and bike
   paths along Pacific Coast Highway.
° Provide public improvements to Sea Terrace Park.
