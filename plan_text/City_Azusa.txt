City Design
The citizens of Azusa strongly favor preserving
our natural environment and traditional neigh-
borhoods. They also want to reclaim areas that
have declined and foster exciting public places
that will become the source of civic pride. Azusa
is commi�ed to enhancing its distinct identity and
sense of place and rejecting conventional devel-
opment pa�erns that have made too many towns
into dreary sprawl. There is no place in Azusa for
more ugly strip malls, “cookie cu�er” tract hous-
ing or poorly-designed and poorly-maintained
apartments.
                                                       This General Plan aims to repair the City’s dam-

   Courtyard Housing is an architectural type consisting of townhouses or townhouses over ﬂats arranged around a
   common court. The court should be inhabitable—a minimum 20’ in either dimension and roughly square in pro-
   portion—and should open via a gateway to the street. The entrance and public rooms of all dwellings should face
   either the court or the public street. Entrances and public rooms should also be located on the ground level—upper
   ﬂoors should be reserved for private rooms such as bedrooms. Occasionaly dwellings may be located on the second
   ﬂoor—but these should have private stairs to the court.

      Introduction
      This section consists of an excerpt from the
      2000-2005/2006 Housing Element, which was

    Azusa’s Recreation Element is such an optional

    will have the same legal status as any of the man-

Mineral Resources
Statutory Requirements
State law, Government Code Section 65302(d),
requires a discussion of mineral resources in the
conservation element. The Azusa General Plan
discusses mineral resources in its Mineral Re-

           Normally Acceptable - Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that
           any buildings involved are of normal conventional construction without any special noise
           insulation requirements.

           after a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements is made and needed noise
           insulation features included in the design. Conventional construction, but with closed
           windows and fresh air supply system or air conditionally will normally suffice.
           Normally Unacceptable - New construction or development should generally be
           discouraged. If new construction or development does proceed, a detailed analysis of the
           noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features included in
           the design.
