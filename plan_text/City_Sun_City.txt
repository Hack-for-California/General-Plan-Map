1. Introduction
A.         PLANNING CONTEXT
The City of Menifee is one of California’s newest incorporated communities,
having incorporated in October 2008. Covering an area of 50 square miles,
the City of Menifee is one of the largest communities in Riverside County. It is
bordered to the north by Perris, to the south by Murrieta, to the west by
Canyon Lake and Lake Elsinore, and to east by county area. Centrally located
in southwestern Riverside County, the I-15 and I-215 provide direct access to
the greater Inland Empire and San Diego region.
The City of Menifee offers a variety of distinctive living environments defined
by topography, history, and rural-suburban settings. Sun City is a master-
planned community for seniors built by Del Webb. Romoland was established
in the late 1800s as a predominantly agricultural community. Quail Valley is a
hilly and isolated residential community in west Menifee. Bell Mountain and
other areas south of Garbani Road offer residents a more rural setting. And
the Paloma Valley encompasses master-planned communities in Menifee.
Menifee incorporated because they desired a government structure made up
of leaders who understood and represented Menifee’s unique values and
priorities. The intent was to create and strengthen the City’s diverse array of
communities and environments, which range from rural mountainous areas
to urbanized activity centers; address the special needs of established
residential communities such as Sun City, Quail Valley, and portions of
Romoland; and celebrate the City’s unique attributes, such as its rural
heritage, natural valley setting, and topography—all of which distinguish
Menifee from other cities in the Inland Empire.
Although cityhood offers Menifee the opportunity for local governance and
determining its destiny, it also brings challenges. Menifee is balancing
meeting its housing needs, improving the transportation system, attracting
businesses that offer jobs and tax revenues, protecting its environmental
features, providing public facilities and community services, and preserving
its rural lifestyle. Successfully navigating these challenges requires thoughtful
planning, balancing of interests, and commitment to a shared vision.
The City of Menifee is committed to responding effectively to these
challenges through its first General Plan and Housing Element. As expressed
in the community’s vision and values, the City is dedicated to preserving the
character of its diverse communities and neighborhoods while
accommodating the demands and responsibilities of cityhood. These
priorities underpin the City’s first housing element.
                                                                         CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT 1

Introduction
                                  B.        REPORT CONTENT
                                  The State of California recognizes that an adequate supply of affordable
                                  housing for all income levels is a fundamental need for all communities. To
                                  achieve that goal, it is critical that all local governments share in the
                                  responsibility of implementing solutions to address local and regional
                                  housing needs. To that end, all California local governments are required to
                                  prepare a Housing Element (or housing chapter of the General Plan) that
                                  specifies how the community will plan for its housing needs.
                                  The detailed statutory requirements for preparing a housing element are
                                  codified in the California Government Code (sections 65580–65589). As stated
                                  therein, the Housing Element must contain an identification and analysis of its
                                  existing and projected housing needs; an analysis of the various
                                  governmental and nongovernmental constraints to meeting that need; and a
                                  series of goals, policies, and scheduled programs to further the development,
                                  improvement, and preservation of housing.
                                  The Menifee Housing Element is organized into two separate volumes: the
                                  Housing Technical Report and the Housing Plan. The Technical Report is a
                                  reference document that contains a description of the City’s housing needs,
                                  and the constraints and resources to meeting those needs. The Housing Plan
                                  sets forth goals, policies, and programs to address those needs and is
                                  included as a chapter in the Menifee General Plan.
                                  The Technical Report contains four sections:
                                   Introduction to the housing element, the statutory authority and
                                    requirements for the housing element, a description of the public outreach
                                    process, and relationship to other planning processes;
                                   Analysis of demographic, social, and housing characteristics; current and
                                    future housing needs due to population growth and change; and other
                                    factors affecting housing need;
                                   Analysis of governmental and nongovernmental constraints that affect the
                                    development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for all income
                                    groups and people with disabilities;
                                   Inventory of resources available to address the City’s housing needs,
                                    including available land for housing, as well as the financial resources and
                                    administrative capacity to manage housing programs.
                                  The Housing Plan contains specific goals, policies, and implementation
                                  programs to address the development, improvement, and conservation of
                                  housing that will address current and future needs in Menifee.

                                                                                                  Introduction
C.        RELATED PLANS
The City of Menifee’s 2008–2014 Housing Element is directly related to
planning and policy documents mandated by the state of California and the
federal government. The Housing Element is required to maintain consistency
with each of them. The following list describes these documents and how the
City will maintain consistency with each of them.
 General Plan Consistency. The 2008–2014 Housing Element is consistent
  with the other elements within the General Plan. The sites designated for
  housing in the Housing Element are capable of accommodating the City’s
  entire regional housing needs allocation. The sites are consistent with the
  land use plan in the General Plan and the growth projections analyzed in
  the Environmental Impact Report. The City will maintain consistency
  between General Plan elements by ensuring that proposed changes in one
  element, including the Housing Element, are reflected in other elements
  when such amendments of the General Plan are needed. In this manner,
  the 2008–2014 Housing Element will maintain consistency.
 Water and Sewer Services. The Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD) is
  responsible for providing water and sanitation services to Menifee residents
  and businesses. In accordance with state law, the City transmitted its 2008–
  2014 Housing Element to EMWD prior to submitting the draft to public
  review so that population projections can be incorporated into EMWD
  plans. This allows EMWD to plan for its water and sewer infrastructure and
  set priorities to serve affordable housing as required under Government
  Code 65589.7 should a shortfall in water or sewer service occur. EMWD does
  not anticipate a shortfall in water supply or sewer capacity that would
  preclude the City from meetings its affordable housing requirements.
 Safety and Open Space and Conservation Elements. As required by
  Section 65302 of the Government Code, cities must amend their safety and
  open space and conservation elements of the General Plan to include
  analysis and policies for flood hazard and management information. The
  City of Menifee is completing its first General Plan, including its Housing
  Element and will comply with these requirements. For example, the General
  Plan contains policies and programs to address future drainage and flood
  hazards for housing sites. Future updates of the Housing Element will
  incorporate any changes in flood hazard and management information.
 Federal Consolidated Plan. Prior to incorporation, Menifee was a member
  of the Riverside Urban County Consortium and participated in countywide
  efforts to receive housing and community development funds. In 2012,
  Menifee adopted its first Consolidated Plan to become an entitlement
  jurisdiction and be eligible to receive community development block grant
  funds directly from the federal government. The housing and community
  development needs identified during this effort and the program
  commitments are consistent with those identified in the Housing Element
  and so the two planning efforts are complementary.
                                                                     CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT       3

Introduction
                                  D.        PUBLIC OUTREACH
                                  California law requires that local governments include public participation as
                                  part of the housing element. Specifically, Government Code 65583(c)(7) states
                                  “that the local government shall make a diligent effort to achieve public
                                  participation of all economic segments of the community in the development
                                  of the housing element, and the program shall describe this effort.” State law
                                  does not specify the means nor methods for participation; however, it is
                                  generally recognized that the participation must be inclusive.
                                  As part of the General Plan, the City of Menifee conducted an extensive public
                                  engagement program to solicit views from the community. Described below,
                                  these forums offered input for the housing element:
                                      3 Consolidated Plan Workshops
                                      5 Community Workshops
                                      1 Citywide Vision Workshop (March 11, 2010)
                                      18 General Plan Advisory Committee Meetings (2010)
                                      10 Planning Commission Meetings
                                      3 City Council Meetings
                                      1 Public Hearing for Release of the Draft Housing Element to HCD
                                  Consolidated Plan Workshops
                                  The City of Menifee adopted a formal public participation plan, as required for
                                  communities seeking to become federal entitlement jurisdictions. The City
                                  held six meetings to define housing, community development, and service
                                  needs in Menifee. Notices were sent to all known service providers operating
                                  in the City and the local newspaper, and were posted at the City Hall, Paloma
                                  Valley Library, Sun City Library, Romoland Library, Senior Center, and
                                  Community Center. The City involved the Menifee Citizens Advisory
                                  Committee (a 13-member advisory board created by City Council) in the
                                  consolidated plan. Phone interviews were also conducted with various
                                  housing, fair housing, and public service agencies serving the City of Menifee.
                                  As part of the consolidated plan needs assessment process, the City of
                                  Menifee issued a community survey to determine the most important
                                  housing services desired by residents. Of the 22 housing subcategories,
                                  property maintenance was deemed the issue that warranted the highest
                                  priority for addressing local housing needs. Public services and community
                                  facilities for youth (e.g., youth center, parks, and recreational services)
                                  garnered significant community support due to the many families living in
                                  Menifee. As an indication of the difficult economic times in the Inland Empire,
                                  job creation and crime awareness and prevention were also of high concern.

                                                                                                    Introduction
General Plan Neighborhood Workshops
The City of Menifee held four general plan visioning workshops for
neighborhoods in 2010. These neighborhood workshops were held in the
evening in various venues and were attended by an average of 25 to 50
residents and stakeholders. The workshops were designed for residents to
express issues of concern so that priorities could be determined while
developing the General Plan and drafting the land use plan alternatives and
the goals, policies, and programs to be implemented.
        February 22, 2010 (Romoland Visioning Workshop)
        February 24, 2010 (Sun City Visioning Workshop)
        February 24, 2010 (City Hall Visioning)
        February 25, 2010 (Quail Valley Visioning)
        March 10, 2010 (Stakeholder Group)
With any inaugural General Plan, the community will have different desires
about the future, which will at times result in conflict. The impact of changes
occurring around Menifee, state mandates, and the desire to preserve the
quality of life—these are just some of the issues to resolve. With respect to
housing, the primary concern was the impact of foreclosures on
neighborhoods, followed closely by concerns about housing quality and code
enforcement and the impact of increased density of housing in certain areas
of the City. Infrastructure concerns were also raised in communities such as
Quail Valley and Romoland.
General Plan Advisory Committee
The Menifee City Council appointed a 17-member general plan advisory
committee (GPAC) to help inform the development of the general plan. Over
the course of 18 meetings in 2010, plus a mobile tour, attendees discussed
issues such as land use, community character, demographic trends, and the
need to accommodate existing and future housing growth needs in Menifee.
In addition, the discussion focused around the need and role for mixed-use
and multiple-family housing products at a density sufficient to facilitate the
lower income housing allocation to address statutory requirements. These
discussions underscored the need for policies in the General Plan to preserve
the uniqueness of different neighborhoods in Menifee.
The GPAC meetings were duly noticed public meetings, therefore open to all
stakeholders, the public, and members of the local press. Prior to each
meeting, the City of Menifee widely advertised the meetings and invited
residents, businesses, and other interested stakeholders to participate.
Meetings were noticed four ways: 1) agenda posting on the City’s website, 2)
agenda posting at Kay Ceniceros Center, Sun City Library, and City Hall, 3)
agenda emailed to persons requesting notices of public meetings, and 4)
publication in the “Calendar” on the front page of the City’s website. The
meetings were also covered by the local North County Times.
                                                                       CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT       5

                                  Following the GPAC meetings, the Planning Commission held an additional
                                  10 public meetings during 2011 to respond to the issues presented by the
                                  GPAC. Six of the meetings focused on the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
                                  (RHNA) and how to effectively plan for housing sites to accommodate the
                                  RHNA. The Planning Commission recommended approval of the draft land
                                  use map to the City Council at their January 10, 2012, meeting. The City
                                  Council also met three times on the draft land use map (January 17, 2011,
                                  February 7, 2012, and February 21, 2012).
                                  Like the GPAC meetings, the public hearings were duly noticed public
                                  meetings, therefore open to all stakeholders, the public, and members of the
                                  local press. Prior to each meeting, the City of Menifee widely advertised the
                                  meetings and invited residents, businesses, and other interested stakeholders
                                  to participate. Public hearings were noticed the same four ways as the GPAC
                                  meetings: 1) agenda posting on the City’s website, 2) agenda posting at Kay
                                  Ceniceros Center, Sun City Library, and City Hall, 3) agenda emailed to
                                  persons requesting notices of public meetings, and 4) publication in the
                                  “Calendar” on the front page of the City’s website. The meetings were also
                                  covered by the local North County Times.
                                  Participants raised issues regarding the future of Menifee. It became apparent
                                  that the City must prioritize economically sustainable strategies for
                                  commercial and industrial development along I-15 and I-215. State housing
                                  law required accommodating the RHNA, so specific sites were redesignated
                                  to achieve housing goals. Finally, considerable discussion occurred regarding
                                  how to maintain a rural lifestyle in specific areas of Menifee where animal
                                  keeping, ranching, and agriculture could continue. These required additional
                                  land use changes, reflected in the land use map, and tailored strategies to
                                  meet the needs of the diverse communities in Menifee.
                                  Prior to submitting the draft Housing Element to the Department of Housing
                                  and Community Development (HCD), the City Council held one more public
                                  hearing to review the draft and consider public comments. The City followed
                                  the same noticing protocol for the public hearing as the prior public hearings.
                                  To address requirements in State law, additional outreach was made to
                                  encourage nonprofit service providers, affordable housing developers, and
                                  stakeholders to attend and participate at the City Council meeting. The
                                  meeting drew more than 100 people, with comments offered by residents,
                                  business, and Habitat for Humanity. After considerable discussion, the City
                                  Council approved release of the draft housing element to HCD.

2. Housing Needs
To provide a context for housing planning, this chapter provides an overview
of Menifee and discusses a variety of demographic, economic, housing, and
special needs characteristics and trends to identify issues that affect the City’s
existing and future housing needs.
A.       DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS
POPULATION GROWTH
Today, the City of Menifee is the eighth most populous city in Riverside
County, with a population of 77,519 as of the 2010 Census. As a new
community spanning 50 square miles, Menifee is anticipated to experience
moderate population growth into the future. According to the Menifee
General Plan, the City’s population could increase to approximately 161,000
residents by buildout, which is less than originally planned under the
Riverside Integrated Comprehensive Plan.
The vast majority of housing growth in the community is slated for master-
planned communities approved over the last decade prior to the City’s
incorporation. The primary task for this 2008–2014 Housing Element is not to
determine or direct the full residential development of the community.
Rather, this Housing Element focuses on how to address anticipated
population growth within a more defined period, 2008–2014. Subsequent
housing elements will focus on a longer periods of time.
                                                                        CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT 7

Housing Needs
                                  POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
                                  Population characteristics have an important influence on housing need. Race
                                  and ethnicity play a role, but age characteristics clearly have the greatest
                                  influence on housing needs. These population characteristics and their
                                  corresponding impacts on housing need in Menifee are discussed below.
                                  Race and Ethnicity
                                  Menifee has a more homogeneous population makeup than surrounding
                                  communities: 54% of Menifee’s residents are White compared to 36% in
                                  nearby cities. Menifee and the region both have a significant Hispanic
                                  population (Figure 1). According to the 2010 Census, 33% of Menifee
                                  residents identify themselves of Hispanic/Latino origin versus 44% in
                                  surrounding cities. In addition, the African American population comprises
                                  10% of the region (versus only 5% of Menifee) and Asians comprise 7% of the
                                  region (versus only 5% in Menifee).
                                  Looking toward the future, race and ethnic changes in Menifee’s population is
                                  expected to generally mirror larger regional population trends, all other
                                  things being equal. These changes shape housing needs in Menifee to the
                                  extent that household and economic characteristics differ between race and
                                  ethnic groups. For example, Hispanics generally have a larger average
                                  household size than other groups. Thus, a large increase in Hispanic
      Figure 1: Race/Ethnicity
                                  households over time would gradually result in different housing needs than
                                  the same increase in White households.
                                  Age Characteristics
                                  The age of residents is an important factor in determining the types of
                                  housing, health care, and public services needed in Menifee. The City’s
                                  population is generally older than that of the region, with a median of 38
                                  versus 31 years (Census 2010). This is due to the sizeable senior population
                                  residing in Sun City, a master-planned senior community. As shown in Figure
                                  2, Menifee has a proportionally smaller population of all other age ranges
                                  compared to the region. Families make up a slightly smaller portion of all
                                  households in the City than they do in the region.
                                  Traditionally, younger adults prefer apartments, condominiums, and smaller
                                  single-family units that are affordable. Middle-aged adults and families prefer
                                  larger homes that offer the space to more easily accommodate children.
                                  Seniors often prefer smaller units that are more affordable and easily
                                  maintained. Therefore, it Menifee’s existing population (specifically baby
                                  boomers) continue to age and younger families continue to migrate to the
                                  community, this may increase the demand for smaller and more affordable

                                                                                                      Housing Needs
HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Household type also influences housing need. For instance, single-person
households often occupy smaller apartments or condominiums, such as one-
bedroom units. Couples often prefer larger single-family homes, particularly if
they have children. These patterns underscore the need for a diversity of
housing opportunities for people of all ages and income.
Household Type
The City of Menifee has about 27,461 households according to the 2010
Census. With respect to household type, a smaller proportion of Menifee’s
households are families (71%) than in the region (82%). This difference is due
in part to the high proportion of single seniors in Sun City. Menifee has almost
twice the proportion of single persons (24%) than surrounding communities
(13%). Moreover, only 31% of Menifee’s households are married couples with
children versus 36% of households in the surrounding region (Figure 3).
Looking forward to the future, the household composition of Menifee should
continue to mirror patterns of population growth and change of
southwestern Riverside County as a whole. The City of Menifee has several
very large master-planned communities (e.g., Audie Murphy, The Lakes, and
others) approved for the development of single-family homes in traditional
residential neighborhoods. As specific plans are developed, the single-family
neighborhoods will attract families with children, mirroring the demographic
trends in southwestern Riverside County.                                                 Figure 3: Household Types
Household Size
Although generally a community of single-family housing, the average size of
households residing in Menifee is approximately 2.8 persons per household—
significantly lower than the average household size of 3.5 persons in
surrounding communities (2010 Census). This is because more than 56% of
Menifee households are one or two-person households compared to 36% in
the region. Moreover, Menifee also has a smaller proportion of large
households with five or more persons—16% versus 26% in the later region.
The result is a smaller household size in Menifee compared to the region.
Menifee’s small average household size is due in part to the significant senior
population living in retirement communities. For example, Sun City has an
average household size of only 1.3 persons. However, these characteristics are
markedly different elsewhere. If the City’s senior population is excluded,
Menifee’s average household size is significantly higher, at 3.6 persons. In
contrast, the average household size is 3.1 in Murrieta and 3.8 in Perris. Since
2010, the majority of single-family homes being built in the community are
larger 3-, 4-, and 5- bedroom units, which suggests that the average
household size is anticipated to increase in the future.
                                                                                          Figure 4: Household Size
                                                                       CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT           9

Housing Needs
                                 ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS
                                 Economic characteristics, such as the employment rate, also affect housing
                                 needs of residents. In 2009, approximately 25,071 (49%) of Menifee residents
                                 older than 16 years were in the labor force (Claritas 2009). This compares to a
                                 labor force participation of 64% in the region and 62% statewide. A higher
                                 number of retirees in Menifee versus other communities explain the majority
                                 of the difference in labor force participation rates. No unemployment figures
                                 are available for Menifee, albeit unemployment in Romoland and Quail Valley
                                 are estimated at above 20% (EDD 2010).
                                 As shown in Table 1, Menifee residents work in three key business sectors—
                                 goods producing, knowledge-based, and health and education. These three
                                 sectors account for 70% of jobs held by Menifee residents. In contrast, 83% of
                                 all jobs located in Menifee are in these three sectors. However, it is important
                                 to note that employers in Menifee’s job base offer only one-third of all jobs
                                 needed to support Menifee residents, meaning that many must commute to
                                 surrounding communities.
                                 Jobs-housing balance is an important issue for the community. In 2006, the
                                 Menifee area had 0.9 workers (employed and those looking for work) per
                                 household and 0.5 jobs per household. Taken as a whole, cities in the region
                                 had 1.3 workers per household and 0.9 jobs per household. Even though the
                                 City has fewer residents in the labor force, it still provides even fewer jobs per
                                 resident worker than the other cities in the region, resulting in longer
                                 commutes for its residents.
                                 As of 2007, jobs in Menifee provided, on average, an annual wage of $32,026.
                                 This is on par with the average annual wage of $32,678 for Riverside County.

HOUSEHOLD INCOME
Along with housing costs, household income is the most fundamental factor
affecting housing opportunity. According to Claritas, the City’s median
household income in 2010 was approximately $61,000, or 10% below the
median income for the region. Shown in the sidebar, 47% of Menifee
households earn below $50,000 per year, compared to 36% in the region,
while 19% of Menifee households earn above $100,000 per year, compared to
26% of households in the region (Figure 5).
The State of California Department of Housing and Community Development
surveys households in each county on an annual basis to determine the
median income. The median income is also adjusted for households of
different sizes. Households are then grouped into four income groups for
purposes of determining the need for assistance. Based on 2010 categories,
these income groups and thresholds are:
  Extremely low: households earning up to 30 percent of CMFI, or a
   maximum income of $19,500 for a household of four.
  Very low: households earning 31 to 50 percent of CMFI, or a maximum                                         Figure 5: Resident Incomes
   income of $32,500 for a household of four.
  Other Low: households earning 51 to 80 percent of CMFI, or a maximum of
   $52,000 for a four-person household.
  Moderate: households earning 81 to 120 percent of CMFI, or a maximum
   income of $78,000 for a household of four.
  Above Moderate: households earning above 120 percent of CMFI, which is
   more than $78,000 for a household of four.
Table 2 details the income distribution of households in Menifee. Shown
below, the percentage of Menifee residents who are homeowners is
significantly less for lower income households and significantly higher for
moderate income households. In contrast, the majority of renters earn either
low or moderate incomes—a similar pattern in all communities.

Housing Needs
                                 B.         HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
                                 This section describes and analyzes various housing characteristics and trends
                                 to provide a basis for assessing the match between the demand and supply of
                                 available housing for the community. These include housing growth trends,
                                 housing characteristics, age and condition of housing, housing prices and
                                 rents, and homeownership rates.
                                 HOUSING GROWTH AND COMPOSITION
                                 As of 2010, single-family housing constitutes 88% of all housing in the city of
                                 Menifee (ACS, 2005–2009). Menifee’s proportion of single-family homes is
                                 significantly higher than that of neighboring cities. Mobile homes are also
                                 particularly more common in Menifee (8%). Multifamily housing (e.g.,
                                 apartments and townhomes) represents only 5% of housing units—
                                 significantly lower than in the region.

                                 Three larger apartment projects have been built in Menifee in recent years.
                                 These projects are the Cantabria Apartments (230 units), the Antelope Ridge
                                 Apartments (248 units), and the Enclave Apartments (336 units). In addition,
                                 the Kensington Apartments will add another 221 senior apartment units.
                                 However, neither Cantabria nor Antelope Ridge is reflected in the 2010
                                 Department of Finance (DOF) housing unit estimates (issued in May 2010).
                                 DOF 2011 estimates are now benchmarked against the 2010 Census. The
                                 Census no longer releases housing estimates by different types of units.
                                 The City of Menifee also has four very large mobile home parks—the Sun
                                 Meadows Park (392 units), Sun City Mobilehome Estates (332 units), BelAir
                                 Mobile Estates (200 units), and Hillside Mobile Home Estates (270 units).
                                 Menifee also has a 523-unit Wilderness Lakes Mobile Home Park, which is a
                                 recreational vehicle park. A significant number of individual mobile homes
                                 and manufactured homes are in Quail Valley, Romoland, and other rural
                                 residential areas. However, the California Department of Finance currently has
                                 inaccurate information on the number of mobile home units.
12    CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT

                                                                                                   Housing Needs
HOUSING TENURE
Tenure refers to whether a household owns or rents a home. Ample
homeownership and rental opportunities allow people of all incomes and
household sizes to choose the type of housing and location best suited to
their needs and preferences. Vacancy rates, in combination with housing
tenure, also affect the price and rents charged for housing.
Homeownership
The American dream is intertwined with homeownership, which is often
associated with independence, economic success, safety, and family.
Ownership commits the owner to a long-term economic relationship with the
home, typically resulting in increased investment into the property, which in
turn increases property values within a neighborhood. Home investment and
the physical presence of homeowners are thought to also improve the quality
and stability of residential neighborhoods. The City of Menifee has made it a
priority to encourage homeownership opportunities.
In the City of Menifee, 77% (21,104) of households own a home and 23%
(6,357) rent a home (Census, 2010). In surrounding cities, the homeownership
rate is lower—68% of the units are owner occupied and 32% are renter
occupied. Menifee’s rate of homeownership is significantly higher than the
average for the region. The City’s higher homeownership rate is primarily due
to two reasons: 1) the higher proportion of single-family units compared to
apartments; and 2) the relatively affordable price of homes compared to other
                                                                                      Figure 6: Homeownership Rate
cities that allows a higher proportion of residents to purchase a home. This
ratio will change over time as other areas of the community are developed.
Vacancy Rates
Housing vacancies are a measure of how well the supply of housing matches
the demand for specific types of housing. Typically, housing vacancy rates of
5% to 6% for apartments and 1% to 2% for homes are considered optimal.
This amount of housing vacancies assures that consumers have sufficient
choices for different types of housing products, that prices are generally
moderated, and that developers have a financial incentive to continue
building housing. Higher vacancy rates are considered to be excessive as
they lead to price depreciation. Lower vacancy rates are also not desirable;
they indicate a tight market and cause housing rents and prices to increase.
According to the 2010 Census, the City of Menifee’s housing vacancy rate is
estimated at 9.3%, which is slightly higher than the 8% in surrounding cities.
Menifee vacancy rate is 4.1% among owner-occupied units and 6.8% among
renter-occupied units. Compared to the market equilibrium rates, the City’s
higher vacancy rates are due to the economic downturn, the wave of
foreclosures still available in the Inland Empire, and continued instability in
the housing market. REALFACTS reports that apartment occupancy rates
appear to have stabilized in 2011. And although the ownership market will
take longer to fully recover, developers are still building new homes.
                                                                       CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT          13

Housing Needs
                                 HOUSING AGE AND CONDITION
                                 Well-maintained housing is important to residents who take pride in the
                                 quality of life offered in Menifee. Well-maintained housing stabilizes property
                                 values, attracts residents to a community, and contributes to neighborhood
                                 quality. The City’s housing stock has a large number of new homes built
                                 during the building boom of the 2000s. Relatively few of the single-family
                                 residences in the city, except in Quail Valley and Romoland, were built prior to
                                 1960. Nonetheless, housing age and condition remain a concern in Menifee.
                                 Housing Age
                                 The age of a housing structure is often an indicator of housing conditions.
                                 Homes generally begin to show age after 30 years and require some level of
                                 maintenance. This typically includes roof repair, painting, landscaping, and
                                 exterior finishes. Homes between 30 and 50 years typically require more
                                 significant maintenance and even renovation. Generally, homes built 50 or
                                 more years ago (unless well maintained) are more likely to require substantial
                                 repairs or need renovation to meet current building codes.
                                 Another concern related to the age of housing is lead-based paint hazards.
                                 Homes built prior to 1978 typically contain lead-based paint. Lead-based
                                 paint can cause a number of hazardous health conditions for children
                                 (specifically developmental delays). Health hazards occur when the paint
                                 chips and is inhaled by residents, particularly children. Since 1978, the federal
                                 government has banned the use of lead-based paint. Still, older homes may
                                 still need to paint over lead-based paint or remove peeling paint.
                                 Table 4 shows the year when housing was built in Menifee. Generally
                                 speaking, Menifee has a larger share of new housing than most communities
                                 in Riverside County due to the recent building activity. The City also has
                                 relatively few apartment buildings and, for those presently in Menifee, the
                                 majority was built in recent years. The older residential buildings are generally
                                 concentrated in rural residential areas, Quail Valley, or Romoland.

14    CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT

                                                                                                Housing Needs
Housing Conditions
Menifee’s housing stock is relatively new and in good to excellent condition.
The vast majority of housing (99%) has complete plumbing and kitchen
facilities, and only 2% of the homes lack any heating at all. The quality of
housing distinguishes Menifee from many older communities in the region.
However, given the expansive size and diversity of the community, different
neighborhoods of the city have some unique housing needs.
 Master Planned Communities. Single-family homes in Menifee, such as
  those in Heritage Lakes and Menifee Village, are relatively newer. The
  majority of homes were built during the last 20 years. Except for some of
  the single-family homes that are in foreclosure, homes are in excellent
  condition with minimal maintenance required. There are also no
  neighborhood preservation issues. In an effort to address foreclosures, the
  City passed Ordinance No. 2009-38, which requires that homes be
  appropriately maintained and not become a public nuisance.
 Sun City. Developed from 1960–1980, Sun City has a mix of single-family
  homes, apartments and mobile homes. As an age-restricted community,
  homeowner turnover is common and homes are inconsistently maintained.
  In addition, although well maintained, many of the apartment projects are
  older and may require repair or rehabilitation in the foreseeable future.
  Habitat for Humanity is working with the Sun City Civic Association to offer
  free repair services to address some of the unique needs of this community.
  This organization provides repairs to approximately 60 homes annually.
 Quail Valley and Romoland. Both neighborhoods are the oldest in
  Menifee and have housing and neighborhood challenges. Quail Valley lacks
  complete sewer and water infrastructure, has failing septic systems, and is
  under a building moratorium. In Romoland, the area lacks complete
  infrastructure and consistent upkeep. Of the 2,100 homes in these areas,
  about 180 single-family units and 20 mobile homes need rehabilitation, and
  10 single-family units and 25 mobile homes are substandard.
 Rural Areas. The City of Menifee also has several rural residential areas,
  located predominantly in the area south of Garbani Road. The area has
  developed into a mix of single-family homes on larger lots. Animal keeping
  and agricultural uses are permitted. Housing quality is mixed and ranges
  from 17-acre manicured estates to small unpermitted structures. The
  majority of the area is on septic systems and water is provided with wells.
  No particular housing conditions have been reported.
Taken together, the City of Menifee’s housing stock is relatively new and in
good to excellent condition. However, the Quail Valley and Romoland areas
have a significant number of housing units requiring major rehabilitation. Sun
City also has older housing, but the primary need is maintenance and repair.
The Housing Plan proposes working with nonprofit organizations to address

funds and cutbacks in federal funding, new funding sources will be needed.

                                 HOUSING PRICES
                                 Southwest Riverside County has experienced unprecedented changes in the
                                 prices of new and existing homes. From 2000 to 2006, the median price for a
                                 single-family home increased by nearly 200%, from $150,000 to an all-time
                                 high exceeding $400,000. However, as the recession has impacted the region,
                                 housing prices plummeted 50% in just a few years (Figure 7). Housing prices
                                 appear to have stabilized since 2010.

                                 Housing prices and trends in Menifee mirror those in Riverside County,
                                 although homes in Sun City and Quail Valley have traditionally sold at prices
                                 significantly lower than the County of Riverside as a whole. As of 2010, the
                                 median sales prices in Menifee are $123,000 for Sun City, $200,000 for
                                 Romoland (e.g., Heritage Lakes), $82,500 for Quail Valley, and approximately
                                 $222,000 for other areas in Menifee.

                                 The UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts that the housing market in the Inland
                                 Empire will continue to be slower than expected through 2014. Despite this
                                 subdued assessment, several residential developers remain active in the
                                 Menifee area and are currently taking orders for new homes. Compared to
                                 other communities in the region, the City of Menifee remains one of the more
                                 attractive places to build due to its relatively larger supply of affordable
                                 housing that matches the price points desired by buyers in the market.

Apartments
In contrast to single-family homes, which soared and then plummeted with
the economy, apartment rents increase at a more gradual rate with inflation.
Table 5 indicates the rents charged for Class A and B apartment projects (100
units and more) built and planned in Menifee in the past decade. Apartment
rents average $900 for one-bedroom units, $1,200 for two bedroom units, and
$1,500 for three bedroom units. Apartment rents have increased in the past
few years, reflecting a growing demand for rental units. However, rents for
senior projects (e.g., Kensington, Halter Hillside, and Villa La Paz) are priced
significantly lower, reflective of the intended occupancy.

Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
Mobile homes and manufactured housing provide an important source of
affordable housing for seniors and families in Menifee. According to
Zillow.com, mobile homes and manufactured housing prices range from as
low as $30,000 to $100,000 depending on the location, type of unit, and size
of parcel. Mobile homes and manufactured housing are located on multiacre
residential or agricultural lots in many areas. Mobile homes located in Quail
Valley and Romoland, like other products, are generally more affordable than
housing in newer developing areas of Menifee, such as Heritage Lakes.
Recently, the City of Menifee has been facilitating the production of a new
type of manufactured housing product referred to as precision built housing.
RSI Development, based in Mira Loma and Irvine, is building 103 new housing
units in a standard residential subdivision in central Menifee. These factory-
built housing units are shipped to and assembled at site. They are built on
larger lots than mobile homes (e.g., 7,500 square feet and larger), offer a
greater level of amenities, and sell within the price range of $140,000 to
$200,000 depending on amenities and lot size. These homes have become
very popular and in high demand by families looking for a starter home.

Housing Needs
                                 HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
                                 Housing affordability refers to how much a household can afford to pay each
                                 month for an apartment, townhome, or single-family home. Typically,
                                 housing affordability is defined as the ratio of housing expenses to income,
                                 referred to as a “cost burden.” It is assumed that households should not spend
                                 more than a certain proportion of income toward housing expenses;
                                 otherwise, they are deemed to be overpaying for housing.
                                 In calculating housing affordability, several factors are considered:
                                   Cost Burden. Cost burden refers to the percent of income paid for housing.
                                    Typically, the housing industry assumes that the “affordable” payment for a
                                    homeowner should range from 30% to 40%, with the latter figure being
                                    used in the California Association of Realtors’ first-time homebuyers’ index.
                                    For renters, the appropriate cost burden also varies from 30% to 40%, with
                                    the latter being used under the federal housing choice voucher program.
                                    The Health and Safety Code uses 35% as the appropriate cost burden. This
                                    housing element uses a midpoint cost burden of 35% for ownership (as
                                    many expenses are tax deductible) and 30% for renters as the threshold.
                                   Household Income. The federal government conducts income surveys to
                                    determine affordable housing costs for families of different sizes. The family
                                    income increases proportionally with number of family members. HUD uses
                                    the ”2+1 standard”; a home can accommodate two people per bedroom
                                    plus one occupant. We assume a more conservative occupancy rate where
                                    two residents are assumed per bedroom. Any unit having three or more
                                    bedrooms is assumed to accommodate a five-person household. Senior
                                    units are assumed to accommodate no more than two persons.
                                   Mortgage Expenses. A mortgage payment typically includes several
                                    components—loan principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI). Whereas
                                    in past years, variable rate loans were common, prospective buyers and
                                    lenders are more conservative and seek more predictable loan terms. When
                                    evaluating available loan options, buyers tend to seek conventional loans,
                                    with both a fixed 5% interest rate and a 30-year term. For purposes of
                                    calculating affordability, we assume a conventional 30-year, FHA-insured
                                    loan at 5% interest in the housing affordability calculation. This is a
                                    conservative measure, as many larger developers in Menifee offer lower
                                    interest rates or financial breaks to wrap closing costs into the loan.
                                   Homeowner Association Fees. Owners of condominiums or planned
                                    residential developments often pay homeowners association fees to cover
                                    the maintenance and repair of common grounds, pools, and recreational
                                    amenities. In some cases, these cover home repairs. Lenders have the
                                    option of including homeowners association fees in the mortgage
                                    qualification process or as an after-tax expense outside of the process. If
                                    included up front, every $100 in HOA fees typically reduces the maximum
                                    affordable home purchase price by $15,000. Of all the builders in Menifee,
                                    only two homeowners associations charged fees above $80 per month.

                                                                                                                      Housing Needs
   The housing model includes the maximum affordable price that could be
   afforded without a homeowners association fee. When calculating the
   affordability of a specific housing project, the housing price equivalent of
   the project-specific is deducted from the maximum affordable home price.
   By way of example, if the maximum supportable home sales price is
   $230,000 for a four-person household and the project has a $100 per
   month HOA fee, the price is reduced $15,000 to $218,000.
  Tax Benefits. Homeowners can deduct the amount paid for mortgage
   interest, taxes, and property mortgage insurance from income taxes. By
   adjusting personal exemptions on a W-2, these savings can be earned
   monthly and used to pay for HOA fees. The tax savings can be calculated
   by: 1) multiplying the federal and state tax rate by the sum of mortgage
   interest, taxes, and PMI; and 2) subtracting the standard deduction for a
   household. The net tax benefit for a low income household is an average of
   $1,000 per year. Although many households also received state and federal
   tax credits, this was excluded in the affordability analysis.
Table 6 shows the amount that a household of different sizes and income
levels can afford to pay for a single-family home and apartment unit.

Housing Needs
                                    Housing Affordability by Income Level
                                    In contrast to more built-out communities, the City of Menifee is noted for its
                                    relatively larger supply of affordable market rate housing. The following
                                    summarizes the general affordability of rental and ownership housing to
                                    different income groups based on the assumptions in Table 6. This analysis
                                    will be used later in this Housing Element to determine the affordability of
                                    new housing built in Menifee.
                                     Extremely Low Income. Extremely low income households can afford a
                                      home priced from $63,400 to $85,600, depending on the household’s size.
                                      The only new homes affordable to this income group are older mobile
                                      homes and condominiums, which sell from $30,000 to $100,000.
                                      Apartments are not affordable to extremely low income households, except
                                      for publicly subsidized projects such as the Vineyards and Halter Hillside.
                                      According to Redfin, more than 500 homes, mostly in Quail Valley and Sun

                                     Very Low Income. Very low income households can afford a home priced
                                      in Menifee from $100,000 to $140,000, depending on the household’s size.
                                      According to Redfin, more than 2,500 homes sold at prices up to $150,000.
                                      This includes single-family homes, condominiums, and mobile homes. Most
                                      are located in Quail Valley, Sun City, and Romoland. Though not new
                                      construction, many of the affordable single-family homes were 1,200 to
                                      1,750 square feet in size, on standard residential lots, and were built during
                                      the 1990s. In contrast, the only apartments affordable to very low income

                                     Low Income. Low income households can afford a single-family residence
                                      priced up to $230,000. This income group can afford all existing mobile
                                      homes, condominiums, and many new single-family homes. According to
                                      Redfin, more than 5,180 homes sold for prices affordable to lower income
                                      households in the past three years. Although many of these homes are
                                      resales, Menifee also has affordable new homes. Precision-built products
                                      offered by RSI/New House sell for prices from $140,000 to $200,000.
                                      Generally, existing family and senior apartments are affordable to the
                                      majority of lower and moderate income residents. The primary exception is
                                      apartments built to condominium specifications.
                                     Moderate Income. Moderate income households have the greatest
                                      housing opportunities available to them in Menifee. Moderate income
                                      households can afford a home of up to $360,000 or a rent of $1,900. A
                                      moderate income household can afford any apartment project in Menifee,
                                      even the newest luxury projects built to condominium specifications. With
                                      respect to single-family residences, the majority of existing or new
                                      residences sell for prices affordable to moderate income households. Even
                                      new single-family homes with more than 3,000 square feet on 12,000-
                                      square-foot lots sell for prices affordable to moderate income households.

HOUSEHOLD OVERPAYMENT AND OVERCROWDING
Housing overpayment and overcrowding are a concern for communities.
Housing overpayment refers to a situation where the household pays 30% or
more of gross income for housing costs. In California, this threshold is often
exceeded as it is common for lenders to approve mortgages that exceed a
35% cost burden for a particular household. Household overcrowding refers
to a situation where a household has more members than habitable rooms in
a house (more than one person per room).
Housing overpayment and overcrowding most often occur when a household
cannot afford suitably-sized and priced rental and ownership housing. In
other cases, life changes (retirement, children moving back home, loss of job,
etc.) can also cause overpayment and/or overcrowding. In these situations, a
household can choose to either pay more for housing than optimal and
overpay for housing or double up with others into too small a unit to afford
housing, which can result in overcrowding.
Table 7 displays the prevalence of overpayment and overcrowding in Menifee
according to the 2006–2010 American Community Survey. As shown below,
approximately 52% of households overpay for housing but only 4% of
households live in overcrowded housing conditions. The high proportion of
overpayment is because of the many limited income seniors who rent
housing in the community and the mortgage crisis in recent years. In contrast
to most communities, overcrowding is not a large issue in Menifee.

  Note: Data is not available by income level. The City was incorporated in 2008; therefore,
  Community Housing Affordability Strategy data for housing problems are not available for the City

Household overpayment and overcrowding in Menifee, like other
communities, typically occur most often among special need households.
This includes seniors, people with disabilities, large families, single parent
households, and farmworkers. Both housing problems are usually much
prevalent among renters rather than homeowners. Finally, housing problems
are also more common among those working in lower paying service
industries, younger adults entering the workforce, or older seniors.

                                      Pursuant to Section 65583(a)(9) of the Government Code, the housing
                                      element must include an inventory of multiple-family projects built with
                                      public subsidies and deed restricted for affordable housing. The housing
                                      element must also contain an analysis of assisted multiple-family projects that
                                      are at risk of converting to non-low income uses due to the expiration of use
                                      restrictions, prepayment of mortgage, or other reasons. The housing element
                                      must analyze such projects and the estimate cost of replacing these units.
                                      The City has three publicly assisted multiple-family projects that offer 226
                                      deed restricted units affordable to lower income households. The Vineyards
                                      project offers 81 units affordable to lower income seniors. The Encanto
                                      project will provide 178 units, of which 36 units will be affordable to lower
                                      income family households. The 118-unit Halter Hillside I and II project

C.        NEIGHBORHOODS
The City of Menifee was formed through the merger of Sun City, Quail Valley,
Romoland, and portions of the Paloma Valley. Each neighborhood has
developed a unique character due to its history, architecture, housing,
topography, and neighborhood design. This section describes each
neighborhood and the primary housing issues.
SUN CITY
Located in the northern part of Menifee, the Sun City area is a master-planned
community originally built for senior citizens. Originally developed by Del
Webb as a golf community for active seniors in the 1960s, the area has
become a recreation haven for seniors and others looking for peaceful
neighborhoods and quality housing in a quiet setting. This four-square-mile
community has two golf courses, two recreation centers and facilities, and a
commercial center of small shops for resident consumers.
In 2006, the County of Riverside Economic Development Agency (EDA)
established a redevelopment project area for the Sun City area. This sub-area
consists of 1,250 acres and lies both east and west of Interstate 215 from
Ethanac Road to just south of McCall Boulevard. The area is characterized by a
large commercial area in the core of Sun City, commercial areas along
Interstate 215, and both residential and industrial uses in the surrounding          New Sun City homes are offered for
areas. Redevelopment tax increment funds have been dedicated to build a              sale at affordable prices at $200,000.
senior center, library, and other public facilities and improvements in the area.
The Sun City area is noted for the affordability of its housing stock compared
to other parts of Menifee and the County of Riverside. As mentioned earlier,
the average priced single-family home is $125,000. Condominiums are not
common for this area of the community. Newer homes built are smaller in size
and priced at around the $200,000 level. Therefore, the Sun City area
continues to be an attractive place for seniors, particularly since a homeowner
association covers many of the common areas.
The Sun City area has a number of unique housing needs. As mentioned
earlier, the area has a large percentage of homes built during the 1960s and
1970s, and many of the homes were built more than 50 years ago. Frequent
turnover is common, due in part to the age of residents (predominantly 55
years of age and older). Although much of the area is in good condition,
certain areas have inconsistent upkeep of the units. Given the age of homes
and maintenance, housing rehabilitation needs are a significant issue.
Habitat for Humanity, Inland Valley, has been working with the Sun City Civic
Association for the past five years to improve housing in Sun City. In 2007,
Habitat launched “A Brush with Kindness” program that offers low cost home
repairs to low income families. Projects include house/trim painting, weed
abatement, fence repair, and garage door painting. Funds are provided
through its organization and donations. Habitat for Humanity works with Sun
City Civic Association to repair approximately 20 homes per year.

                                 QUAIL VALLEY
                                 Quail Valley is an isolated and hilly residential community located in
                                 northwest Menifee. Historically, Quail Valley was a getaway destination for
                                 Los Angeles residents seeking a rural weekend experience. During the 1930s,
                                 the historic core of Quail Valley was subdivided into small residential lots
                                 oriented around a hunting lodge. Most of the housing stock consisted of
                                 Craftsman cottages built as weekend housing. This housing was later
                                 replaced by mobile homes and prefabricated homes. Although newer homes
                                 have been built outside its historic core, Quail Valley remains a quaint
                                 community, reflective of its rural and rustic tradition.
                                 Due to its age and remote location, Quail Valley has unique infrastructure and
                                 housing needs. Many of the homes were built 30 to 50 years ago, and many
                                 are older mobile homes in need of rehabilitation. Although newer areas of
                                 Quail Valley are connected to sewer systems, the vast majority of the older
                                 neighborhoods are served by undersized septic systems. The area’s
                                 topography and remoteness make it too costly to install a public sewer
                                 system. Furthermore, as described below, no funding is available due to the
                                 governor’s take of redevelopment. Until this issue is resolved, Quail Valley has
                                 been placed under a development moratorium.
                                 In 2002, the County of Riverside formed a redevelopment project area, called
                                 the I-215 Corridor. The project area encompasses 2,039 acres on Goetz Road
                                 between McCall Boulevard and Newport Road. The county had been
                                 dedicating tax increment proceeds to improve the Quail Valley area, but the
                                 governor has diverted revenues for the state budget. The Santa Ana
                                 Watershed Project Authority has also been pursuing funds to replace the
                                 area’s aging sewer system, an effort which is also on hold until the governor
                                 manages the statewide budget. These two efforts offer the potential to
                                 address long-standing water quality issues in Quail Valley.

RURAL COMMUNITIES
Until the last decade, Menifee was a predominantly rural community. Despite
the development in recent years, two areas have remained relatively rural in
character—Romoland and areas south of Garbani Road. Each of these areas
have common housing and infrastructure concerns described below.
 Romoland. Established in the late 1800s, the original name of the town was
  Ethanac, the name of the train station that was originally located in present
  day Romoland. During the early 1900s, large numbers of traqueros or
  railroad workers from Mexico moved to the area and created a community
  with shops, schools, recreation and churches catering to an immigrant
  population. The Romoland Fruit Company played a large role, with the
  planting of vast citrus groves. Agriculture remains a prominent part of local
  life and crops are still shipped throughout the United States.
  The primary needs are twofold: infrastructure and housing. Romoland is
  designated a Special Flood Hazard Area Zone (SFHA) and is therefore
  subject to federal floodplain management regulations. Pursuant to the
  Romoland/Homeland Area Drainage Plan, the area is slated for Line A, a $30
  million project that would alleviate flood risks. For developers wishing to
  build in this area, the Riverside County Flood Control District requires the
  payment of $12,600 per acre toward the construction of these facilities.
  Portions of the drainage project have been funded. The area is also known
  for numerous code enforcement and substandard housing conditions.
  The General Plan and Housing Element propose land use changes to this
  area to accommodate the next Housing Element update.
 South of Garbani Road. The area located south of Garbani Road is the
  other rural community in Menifee. On the east side of the I-215, the area is
  referred to as Bell Mountain, named after the unique mountainous
  topography framing the area. This region is distinguished by its ranching
  environment, which allows agricultural uses and the keeping of animals,
  including horses. Residential lots are generally irregular in shape, reflect
  historical agricultural uses, and range from a half acre to over 15 acres.
  Residents expressed a desire to maintain the rural character of this region.
  The primary needs of the areas south of Garbani Road are twofold:
  infrastructure and housing. The area is served by private wells and septic
  tank systems. Roads may be unpaved, with limited appurtenances,
  including street lighting. Because of these infrastructure needs, it is
  advisable to periodically monitor the supply and quality of groundwater.
  Moreover, flooding is a concern due to the limited infrastructure in the area.
  Beyond these needs, there is a need to address housing conditions and
  land uses through the appropriate enforcement of city codes.
  The General Plan and Housing Element do not propose land use changes to
  this area from the original Riverside Comprehensive Integrated Plan.
                                                                       CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT     25

                                 groups, as defined in state law, who reside in the City of Menifee. Special
                                 needs households include seniors, large families, single-parent households,
                                 people who are homeless, and people with disabilities. Also, included are
                                 major programs available to address their unique needs.
                                 SENIOR CITIZENS
                                 The City of Menifee has an estimated 9,400 senior households, defined as a
                                 household with one member age 65 years or older (Census, 2010). Among
                                 this population, 1,643 senior households (17%) rent housing and 7,787 (83%)
                                 own homes. The City has 2,220 senior homeowners (31% of all senior
                                 homeowners) who overpay for housing and 792 renters (75% of all senior
                                 renters) who overpay (ACS, 2005–2009). Although not reported by the 2005–
                                 2009 ACS, low income seniors who rent have the highest prevalence and
                                 severity of overpayment.
                                 In 2006, the Riverside County Advisory Council on Aging held a Senior Forum
                                 in the Menifee/Sun City area. The purpose was to identify critical needs facing
                                 seniors and other residents living in the Menifee/Sun City area, pinpoint gaps
                                 in services and programs, and develop recommendations for addressing the
                                 needs and gaps. Among many findings, participants identified the need for
                                 affordable and accessible housing for older adults and adults with disabilities.
                                 Lack of adequate parks and recreational facilities, inadequate public
                                 transportation options, and lack of medical services and facilities were also
                                 cited as concerns.
                                 Another cited challenge was that many homes built today are not conducive
                                 to seniors aging in place. New homes often do not contain built-in
                                 modifications and universal design elements that would make the home
                                 barrier free and usable by residents of all ages and levels of ability. Many
                                 builders do not incorporate universal design features into new and existing
                                 homes because they claim that such improvements are too expensive. As a
                                 result, many adults will need to move from their homes when they experience
                                 age-related disabilities or mobility issues.
                                 Menifee is known for its Sun City development, a 4,800-unit senior-only
                                 master planned community built by Del Webb in the 1960s. This four-square-
                                 mile community has two public golf courses, two recreation centers and
                                 facilities, and a commercial center of small shops for resident consumers. The
                                 City continues to support the production of new senior housing. Two senior
                                 affordable projects have been recently approved–the 80-unit Vineyard
                                 Apartments and the 221-unit Kensington Apartments. The Kay Ceniceros
                                 Community Center in Sun City also offers social, recreational, and educational
                                 activities for seniors in the community.

                                                                                                 Housing Needs
FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS
Providing decent and affordable family housing is an important goal for
Menifee given the demographic makeup of the community. State law
identifies three types of families as having special needs—large families with
five or more members, female-headed, and single parent households. The
reasons for their special need status differ, but generally includes lower
incomes, the presence of children and need for financial assistance for
housing, and the lack of adequately sized rental and ownership housing.
Large Families
Large families with five or more persons have special housing needs due to
generally lower per capita income, the need for affordable childcare, or the
need for affordable larger units. Menifee has an estimated 4,503 large family
households (Census, 2010). Among this group, 3,181 of large families or 70%
of this group own a home and 1,322 large households or 30% rent housing.
The Census Bureau has not published data on the percentage of Menifee
large households that overpay for housing or live in overcrowded conditions.
As is common to households in many communities, lower income large
families, particularly renters, often experience the highest prevalence and
severity of overpayment and overcrowding. However, as noted earlier,
overcrowding is relatively minor in Menifee, as only 4% of all households (2%
of renters and 7% of homeowners) are living in overcrowded situations. In
contrast, more than 60% of renters and homeowners overpay for housing.
Presumably, a large share of overpaying households are large families.
Single-Parent Families
Single-parent households also have greater housing needs than other
households due to their limited income and higher expenses. The City of
Menifee currently has 1,914 single-parent families (Census, 2010). This total
comprises 609 male-headed households and 1,305 female-headed
households. The Census Bureau has not published data on the percent of
Menifee single-parent families that are low income or have housing
problems. However, as is common to a majority of communities, lower
income single parents, particularly renters, experience the highest prevalence
and severity of overpayment and overcrowding.
As discussed earlier under the housing characteristics section of this chapter,
the City of Menifee has very few family apartment complexes. Since 2007,
however, housing market changes have affected the need for affordable
housing for families with children. Because of the severity of the housing
market crash in southwestern Riverside County, even single-family homes sell
for prices that are now affordable to lower income households. Moreover, the
City’s 3,859 mobile homes are also affordable to very low income families. In
the past several years, several apartment complexes have been built, adding
incrementally to the rental housing opportunities available to families.
                                                                      CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT     27

Housing Needs
                                 HOMELESS PEOPLE
                                 Homeless persons and families are defined as those who lack a fixed and
                                 adequate residence. Homelessness is a pressing issue for many communities,
                                 and the varied dimensions involved have implications for housing programs.
                                 People who are homeless may be chronically homeless (perhaps due to
                                 substance abuse) or situationally homeless resulting from job loss, family
                                 strife, incarceration, or violence. Homeless people face critical housing needs
                                 due to their very low incomes and lack of appropriate housing. Thus, state law
                                 requires cities to plan to help meet the needs of their homeless population.
                                 According to the 2011 Riverside County biennial homeless survey, an
                                 estimated 5,090 unsheltered homeless people and 1,113 sheltered homeless
                                 people, for a total 6,203 homeless people, live in Riverside County. The survey
                                 documented about 64 homeless people living in the communities that
                                 comprise Menifee. This includes 6 in Quail Valley, 26 in Romoland, 29 in Sun
                                 City, and 3 elsewhere. This count is generally consistent with discussions with
                                 City staff and school officials at the Menifee Unified School District. It does not
                                 necessarily take into account those who are marginally housed.
                                 With respect to living quarters, the homeless typically have a primary
                                 nighttime residence that is not designed for human habitation or live in a
                                 supervised temporary living environment such as an emergency shelter,
                                 hotel, or transitional home for those with special needs (drug and alcohol
                                 rehabilitation, mental health treatment, childcare, etc.). The closest shelters
                                 for homeless persons are in Perris, Lake Elsinore, and Murrieta. These cities
                                 have also begun to develop a network of supportive services to serve
                                 homeless people living within their respective communities.
                                 Upon incorporation in 2008, the City of Menifee adopted the Subdivision and
                                 Zoning Codes that are currently implemented by the County of Riverside. The
                                 City’s Municipal Code does not directly address the permitting of facilities for
                                 homeless people and there are no provisions for emergency shelters,
                                 transitional housing, or permanent supportive housing. As part of the
                                 Housing Element, new zoning code amendments will be drafted to comply
                                 with new state laws in this matter. Moreover, as part of the Consolidated Plan
                                 process, the City will be joining the County’s Continuum of Care program and
                                 participate in regional efforts to reduce the incidence of homelessness.
                                 State law now requires that all jurisdictions allow at least one year-round
                                 emergency shelter in their community. Transitional housing and must be
                                 allowed by right in all residential zones and treated in the same manner as
                                 other residential uses in the same zone. Moreover, permanent housing must
                                 also be treated in the same manner as transitional housing. Finally, all
                                 jurisdictions must identify sufficient land that could accommodate housing
                                 commensurate with the identified needs of homeless people. The Housing
                                 Plan has policies and implementation programs to comply with state law and
                                 improve the housing opportunities for homeless people living in Menifee.

DISABLED PEOPLE
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities are impairments that
substantially limit life activities and make it difficult to care for oneself.
Because of that, persons have special housing needs for accessible housing.
Many disabled persons live on fixed incomes, thus limiting their ability to
afford housing. Persons with a disability may also have limited housing
choices (e.g., single-story homes or developments with elevators). Someone
with a visual impairment may require a home that allows service animals.
In 2010, the Census Bureau defined a disability as a long-lasting physical,
mental, or emotional condition that can make it difficult for a person to do
activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or
remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being able to
leave the home alone or to work at a job or business. In 2010, Menifee had
10,797 residents living with a disability—about 14% of residents (ACS 2008–
2010). Disabilities refer more specifically to:
 Sensory disability: Blindness, deafness, or severe vision or hearing
   impairment
 Physical disability: Substantially limited movement
 Mental disability: Impaired learning, memory, or concentrating
 Self-care disability: Restricted ability to care for oneself
 Go-outside-home: Restricted ability to leave home alone for shopping,
   medical care, or other activities
 Employment disability: Restricted ability to work and provide for oneself
Senate Bill 812 (codified as Government Code 65583(e)) requires that all local
governments include in the special needs analysis of the housing element an
assessment of the housing needs of people with developmental disabilities. A
developmental disability is a severe and chronic disability, to which is
attributable a mental or physical impairment that begins before adulthood.
These disabilities include, among others, mental retardation, cerebral palsy,
epilepsy, autism, and disabling conditions closely related to mental
retardation or requiring similar treatment.
The Census Bureau does not include a survey of people with developmental
disabilities, so estimates are derived from other sources. The California
Department of Developmental Services (DDS) estimates that 1.8% of people
have a developmental disability. This equates to 1,341 people in Menifee. A
smaller percentage of developmentally disabled people are served by the
Inland Regional Center (IRC). According to state records, the IRC serves 359
people with a developmental disability in Menifee, of which 54% are adults
and 45% are children. The vast majority (304 residents) live at home.
                                                                      CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT     29

Housing Needs
                                 Housing Accommodations
                                 Providing a sufficient quantity and quality of housing for people with
                                 disabilities is a significant challenge. Many people with a disability can live
                                 and work independently within a conventional residential environment. More
                                 severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where
                                 supervision and assistance with activities of daily living is provided. In some
                                 cases, the most severely disabled individuals may require an institutional
                                 environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided.
                                 The most obvious housing need for persons with disabilities is housing that is
                                 adapted to their needs. Most single-family homes are inaccessible to people
                                 with mobility and sensory limitations. Housing units may need to have wider
                                 doorways and hallways, access ramps, larger bathrooms with grab bars,
                                 lowered countertops, and other features common to “barrier-free” housing.
                                 Location is also important for disabled people because they often rely on
                                 public transit services to travel to services, like grocers or medical offices.
                                 Meeting this challenge requires a comprehensive housing strategy.
                                 For people with disabilities who need or desire more assistance with everyday
                                 activities of life, Menifee provides the following types of facilities and housing:
                                  Adult Residential–facilities that provide 24-hour nonmedical care for
                                   adults ages 18–59 who are unable to provide for their own daily needs.
                                   Adults may be physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, and/or
                                   mentally disabled. Menifee’s 10 facilities serve 47 residents.
                                  Residential Care for the Elderly–facilities that serve persons 60 years of
                                   age and over and persons under 60 with compatible needs. These facilities
                                   are also known as assisted living facilities, retirement homes, and board and
                                   care homes. Menifee’s 13 facilities serve 90 residents.
                                  Adult Day Care–facilities that serve persons 60 years of age and over and
                                   persons under 60 with compatible needs. These facilities are also known as
                                   assisted living facilities, retirement homes, and board and care homes.
                                   Menifee’s one adult care facility serves 40 residents.
                                 Several organizations serve the needs of people with disabilities in Menifee.
                                 The IRC serves more than 25,000 individuals with developmental disabilities
                                 in San Bernardino and Riverside counties. The IRC provides services for early
                                 start/prevention (0 to 3 years), school age children (3 to 15 years), transition
                                 (16 to 22 years), adult (23 to 59 years), and senior (60+ years). In addition, the
                                 County of Riverside, housing and service providers, and nonprofit
                                 organizations provide supportive services and transportation for people with
                                 disabilities in Menifee and the surrounding communities.

Constraint Analysis
3. Constraint Analysis
As required under state law, this chapter contains an analysis of potential and
actual market, governmental, and environmental constraints to the
production, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons of all
income levels, including persons with disabilities.
A.        MARKET CONSTRAINTS
Market constraints to the development of residential buildings have become
more prominent as the economy and residential construction industry have
slowed down. Cost of materials, land costs, lending policies, and local
government fees have all been credited as factors influencing the cost of
construction and the ability of households to purchase new housing. This
section analyzes the impact of these market factors.
DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Land and construction costs, in tandem with projected rents and sale prices
of housing, affect the feasibility of building housing. Land costs include the
costs of raw land and site improvements (e.g., grading, cut and fill,
environmental cleanup). Factors affecting the cost of land include: overall
availability, environmental site conditions, public service and infrastructure
availability, aesthetic considerations, and parcel size. According to
Redfin.com, raw land sells for approximately $1.50 to $2.00 per square foot
($65,000 to $87,000 per acre).
Housing construction costs constitute about half the cost of a single-family
home. The square footage cost of new housing averages approximately $110
per square foot for a single-family detached unit and an average of $60 per
square foot for a stacked flat single-family unit (with no garage). Apartments
can achieve some economy of scale, provided that the building does not
exceed three stories and does not require structured parking, and the
amenities are standard for most apartment projects. Mobile homes are
significantly less expensive, as are precision or factory-built housing products,
both of which have been widely used in the City of Menifee.
Labor costs are two to three times the cost of materials, representing
approximately 20% of the total cost of a new home. Labor costs are based on
a number of factors, including housing demand, the number of contractors in
the area, and union status of workers. State law requires the payment of
prevailing wages for most private projects built under an agreement with a
public agency providing assistance to the project, except for certain types of
affordable housing. Although this law may raise the cost of affordable
housing, it is not a constraint unique to Menifee.

Constraint Analysis
                                  ACCESS TO FINANCING
                                  The past several years have seen volatility in the home financing and
                                  construction market and the resulting change in lending requirements.
                                  Interest rates for loans have varied from 5% to 7%, down payments have
                                  ranged from 0 to 10%, and allowable income-debt ratios have varied.
                                  Common loan products issued in the early 2000s (adjustable rate mortgages)
                                  are credited with placing households in precarious situations, resulting in
                                  increased housing payments and foreclosures. Obtaining home loan
                                  financing has therefore become more uncertain.
                                  Changes in construction lending practices for housing projects have a
                                  significant impact on the financial feasibility of new construction. In past
                                  decades, housing developers could receive construction loans for 100% or
                                  more of a project's estimated future value. Following the housing market
                                  crash of the early 1990s, financial institutions tightened regulations for
                                  approving construction loans. After the boom period of the early to mid
                                  2000s, this cycle repeated itself during the late 2000s. Loan underwriting has
                                  grown more conservative, with maximum leveraging topping out at 75% and
                                  equity requirements increasing from 10% in past years to 30% in 2009.
                                  Although there is no hard threshold for how much required upfront equity is
                                  too much before a residential project would be infeasible, the higher the
                                  proportion of equity required, the more unlikely that a developer would
                                  proceed with the project. Not only would it require more up-front cash, but
                                  higher equity contribution means a project must be able to achieve an even
                                  higher value at completion in order to generate the cash flow needed to meet
                                  acceptable cash-on-cash returns. These trends are anticipated to continue
                                  through at least 2014.
                                  The housing market downturn that affects the southland has also impacted
                                  the financing for affordable housing. Historically, the Low Income Housing
                                  Tax Credit Program (LIHTC) has been used to raise capital for affordable
                                  housing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provided 40% of LIHTC investments,
                                  and banks motivated by the Community Reinvestment Act provided 40%.
                                  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac no longer make new investments, and financial
                                  institutions have also reduced LIHTC investment. It is unclear whether the
                                  LIHTC market will return to the levels seen in the pre-financial downturn days.
                                  Finally, Governor Brown appropriated the last major funding source of
                                  affordable housing—redevelopment tax increment and housing set aside
                                  funds—to temporarily ameliorate the state budget shortfall. This act and its
                                  long-term deleterious impact on the economy and long-term revitalization of
                                  California cities cannot be overstated. The Governor effectively wiped clean
                                  billions of dollars, locally approved over decades, that was raised and
                                  earmarked to eliminate blight, stimulate economic development, finance the
                                  construction and improvement of affordable housing, and otherwise improve
                                  the lives of residents living in underserved areas.

FEES AND ASSESSMENTS
The City of Menifee, like other communities in the region, charges a range of
fees and assessments to cover the cost of processing development permits
and ensuring that adequate public facilities, infrastructure, and services are
available to support new residential developments. The lack of adequate fees
has been shown to result in reduced quality of life if adequate infrastructure is
not in place to serve new development. As a new city, Menifee has adopted
the fee structure of Riverside with a few adjustments for local services.
Residential developers in Menifee typically pay three types of fees to different
entities. City development fees are paid to City Hall for processing permits
and applications, and otherwise requesting public hearings for projects.
Regional development impact fees are paid to various local and regional
governmental agencies for the construction of transportation improvements,
new school infrastructure, and the extension of water and sanitation services.
Fees are also due to pay for the preservation of habitat for sensitive species.
Table 9 shows the typical fees charged to residential developers. On average,
fees total $40,500 per single-family and $33,500 per multiple-family unit. This
compares to development costs (including land and building) that average
$240,000 for a single-family home and $120,000 for an apartment unit.

Constraint Analysis
                                  Assessment of Fees
                                  State law allows all communities to charge planning and development fees to
                                  recover the reasonable cost of planning, environmental, and development
                                  services. In addition, state law also allows the charging of impact fees to pay
                                  for the cost of roadways, parks, sewer, water lines, schools, and other
                                  infrastructure to ensure sufficient services are in place to support the housing.
                                  The question is whether local and regional fees are unduly high so that they
                                  limit the construction of housing and the available means to address fees.
                                  Based on the City fee schedules, the total fees charged for new residential
                                  projects range from $40,000 for a single-family home (17% of development
                                  cost) to $33,000 for an apartment unit (or 28% of development costs).
                                  Regional entities outside the control of the City make up about 75% of the fee
                                  burden by charging fees for water, sewer, transportation, and schools. The
                                  City has very limited ability to effectively reduce the fees of these agencies.
                                  Moreover, City fees are needed for staff support to review projects and ensure
                                  that adequate infrastructure is in place to serve residential projects.
                                  However, developers are granted reductions in fees for qualifying projects or
                                  have other means available to them to lessen the impact of fees.
                                    Fee Reductions. The Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fee and School
                                     Mitigation Fee (TUMF) make up 30% of all fees paid by residential
                                     developers. These fees have been reduced in recent years or contain
                                     provisions that exempt certain qualified residential projects. For instance,
                                     affordable housing receives a 100% waiver from TUMF fees. Moreover, the
                                     Menifee Union Elementary School District has significantly reduced fees
                                     and offers an 85% reduction to qualified senior projects.
                                    Fee Deferrals. More than 75% of all development fees (e.g., TUMF, DIF,
                                     Quimby, MSHCP, and Eastern MWD) are now all due at occupancy of the
                                     residential unit. Remaining City fees and the school district fees are due as a
                                     condition of issuance of the building permit. For smaller developers, this is
                                     a major financial incentive to develop housing, since the fees need not be
                                     covered by a construction loan. For larger builders, however, the fee
                                     deferral is not a critical financing incentive but relatively inconsequential
                                     because homes are built and sold within a shorter time frame.
                                  Taken together, developer fees can be reduced significantly if the project is
                                  affordable, age restricted, or both. For single-family homes, fees can be
                                  reduced by 13% for senior housing and 22% for affordable housing projects.
                                  For multiple-family projects, fees can be reduced by 8% for market rate senior
                                  apartments and 19% for qualified affordable family apartments. Moreover,
                                  most impact fees are due at occupancy rather than up front.
                                  In summary, unlike the greater Riverside County region, Menifee has many
                                  new residential housing projects underway; therefore, the current fees are not
                                  considered to be an actual constraint to development at this time.

B.          LAND USE CONTROLS
This section introduces the City’s Municipal Code regulations that affect the
location, density, and types of permitted residential land uses in Menifee and
the general impact on the types and prices of housing. This section also sets
the foundation for the land inventory.
GENERAL PLAN LAND USE
When Menifee incorporated, the City adopted the general plan land use
designations and zoning classifications of Riverside County. As of 2012, the
City has approved new land use designations for its general plan, but will
maintain the county’s zoning classifications until a zoning code update is
undertaken in the next two years. Table 10 presents the land use designations
for the new General Plan and corresponding zoning districts.

 Notation:
 Rural residential land use designations are described in greater detail in the General Plan Land
 Use Element. Although the nomenclature for some of the residential uses has been slightly
 modified (Rural Mountain and Rural Residential categories, for example) the density ranges and
 allowable uses in these categories are the same as those originally approved as part of the
 Riverside County General Plan and have been carried over into the Land Use Element. The City
 has also added a new mixed use category “Economic Development Corridor,” which will allow a
 limited amount of residential uses up to 24 dwelling units per acre.

                                  RESIDENTIAL USES BY ZONE
                                  Housing element law requires cities to facilitate and encourage a range of
                                  housing types for all economic segments of the community. This also includes
                                  the production of housing to meet various special needs of seniors, people
                                  with disabilities, farmworkers, the homeless, and others. Upon incorporation,
                                  the City adopted the Riverside County Ordinance 348 governing the
                                  allowable uses within each zoning district.
                                  Table 11 shows the type of housing permitted in the City of Menifee and the
                                  type of discretionary permit required, if any. The following pages analyze
                                  Ordinance 348 and its compliance with state law.

                                                                                              Constraint Analysis
Conventional Single- and Multiple- Family Housing
The Menifee Municipal Code permits single-family homes and two-family
units in most residential zones in the community as a by-right use. The Code
also permits standard multiple-family and apartment houses in the same
zones as a by-right use. Planned residential uses are also allowed as a by-right
use in the community. In compliance with Government Code 65852.3, the
installation of manufactured homes is allowed as a by-right use, subject to
design standards, on lots zoned for single-family dwellings. If the units are
located in the R-6 zone, there are affordability restrictions.
With respect to multiple-family housing, the City allows two-family units
(apartments and townhomes) in five residential zones—the R-2, R-2A, R-3, R-
4, and R-6 zones. Multiple-family uses are allowed in these zones as a by-right
use subject to a Plot Plan approved by the Planning Commission. No special
use or conditional permit is required to obtain approval to build multiple
family units in the community. If multiple-family units are located in the R-6
zone, however, the units are required to have affordability restrictions so the
housing is affordable at specific levels.
Mobile Homes and Mobile Home Parks
Mobile homes can provide a considerable source of affordable housing for
families and seniors. The City of Menifee has more than 3,000 mobile home
units. Mobile homes are currently permitted in three residential zones as a by-
right use. In recent years, however, the City has received an application for
precision-built factory housing. In compliance with Government Code
65852.3, the installation of manufactured homes is allowed as a by-right use,
subject to design standards, on lots zoned for single-family dwellings.
Mobile home parks are permitted conditionally in eight residential zones
within Menifee. An additional one-family unit or mobile home, excluding the
principal dwelling, is allowed for each ten acres being farmed. The additional
unit shall be located on a parcel being farmed and occupied by the owner,
operator, or employee of the farming operation as a one-family residence,
shall be at least 450 square feet, and shall be leased only to an employee of
the farming operation. The number of dwellings for employees shall not
exceed four units per established farming operation.
Second Units and Guest Units
The City of Menifee also permits second units in seven residential zones
pursuant to an approved plot plan and second-unit application. Several
development standards apply to second units. The lot must be zoned for a
one-family dwelling as a permitted use; however, the lot must be 14,400
square feet or larger and may not be part of a planned residential
development (PRD) or the R-6 zone. Off-street parking in the amount of one
space per bedroom (may include carport) is also required. However, because
of the generally affordable price of housing, second units are not common.
The second unit application is approved in a ministerial fashion (“over-the-
counter”) by the Planning Department staff with public hearings.
                                                                       CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT      37

Constraint Analysis
                                  In 2009, the City Council adopted an ordinance allowing for guest dwellings.
                                  These dwellings are defined as a building which contains no cooking facilities
                                  and is used primarily for members of a single family and nonpaying guests.
                                  Guest houses are permitted as a by-right use in all residential zones pursuant
                                  to a plot plan. With respect to unit size, the guest house must not be larger
                                  than the main unit or larger than 2% of total usable lot size. Required setbacks
                                  and allowable height depend on the size of the parcel. One parking space is
                                  required per unit. Several guest houses have been built in recent years,
                                  incrementally adding to the City’s stock of affordable housing.
                                  Community Care Facilities
                                  The California Welfare and Institutions Code, Community Care Facilities Act,
                                  and Health and Safety Code declare that people with disabilities are entitled
                                  to live in normal residential settings. State law specifies that a wide variety of
                                  community care facilities are allowed in all residential neighborhoods.
                                  Moreover, state law requires that state-licensed community care facilities
                                  serving six or fewer persons be (1) treated the same as a residential use, (2)
                                  allowed by right in all residential zones, and (3) subjected to the same fees,
                                  taxes, and permits as other residential uses in the same zone.
                                  When the City of Menifee incorporated, the City Council adopted the County
                                  of Riverside’s Development Code and Ordinance 348 on an interim basis until
                                  a new development code could be developed for Menifee. The County of
                                  Riverside’s Municipal Code does not clearly distinguish, define, or permit
                                  residential care facilities. Rather, it uses the term congregate care to refer to
                                  residential care facilities, although the two terms refer to different types of
                                  facilities. The City’s Municipal Code will need to be updated to define
                                  residential care facilities, distinguish them by size (serving six or fewer or
                                  seven or more clients), and permit them in accordance with fair housing law.
                                  Farmworker Housing
                                  The City of Menifee has some agricultural land in the southern part of the city.
                                  The California Employee Housing Act regulates farmworker housing and
                                  generally requires that facilities with no more than 36 beds or 12 units be
                                  treated as an agricultural land use that is not required to obtain any
                                  conditional use permit or other approval that is not required of other
                                  agricultural uses in the same zone. Farmworker housing (employee housing)
                                  serving six or fewer residents should essentially be treated like any other
                                  residential use (single-family or multiple-family) in the same zone. Such
                                  facilities must be allowed by right.
                                  The R-R (Rural Residential) and R-A (Rural-Agricultural) zones allow for the
                                  grazing, keeping of animals, nurseries, greenhouses, and crops. According to
                                  the Census, 182 residents work in the agricultural, forestry, mining, and
                                  related industries in Menifee. The Municipal Code allows farmworker housing
                                  pursuant to a plot plan in the R-R zone and as a by-right use in the R-A zone.
                                  In these zones, the Municipal Code also allows one additional single-family
                                  unit or mobile home for each ten gross acres being farmed. These provisions
                                  address the need for farmworker housing in the Menifee Valley.

                                                                                                Constraint Analysis
Homeless Facilities
Senate Bill 2 requires cities to facilitate and encourage the production of
housing suitable for homeless people, including emergency shelters,
transitional and permanent supportive housing. This is accomplished by
identifying a zone where at least one year-round emergency shelter could be
approved as a by-right use without a conditional use or other discretionary
permit. State law also requires the zone(s) to have sufficient capacity to
accommodate the City’s need (estimated at 64 people) and be suitable.
Six parcels (39 acres) zoned I-P, located north of Rouse Road and east of I-215,
have been identified as suitable for emergency shelters. The I-P zone allows
lighter industrial and manufacturer uses. The sites are vacant, not adjacent to
other nonresidential uses, and do not contain environmental hazards that
make it unsuitable for emergency shelters. In terms of parcel size, one site is
8.2 acres, while the other 5 sites range from 4.1 to 5.2 acres in size. The City
will amend the Zoning Code to allow emergency shelters as a by-right use in
the I-P zone and will adopt written management, operational, and
development standards allowed by state law to facilitate the siting process.
An additional screening was undertaken to determine site suitability. The
sites are located 2 miles north from the Menifee Valley Medical Center. One
mile north, the Riverside Transit Agency runs route 27 in an east-westerly
direction along Ethanac Road, from I-215 to the of Winchester. The Marion
Ashley Community Center, located 1 mile northeast, has food distribution
services. The Bargain Basket, at Sherman and SR-74, provides discount food
services for the Romoland area, including these sites. The Romoland School
District, located 1 mile northeast also offers a head start program for children.
The Government Code also requires that transitional housing and permanent
supportive housing be allowed in all zones allowing residential uses and that
it be treated in the same way as other residential uses in the same zone. To
bring the City’s codes into compliance with state law, the Housing Element
contains a program to amend the Municipal Code and all zoning districts
allowing residential use to permit transitional housing and permanent
supportive housing as a residential use, subject only to those regulations that
apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone.
Single Room Occupancy
Single room occupancy (SRO) units can provide a valuable form of affordable
private housing for lower- income individuals, seniors, and persons with
disabilities. An SRO unit usually is small, between 200 to 350 square feet.
When Menifee incorporated and assumed the Riverside County Development
Code, single room occupancy was not specified as a permitted use in the
code. As required under state, the City of Menifee will amend its zoning code
to define the use and allow for any application to be treated and permitted in
the same manner as a multiple-family dwelling. The Housing Plan contains a
program to permit this use consistent with that required in state law.
                                                                         CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT      39

Constraint Analysis
                                  C.          DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
                                  The City of Menifee has adopted various development regulations. Prior to
                                  incorporation, Riverside County regulated the pattern of development. Thus,
                                  many of the City’s residential development standards, building codes, and
                                  subdivision requirements are the same as Riverside County. This section
                                  describes and analyzes the major development regulations.
                                  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
                                  The Municipal Code provides more specific residential development
                                  standards that determine building height, density, setbacks, parking, etc.
                                  Residential development standards are designed to promote a more livable
                                  environment, with adequate yards for children, height restrictions and
                                  setbacks to ensure privacy from adjacent homes, and minimum unit sizes to
                                  ensure adequate living areas for families.
                                  Table 12 lists residential development standards for housing in Menifee. The
                                  Zoning Code allows for semi-rural and suburban development at a density of
                                  up to 20 units per acre, except for higher densities within certain specific
                                  plans. As described in the Housing Plan, the City is adopting new general plan
                                  and zoning designations that allow for a minimum of 20 units per acre in
                                  certain residential and mixed use zones.

PARKING STANDARDS
Parking is an important development regulation in communities. Adequate
parking for residential projects contributes to the value of a project, the safety
of residents, its appearance, and livability. However, excessive parking
standards that do not reflect actual parking demand can unduly increase
development costs and reduce the potential land availability for project
amenities or additional units.
The City of Menifee assigns parking standards with the intent to promote
efficient land use as well as reduce street congestion and traffic hazards and
promote vehicular and pedestrian safety. To ensure these livability goals are
achieved, the City requires a parking plot plan for dwelling units containing
more than two families. Table 13 provides a summary of parking
requirements for residential developments and projects.

Constraint Analysis
                                  BUILDING CODES AND ENFORCEMENT
                                  Building and property maintenance codes in Menifee are required to ensure
                                  that structures, including housing, are built in a safe manner, that individual
                                  properties and neighborhoods are well maintained, that owners see a
                                  financial benefit in improving properties, and that Menifee attracts and
                                  retains development that benefits its economy. As a new city, the City Council
                                  has recently enacted new building and property maintenance codes.
                                  With respect to building and structures, the Menifee City Council adopted all
                                  the building codes contained in the Building, Mechanical, Plumbing,
                                  Electrical, and Uniform Housing Code. The Health and Safety Code Section
                                  18938 establishes standards for all types of buildings and occupancies and
                                  requires these standards be adopted by all jurisdictions. The City must adopt
                                  the 2010 edition of the California Building Code. In compliance with this law,
                                  the City has adopted the required codes and adopts periodic updates.
                                  The California Building Code allows jurisdictions to adopt modifications or
                                  additions to their local building codes that address specific climatic,
                                  topographic, or geological conditions within a community. Because of strong
                                  Santa Ana winds, hot and seasonally dry climate, traffic congestion, open
                                  space with chaparral, and unique valley topography, the City has made
                                  several code modifications. These include requirements for the separation
                                  walls between garages and residences and for installing enhanced onsite fire
                                  protection features. These features add a most cost to new construction.
                                  The City enacted Ordinance No. 2009-38, which requires that all foreclosed
                                  properties in the City be maintained free of debris and graffiti that contribute
                                  to the appearance that the property is abandoned. Pools and spas shall be
                                  secured with approved fences and devices as required by California Building
                                  Code and shall be drained and kept dry or kept in working order so that the
                                  water remains clear and free of pollutants and debris. All properties within the
                                  City shall be maintained so as not to constitute a public nuisance.
                                  The City of Menifee’s Code Enforcement Division is responsible for enforcing
                                  municipal codes and responds to code violations on a complaint basis. The
                                  City works with residents to abate substandard property conditions. In certain
                                  cases, stronger enforcement is required. In 2010, the City of Menifee was
                                  required to shut down a mobile home park and revoke its conditional use
                                  permit due to hundreds of property code violations, including septic
                                  problems, rubbish, electrical wiring, and other problems.
                                  Building codes add an incremental cost to the construction of housing, but
                                  the cost is not an actual constraint to the production of housing. First, the
                                  City’s building and property maintenance codes are similar and/or identical to
                                  those adopted in surrounding communities. Moreover, Menifee also has the
                                  highest housing production in the immediate area. These two facts
                                  demonstrate that the City’s building codes appear to have no material effect
                                  on the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing.

SUBDIVISION REQUIREMENTS
The City of Menifee has adopted Ordinance No. 460.151 of the County of
Riverside which regulates the division of land, the design and improvement of
subdivisions, and the installation of improvements needed for new
development. As the City has not enacted its own Subdivision Code, it relies
on standards authorized in the County Code unless other standards have
been approved in Specific Plans. Developers are typically required to
construct or install the following:
 Grading and filling to approved grade, and construction of all necessary
  grade crossings, culverts, bridges and other related works;
 Drains, facilities, channel improvements, and other works required to
  provide adequate drainage and protection from storm or floodwaters;
 Concrete curbs/gutters on both sides of every street and the proximate side
  of each existing or dedicated street bordering the subdivision;
 Sewer mains, including dry sewers when required by the Public Works
  Department, and all laterals required to serve each lot;
 Utilities, utility lines, and appurtenances, including water mains, fire
  hydrants, gas mains, telephone and electric lines, and all laterals and
  appurtenant equipment required to serve each lot;
 Utility lines, including but not limited to electrical, telephone, cable
  television, and street light, providing service to all new properties;
 Asphalt concrete pavement, base material, and seal coat in all existing or
  dedicated streets and alleys or portions thereof;
 Concrete sidewalks adjacent to the curb line, concrete driveway
  approaches, and concrete pavement for pedestrian ways;
 Planting of trees of the variety, size, and condition in accordance with the
  approved plans and specifications;
 Street lights of approved design and illumination intensity, street signs,
  warning signs, and regulatory signs where required.
These types of improvements are common for all unincorporated areas and
for many recently incorporated communities in Riverside County. Therefore,
these subdivision and street standards would not make it less financially
feasible to build housing in one jurisdiction versus another. However, the
specifications of these standards may vary as allowed through the Specific
Plan approval process, either in the County or City.

Constraint Analysis
                                  ENERGY CONSERVATION
                                  Rising energy costs, dependence on fossil fuels, and increasing evidence of
                                  the adverse impacts of global warming have provoked the need in California
                                  and nationwide to improve energy management strategies. Buildings use
                                  76% percent of all electricity generated in the US for their operation and
                                  generate 40% of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas (GHG). How we
                                  design, build, and operate buildings thus has profound implications for
                                  energy use and resulting global warming.
                                  Although state law has long supported energy conservation, recently passed
                                  state laws target GHG emissions and energy independence. In 2006, the State
                                  Legislature adopted the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which created
                                  the first comprehensive, state regulatory program to reduce GHG emissions
                                  to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. SB 1368 bars California energy providers
                                  from entering into long-term contracts with high-polluting power generators
                                  in order to encourage development of the state’s renewable energy portfolio.
                                  Promoting energy conservation has become a consistent theme in
                                  regulations, green building practices, and general business operations. For
                                  Menifee, opportunities abound to promote energy-efficient practices in the
                                  siting, design, construction, and renovation of housing stock. These practices
                                  not only respond to regulatory requirements, but also can generate
                                  significant community, environmental, and economic benefits.
                                  Neighborhood Design
                                  The Subdivision Map Act references the need for passive or natural heating or
                                  cooling opportunities, but no prescriptive guidance is provided. Strategies to
                                  reduce energy demand begin with efficient site planning. Sizing and
                                  configuring lots to maximize a building’s solar orientation (east–west
                                  alignment for southern exposure) facilitates optimal use of passive heating
                                  and cooling techniques. Placing housing near jobs, services, and other
                                  amenities reduces energy consumption for transportation. Other design
                                  strategies with beneficial energy implications include installing broad-
                                  canopied trees for shade and clustering development to reduce auto use.
                                  In many jurisdictions, energy-efficient site planning is usually the result of
                                  developers who recognize the economic benefits or ethics of such design.
                                  Many of the present developments in Menifee were approved years before its
                                  incorporation, so these residential development patterns are set. Yet, there
                                  are still opportunities for improving energy efficiency through neighborhood
                                  design. The Community Design Element of the General Plan provides more
                                  guidance on incorporating energy efficiency priorities into the planning
                                  process. As an implementation program for the General Plan, the City of
                                  Menifee’s Climate Action Plan will also address these concerns.

Building Design
Title 24, Part 6, California Energy Efficiency Standards, requires all residential
construction to meet minimum energy conservation standards through either
a prescriptive or performance-based approach. The former approach requires
each individual component of a building to meet an identified minimum
energy requirement. The performance approach, on the other hand, allows
developers to choose a range of measures which, in totality, meet specified
energy conservation targets. With either of these options, mandatory
components must still be installed, such as minimum insulation, HVAC, and
efficient water heating equipment.
In addition to Title 24, all residential projects are required to meet state
building codes, which also include energy conservation standards. The
California Building Standards Commission adopted the California Building
Codes in 2007 based on model codes produced by various professional
organizations. The City of Menifee has adopted these standards, which apply
to all new residential buildings constructed after January 1, 2008. The City of
Menifee enforces Title 24 as the primary means to ensure that new housing
incorporates the latest energy efficient technologies. The City’s Climate
Action Plan may offer additional building techniques to conserve energy.
Green Standards Design
The building industry has developed different green building programs
designed to improve the energy efficient and sustainability of housing. The
BIA sponsors a voluntary program called Green Builder. The program focuses
on energy efficiency, water conservation, wood conservation, advanced
ventilation, and waste diversion. Certified homes incorporate water-efficient
landscaping and fixtures, use high-efficiency insulation and ventilation
systems, contain environmentally sound building materials, initiate waste
reduction methods during construction, and exceed Title 24 Building Code
energy standards by 15 percent.
Other green building programs have also been sponsored by government
and nongovernmental agencies. The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC)
sponsors another building certification program called Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design (LEED). The USGBC is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that
seeks to improve human health, support economies and protect the
environment through green buildings. The LEED program is a national rating
system for green buildings that focuses on commercial and multiple-family
residential projects. The USGBC reviews projects for conformance based on
various efficiency, sustainability, materials quality, and design factors, and
then issues certifications based on points achieved.

                                  Development review is the primary way that to ensure that the construction
                                  of projects contributes in a positive manner to the community and quality of
                                  life. Residential development projects typically undergo several types of
                                  approvals—ministerial, discretionary actions (either with or without a public
                                  hearing), and legislative actions. This section outlines the timeline for the
                                  development review process for housing and describes the conditional use
                                  permit and design review process.
                                  The Planning Department transmits the application to City departments,
                                  county agencies, utilities, and the local school districts. Each agency has three
                                  weeks to provide comments to the Planning Department. Within 30 days of
                                  application submittal, the Planning Department indicates whether their
                                  application is complete or incomplete. All department comments are also
                                  provided at that time. All project aspects are reviewed, including the plot
                                  plan, design review, and other applicable requirements. This review continues
                                  until all comments have been satisfactorily addressed. There are several key
                                  aspects of this process, described below.
                                  PLOT PLAN
                                  Typically, single-family residential units are created either with parcel or tract
                                  maps. With parcel maps, there is no plot plan required for the placement,
                                  architecture, or floor plans of any dwelling on the property—the property
                                  owner would only need a building permit. With tract maps, the City requires a
                                  plot plan for the final site of development plan that lays out all of the houses
                                  within the tract, fencing, walls, driveways, setbacks, architecture, etc. Once
                                  the plot plan for the entire site is approved, the developers only need to
                                  obtain a building permit for a house.
                                  An apartment or condominium project will require a plot plan and site
                                  development plan prior to development. These include the following: 1)
                                  property boundary and dimensions; 2) topography; 3) location of adjacent
                                  streets, drainage structures, utilities, buildings, signs, and other features that
                                  may affect the property use; and 4) various specifics of the proposed project.
                                  The site plan requires spot elevations, constrained area analysis, site
                                  grading/subsurface disposal requirements, drainage plans, water quality
                                  plans, and floor plans and elevations.
                                  Plot plan (and site development plan) review depends on the nature of the
                                  project. Minor plot plans that are exempt from CEQA requirements (e.g., for
                                  projects such as guest quarters) may be approved by the Community
                                  Development Director without a public hearing. Major plot plans and site
                                  development plans (that are not CEQA exempt) must be submitted to,
                                  reviewed, and approved by the Planning Commission.

DESIGN REVIEW
When Menifee incorporated, the City adopted the residential design
guidelines currently in use by the County of Riverside. The County of
Riverside’s guidelines are applied throughout the county, except for specific
plans that were approved for some projects in Menifee. The design guidelines
set general parameters for quality design while allowing variation to reflect
the diverse cultural, heritage, rural, and suburban lifestyles. Design guidelines
apply to all structures except for single-family homes.
Guidelines address such topics as site planning, scale and mass, building
appearance, landscaping and open space, fencing and walls, parking, and
other related design topics. For ease of understanding, the Guidelines provide
sketches and illustrative photographs of preferred methods of building
design. The Design Guidelines are simple and complete; a developer would
not need to reference other design guidelines, unless the project was part of a
Specific Plan with adopted design guidelines.
Menifee planning staff conducts design review as part of the overall review of
the applications for residential projects. Applications for proposed residential
projects are not submitted for review to a separate Design Review
Committee, City Council, or other hearing body. Rather, City staff carefully
review each application and make recommendations and findings as to the
consistency of a project with either the County Design Guidelines or those in
the relevant Specific Plan.
The Planning Department provides the applicant with comments and
corrections on proposed projects. The applicant is responsible for providing
additional information, corrections, and/or clarifications. This process can take
a month or longer. Upon resubmittal of exhibits or reports, the application is
rerouted through various departments, who review the application for their
comments. This process of transmitting exhibits to the other departments
continues until the departments have issued approval and/or conditions of
approval for the project.
Once all City and county department comments have been addressed and
conditions of approval prepared, the Planning Department prepares the staff
report and environmental documents. All staff report documents and
environmental assessments are reviewed by the Community Development
Director and the City Attorney. This process takes two to three weeks. When
complete, the project is scheduled for a public hearing, which requires a 10-
day (if CEQA exempt) or a 20-day public notice.
Taken together, the time required to obtain entitlements is six months to a
year for an apartment project, six months to a year for a tract of single-family
homes, and six months if the project is exempt from CEQA.

Constraint Analysis
                                  HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
                                  Pursuant to Section 65008 of the Government Code, this section analyzes
                                  potential and actual constraints to the development, improvement, and
                                  maintenance of housing serving people with disabilities in Menifee. Where
                                  actual constraints are found, this section describes specific programs that will
                                  be implemented as part of the 2008–2014 Housing Element to remove
                                  government constraints to housing people with disabilities.
                                  Zoning Code Definitions
                                  General Plan and Municipal Code definitions can create fair housing concerns
                                  if the definition could be used to limit housing opportunities or fair housing
                                  choice by individuals or families. Fair housing law prohibits a city from
                                  defining a family (and by extension living quarters) in terms of the
                                  relationship of members (e.g., marital status), number of occupants (e.g.,
                                  family size), or other characteristics beyond a housekeeping unit.
                                  As part of this housing element, the City’s Zoning Codes were reviewed to
                                  determine if any definitions presented fair housing concerns. Because
                                  Menifee is a new city, many of the codes were inherited from the county and
                                  have not yet been reviewed or revised. The following were noted:
                                    The Menifee Zoning Code defines a family as an individual or two or more
                                     persons related by blood or marriage, or a group of not more than five
                                     persons, excluding servants, who are not related by blood or marriage,
                                     living together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling. This definition is
                                     in conflict with recent court decisions on who can occupy a unit.
                                    The Menifee Zoning Code defines an apartment as a room or suite of two or
                                     more rooms in a multiple dwelling, occupied or suitable for occupancy as a
                                     residence for one family. Similarly, a dwelling unit is defined as a building or
                                     portion thereof used by one family. This definition is not consistent with
                                     current fair housing law because it could restrict housing opportunities.
                                    The Menifee Zoning Code defines a dwelling for one family as a building or
                                     structure, including a mobile home or manufactured home, containing one
                                     kitchen and used to house not more than one family, including domestic
                                     employees. This definition is not consistent with current fair housing law
                                     because it could restrict housing opportunities.
                                  Although the City of Menifee (and its code enforcement staff) does not use
                                  these codes to limit housing opportunities, these codes can create a fair
                                  housing issue if literally interpreted. To bring the City’s codes into compliance
                                  with fair housing law, the Housing Plan sets forth a program to review and
                                  revise the definition of a family, dwelling unit, and similar codes. The Zoning
                                  Code will be amended to remove any reference to number of individuals,
                                  relationship of members, or any other reference that could limit an otherwise
                                  lawful use or occupancy of a residence.

Permitted Land Use
The Zoning Code should also be updated to permit additional types of
housing units. Currently, the Zoning Code does not define the type of
housing for homeless people (e.g., emergency shelters, transitional housing,
permanent supportive housing, etc.). In addition, these types of uses are
generally not permitted or prohibited in the community. Although Menifee
does not have many homeless people compared with more urbanized areas,
the Zoning Code needs to be updated to allow housing for homeless people.
Moreover, the Municipal Code does not clearly distinguish, define, or permit
residential care facilities. Rather, based on the County of Riverside codes, the
City uses the term congregate care to refer to residential care facilities,
although the two uses are very different. This clause conflicts with the Health
and Safety Code, Lanterman-Petris Act, and Welfare and Institutions Code.
The City’s Municipal Code will be updated to define residential care facilities,
distinguish them by size (serving six or fewer or seven or more clients), and
permit them in accordance with fair housing law.
Building Codes
The City of Menifee has adopted the latest techniques and accessibility
standards for new construction. In compliance with state law, the City
requires at least 5% of publicly funded new units to be accessible to persons
with mobility impairments, and an additional 2% of the units be accessible to
persons with hearing or visual impairments. Multiple-family units must
include: 1) public and common use portions of units readily accessible by
disabled persons; 2) doors allow passage into and within such units that
accommodate wheelchairs; and 3) all units contain adaptive design features.
Should the application of a building code materially affect the ability of a
disabled resident to use a home, the City of Menifee has established an
Accessibility Appeals Board to conduct reviews on a case-by-case basis. The
Appeals Board may conduct hearings on written appeals of decisions of the
building official regarding accessibility issues, and approve or disapprove
interpretations and enforcement actions taken by the building official relating
to access. Since incorporation, however, it has not been necessary to activate
the Appeals Board to decide upon such matters.
Development Standards and Permitting Processes
The City of Menifee thoroughly examined its residential development
standards and permitting process to identify potential constraints on the
construction or improvement of housing occupied by people with a disability.
Parking standards for group homes are equal to any single-family or multiple-
family residence. No additional construction standards or development
standards are required for housing for people with a disability. Housing is
treated in a similar manner regardless of the occupancy. The City does not
have distance requirements for residential care facilities. In fact, the City has
been proactive in approving senior projects that serve people with
disabilities, such as the Kensington and Vineyards senior projects.
                                                                        CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT      49

                                  Fair Housing Concerns
                                  The City of Menifee is committed to furthering fair housing opportunity for all
                                  residents regardless of status, race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion,
                                  sex, disability, familial status, source of income, sexual orientation, or any
                                  other arbitrary factor. As a contract city under the County of Riverside’s CDBG
                                  Program, the Fair Housing Council of Riverside County provides fair housing
                                  services, including anti-discrimination, landlord-tenant mediation, training
                                  and technical assistance, enforcement of laws, and administrative hearings.
                                  Over the past five years (FY 05/06–10/11), the County responded to 785
                                  landlord-tenant calls. Of that total, nearly one-third of the calls were for
                                  landlord repairs. This pattern may be due to the increasingly difficult
                                  economy, with landlords deferring maintenance and repairs. Of that total, the
                                  County processed 36 discrimination cases, of which 80% were for
                                  disability/age status. The Consolidated Plan indicated that the greatest
                                  number is most likely due to changes in state laws allowing for reasonable
                                  accommodation for a disability-related issue.
                                  Reasonable Accommodation
                                  As noted by the Fair Housing Council of Riverside Council, a high volume of
                                  potential housing discrimination cases are disability related. The Department
                                  of Housing and Community Development now requires cities to adopt
                                  reasonable accommodation procedures. A reasonable accommodation refers
                                  to actions that a city takes to modify land use and zoning regulations
                                  affecting housing for people with disabilities. A reasonable modification is a
                                  structural change made to existing premises so that a disabled person can
                                  fully utilize the premises.
                                  Although the County of Riverside has a more formal process, the City has
                                  used a more informal process for making reasonable accommodations. As
                                  required by state law, the Housing Element contains a program to develop a
                                  reasonable accommodation ordinance that would formalize the process and
                                  procedures for how people with disabilities may seek appropriate relief from
                                  the strict application of land use, building, and zoning standards.

4. Housing Resources
This chapter describes the land, financial, and administrative resources
available to Menifee to address its existing and future housing needs,
including its share of the regional housing needs allocation (RHNA).
A.        REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
California law requires all local governments to plan to facilitate and
encourage the production of housing to accommodate population and
employment growth. To assist in that effort, SCAG prepares housing
construction need goals for each city in southern California as part of the
RHNA authorized by the California Government Code. Jurisdictions are
required to develop proactive policies and programs to facilitate the
construction of new housing commensurate with assigned housing goals.
MENIFEE’S RHNA
The SCAG determines total housing need for each community in southern
California based on three general factors: 1) the number of housing units
needed to accommodate future population and employment growth; 2) the
number of additional units needed to allow for housing vacancies; and 3) the
number of very low, low, moderate, and above moderate income households
needed in the community. Additional factors used to determine the RHNA
include tenure, the average rate of units needed to replace housing units
demolished, and other factors.
In 2006, SCAG prepared a RHNA for the entire County of Riverside, which
included the unincorporated area now comprising the City of Menifee. Upon
Menifee’s incorporation, new state law requires a transfer of a portion of the
County of Riverside’s RHNA allocation to the City of Menifee. Pursuant to
Government Code, Section 65584.07(a), adopted by the State Legislature in
2010, the City of Menifee is required to use its portion of the RHNA for its
housing element.
Given the time frames for completion of the City of Menifee’s and County’s
Housing Elements and General Plan, the City and County of Riverside arrived
at five principles to derive the RHNA:
 The RHNA is generally consistent with SCAG’s RHNA model;
 The RHNA transferred must be agreed upon by both City and County;
 The transfer must not reduce the subregional RHNA production goals;
 The transfer must not change the fair share adjustment; and
 The transfer cannot change the housing need allocated to other cities.

                                 the RHNA that contained five principles, and the Southern California
                                 Association of Governments also agreed to them. These principles are:
                                 1.     The methodology used to calculate the RHNA transfer is based on
                                        projected household growth, vacancy rates, and replacement factors
                                        used by SCAG in calculating the original 2006–2014 RHNA for the
                                        County of Riverside;
                                 2.     The RHNA transfer occurs from the County of Riverside unincorporated
                                        area to the City of Menifee so that the transfer does not reduce the total
                                        number of units in the subregion nor affect any other community;
                                 3.     The City of Menifee agreed to use the same affordability distribution of
                                        units as the County unincorporated area so that the transfer does not
                                        affect the portion of lower fair share of the region nor any other
                                        community in the SCAG region;
                                 4.     The City of Menifee incorporated in October 2008, which is 34 months
                                        (or one-third) into the 8½-year planning period beginning January 2006
                                        and ending June 2014; thus the RHNA for the City is two-thirds the
                                        2006–2014 planning period;
                                 5.     The County of Riverside will transfer a RHNA of 2,734 housing units,
                                        which equates to 648 very low income, 448 low income, 506 moderate
                                        income, and 1,132 above moderate income units, to the City of Menifee.
                                 Table 14 summarizes the City of Menifee’s 2006–2014 RHNA. The City is
                                 required to ensure that sufficient sites which are general planned and zoned
                                 for housing are available to accommodate its need and to implement
                                 proactive programs to facilitate and encourage the production of housing
                                 commensurate with its housing needs.

                                                                                             Housing Resources
The City of Menifee was been allocated a RHNA of 2,734 housing units for the
2008–2014 Housing Element planning period. The City recognizes that an
effective strategy to address its housing needs must reflect the diverse
housing needs of the community. Because the housing needs of seniors,
families, young, and working-age individuals are all different, meeting these
needs requires a diversified strategy of providing housing.
In addressing the 2008–2014 RHNA, state law allows local governments to
satisfy their share of the regional housing need in three primary ways:
 Housing Production. Housing units built and/or occupied since the City’s
  incorporation can be credited toward the 2008–2014 RHNA per the City
  and county’s agreement and state housing element regulations. Units built
  prior to Menifee’s incorporation are credited toward the county’s RHNA.
 Vacant Land. Vacant land that has or will have adequate infrastructure,
  appropriate zoning, and density levels in place can count toward the RHNA.
  However, any policy changes required to make these sites feasible for
  housing must occur in time to be built by the end of the planning period.
 Housing Preservation. In certain cases, the rehabilitation or preservation
  of housing and affordable housing units at risk of conversion to market
  rents can be credited to the RHNA, but the strict state regulations
  surrounding these provisions make this option infeasible for Menifee.
  The following sections credit housing production toward the RHNA,
  identify sites that accommodate the unmet need for housing, and discuss
  financial and administrative resources to implement programs.
                                                                      CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT     53

                                     Since the City’s incorporation in 2008, Menifee has seen the production of
                                     thousands of housing units. This section describes projects built and credits
                                     the projects to the 2008–2014 RHNA.
                                     Heritage Lakes
                                     The Heritage Lakes residential development is located in the Menifee Valley
                                     Ranch Specific Plan in northern Menifee. This 910-acre project will contain 19
                                     residential neighborhoods, 2,600 homes at buildout, two new schools, and
                                     four grand parks—all oriented around a central 25-acre lake and waterfront.
                                     Approximately 17 acres of greenbelts and trails surround Heritage Lake,
                                     creating a pedestrian waterfront experience and high quality of life. The
                                     picture in the left column illustrates a vista of Heritage Lake.
                                     Since 2008, five phases priced from $175,000 to the mid $300,000s (HOA fees
                                     of $80 per month) have been under construction. The affordability thresholds
                                     of homes were calculated earlier in Table 6 (page 17). Home prices range from
                                     affordable Traditions and Parkside models to moderately priced Brighton and
                                     Reflections models to the higher- priced Waterford models. Table 15 shows
                                     the specifics about each residential model and its affordability level.

The Menifee East Specific Plan is a 400-acre project in Menifee, approved as
Tract 30422. This Specific Plan features several residential neighborhoods,
one new elementary school, a community park, three mini parks, day-care
site, and a central 52-acre lake. Approximately 20 acres of greenbelts,
easements, and trails weave through the residential development. The
project is general planned for low density residential development (2.1-5R)
and allows a density of 2-5 housing units per acre.
The Menifee East Specific Plan has a development capacity to accommodate
1,150 new housing units, of which half the area has been built and sold.
Centex Homes/Pulte is approving plans to develop the remaining 688 single-
family units. The project has four models ranging from 1,900 to 2,900 square
feet on 5,000- to 6,000-square-foot lots. Single-family homes are priced in the
$200,000s and recently dropped $20,000 for every model. HOA fees are $200,
which translates into an increase of approximately $30,000 in sales price.
The housing market today is dynamic and difficult to predict. However, based

                                   Specific Plans, developers in Menifee are building smaller residential
                                   neighborhoods. These include Richmond American, Capital Pacific, Beazer,
                                   and RSI Development described below:

                                   Menifee is at the forefront of facilitating new types of housing, such as
                                   precision built housing. The City of Menifee approved the 103-unit RSI-New

                                   place and the developer is pulling permits. According to Redfin, 37 units were
                                   sold for prices from $245,000 to $289,000. One unit was sold below that range
                                   (low income) and one unit was sold well above the range (above moderate)
                                   Based on standard affordability criteria, these residences and all future homes
                                   are anticipated to be affordable to moderate income households.
                                   Beazer Homes

                                   feet. Prices are from $229,000 to $300,000 and there are no required HOA
                                   fees. Residential lots are typically 7,200 square feet in size and larger. As of
                                   March 2012, a total of 26 single-family have been sold. Based on standard
                                   affordability criteria, these homes are affordable to predominantly moderate
                                   income households (21 units) with a few (5 units) lower income units.
                                   Capital Pacific Homes
                                   Capital Pacific Homes is building the Calder Ranch project located just north

                                   All streets and infrastructure are in place and the developer is pulling permits.
                                   According to Redfin, 18 homes sold in recent years at prices below $400,000.
                                   Based on standard affordability criteria, however, these single-family homes
                                   are affordable only to above moderate income households.

                                 C.        LAND INVENTORY
                                 The City of Menifee recognizes that planning for its residents and workforce
                                 must take into account many considerations. In addition to housing
                                 affordability, these include unit size, parking needs, proximity to educational
                                 centers and transit facilities, and access to social services and health facilities.
                                 The City recognizes that housing needs differ for families, young and
                                 working-age individuals, and seniors. Finally, new housing must also
                                 complement existing neighborhoods and communities.
                                 The 2008-2014 Housing Element identifies available sites in the community
                                 that can accommodate the RHNA for Menifee. As discussed earlier, the City
                                 has already fulfilled its requirement for moderate and above moderate
                                 income housing. This is because moderately priced housing has been built in
                                 such large quantities that it exceeds the RHNA for both moderate and above
                                 moderate income housing alone. The City also has significant vacant land
                                 reserves in specific plan areas. Therefore, the land inventory discussed in this
                                 chapter focuses on the low income requirement.
                                 State law requires that an adequate site inventory contain four components. If
                                 the sites are underutilized (as opposed to vacant sites), additional analysis is
                                 required.
                                 1.    Identify parcels: a listing of properties proposed to accommodate the
                                       regional housing needs by parcel number, size, general plan
                                       designation, and zoning of each property;
                                 2.    Analyze site constraints: the sites should not have significant
                                       environmental or infrastructure constraints that might affect the timing
                                       or feasibility of development by the end of the planning period.
                                 3.    Calculate development capacity: the development capacity of sites in
                                       the housing element should be calculated based on minimum density
                                       range or realistic capacity based on development trends
                                 4.    Demonstrate that zoning is adequate: demonstration that identified
                                       zones and associated densities will be in place to facilitate the
                                       development of housing for lower income households.
                                 Shown later, Menifee has numerous residential projects built that already
                                 meet all of the above moderate and moderate income RHNA requirements.
                                 In fact, many single-family homes and apartments have been built for prices
                                 affordable to lower income residents. Therefore, the remainder of this section
                                 will discuss how the City will meet its lower income requirement. This will be
                                 achieved predominantly through the redesignation of vacant sites to allow
                                 for the construction of multiple-family dwellings.

 IDENTIFICATION OF SITES AND CONSTRAINTS
 Menifee has satisfied a significant part of its RHNA with the production of low,
 moderate, and above moderate income housing, but there is still a shortfall of
 512 lower income units. State law does not require the City to build these
 units, but rather plan for facilitating the development of affordable housing. A
 local government facilitates the production of housing through a
 combination of making land available through zoning, creating appropriate
 development standards, and implementing housing programs.
 The first step in creating an adequate land inventory is to identify and analyze
 appropriate sites for housing that can address the unmet share of the RHNA.
 State law explicitly assumes that sites that could reasonably accommodate
 affordable housing for lower income households are those that can
 accommodate multiple-family housing (apartments, condominiums, and
 townhomes) at a certain density. As discussed later, this density level is a
 minimum of 20 units per acre, and currently no parcels meet that criteria.
 The City surveyed sites throughout the community and identified five parcels
 that met the requisite criteria in state law and could be rezoned to
 accommodate multiple-family housing at an appropriate density. The criteria
 used to screen the sites for appropriateness were:
  Vacant Site Characteristics: Generally flat, large enough to accommodate a
    project, vacant, and reasonably ready for development.
  Infrastructure Feasibility: Could be served with water and sewer by simply
    extending water, sewer, and transportation infrastructure.
  Minimal Environmental Issues: Do not have sensitive species, habitat, nor
    other characteristics that would preclude development.
  Wide Distribution: The five parcels are distributed throughout Menifee and
    consistent with the vision and goals of the proposed General Plan.

ADEQUACY OF ZONING AND DENSITY
The second test in demonstrating that a site is suitable for facilitating and
encouraging affordable housing for low income households is density levels.
This is because state law assumes that density levels are associated with
different affordability levels. Lower density units, such as single-family homes,
are typically less affordable than higher density units, such as apartments.
State law allows two options to satisfy the criteria: 1) rezone sites at a
minimum density of 30 units per acre (a threshold referred to in state law as
default density); or 2) zone sites at a lower density but demonstrate it is
feasible for the production of housing for lower income households.
Whenever a city is required to rezone sites to meet the lower income RHNA,
state housing element law contains other requirements: 1) that the sites
accommodate at least 16 dwelling units per site, 2) that multifamily
residential and single-family residential uses only be permitted as a by-right
use on the sites needed to address the unmet lower income RHNA; 3) that
mixed uses not be allowed on sites required to address the lower income
RHNA; and 4) that the density range facilitate affordable housing.
The City of Menifee assumes that the 20.1-24R general plan land designation
and density of 20 to 24 units per acre can accommodate affordable housing
for lower income households based on projects approved and/or built.
Cantabria and Antelope Ridge apartments—projects built at higher end
condo specs—facilitate moderate income rents at an average of 17 units per
acre. Vineyard senior apartments, Encanto family apartments, and Kensington
apartments, built at 11 to 18 units per acre, offer low income units (Table 19).

Using the above example, the City of Menifee has seen the construction of
affordable housing for lower income households at densities ranging from 11
to 18 units per acre. The City is creating a zone with a higher density range of
20 to 24 units per acre. If affordable housing can presently be developed at
densities of 11 to 18 units per acre, it stands to reason that a 60% to 100%
higher density increase to 20 to 24 units per acre would lower the per unit
cost of land (and therefore development costs), making it even more feasible
to facilitate the construction of lower income affordable housing.
                                                                            CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT     63

                                 Summary of RHNA Credits from Recently Built Projects
                                 Table 20 summarizes the City’s progress toward its 2008–2014 RHNA. As of
                                 March 2012, the City has fulfilled all of its housing production and sites
                                 requirement for the moderate and above moderate income housing. A large
                                 percentage of lower income units have also been addressed through the
                                 construction and approval of housing projects. However, a deficit of lower
                                 income units/site capacity remains.
                                 As discussed earlier, the City is proposing to redesignate five parcels to high
                                 density residential at a density range of 20.1 to 24 units per acre. The realistic
                                 density, however, is assumed to be 22 units for consistency with the General
                                 Plan EIR. With these additional sites and estimated 840-unit development
                                 capacity collectively on these sites, the City of Menifee can adequately
                                 address its 2008–2014 RHNA.

D.        IMPLEMENTATION RESOURCES
This section provides an inventory of current and potential resources to
augment the financial resources and administrative capacity of the City to
undertake its housing programs and activities.
FINANCIAL RESOURCES
Several local, state, and federal financial resources are often used to fund the
construction, improvement, and maintenance of housing in cities. The
following lists the major sources of financial resources used for housing, the
ability of Menifee to access these funds, and plans for the future.
Neighborhood Stabilization Funds
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has allocated the
County of Riverside a total of $48.5 million in funding as part of the
Neighborhood Stabilization Program through the Community Development
Block Grant program. Targeted funds can be used to acquire foreclosed
homes, demolish or rehabilitate abandoned properties, and/or offer down
payment and closing cost assistance to qualified homebuyers. According to
the County’s Consolidated Annual Performance Evaluation Report, $1.8
million was spent in Menifee during FY2009–2010, which was used for the
rehabilitation and sale of single-family residences.
Community Development Block Grants
The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program is a federal
program awarded to cities or the county to fund housing activities and
expand economic opportunities. Projects must benefit low and moderate
income persons, aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or
meet other urgent needs. Eligible activities include property acquisition,
rehabilitation, preservation, economic development, code enforcement, and
public facilities/services. Menifee has applied for status as an entitlement
jurisdiction at the conclusion of the three-year funding period. This will
provide revenues directly to the City of Menifee for eligible activities.
HOME Investment Partnership (HOME)
Title II of the National Affordable Housing Act established the Home
Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program. HOME is the largest federal block
grant to state and local governments designed exclusively to expand the
supply of safe, decent, and affordable housing for low-income households.
Participating jurisdictions work in partnership with nonprofit groups called
Community Housing Development Organizations to fund activities that build,
buy, and/or rehabilitate affordable housing or provide direct rental assistance.
Menifee is seeking to become an entitlement city and will be entitled to direct
funding, rather than being dependent on the County allocation of funding.

Housing Resources
                                 ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
                                 The City of Menifee has several administrative resources available to assist in
                                 implementing housing programs. As a new community, the City will also
                                 need to tap other resources outside of city hall to also assist in implementing
                                 housing programs.
                                 Menifee Planning Department
                                 The Planning Department is responsible for the long-range planning and
                                 physical development of the City of Menifee to promote livability and
                                 appearance. The Planning Department ensures the City’s viability through
                                 enforcement of land use, construction, health and safety, and environmental
                                 regulations. This involves land use and development standards, building
                                 codes, economic vitality, and adherence to the General Plan. The Planning
                                 Department is also responsible for the implementation of the General Plan,
                                 Zoning Code, and Specific Plans.
                                 Habitat for Humanity, Inland Valley
                                 Habitat for Humanity Inland Valley was founded in 1991 to provide low
                                 income housing for families in the Inland Valley. The chapter works alongside
                                 families to build or rehabilitate homes and sell them to the families at cost
                                 with a zero interest mortgage. Habitat has completed the construction and/or
                                 rehabilitation of 10 homes in southwest Riverside County, including three
                                 homes in the City of Menifee. The chapter is working with the County of
                                 Riverside Economic Development Agency to receive Neighborhood
                                 Stabilization Grants to complete the work.
                                 Fair Housing Council of Riverside County
                                 The Fair Housing Council of Riverside County provides fair housing services to
                                 its member cities in Riverside County. This agency is responsible for enforcing
                                 fair housing laws for its member communities, assisting in foreclosure
                                 prevention trainings, conducting homebuyer education programs, and
                                 facilitating landlord-tenant mediation. The Fair Housing Council also has the
                                 ability to serve as an intake center to answer questions regarding fair housing
                                 in Menifee. The City’s 2012–2017 Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing
                                 recommended working with a qualified fair housing service provider.
                                 Affordable Housing Developers
                                 As the City of Menifee develops further and plans for the next housing
                                 element cycle, it is beneficial to establish working relationships with qualified
                                 affordable housing developers. The Department of Housing and Community
                                 Development maintains a list of qualified developers who may be able to
                                 assist the City in meeting its production goals for affordable housing.

5. Housing Plan
This chapter describes the goals, policies, and implementation programs the
City will implement to address its housing needs, including its share of the
regional housing needs allocation (RHNA).
A.        BACKGROUND
OVERVIEW
The State of California recognizes that an adequate supply of quality
affordable housing is fundamental to economic and social well-being.
Therefore, the California Legislature has adopted requirements for all local
governments to further this goal by contributing to and advancing solutions
to meeting their local and regional housing needs. All communities across
California are required to prepare a Housing Element to address their local
housing needs and a share of their region’s need for new housing. This
present housing element covers the planning period of 2008–2014.
PURPOSE
An adequate supply of quality affordable housing is fundamental to the
economic and social well-being of Menifee, its residents, and economy. State
law requires all communities to prepare a housing element every five years.
The Housing Element is required to address the production, preservation, and
improvement of housing in the community. Among its most important
functions, the Housing Element analyzes existing and future housing needs;
addresses various constraints to meeting local housing needs; identifies land,
financial, and administrative resources for housing; sets forth goals and
policies to meet community housing needs; and establishes housing
programs and an implementation plan.

The Housing Element is required to address the production, preservation, and
improvement of housing. Among its most important functions, the Housing
Element analyzes existing and future housing needs; addresses constraints to
meeting local housing needs; identifies land, financial, and administrative
resources for housing; and sets forth goals, policies, and implementation
programs to meet a community’s varied housing needs. The result is a
housing plan that balances the City’s varied needs within the overall goal of
creating and sustaining a strong community.
The City of Menifee’s first 2008–2014 housing element is designed to comply
with requirements in California housing element law.

                                 live in our City, supports future economic growth and our workforce, and
                                 raises municipal revenues needed to sustain our City. We carefully plan our
                                 communities to offer the appropriate types of housing, including startup and
                                 move-up opportunities and supportive community amenities, for residents of

NEIGHBORHOOD QUALITY
Menifee’s character and economic sustainability require that our community
and neighborhoods are quality places to live, work, and raise our children.
Residential neighborhoods must provide parks, recreation services,
infrastructure, and public services and facilities needed to support quality
living. Moreover, we recognize unique features of our communities—Sun
City, Quail Valley, Romoland, master-planned communities, and rural
residential areas. Each neighborhood maintains a unique rural and suburban
character reflective of its history, architecture, housing, and neighborhood
amenities.
GOAL HE-2: Sustainable neighborhoods well served by ample parks,
infrastructure, community amenities, and public services and facilities.

                                 needs, families and individuals seeking first time rental or homeownership
                                 opportunities, people without housing, and other groups. At some point,
                                 each of us will consider the type of neighborhood, location, size of home, and
                                 affordability level that best meets our needs. The answers to these and other
                                 housing questions have significant implications for Menifee—the type of
                                 community it aspires to become, and the implications for the well-being of its
                                 residents and workforce.

                                                                                                   Housing Plan
C.        HOUSING PROGRAMS
As part of its first General Plan program, the City of Menifee will implement
the following housing programs to achieve the goals, policies and objectives
set forth in the 2008-2014 Housing Element.
1. Minor Home Repair Grant Program
The City traditionally participated in Riverside County’s Home Repair Program,
which provides grants to qualified low-income homeowners to address
interior and exterior health and safety issues, Housing Quality Standards, or
improve the accessibility of homes. To qualify, the homeowner must be low
income, own and live in their home in a qualified area, and maintain the
home and property in acceptable condition for 10 years. Low income senior
homeowners are eligible to apply for repairs that address health and safety
issues only. The program does not apply to mobile homes in Menifee. The
City will assume this program (if approved as an entitlement jurisdiction).
Implementation
  Objective: Issue grants for up to 10 households annually. Request county to
   expand program to include permitted mobile home units.
  Time frame: Ongoing
  Responsibility: Menifee CDD
  Funding Source: CDBG
2. Substantial Rehabilitation Grant Program
The City participates in the Riverside County Substantial Rehabilitation
program, which offers funding of up to $20,000 for home repair services. This
program covers more costly repairs—such as air conditioning repair, kitchen
or bathroom repair, roof replacement, plumbing re-piping, electrical upgrade,
or exterior painting. Because of the investment from this program, the
homeowner also must sign an agreement to maintain the property in good
condition for ten years. Currently, the program does not apply to mobile
homes in Menifee. The county has been working with Habitat for Humanity to
complete substantial rehabilitation work in the City of Menifee. The
Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) efforts are anticipated to close out
in 2012 unless new federal funding becomes available.
Implementation
  Objective: Issue grants for up to 10 households annually. Request county to
   expand program to include permitted mobile home units.
  Time frame: Ongoing
  Responsibility: Riverside County EDA
  Funding Source: NSP
                                                                       CITY OF MENIFEE | HOUSING ELEMENT     71

                                 3. Code Enforcement Program
                                 The City of Menifee implements a code enforcement program. The program is
                                 responsible for enforcing various municipal codes that are intended to
                                 maintain the value and safety of property and structures in the community.
                                 The program addresses hazardous vegetation, substandard buildings,
                                 accumulation of debris and vehicles, graffiti, storm water drainage, green
                                 pools, construction without a permit, land use violations, and various other
                                 health and safety codes. The City’s code enforcement officers work with
                                 residents and the business community to remedy code violations in a timely
                                 manner. Code enforcement officers are also involved in coordinated cleanup
                                 days. This program is viewed as essential to maintaining and improving the
                                 safety, livability, and value of properties in the City of Menifee. As the City is
                                 awarded a federal entitlement jurisdiction, CDBG funds may also be used for
                                 code enforcement purpose in income-eligible census tracts.
                                 Implementation:

                                 Habitat for Humanity Inland Valley runs several home rehabilitation and
                                 repair programs out of its Inland Valley office. Using federal Neighborhood
                                 Stabilization funds, Habitat has rehabilitated 6 homes in Menifee. In addition,
                                 Habitat has launched “A Brush with Kindness” program that offers low cost
                                 home repairs to low income families. Sample projects include house/trim
                                 painting, weed abatement, address numbers, fence repair, and garage door
                                 painting. Funds are provided through its organization and donations. Habitat
                                 currently works with Sun City Civic Association to repair about 20 homes per
                                 year. Through its partnership with Grid Alternative, low income homeowners
                                 may also be eligible to receive free solar panels as part of the program. Grid
                                 Alternative also trains volunteers in an apprentice program, serving to meet
                                 economic development goals of communities as well.

5. Neighborhood Stabilization Homeownership Program
The City of Menifee participates in the Neighborhood Stabilization
Homeownership Program administered by the County of Riverside. This
program targets the problem of abandoned and foreclosed homes. This
program provides a silent second loan in the amount of 20% of the purchase
price of the home secured by a deed of trust. The first loan must be a fully
amortized, fixed rate, 30-year mortgage. To qualify, the homebuyer must not
have owned a home in the last three years, have an annual income that is not
greater than 120% of the area median income, and is purchasing a foreclosed
home in the County of Riverside. The Program can also provide substantial
home repair assistance including energy-efficient improvements. Total
combined amount of purchase price assistance and home repair assistance
cannot exceed $75,000. The program is anticipated to end in summer of 2012
unless the federal government reauthorizes the program.
Implementation:
  Objective: Support the County’s NSP program by advertising the program
   on the City’s website.
  Time frame: Ongoing
  Responsibility: Riverside County EDA
  Funding Source: NSP
6. Rental Housing Assistance
The County of Riverside’s Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program
provides rental assistance to very low income families to help them afford
decent and safe rental housing in Menifee. This program is currently
administered by the Riverside County Housing Authority. The Housing
Authority accepts application for rental assistance, selects the applicant for
admission, and issues the applicant a rental voucher. The family must then
find and lease a unit suitable to the family's needs and desires in the private
rental market. The Housing Authority pays the owner a portion of the rent
that generally covers the difference between what the tenant can afford (30%
of income) and the locally determined fair market rent and payment standard.
Because of the limited number of vouchers, there is a waiting list for vouchers.
Although not a direct service provider, the City can assist the county by
placing advertisements in certain locations throughout the community.
Implementation:
  Objective: Support Riverside County Housing Authority by placing
   advertisements for the program for them at City Hall.
  Timeframe: Ongoing
  Responsibility: Riverside County Housing Authority
  Funding Source: Section 8 funds

                                 As a newly incorporated city, Menifee has limited financial resources available
                                 for housing. The Governor’s elimination of redevelopment agencies, take of
                                 local funds, and take of vehicle license fees has made it necessary to seek
                                 other funding sources. The City is not an entitlement jurisdiction and does not
                                 qualify for CDBG, HOME, or ESG funds. To address the need for funding, the
                                 City is applying to become an entitlement jurisdiction to receive community
                                 development block grants. However, the City is not large enough to qualify
                                 for HOME, ESG, or other federal funding sources. General funds are also
                                 limited due to the need to fund City operations. Therefore, the City needs a
                                 self-sustaining funding source that cannot be appropriated by the state to
                                 address infrastructure, housing maintenance, foreclosures, and services
                                 Implementation:
                                   Objective: Become a federal entitlement jurisdiction to allow the securing
                                    of community development block grants.
                                   Timeframe: Submit application to become an entitlement city. Periodically
                                    seek grants and additional housing funding sources.

                                 As a new City, Menifee has adopted the County of Riverside’s Zoning Code
                                 until it adopts its own codes. The Riverside Zoning Code defines a family as an
                                 individual or two or more persons related by blood or marriage, or a group of
                                 not more than five persons who are not related by blood or marriage, living
                                 together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit. Housing definitions
                                 also refer to the number of families and occupants that are suitable for certain
                                 housing types. Fair housing law prohibit a local government from defining a
                                 family in terms of the relationship of members (e.g., marital status), number of
                                 occupants (e.g., family size), or other characteristics beyond a simple
                                 housekeeping unit. This definition could be used or be perceived to
                                 discriminate against large families finding a suitable home or rental unit in
                                 the community.
                                 Implementation:
                                   Objective: Revise the term family, single-family residence, apartment, and
                                    other Zoning Code definitions consistent with fair housing law
                                   Timeframe: Within one year of adoption of the Housing Element

9. Housing for People with Disabilities
Licensed community care facilities provide housing for people with
disabilities who are cannot live independently and need assistance. State law
requires that licensed community care facilities be treated like any other
residential use in the same residential zone. Facilities serving six or less must
be permitted by right in all residential zones similar to other residential uses
in the same zone. The County of Riverside Zoning Code, which the City uses
until a substitute is adopted, does not clearly define or permit residential care
facilities. Rather, the Zoning Code uses the term congregate care to refer to
residential care facilities, although the two uses are very different in definition
and requirements of state law. The Zoning Code does not appear to be
consistent with state law.
Implementation:
  Objective: Create a definition for residential care facility serving six or fewer
   clients that is consistent with state law and amend the Zoning Code to
   allow such uses as a by-right use in all residential zones.
  Timeframe: Within one year of adoption of the Housing Element
  Responsibility: Menifee CDD
  Funding Source: General Fund
10. Reasonable Accommodation
Fair housing law requires local governments to develop and implement a
reasonable accommodation procedure to provide flexibility in the application
of land use policies, zoning regulations, and City procedures to accommodate
the housing needs of persons with disabilities. Currently, the City makes
reasonable accommodations through a variance on a case-by-case basis. A
variance requires a public hearing and finding of a unique property condition.
However, since the variance is not based on disability, an improvement could
be denied based on property characteristics, but still have the effect of
impeding accessibility and fair housing opportunity for the disabled person.
To comply with fair housing law and allow a disabled person to fully access a
house, the City will create and use a reasonable accommodation procedure
(in contrast to a variance) to accommodate the needs of a disabled person.
Implementation:
  Objective: Create a reasonable accommodation procedure that specifies
   eligibility for relief, type of relief, criteria for evaluating requests, procedure
   for application, review, and approval.

                                 11. Housing for Homeless People
                                 State law (Senate Bill 2) was amended to require local governments to
                                 address the needs of the homeless and transitional homeless population. This
                                 is accomplished in three steps: 1) define emergency shelters as a by-right use
                                 pursuant to state law; 2) identify an appropriate zone that permits a year-
                                 round emergency shelter as a by-right use; and 3) make code amendments to
                                 allow transitional and permanent supportive housing.
                                 In complying with this requirement, the City must amend the Municipal Code
                                 to define emergency shelters as required under state law. The City of Menifee
                                 can create standards permitted in state law with respect to maximum
                                 occupancy, off-street parking regulations, onsite waiting and client intake
                                 areas, onsite management, proximity of other emergency shelters, length of
                                 stay, lighting, and security. Considerable flexibility is granted, but shelters
                                 must be subject to development standards required of other uses in the zone.
                                 The City of Menifee must also choose an appropriate zone(s) to allow for the
                                 provision of emergency shelters, including at least one year-round shelter
                                 that is capable of accommodating the unmet need for housing. The City has
                                 selected an area of approximately 39 acres located north of Rouse Road. The
                                 sites are vacant, near transportation routes, and within two miles of the
                                 Menifee Medical Center. These sites could reasonably accommodate the
                                 construction of an emergency shelter should the demand exist for one.
                                 Development standards could be created to facilitate such a use.
                                 The Housing Element also identified a need to revise the Zoning Code to
                                 facilitate provision of transitional housing and supportive housing in the City.
                                 Pursuant to the California Government Code, these uses must be treated like
                                 any other residential use. To bring the City’s Municipal Code into compliance
                                 with state law, the Municipal Code will be amended for all zoning districts
                                 allowing residential use to permit transitional housing and supportive
                                 housing as a residential use, subject only to those regulations that apply to
                                 other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone
                                 Implementation:
                                   Objective: Amend the Municipal Code to allow emergency shelters as a by-
                                    right use in the I-P zone (north of Rouse) and create development and
                                    operational standards allowed for under state law.
                                   Amend all zones allowing residential use to permit transitional housing and
                                    supportive housing as a residential use, subject only to the same standards
                                    and processes required for the same type of housing in the same zone.

12. Community Services
The City of Menifee supports a number of organizations who provide services
to the community. Pursuant to the submittal of the City’s new Consolidated
Plan, Menifee has become a federal entitlement jurisdiction and is eligible to
receive a certain entitlement of community development block grants. By
becoming an entitlement jurisdiction, the City receives funding previously
granted to the County of Riverside for community development activities in
Menifee. As outlined in the Consolidated Plan Action Plan, this includes more
than $50,000 annually for activities serving income qualified members of the
city. Services include supporting a domestic violence shelter, providing food
services, addressing the needs of seniors, providing clothing for school
children, and funding other similar activities. The City will continue to work
with these organizations as outlined in the Annual Action Plan to continue to
meet the housing and community development needs of its residents.
Implementation:
  Objective: As a new entitlement jurisdiction, assume responsibility for
   funding organizations that serve public service needs in the community.
  Timeframe: Annually
  Responsible Party: Menifee CDD
  Funding: CDBG
13. Specific Plans
The City of Menifee has 15 approved specific plans that comprise 7,200 acres
of land. Of that total, 10 specific plans have significant residential
development capacity that will accommodate significant new housing units.
This includes single-family units, townhomes, apartments, and senior housing
built at various densities. These vacant housing sites are free from
infrastructure, environmental, or other topographical constraints that would
preclude their development. Although these sites are not needed until the
next housing element cycle, the City of Menifee will continue to monitor
these sites and market conditions and work with developers to facilitate and
encourage their development so that they can provide housing
commensurate with the regional housing needs allocation. These specific
plan vacant sites will be used for the 2014–2021 Housing Element update.
Implementation:
  Objective: Continue to review and approve residential projects within
   specific plan areas needed to accommodate the Round #5 RHNA.

                                 14. Redesignation of Housing Sites
                                 The City of Menifee has an unmet need of adequately zoned sites that could
                                 accommodate its lower income RHNA need. To address this need, the City will
                                 redesignate five parcels totaling 38.2 acres to a General Plan designation of
                                 20.1–24 R. The sites proposed for redesignation are vacant, readily served by
                                 infrastructure, and immediately developable. This density has been shown to
                                 accommodate affordable housing in Menifee. The sites to be redesignated
                                 shall allow owner-occupied and rental multiple-family residential uses “by-
                                 right” without a conditional use permit, planned unit development permit, or
                                 other discretionary review or approval, and mixed uses will not be allowed.
                                 Each of the sites will allow 20 to 24 units per acre and at least 16 units per site.
                                 At an average density of 22 units per acre, these sites can accommodate 840
                                 units, which exceed the remaining lower income RHNA need.
                                 Implementation:
                                   Objective: Redesignate 6 parcels totaling 38 acres for 20.1–24R. Until zoning
                                    is revised to make consistent with the general plan, allow for such uses
                                    provided consistency with the general plan and housing element.
                                   Timeframe: Within one year of general plan adoption

                                 The General Plan establishes a new general plan designation (20.1-24R) for
                                 high density residential uses, allowing 20.1 to 24 units per acre. The high
                                 density designation is intended to encourage a broader variety of housing
                                 located near or supporting commercial centers and transit. Upon adoption of
                                 the General Plan, the City will update the Zoning Code Map to implement this
                                 land use designation. The Zoning Code will indicate permitted land uses,
                                 development regulations, and administrative procedures to review and
                                 approve projects consistent with and supportive of the General Plan. The City
                                 will adopt an internal policy that will allow for review and approval of projects
                                 that meet the City’s lower income allocation of the RHNA in a manner
                                 consistent with the General Plan land use plan, thereby ensuring that the sites
                                 are deemed “adequate” under housing element law.
                                 Implementation:
                                   Objective: Update the Zoning Code/Map to allow development of multiple-
                                    family residential uses on sites designated 20.1–24 R consistent with City
                                    policy established for that purpose. Adopt an internal policy that will allow
                                    for review and approval of projects that meet the City’s lower income RHNA
                                    in a manner consistent with the General Plan.

16. Financial Incentives Program
As a newly formed community, Menifee has limited financial resources
available to facilitate and encourage the production of housing. About 75% of
total fees for residential development are derived from: 1) Transportation
Uniform Mitigation Fee; 2) school district fees, and 3) water and sewer fees
required from the Eastern Municipal Water District. Under the TUMF program,
affordable housing projects are exempt from this fee. School districts do not
offer fee waivers for affordable housing, but do allow for significant
reductions for senior housing. Water and sewer providers do not offer
reductions for either affordable or senior housing. With the elimination of
redevelopment and reduction in community development block grants, most
cities can no longer subsidize affordable housing. As the economy improves,
however, the City will periodically evaluate the appropriateness of its fee
strategy for opportunities to support the production of affordable housing.
Implementation:
  Objective: Annually evaluate the appropriateness of the City’s fee structure
   for encouraging the production of affordable housing.
  Timeframe: Ongoing and annual review
  Responsible Party: Menifee CDD
  Funding: General Funds
17. At-Risk Housing Preservation
The City of Menifee does not have a large stock of publicly subsidized housing
at risk of conversion to market rates. Current senior and family apartments
provide market rate housing affordable to low and moderate income
households. However, with the construction of the Vineyards Senior project
and Encanto Apartments, Menifee will have three publicly subsidized
projects. The other subsidized multiple-family project is the Halter Hillside
senior development in Sun City. As the City gradually begins to develop an
inventory of publicly subsidized housing units, the City will monitor the status
of its projects. Should the need arise to preserve or rehabilitate such units, the
City will work with property owners or qualified organizations to facilitate the
preservation and long-term affordability of these projects.
Implementation:
  Objective: Monitor affordable projects and work with qualified entities to
   preserve the long-term affordability of such projects.

                                 The City of Menifee recognizes the importance of addressing statewide goals
                                 for energy conservation and climate change reduction by taking reasonable
                                 actions to encourage the conservation of energy, reduction of greenhouse
                                 gas emissions, and other feasible practices in residential construction. To that
                                 end, the City requires residential developers to meet the 2010 Green Building
                                 Code with 20% reductions in indoor water use, 50% reduction in diversion of
                                 construction waste generated at the site, achievement of California Energy
                                 Standards, and other standards per City specifications. All of these standards
                                 are enforced through the permitting process for new housing. As the General
                                 Plan EIR is approved, mitigation measures will be evaluated for suitability for
                                 implementation to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions.
                                 Implementation:
                                   Objective: Continue to require adherence to the 2010 Green Building Code
                                    and other practices deemed feasible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
                                    and conserve resources in a manner that does not unduly constrain the
                                    development, improvement, and affordability of housing.

                                 19. Density Bonus Program
                                 State law requires all cities and counties to adopt a bonus density ordinance
                                 that specifies how compliance with the state bonus density law will be
                                 implemented. The City of Menifee will adopt a bonus density ordinance to
                                 allow greater density bonuses and incentives and concessions for affordable
                                 and senior citizen housing, in accordance with changes made in the state-
                                 mandated density bonus law effective in 2005. Among other things, the
                                 ordinance will provide for greater density and incentive options based on the
                                 level of affordability and percentage of affordable units, as well as incentives
                                 for senior housing. The ordinance may also allow basic incentives and
                                 concessions to be granted through an administrative procedure, regardless of
                                 whether or not the project otherwise requires a discretionary review.
                                 Implementation:
                                   Objective: Prepare a local density bonus ordinance consistent with state
                                    law.
                                   Timeframe: Within one year of adoption of the housing element.

20. Lower Income Housing
Menifee recognizes that the production of lower income housing, in
particularly extremely low income housing, is needed. But this affordability
level cannot be achieved without financial assistance. Given the loss of
redevelopment dollars, reduction in federal funds, and difficulty of obtaining
tax credits, Menifee will face challenges in encouraging the production of
housing for extremely low income persons. To that end, the City will seek,
where feasible, to encourage the production of housing affordable to
extremely low income households through activities such as developer
outreach on an annual basis, rezoning land identified in this housing element,
identifying and supporting grants or other funding opportunities, adopting a
density bonus program, amending the zoning code to define single room
occupancy units, and exploring other feasible means to further this goal.
Implementation:
 Objective: Outreach to developers, apply for or support applications for
  funding, and adopt a density bonus ordinance to facilitate housing for
  extremely low, very low, and low income households. Amend the Zoning
  Code to define single room occupancy units.
 Timeframe: Ongoing
 Responsible Party: Menifee CDD
 Funding: General Funds
21. Fair Housing Program
Menifee is committed to furthering fair housing opportunity for all residents
regardless of protected status. Menifee is a contract city under Riverside
County’s CDBG Program, and the Fair Housing Council of Riverside County
provides fair housing services, including antidiscrimination and landlord-
tenant mediation, training and technical assistance, enforcement of laws, and
administrative hearings. The City committed to making changes to its code to
further fair housing in Programs 8 to 11, which address reasonable
accommodations, zoning code updates, housing for people with disabilities,
and housing for homeless people. The City will continue to prepare its
Analysis of Impediments every five years as required and take the necessary
steps to remove identified impediments to fair housing opportunity.
Implementation:
 Objective: Implement housing programs contained herein, periodically
  prepare the Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing, and take necessary
  steps to remove identified impediments to fair housing.
