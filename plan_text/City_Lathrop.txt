                         INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN
                                    AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
BACKGROUND
The town of Lathrop began with a store and schoolhouse prior to construction of the Central Pacific
Railroad around 1870, and was known as Wilson's Station. The town was founded initially by Leland
Stanford, as a product of political controversy with the City of Stockton over negotiations on the Central
Pacific's alignment through Stockton. Subsequently, Stanford ordered construction of the railroad around
Stockton. Wilson's Station was renamed for Stanford's brother-in-law, Charles Lathrop, and became an
important division point and rail stop by 1871. The Town's growth through the 1870's was steady, reaching
a population of about 600 by 1879.1
Lathrop entered a period of decline in the 1880's which was to continue for nearly 50 years. With the
transfer of the railroad roundhouse and machine shop to Tracy, the transfer of rural postal customers to
Manteca and a major fire in 1911, Lathrop's population and economy dwindled until World War II. The
war brought Permanente Metals and the Sharpe Army Depot to town. Permanente produced aircraft parts
and magnesium bombs, while the Depot became one of the major army supply depots in the Western United
States. The Depot remains as a major employer in San Joaquin County and serves as the U.S. Army's
western distribution center for repair and spare parts.
During the 1940's, Lathrop expanded from its original townsite to an area of about five square miles.
Housing tracts were constructed during postwar years and Lathrop became home to large industrial
employers. They include Best Fertilizer, now operated by Simplot for the production of pesticides and
fertilizers, and Libby-Owens-Ford which produces auto glass. Residential growth was slow during the
1950's and 1960's, but accelerated through the '70's and '80's. Nearly all of the vacant land between the
original townsite and Interstate 5 has been developed. With about 3,700 people and 1,100 homes in 1980,
Lathrop has expanded to a population of 6,841 in 1990 and about 7,000 in early 1991.
Lathrop became a municipality by an overwhelming majority of the votes cast in the election held in 1989.
The current General Plan Program commenced in the spring of 1990 with a planning area extending west to
the San Joaquin River and north to Roth Road. The Program was enlarged in January, 1991, to encompass
the nearly 5,000 acre Stewart Tract west of the San Joaquin River.
NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE GENERAL PLAN
Under the body of statutory and case law which has evolved in California, including Guidelines issued by
the State Office of Planning and Research, the General Plan for Lathrop functions as a "constitution" in
much the same way as a state or national constitution. The Plan reflects the City's long-range aspirations of
  1
          Abstracted from the description of Lathrop's background in the Draft San Joaquin County General Plan 2010,
          Volume II: Community Plans Special Supplement: Lathrop Planning Area, June 1, 1989.
                                                            1-1
physical form and amenity and provides guidance to the substance of developmental regulations and other
programs approved or to be approved by the City Council which combines as the package of tools necessary
to carry out the Plan over time.
The General Plan has three basic functions:
1.       To enable the City Council, upon the advice of its Planning Commission, to express agreement
         on goals and policies for current and future development;
2.       To provide clear guidance in judging whether projects proposed by public agencies and private
         developers are in close agreement with policies of the General Plan; and
3.       To allow and provide the basis for making intelligent changes to the Plan as time and changing
         circumstances may dictate, while being true to its purposes.
The principal characteristics of the Plan are that it is comprehensive, long-range and general. It is
comprehensive in that it embraces all aspects of existing and future physical development of the
community, public and private. It is long-range in that it presents a view of the physical character to be
achieved over the next 20 years. And, it is general in that it provides for innovation and flexibility in
working toward the achievement of the Plan's goals through the many public and private actions that are and
will be necessary for Plan implementation.
THE LATHROP PLANNING AREA
The area covered by the Plan has three significant geographic dimensions as shown on Figure I-1. With the
exception of lands west of I-5 extending north of the line of Squires Road, these three areas comprise the
total land area prescribed by the City's proposed "Sphere of Influence" (SOI) which is being recommended
for the approval of the San Joaquin County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO). Because of
different characteristics and needs, each of the three sub-planning areas exhibits some differences in
development policies and proposals. These differences are noted in the descriptions which follow:
Sub-Plan Area #1:          This area comprises all area within the existing SOI adopted by LAFCO and
which is coterminous with the City Limits existing as of December, 1991. With the exception of lands held
for industrial use, this part of SPA #1 is substantially developed. SPA #1 also contains acreage south of
State Route 120 and north of Lathrop Road outside of the City Limits. Lands south of State Route 120 are
bordered by SR 120, the Union Pacific Railroad and the San Joaquin River.
Sub-Plan Area #2:          This area essentially involves all of the lands extending west of I-5 to the San
Joaquin River, between lands along the north side of Bowman Road on the north and the I-5 crossing of the
river on the south. Virtually all of this land is in agricultural use, with a scattering of rural residential use on
large parcels. The line north of Bowman Road is the southern limits of Stockton's SOI.
Sub-Plan Area #3:          This third area involves land known as the Stewart Tract west of the San Joaquin
River. The site is bounded by Old River on the north, the San Joaquin River and Interstate 5 on the east and
Paradise Cut on the south.

APPROACH TO POLICIES FOR THE SUB-PLAN AREAS
Policies for each of the sub-plan areas are quite often expressed differently and policies which apply in one
sub-plan area may not apply at all in another. Variations in policy among sub-plan areas are especially
apparent in describing the Land Use Section (Section A) of the Community Development Element in Part
IV.
USING THE GENERAL PLAN AND RELATED DOCUMENTS
The general plan has been organized to save the reader time in identifying and understanding those
development policies which most affect the reader's interests. The reader is encouraged to use the Table of
Contents, which includes a detailed listing of subject matter and a list of the many figures and tables which
provide mapped and statistical information. Supporting material is also found in a series of separate
documents on file in the office of the Lathrop City Community Development Department which constitute a
technical appendix covering the topics of water resources, fiscal impact of General Plan proposals and a
series of land use, housing and employment maps and tables.
FORMAT AND CONTENT OF THE PLAN
The General Plan is presented in seven parts (including this introduction). Part II provides a description of
the reasoning which underlies the goals, major policies and major proposals of the General Plan. Part III
(now a part of the separate EIR) provides a description of the environmental setting which serves to meet
requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for purposes of the General Plan EIR
and for environmental assessments that may be required for specific development projects.
Parts IV - VI present descriptions of seven mandatory (and one optional) elements of the Plan (Land Use,
Circulation, Housing, Conservation, Open Space, Noise and Safety). The optional element is the Recreation
Element. These descriptions have been combined into three so-called "Super Elements" as discussed under
alternatives for element consolidation developed by the Governor's Office of Planning & Research. 2 These
three elements are the Community Development Element (Part IV), the Resource Management Element
(Part V) and the Hazard Management Element (Part VI). They represent a functional consolidation which
simplifies the task of element description by combining those elements which are closely related to each
another. Consolidation also makes it easier to achieve internal consistency among elements as required by
State Law and Case Law. The relationship of the formerly separate and consolidated elements is shown in
Table I-1.
The policies and proposals of the General Plan are given added dimension by the 1000' scale Diagram
incorporated as a folded insert at the back of the document. The Diagram depicts only those proposals
which are capable of graphic presentation. Although the Diagram usually is referred to more often than the
text of the Plan, the Diagram taken together with this entire document constitutes the complete General
Plan. The Diagram illustrates, while the text explains. A more generalized General Plan Diagram is also
included as Figure IV-1 in Part IV of this document, for ready reference to major proposals of the Plan. The
20 Year General Plan Diagram insert at the end of the report is the official version.

Part VII presents a general strategy and program for Plan implementation. It is included more to provide
direction to the City rather than policy commitment to specific programs in recognition of financial
limitations which impose constraints on the ability of the City (and therefore the timing) to implement
various features of the Plan. Part VIII, now part of the separate General Plan EIR, fulfills the requirements
of CEQA for an Environmental Impact Report on the General Plan.

                                     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
This Executive Summary is provided as a ready-reference to goals and many of the more significant policies
of the General Plan and to mitigation measures specified by the General Plan EIR. Policies of the General
Plan can be found throughout Parts II, IV, V, and VI, along with considerable descriptive material that
translates goals and policies into more specific directions for action by all parties engaged in the
development process. The complete description of mitigation measures can be found throughout the various
sections of Part VIII which comprise the General Plan EIR.
GOAL NO. 1 - BALANCING THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF
URBANIZATION
The General Plan gives emphasis to the development of job-creating and tax revenue creating activities
during the early phases of development as a matter of primary importance to achieving other goals of the
Plan. Despite pressures and demands that are certain to emerge in order to build housing units at a rapid
pace, a clear policy of the General Plan is to limit the pace and quantity of housing construction to annual
allocations in reasonable balance with the growth of Lathrop's economic base.
Policies:
General:
1.       The City's ability to stay abreast of its financial and service capabilities will require continuous
         monitoring. Once a system is in place, it will be relatively easy to identify current conditions and
         to estimate the probable impacts of new development proposals. Rather than adhering to an
         arbitrarily fixed percentage of annual growth as a matter of policy, it will be the City's
         responsibility to manage the growth rate in relation to physical and financial capability of
         municipal service while being consistent with all applicable policies and proposals of the General
         Plan.
Commercial Development:
1.       Areas having early potential for retail and highway commercial development primarily involve
         lands located at the easterly quadrants of the Lathrop Road and Louise Avenue interchanges with
         I-5. The largest commercial project being considered in the short term is a Factory Stores center
         proposed at the southeast quadrant of the Louise Avenue interchange.
2.       Priorities for commercial development in Sub-Plan Area (SPA) #2 west of Interstate 5 would
         typically emphasize Freeway Commercial and Office Commercial uses until the population of SPA
         #2 increases (in combination with Area #1) to where the market will support initial stages of a
         community shopping center at the Lathrop Road interchange and an initial Village Center west of I-
         5.
                                                      1-6
3.       The development of the Stewart Tract is enhanced by the construction of a large employment center
         as the focus of the initial increments of development.
4.       Proposals for the classifications of retail activity described in Part IV-A of the Plan are to be
         considered as offering flexibility for ingenuity and innovation in the selection, promotion, design
         and development of commercial centers and uses.
Industrial Development:
1.       Areas designated for industrial use are intended to take advantage of rail and freeway access.
         Industrial development priorities must involve lands south of Lathrop Road east of I-5 until sewage
         treatment facilities can be extended to other areas within SPA #1.
2.       Areas designated for industrial use are to assure that there will be sufficient long-term availability
         of industrial land to expand the City's economic base and capability for meeting the on-going
         costs of public services required by the community. A slow pace of industrial development is not
         to be construed alone as justification for designating industrial land areas for another type of urban
         use unless such use would be of a regional commercial character.
3.       Industrial proposals should be located where possible within an industrial park designed for the
         accommodation of a community of industries that are compatible in terms of operational
         characteristics, aesthetic qualities, utility service requirements and street circulation.
GOAL NO. 2 - EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
The creation of growth centers west of Interstate 5 and the rehabilitation of the existing community east of I-
5 offers unique opportunities to assure equality in opportunity for existing residents, for racial and ethnic
minorities and for people of low and moderate income in the provision and availability of public services
and facilities and in meeting employment and housing needs. Insofar as reasonably may be possible,
policies and proposals of the General Plan are intended to provide for and support the attainment of such
equality of opportunity.
Policies:
1.       The City intends that positive benefits accrue to the community as a whole through programs
         which maximize the potential of local residents to obtain jobs, assuming adequate training and
         personal characteristics. Contracts will be sought with employers of commercial and industrial
         establishments which will assure the opportunity for employing qualified local residents.
2.       Residential expansion should reflect the considerable variety of housing types that comprise the
         residential market of the region. In addition to conventional single-family detached housing, there
         is a strong market for small lot detached and attached (townhouse) single-family purchase housing
         for entry level buyers as an alternative to multi-family rentals. As an alternative to large multi-
         family rental projects, there also is a market for owner-occupied multi-plexes. Other alternatives
         are the purchase and rental condominium, the single story garden apartment and well-designed
         mobile home park. As an overall standard, the City should seek to maintain a 70% to 30% ratio in
         the combined variety of single-family units provided as compared to the combined variety of multi-
         family units. This percentage is a fair reflection of regional characteristics of housing market
                                                          1-7
         demand, and will assure that Lathrop will meet its fair share of the regional market for housing to
         meet the needs of low and low-moderate income households.
With respect to housing opportunity, 22 policies are listed on pp. 12 - 15 of Part IV-C regarding the
following topics:
         -        Adequate provision of housing sites.
         -        Increasing the supply of affordable and accessible housing.
         -        Implementation and monitoring.
         -        Preservation and conservation of existing neighborhoods.
         -        Adequate housing for all socio-economic segments of the population.
GOAL NO. 3 - COMMUNITY IDENTITY
Just as the loss of personal identity can contribute to emotional disorder, so can failure to establish and
maintain community identity lead to instability and disorder within the community-at-large. At the very
least, the lack of community identity can stifle community pride. At its worst, it can foster destructive
competition between the old center and the new and lose the identity for both areas in the process. It is a
goal of the General Plan that the old and new centers of development, which lay east and west of I-5
respectively, make a strong contribution toward the identity of the entire City of Lathrop. At the same time,
residents of all Sub-Plan areas are to be encouraged to develop a sense of pride and identity with their
immediate neighborhoods.
Policies:
1.       Lathrop's existing urban pattern is confined to lands which lay between Interstate 5 and the Western
         Pacific Railroad. Older housing areas which comprised the original settlement are in need of
         improvement to public service infrastructure and housing quality. Through policies of the General
         Plan which seek a sound economic base and tax base in support of residential expansion, it will be
         possible to progressively achieve the revitalization of blighted properties to where many existing
         residents and land owners will benefit significantly from the City's planning program. In some
         cases, benefits will be realized through the revitalization of properties under programs of a Lathrop
         Redevelopment Agency. In other cases, benefits will result from important changes in land use
         policy which will create higher land values.
2.       A concept basic to the design of residential areas in Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2 is to create
         residential "villages". Each village may be served by a Village Center with a convenience-oriented
         (neighborhood level) shopping center and community services, one or more elementary schools and
         recreation-parks centrally placed to the neighborhoods they serve, and bordered by components of
         the community open space system. Villages would be defined by elements of the Arterial street
         system and would be comprised of two or more neighborhoods accommodating a variety of housing
         types and with aggregate populations in the range of 7,000 to 10,000.
3.       Each village and village center could have its own distinctive architectural character, with major
         activity centers connected by pedestrian-oriented open space corridors mostly separate from the
         street system. This approach is important to achieving identity among residential areas. The scale
         and variety of shopping and community services of each village center will be influenced in part by
         the economic characteristics and housing densities of the residential areas to be served.
                                                       1-8
4.       Residential areas on Stewart Tract will be defined by their shared edge conditions (such as lake,
         river or canal edges) and by their shared internal parks, paseos and open space/recreation areas.
GOAL NO. 4 - QUALITY IN THE FORM, DESIGN AND FUNCTIONS OF THE URBAN AREA
The building of a new growth center west of Interstate 5 and the rehabilitation of the existing growth center
must not and cannot be approached as a collection of subdivisions and commercial and industrial
enterprises, to be built out as rapidly as the private sector may desire. The City of Lathrop has a unique
opportunity and responsibility to control the timing and phasing of development; to create and hold more
directly to an overall town design; and to withhold the provision of essential public services if necessary to
gain the level of cooperation required of developers and landowners to assemble land and proposed units of
development in conformance with the town design.
New development and redevelopment is to reflect quality in community design and image. Development is
to be phased to create a community which exhibits the best that community building and management
experience will allow.
Policies:
Residential Areas:
1.       Architectural design review shall be required of all Planned Developments (PD's), and of all multi-
         family, office, commercial, institutional and industrial uses.
2.       Eligibility for density bonuses under Planned Development or other applications should be based on
         objective criteria to be included in the zoning ordinance, or as noted in a specific plan.
3.       Multi-family projects shall include landscaped open space in addition to yard areas required by
         the zoning ordinance, to be developed for the common recreation use of tenants. Minimum
         facilities may be required for common recreation areas. Examples include tot lots for pre-school
         children, and passive recreation areas for lounging, sun bathing, barbecuing, quiet conversation
         and reading, including area to be shaded by trees and shade structures.
4.       Where multi-story housing units are proposed adjacent to existing or planned Low Density areas,
         building elevations and the location of windows, balconies and air conditioning units above the
         first story shall be reviewed by the City to assure visual compatibility and residential privacy.
5.       Multi-family site development and maintenance shall be in accordance with a comprehensive
         landscape development plan, including automatic irrigation.
Commercial and Industrial Areas:
1.       Major features for the City Center would include the following:
         a.        Application of an architectural review process for all new building and remodeling.
                                                        1-9
       b.        Development of central and bordering streets as landscaped corridors. Examples of design
                 features include angle parking, mid-block crosswalks, street furniture, tree planting and
                 complementary building facades.
       c.        Off-street parking to satisfy the need for all-day static parking of owners, managers and
                 employees of downtown businesses and public service activities, in order to release on-
                 street and off-street spaces to businesses for customers.
       d.        Encouragement of above ground floor residential use in support of the City
                 Center as a major activity center during evenings.
       e.        Encouragement of business and medically related office development at the periphery
                 rather than at the core of the City Center.
2.     The visual interface between commercial/industrial areas and residential areas shall be designed
       and developed so as to avoid obtrusive visual impacts of commercial or industrial activities on
       nearby residential areas.
3.     All outdoor storage areas shall be visually screened with ornamental fencing or walls, and
       landscaping.
4.     Street trees and frontage landscaping, with automatic irrigation, shall be provided for all
       commercial sites outside of the CBD, and may be required by the City within the City Center.
       Shade trees shall be provided within off-street parking areas as determined under site plan review.
Urban Open Space System:
1.     Features of the urban open space system should include neighborhood and community recreation-
       parks, park and recreation corridors along natural and man-made drainages and waterways,
       recreation corridors which connect with major components of the park system, and a municipal
       marina. Neighborhood parks should be adjacent to and integrated with elementary school sites as
       well as being free-standing. Community parks should be adjacent to and integrated with junior
       high, high school and college sites, as well as being freestanding.
2.     Major components of the regional open space system should include natural waterways and
       riparian vegetation south of Route 120 close to the San Joaquin River, a pedestrian and bike trail
       linking all three Sub-Plan areas, and private marinas open to the public along the San Joaquin
       River and Old River. Access to trails should be designed so as to prevent use by motor vehicles,
       including motorcycles, motorbikes and similar off-road vehicles.
3.     An important component of the system will be landscaped open space corridors on either side of
       expressways and some arterial streets as a means to buffer residential areas from traffic noise and
       glare. These corridors may vary in width and design to accommodate such recreation pursuits as
       walking, biking, golf, and nature study. A corridor for eventually combining light rail, bike and
       pedestrian circulation is proposed separate from the Expressway and Arterial street system. Until
       light rail becomes feasible, the corridor could be used for busses.
                                                      1-10
GOAL NO. 5 - ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF LIFE
It is a goal of the General Plan to enhance the quality of living by preventing the degradation of the natural
environment, and by taking steps to off-set and alleviate the effects of that degradation which already has
occurred or which cannot be avoided. Where feasible, natural conditions should be emulated as features of
the community's systems of public and private open space.
Policies:
Agricultural Land:
1.        The extent of urbanization proposed within all three Sub-Plan Areas is based on the principle that
          the capacity to accommodate population and economic growth is dictated by the need to preserve
          environmental qualities rather than the potential of Lathrop to grow beyond its planning area
          boundaries. If future conditions indicate a potential for further urbanization greater than that
          encouraged by the General Plan west and south of the planning area, such potential is to be satisfied
          within the sphere of influence of local governments other than Lathrop.
2.        Exclusive agricultural zoning shall be continued on agricultural lands outside the boundaries of the
          three sub-plan areas
3.        The City, the County and affected landowners should develop a comprehensive approach to the
          cancellation of Williamson Act contracts on lands needed for early phases of urban development.
4.        The protection of agricultural lands outside of Sub-Plan Areas #1, #2 and #3 should be reinforced
          by firm City policies to not permit the extension of sewerage and water service to such lands.
Mineral Resources:
1.        Lands classified by the State Mining and Geology Board as MRZ-2 as shown on Figure V-1 are
          urged for protection to assure their availability for mining under applicable provisions of State
          Law and local ordinance. If determined practical and feasible, these lands are to be mined and
          reclaimed in accordance with the provisions of the California Surface Mining and Reclamation
          Act of 1975, as amended, prior to their being utilized for the various urban purposes depicted on
          the General Plan Diagram and described in this document.
2.        Lands classified MRZ-2 may be developed for urban use without first being mined only if
          compelling reasons can be stated by the City in writing in support of such action and upon
          fulfilling the requirements of Section 2763 (a) of the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of
          1975, as amended. Action by the City shall consider the need to balance mineral values against
          alternative land uses, and the importance of these mineral deposits to the regional market demand
          for their use.
Fish & Wildlife Habitat:
Policies of the General Plan seek not only the retention of important habitat which now exists, but also to
enhance habitat which has been degraded and to create new habitat where feasible.
                                                       1-11
1. The objective of habitat retention calls for:
   -    The integration of waterway habitat areas as part of the area wide system of open space.
   -    The preservation of all stands of vegetation along waterways which provide habitat, where
        appropriate.
   -    The careful introduction of public and private recreation activities within habitat areas which
        will not disturb natural conditions either through intensity of operations, high levels of noise
        generation, or scarring of the landscape through development activity.
   -    The retention of hedgerows and other habitat areas within intensively farmed acreage which are
        compatible with agricultural operations.
2. The objective of habitat enhancement calls for:
   -    The improvement of natural habitat along waterways.
   -    The creation of new habitat within multi-purpose open space area designated for reuse of
        treated wastewater for wildlife management and recreation.
   -    Cooperative approaches among landowners to manage farmlands so as to increase the numbers
        of desirable species of wildlife.
3. The City has adopted (effective October 15, 1996) a Habitat Conservation Plan for the Swainson's
   hawk. The acquisition of lands required as replacement habitat for nesting and foraging is to be
   funded by fees imposed upon developers whose land development activities would threaten,
   endanger or eliminate existing habitat within the Lathrop planning area.
4. Land use within areas of riparian habitat shall be restricted to nature-oriented passive recreation,
   which may include an arboretum, zoological gardens, hiking and nature study and other such uses
   compatible with riparian habitats. Structures which would reduce the amount of area available for
   water detention should be prohibited within the Paradise Cut flood plain unless they are
   accompanied by concurrent expansion of such detention areas in or adjacent to Paradise Cut. (See
   page 5-9.)
5. A naturally landscaped corridor and/or park shall be provided along the western boundary of SPA
   #2, interrupted only by public and commercial areas that need access to adjacent waterways. These
   parks or/and corridors should be wide enough to serve as major components of the park, recreation
   and open space system, and should provide for a system of pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian trails,
   where such uses are compatible with existing or enhanced habitats.
6. The visual amenities of water and its potential as wildlife habitat are to be reflected where feasible
   in all developments by the inclusion of bodies of water as components of urban form. Such bodies
   of water may be in the form of lakes, ponds, lagoons, simulated streams or similar features which
   can be integrated by design within recreation open space corridors, parks, commercial and
   residential areas and public sites. The multi-purposes use of water bodies for surface water
   drainage, flood control, wastewater reclamation, wildlife management, recreation and visual
   amenity is encouraged.
7. Developments proposed in sensitive biological areas shall be required to provide a site specific
   analysis of the impacts of the project on fish and wildlife habitat. Because of the large-scale
   character of development proposed in SPA's #1 and #2 in the vicinity of biologically sensitive
   environments, including the conversion of several thousand acres of agricultural land to urban use,
                                                 1-12
        project proposals should be made to address ways in which new or enhanced habitat may be created
        as a trade-off to the general environmental impacts on biological resources associated with
        development under the General Plan.
8.      Appropriate trees within public rights-of-way are to be retained and new street trees planted and
        maintained in accordance with policies and procedures of a Master Street Tree Plan and Street Tree
        Ordinance. Only trees which are either badly diseased, disruptive of street improvements because
        of root growth, or dangerous to the public shall be allowed to be removed. The installation of street
        trees shall be made a condition of approval of residential, commercial, industrial and institutional
        development along such streets.
Air Quality:
1.      Mitigation of air quality impacts is to be achieved in part through the design and construction of
        an efficient system of arterial and collector streets and interchange and freeway improvements that
        will assure high levels of traffic service and the avoidance of unmanageable levels of traffic
        congestion.
2.      Mitigation of air quality impacts is to be achieved in part through the development of a regional
        rail transit service to be incorporated into early stages of development within both growth centers.
3.      The City shall adopt standards which require industrial process analysis before the fact of site and
        building permit approval to assure compliance with State air quality and water quality standards.
        Standards should provide for periodic monitoring of industrial processes which could have an
        adverse impact on water or air quality. Industrial process review that may be required should be
        conducted as part of environmental assessment by an engineer licensed in California having
        demonstrated experience in the industrial processes involved.
4.      The City shall require positive control of dust particles during project construction activities,
        including watering or use of emulsions, parking of heavy equipment on paved surfaces, prohibition
        of land grading operations during days of high wind (beginning at 10 mph, with gusts exceeding
        20 mph), and prohibition of burning on vacant parcels. The City should seek the cooperation of
        agricultural operators to refrain from the plowing of fields on windy days, and to keep loose soils
        under control to the extent reasonable to avoid heavy wind erosion of soils.
5.      The beneficial effects of open space and vegetation on the air resource are to be reflected in the
        arrangement of land uses depicted on the General Plan. Heavy plantings of trees are encouraged
        to assist in maintaining oxygen levels.
6.      The need to protect and preserve the air resource within the planning area and to reduce levels
        of vehicle emissions of air pollutants imposes practical limitations on the extent to which the City
        can depend on the automobile as the principal source of transportation into the next Century.
Recreation:
The following statements of policy are recommended for adoption by the City, and the Board of Trustees of
the Manteca and Tracy Unified School Districts and the Banta School District:
                                                       1-13
1.       It is the policy of the City and the School Board, functioning under a joint powers or other
         appropriate written agreement, to provide such quantity and quality of recreation opportunity as
         will be necessary for individual enjoyment and to assure the physical, cultural and spiritual benefit
         of recreation for all people of the community.
2.       The City and School Board supports the creation of a means to achieve a permanent and stable
         funding for local recreation services.
3.       The recreation program will encompass the needs of all age groups, concentrating on activities
         and experiences which people are mostly unable to provide for themselves.
4.       The range of recreation opportunities will be provided through the development of general and
         specialized areas and facilities at the neighborhood, village and community level throughout the
         urban area.
5.       The fulfillment of recreation needs will be accomplished through a coordination of effort and
         programming on the part of the City, the School District, and charitable, service, religious, and
         civic organizations, which takes maximum advantage of fiscal and physical resources, and
         individual and group interest, leadership and talent within the community, both public and private.
6.       Through an ongoing coordinated effort, a "framework for cooperation" should be developed and
         maintained by the City and School Board. This framework should clearly delineate the areas of
         responsibility to be retained by each jurisdiction. Examples of topics include fee structures,
         contracts for maintenance and operation and coordination and sponsorship of recreation
         programming.
7.       The City will encourage and, where appropriate, require the provision of recreation areas and
         facilities within residential areas and the community as a whole to meet the general and specialized
         needs of existing and future residents. The Recreation component of the Resource Management
         Element of the General Plan is intended to meet the criteria and standards required by the State
         Subdivision Map Act and by the Quimby Act for determining financial responsibilities of
         developers in meeting recreation needs of the community.
GOAL NO. 6 - TRANSPORTATION/CIRCULATION/TRAFFIC
It is a goal of the General Plan to guide and provide for the development of an integrated system of
transportation and internal circulation, and to provide access to other parts of San Joaquin County and the
region. This goal is intended to benefit all citizens of Lathrop, including the young, the elderly and the
physically handicapped, by seeking the following:
         -         Increased transportation safety for citizens.
         -         The efficient movement of people and goods.
         -         Lower vehicle operating costs.
         -         Lower vehicle miles traveled with consequent reduction in vehicle emissions.
         -         Economy in street construction and maintenance.
         -         A circulation system correlated and consistent with the land use patterns fostered by the
                   General Plan.
         -         Avoidance of the disruption of residential areas caused by through traffic on minor streets.
                                                       1-14
         -         Protection of rights-of-way needed for future Arterial and Collector street widening in
                   developed areas.
         -         Access to boat docking facilities.
Policies:
Interstate and State Route Freeways:
1.       The City should protect the through traffic functions of Interstate and State Route Freeways serving
         the Lathrop area by planning arterial street alignments which will avoid the need or desire to utilize
         freeway sections for short, local area interval trips as if they were elements of the local arterial street
         system.
2.       Land use designations along freeway sections should take into consideration the existing visual
         and noise impacts associated with existing and future traffic levels on these major traffic carrying
         facilities.
3.       Freeway interchanges should be improved to carry the demands of traffic generated by Lathrop's
         development, with new freeway interchanges and additional interchange ramps being added where
         necessary and practical in consideration of the need for fair apportionment of traffic to existing
         and future regional demands.
Arterial Streets:
1.       Arterials are to be the principal carriers of north-south and east-west traffic through Sub-Plan Areas
         #2 and #3. They typically involve 4-6 lanes, but may occasionally be 2-lanes, depending on the
         amount of traffic capacity required, with landscaped dividers between intersections and left turn
         lanes at each intersection. Sufficient right-of-way is required to include room for landscaped
         corridors along either side. Spacing between the intersections of crossing streets should be in the
         range of 1,000 to preferably 2,500 feet. Spacing between "T" intersections should be at least 800’
         feet. On-street parking is to be prohibited. [See Figure IV-2 for typical right-of-way cross
         sections].
2.       Arterials are to be typically constructed for 4-6 lanes of traffic with left turn lanes provided at
         intersections, although in infrequently arterials may be 2 lanes wide. Development through
         residential areas should be designed to back-on to the Arterial, with ornamental walls and
         landscaping along the right-of-way line. In areas where development fronts the arterial, the design
         for a 2- or 4-lane facility may require a minimum right-of-way of 84'. Typically, this would involve
         four 12' travel lanes, two 8' parking lanes and two 10' minimum planting strips for the
         accommodation of sidewalks and street trees. Commercial sidewalks 10' in width need only be
         provided in retail commercial areas and along the frontages of other pedestrian-intensive uses.
         Street trees should be provided along all Arterial streets. Rights-of-way should be widened at the
         approaches to major intersections to provide space for additional turn lanes. [See Figure IV-3, for
         typical rights-of-way cross sections.]
3.       Arterial streets serving Service Commercial and Industrial areas are to be designed and constructed
         to standards which reflect heavy truck traffic and the need for longer turning radii for trucks at
         intersections. On-street parking should be prohibited.
                                                        1-15

Collector Streets:
1.      Collector streets are to be designed to carry from 500 to 5,000 vehicles per day. Where average
        daily traffic (ADT) is projected to be less than 4,000, a ROW of 60' is usually sufficient. Typically,
        this will involve two 11’ or 12' travel lanes, two 8' parking lanes and two 10' minimum planting
        strips with sidewalks. Sidewalk width need not exceed 4'- 5' except where intensive pedestrian
        traffic is expected such as along school access streets. [See Figure IV-4 for variations.]
2.      Where ADT is projected above 4,000 to 5,000 in residential areas, a 64' right-of-way is usually
        required. In commercial and industrial areas, four lanes of traffic may be required. Where ADT
        is projected above 5,000, with high peak hour traffic, wider cross-sections will be required.
        Rights-of-way may require widening on their approaches to Arterials, Expressways or other
        Collector streets in order to provide suitable turn lanes.
3.      The high costs of converting a deficient Collector street to the appropriate standards required for
        existing and projected traffic should be limited to only those streets where either: a) high current
        and projected volumes of traffic are involved; b) joint funding is possible; c) significant
        contributions of private or assessment district funds are involved as part of the cost of developing
        adjacent lands; or d) where the rate of serious accidents has been high and where hazards to public
        safety are great.
Minor Streets:
1.      To keep Minor street volume within design capacity, street length shall be kept under 1,600 feet
        where possible unless interrupted by an Arterial or Collector street.
2.      Design standards shall permit innovation and flexibility by the developer in relation to land use
        proposals under Planned Unit Development procedures of the Zoning Ordinance or under any
        applicable adopted Specific Plan.
3.      In view of deficiencies in existing Minor streets, the City should consider forms of funding which
        include direct public sources (e.g., through redevelopment or assessment districts) as a means of
        overcoming Minor street deficiencies. Curb, gutter, sidewalk and paving needs along Minor streets
        might alternatively be made the responsibility of affected property owners. Under this policy, the
        City would assume responsibility for engineering services and additional costs occasioned by
        higher standards of street construction and drainage than were involved at the time of original
        street construction. The City might also share equally in total costs where a majority of property
        owners are willing to accept assessment proceedings or another appropriate method of collective
        project financing.
4.      Policies for Minor streets are intended to reflect options for reducing through traffic on minor
        streets between intersections with Arterials. This policy seeks to eliminate the use of Minor streets
        as thoroughfares through residential areas where they extend parallel to nearby Arterials or
        Collectors for many blocks and are often used as substitutes for Arterials or Collectors.
        Illustrations of how this policy may be implemented are shown on Figure IV-6.
                                                      1-16

GOAL NO. 7 - SEISMIC HAZARDS
Goals for achieving and maintaining safety from seismic events include preventing serious injury, loss of
life, serious damage to critical facilities involving large assemblies of people, and loss of continuity in
providing services.
Policies:
1.        The City will inventory all buildings which are unsound under conditions of "moderate" seismic
          activity; buildings having questionable structural resistance should be considered for either
          rehabilitation or demolition. Structures determined by the City's Building Official to be
          structurally unsound are to be reported to the owner and recorded with the County Recorder to
          insure that future owners are made aware of hazardous conditions and risks.
2.        All new building construction shall conform to the latest seismic requirements of the Uniform
          Building Code as a minimum standard.
3.        The present building height limit of 50 feet shall be maintained, with a maximum of four stories.
          This policy should stay in force until such time that high rise construction is desired and capability
          for evacuation and fire fighting in upper stories is possible through the availability of appropriate
          equipment. For Sub-Plan Area #3, at that point in time, the maximum building height shall be 125
          feet, with a maximum of ten stories. For the Central Lathrop area, once the appropriate fire fighting
          equipment is procured for buildings higher than 50’, permitted building heights shall be that noted
          in the Central Lathrop Specific Plan and Design Guidelines.
4.        Facilities necessary for emergency service should be capable of withstanding a maximum credible
          earthquake and remain operational to provide emergency response.
5.        Preliminary soil compaction tests and geotechnical analysis of soil conditions shall be submitted
          as part of the justification for development proposals contained in any Specific Plan.
6.        Soil compaction tests, and geotechnical analysis of soil conditions and behavior under seismic
          conditions shall be required of all subdivisions and of all commercial, industrial and institutional
          structures over 6,000 square feet in area (or in the case of institutional structures, those which hold
          100 or more people).
7.        A preliminary soils report is to be prepared by a registered geo-technical engineer for any
          residential development project, based upon adequate test borings. If the report indicates the
          presence of critically expansive soils or other soil problems which, if not corrected, would lead
          to structural defects, the developer shall provide for and submit the findings of a soil investigation
          of each lot or housing site proposed. The soil investigation shall be prepared by a state-registered
          civil engineer and shall recommend corrective action likely to prevent structural damage to each
          dwelling to be constructed. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, any recommended action
          approved by the Building Official shall be incorporated into the construction of each dwelling.
8.        A preliminary geologic report, prepared by a state-certified engineering geologist and based on
          adequate test borings, shall be submitted to the Building Official for every subdivision, planned
          development or other residential project at the time of submitting a tentative map or other type
          of development application to the City.
                                                       1-17

9.      If the preliminary geologic report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soil
        problems (e.g., potential for liquefaction which if not corrected could lead to structural defects,
        the developer shall provide such additional soils investigation for each development site as may
        be requested by the Building Official. The geologic investigation shall be prepared by a state-
        certified engineering geologist and shall, recommend further corrective action likely to prevent
        structural damage to dwelling units. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, any recommended
        action approved by the Building Official shall be incorporated into site preparation and the
        construction of each dwelling.
10.     The provisions of policy nos. 6 - 9, above, shall be applicable to all commercial, industrial,
        institutional and public development projects.
11.     The City should adopt an Earthquake Disaster Plan in coordination with San Joaquin County and
        local special districts. The Plan should identify hazards that may occur as the result of an
        earthquake of major magnitude. The Plan should be sufficiently broad in scope to include the
        designation of evacuation routes and means to coordinate all local government agencies in assisting
        local residents in the event of a major earthquake, large-scale fire or explosion, or hazardous
        chemical spill or release of hazardous air-borne gas.
12.     All lines which are part of the domestic water distribution system should be looped to assure
        adequate pressure in the event of major fire, earthquake, or explosion. Adequate emergency
        standby power generation capability should be available at water wells to assure water availability
        in the event of a major power failure.
GOAL NO. 8 - PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARDS
Goals for public safety seek to accomplish the following:
1.      The reduction of loss of life or property due to crime, fire, earthquake, flooding or other disasters
        or hazards.
2.      The provision of adequate medical and emergency services to reduce the effects of natural or man-
        made disasters.
3.      The promotion of citizen awareness and preparedness for emergency/disaster situations or potential
        for the incidence of crime.
4.      The implementation of adequate inter-agency disaster planning.
Policies:
1.      The City will continue to give high priority to the support of police protection, and to fire
        suppression and prevention and life safety functions of the Fire District. Ultimate expansion
        of the City's fire service is to include additional stations affording adequate response within a
        maximum of 3-4 minutes to all parts of the urban area.
2.      The City will work to maintain a fire flow standard of 3,000 gpm for all commercial and industrial
        areas of the community, and 1,500 gpm for residential areas, to assure the capability to suppress
                                                     1-18
         urban fires. In strategic areas, the City should provide above ground water storage with capacities
         sufficient to supply the City for required durations.
3.       The City will maintain a street system which is capable of providing access to any fires that may
         develop within the urban area, and which is capable of providing for the adequate evacuation of
         residents in the event of an emergency condition of magnitude.
4.       The City will continue to maintain and update emergency service plans, including plans for
         managing emergency operations, the handling of hazardous materials and the rapid cleanup of
         hazardous materials spills.
5.       The City will continue to cooperate with the County of San Joaquin and other agencies in pre-
         disaster planning activities such as evacuation required in the event of a serious breach of an
         upstream dam capable of flooding the community.
6.       The City will seek to reduce the risks and potential for hazards to the public through planning and
         zoning practices and regulations which avoid hazardous land use relationships, and by the
         continued and timely adoption of new-edition building and fire codes.
7.       Neighborhood watch programs will be encouraged in all residential areas of the City.
GOAL NO. 8 - NOISE HAZARDS
The Goals of the Noise Section of the Hazard Management Element of the General Plan are to protect
citizens from the harmful effects of exposure to excessive noise, and to protect the economic base of the
City by preventing the encroachment of incompatible land uses near noise-producing roadways, industries,
the railroad, and other sources.
Policies:
1.       Areas within the City shall be designated as noise-impacted if exposed to existing or projected
         future noise levels exterior to buildings exceeding 60 dB CNEL or the performance standards pre-
         scribed in Table VI-1.
2.       New development of residential or other noise sensitive land uses will not be permitted in noise-
         impacted areas unless effective mitigation measures are incorporated into project designs to reduce
         noise to the following levels:
         a.       Noise sources preempted from local control, such as railroad and highway traffic:
                  - 65 dB CNEL or less in outdoor activity areas;
                  - 45 dB CNEL within interior living spaces or other noise-sensitive interior spaces.
                  - Where it is not possible to achieve reductions of exterior noise to 60 dB CNEL or less
                       by using the best available and practical noise reduction technology, an exterior noise
                       level of up to 65 dB CNEL will be allowed.
                  - Under no circumstances will interior noise levels be allowed to exceed 45 dB CNEL
                       with windows and doors closed.
         b.       For noise from other sources, such as local industries:
                                                      1-19
           -    60 dB CNEL or less in outdoor activity areas;
           -    45 dB CNEL or less within interior living spaces, plus the performance standards
                contained in Table VI-1.
3. New development of industrial, commercial or other noise generating land uses will not be
   permitted if resulting noise levels will exceed 60 dB CNEL in areas containing residential or other
   noise-sensitive land uses. Additionally, new noise generating land uses which are not preempted
   from local noise regulation by the State of California will not be permitted if resulting noise levels
   will exceed the performance standards contained in Table VI-1 in areas containing residential or
   other noise-sensitive land uses.
4. Noise level criteria applied to land uses other than residential or other noise-sensitive uses shall
   be consistent with the recommendations of the California Office of Noise Control.
5. New equipment and vehicles purchased by the City shall comply with noise level performance
   standards consistent with the best available noise reduction technology.

     GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES; GOALS, MAJOR
        POLICIES AND MAJOR PROPOSALS OF THE GENERAL PLAN
THE BASIC PLANNING CONCEPT - REDEVELOPING AND EXPANDING LATHROP AS A
"NEW TOWN"
From the outset of the General Plan Program during the spring of 1990, a fundamental realization emerged
that the people of Lathrop enjoy a unique opportunity to plan and manage future development in a manner
seldom available to other communities in California or the Nation. In effect, the General Plan calls for
creating a new town with a population of about 30,000 by the year 2012. The new urban complex would
contain all of the physical improvements and services required to serve that population, along with an
economic base in industry and commerce capable of fully supporting anticipated population growth.
Historically, the community of Lathrop developed primarily as an industrial center rather than as a city
having an industrial base. Other than scattered industrial development, Lathrop's land use pattern is
comprised mostly of modest older housing areas that concentrated north of Lathrop Road and along the west
side of the Southern Pacific Railroad, and the more recently constructed housing areas east of I-5 and south
of Lathrop Road. Commercial development is limited to neighborhood and highway commercial use at the
Lathrop Road and Louise Avenue interchanges with Interstate 5. Lathrop does not have a downtown, and
lacks the availability of many of the private and semi-public services that may be found in most small towns
in rural California that began as cities.
Given this legacy, Lathrop's future as a city lays in its ability to create and manage a "new town" that takes
advantage of the City's strategic location in Northern California in relation to powerful dynamics in
employment, housing, trade and transportation that are reshaping the patterns of metropolitan expansion in
the San Francisco Bay Area, the Northern San Joaquin Valley and the Southern Sacramento Valley.
The basic development policies for this new town plan have been developed through extensive study and
discussion by a Citizens Advisory Committee and the City Council, close cooperation with affected
landowners, and review with staff of the Local Agency Formation Commission, San Joaquin County and the
nearby cities of Stockton, Manteca and Tracy. A partnership approach has been followed where major
property owners have organized and jointly examined (with the City) alternatives for all of the property
within the planning area.
FACTORS WHICH SUPPORT THE NEW TOWN PLANNING APPROACH
The factors which support the case for a new town approach to future development include strategic
location, accessibility, economic potential, relationship to surrounding communities, and environmental
resources. These and other factors are described below:
Strategic Location, Accessibility and Economic Potential:
1.       Lathrop's planning area sits astride one of the major freeways in the State and the major
         north-south freeway along the entire West Coast. Interstate 5 connects with British Columbia
         and Mexico, and intercepts every east-west interstate highway in the Pacific Northwest, and in the
         states of California, Nevada, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona. I-5 connects with the
                                                       2-1
   Stockton and Sacramento metropolitan areas to the north, the San Francisco Bay Region to the
   west, and the Los Angeles and San Diego regions in Southern California. State Route 120
   provides a connection with U.S. Highway 99 four miles to the east which interconnects the chain
   of metropolitan areas of the San Joaquin Valley, including Modesto, Merced, Fresno-Clovis,
   Visalia-Tulare-Porterville, and Bakersfield. [See Figure II-1]
2. Within Northern California, Lathrop lays at or near a crossroads of transportation facilities,
   including intercontinental railways, interstate highways, Delta waterways, an international airport,
   an interstate power intertie, and natural gas pipelines. Figure II-2 shows that Lathrop literally is
   in the center of the Northern California transportation and metropolitan complex.
3. The Central Valley economy is one of the most robust in the State. It has higher population
   growth rates than do the larger coastal metro areas, the North Coast or the mountainous areas of the
   State. Population projections by the State Department of Finance anticipate that growth will
   continue for the foreseeable future. Part of the strong housing demand is due to the Valley's natural
   advantages of pleasant living conditions, the nearness of the Delta for water-oriented recreation, and
   easy access to the recreation opportunities of the Sierra. While some of this demand is from
   continuing growth in the local economies of the Stockton and Modesto metro regions, much of it is
   also due to the lack of reasonably priced housing, and to the traffic congestion and densely
   populated conditions in the San Francisco Bay Region. The unavailability of adequate housing to
   serve the rapid employment growth occurring in the Pleasanton-Dublin-San Ramon-Livermore
   (Tri-Valleys) area is becoming increasingly important to the local housing market.
4. Convenient access from other parts of the State, and access to the San Joaquin River and the
   Delta, offers significant opportunities for creating recreation opportunities for the region
   which can generate considerable employment and revenue for the local economy. Boat
   docking and other harbor-related commercial recreation activities are proposed along the edges of
   Stewart Tract next to a town center. These will create a synergistic economic relationship between
   land and water activities. The San Joaquin River channel which forms part of the western edge of
   the Planning Area provides boating access to Delta waterways as it flows northwesterly to its
   junction with the Sacramento River at Antioch.
5. The railroads offer a prospect for Lathrop becoming a hub for expanded interregional rail
   passenger service. This prospect has been improved recently by voter approval of statewide
   transportation bond and tax issues, and by studies being conducted by the State Transportation
   Agency as a basis for developing high speed inter-regional rail corridors.
6. A potential exists for the attraction of region-serving commercial centers. In addition to the
   Stewart Tract town center and other commercial recreation attractions, other region-serving centers
   could include a factory outlet center, a regional office center and a research and development
   employment complex. The latter two centers have potential because of the need for sites close to
   areas where many employees can find affordable housing. The potential for region-serving
   commercial recreation has already been proven with the water recreation center located at Oakwood
   Lake in the southern part of Sub-Plan Area #1.
                                                 2-2

                 2-4
         It will be a number of years before new residential growth will occur sufficient to justify the
         development of conventional community and regional shopping centers. This will occur slowly
         both because development of the new town will occur in phases and because of competing major
         centers in Stockton, Manteca and Tracy. In the interim, specialized centers such as the Factory
         Stores at Vacaville, highway commercial centers like the Nut Tree and Anderson's, auto dealer
         plazas, auto care centers and business service complexes should be considered. Commercial
         characteristics will continue to evolve over the next 20 years as they have over the last 20.
         Consequently, there is a challenge to accommodate the types of centers for which a market exists
         today without closing the door on opportunities for more specialized centers which the population
         of the City and surrounding communities can support in future years.
7.       The potential for attracting industry continues, provided that new industries are free of
         conditions that could adversely affect air and water quality and the public health. New industrial
         opportunities will include light industry, warehousing and distribution, incubator facilities for
         housing fledgling industries, truck and container terminals, business parks (with multi-tenant
         buildings), high technology, regional offices, and utility, contractor and service commercial
         buildings and yards. A variety of industrial and office environments will also be needed.
Opportunity to Work with a Few Landowners Controlling Large Acreage:
The vast majority of acreage within the planning area west of I-5 is owned and controlled by relatively few
owners. Their need to cooperate with each other and the City in preparing and executing plans for private
development has been emphasized throughout the period of General Plan preparation. The need for such
cooperative effort is dictated by the realities of developing adequate systems for water supply, sewage
disposal and surface water drainage, and by the realities that maximum economic benefits will flow from a
well-planned and phased development process. For the City, this approach poses a unique opportunity to
create a new (and revitalized) City that will reflect the best traditions of community building.
The ability of the City of Lathrop to work with but a few landowners to create a new urban complex is
indeed a major factor in support of the expanded Planning Area and in amending the City's Sphere of
Influence boundaries. The opportunity exists to create a highly efficient and exceptionally pleasant
community environment, devoid of many of the problems associated with established communities which
are being thrust into roles of rapidly accommodating new population while at the same time trying to
overcome the deficiencies of an existing urban pattern and to restructure that pattern as the core of a much
larger community.
Environmental Resources:
Lathrop's expanded planning area offers a variety of environmental resources and conditions that lend
themselves to the creation of a new town. In addition to the San Joaquin River environment, there are
scenic vistas of the Coast Range and the Sierra, a predominance of Class III soils, recently strengthened
river levees which protect the lands west of I-5 to the River from the ravages of a 100 year intensity flood,
and prevailing winds which frequently flush the air envelope of pollutants.
Even the potential for negative environmental impacts cries for a comprehensive approach to develop
feasible means of mitigation within a framework of new town planning policies and techniques. As
compared to the conventional approach of adding population and housing to surrounding communities a few
subdivisions at a time, the economies inherent in new town development provide financial leverage and
feasibility to the wise management and protection of environmental resources. Important examples include
the assurance of adequate water supply and water conservation through reuse of treated sewage effluent and
pre-treatment by industry to where the total amount of water needed for the community will be substantially
                                                        2-5
less than now required by agricultural use. Other examples include the enhancement of wildlife habitat,
reducing the impacts of traffic on air quality through multi-modal transportation, protection from the
potential for liquefaction of foundation soils due to earthquakes, and enhancement of public access to
recreation resources of the San Joaquin River and Delta.
Revitalizing the Existing Community
Lathrop's existing urban pattern is confined to lands which lay between Interstate 5 and the Western Pacific
Railroad. Older housing areas which comprised the original settlement are in need of improvement to
public service infrastructure and housing quality. Through policies of the General Plan which seek a sound
economic base and tax base in support of residential expansion, it will be possible to progressively achieve
the revitalization of blighted properties to where many existing residents and land owners will benefit
significantly from the City's planning program. In some cases, benefits will be realized through the
revitalization of properties under programs of a Lathrop Redevelopment Agency. In other cases, benefits
will result from important changes in land use policy which will create higher land values.
A City Capability to Meet the Task of Governance:
As a brand new city, Lathrop is unfettered in its capability to think and act in a manner which will bring the
concept of a new town into reality, and to provide the levels of public service that will be equal to the task.
From the beginning of its planning program, the City defined its commitment to do the right job the first
time out, recognizing that there is little room for error.
ANTICIPATED GROWTH IN POPULATION, HOUSING AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
Population and Housing
Lathrop's population is expected to reach approximately 30,000 over the 20 year planning period to 2012.
This population (an increase of 23,000 over 1991) is expected in response to the dynamic economy of the
Central Valley as well as from continuing inflow of commuters from the Bay Area, Silicon Valley, "Tri-
Valley" and Sacramento employment growth centers. Just how much residential building is likely to occur
in the City is a matter of some conjecture. In the final analysis, it will depend on a variety of factors
including the quality of housing to be constructed, and the management, marketing and pricing skills of the
developers in meeting a constantly changing market and strong competition. In 1990, the Census Bureau
reported Lathrop with a population of 6,841 residing in 1,927 households and 2,040 housing units. For
purposes of projection, the population at the beginning of the planning period is assumed at 7,000.
There currently are at least three different projections of the City's potential population and residential
growth over the next 20 years -- 18,000, 26,300 to 31,800 and 29,000 to 33,000.1 These projections are
shown on Figure II-3 and in Table II-1. The three projections are as follows:
  1
         A fourth scenario was examined based on a combined population holding capacity of Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2 of
         55,000, with urbanization occurring out to the northern and western limits of the Lathrop Planning Area. This fourth
         scenario was dropped when it became clear that the magnitude of local economic development would not support such
         a level of growth except over a period of perhaps 40 years.
                                                               2-6

POPULATION AND HOUSING TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS
                     2-8
1.       San Joaquin County Planning Department's 1989 Update of the General Plan for the Lathrop Area:
         County staff projected an increase from 5,630 people and 1,900 housing units in 1987 to 18,000
         people and 6,740 housing units in the year 2010.
2.       The "Keiser Report" released in June, 1991: Prepared as part of the County's study of six
         potential "new cities", the report estimates a 20 year population increase at 26,300-31,800, with
         9,650-11,675 housing units.
3.       Review of 1970-1990 experience in six moderate-sized cities in the region: The experience of
         Ceres, Folsom, Lodi, Manteca, Tracy and Turlock indicate that all averaged 400-600 housing units
         per year under aggressive conditions of growth for a decade or more, with this level occurring
         75% of the time. Assuming an aggressive economic development program for Lathrop, the City
         could develop an average of 500 housing units per year for 20 years. This rate would result in
         a total of 11,000 housing units and a population in the range of 29,000 to 33,000.2
For purposes of the Lathrop General Plan, the third projection has been selected. By the year 2012, the City
could have a population close to 30,000, involving 10,720 housing units. This is based on a housing mix of
7,370 single family units (70.3%), 620 multi-plex units (duplexes, triplexes, and four-plexes), 2,260
apartments and 300 mobile homes. On an annual basis, the survey of the six cities indicated the
construction of 500 units, with an approximate housing mix of 300 single family detached, 40 single family
attached townhouses, patio homes, etc., 30 multi-plex units and 130 apartments or condominium type
rentals.
Economic Activity
Employment:
As a recently established municipality with a relatively small population, Lathrop is unusual in having an
established employment base. This base includes:
         -    The Sharpe Depot.
         -    Several large industries, including Libby-Owens-Ford and Simplot.
         -     An active developer constructing the 535 acre "Crossroads" industrial/commercial park.
The San Joaquin County Planning Department and Council of Governments have estimated that the City
had about 5,300 "local" jobs in 1987, with about 1,400 at the Sharpe Depot, 2,400 in manufacturing and
1,500 in other types of employment. The County anticipates that employment will reach 11,500 in the next
20 years -- an increase of 6,100 jobs or 113%. Growth in local employment is expected to be strongly
influenced by two elements:
         1. The effectiveness with which new region-serving industrial and commercial development can
              be attracted.
  2
         This growth rate would require that Lathrop attract 15%-20% of all new housing occurring in the southern part of San
         Joaquin County, in competition with already established building programs in Manteca, Tracy, and Ripon, and possibly
         in competition with the planned new communities of Mountain House and New Jerusalem.
                                                              2-9
         2. The amount of population and housing growth which occurs in the City. Under typical
              conditions in the region, between 60 and 90 new jobs accompany the establishment of 100 new
              housing units. This would add from 300 to 450 jobs each year. Based on the housing
              projection described above, Lathrop would typically experience employment growth in the
              range of 5,220 to 7,830. The County's employment projection of 6,100 new jobs is near the
              middle of this range.
Lathrop currently has about 8.5% of the manufacturing employment in San Joaquin County. It can expect
to attract between 5% and 10% of the County's future industrial development.
Future service, business park and research, and development employment can be expected to rise
significantly with development of the Stewart Tract and Central Lathrop employment centers. Between
1983 and 1988, the service industry generated 37% of California's employment growth. Services had the
fastest growth rate (30%) of the major employment categories; the rate was more than 40% greater than the
average employment growth rate of 21%, and was nearly three times the 11% growth rate of manufacturing.
THE LATHROP GENERAL PLAN INTENDED AS AN "END-STATE" PLAN
For most cities, a General Plan is a depiction and description of future development policy for a given
period of time -- usually 20 years. About every 3-5 years (depending on local conditions), the Plan is
amended to maintain a 20 year perspective. Under these conditions, the General Plan usually calls for an
ever increasing population and urban pattern, without suggesting that there may be an ultimate limit to city
size. For Lathrop, however, the General Plan establishes some relatively finite limits to ultimate urban
expansion, with fairly definite future boundaries. Lathrop's planning area boundaries are nearly co-terminus
with the City's proposed sphere-of-influence. A difference exists only between the north boundary of the
urban pattern in SPA #2 at the line of Squires Road and the north boundary of the planning area near
Bowman Road. In effect, the sphere-of-influence boundaries become a future urban limit line that contains
the urban pattern that may emerge 20 or more years from now. With the possible exception of lands north
of the urban limit line in SPA #2, it is not envisioned that the City would extend beyond these boundaries
within the scope of this General Plan.
Constraints to Urban Expansion
Lathrop's planning area boundaries are to be considered relatively "fixed" for very important reasons
pertaining to the logical spheres-of-influence of neighboring cities and as a means to assure the preservation
of environmental qualities and amenities of the sub-region. As shown on Figure II-2, Lathrop is located in
the near-center of the triangle formed by Stockton, Modesto and Tracy, and is almost adjacent to Manteca
on the east. The spheres of influence of these communities constrain Lathrop from future expansion to the
north, east and southwest. And the environmental qualities of lands to the northwest, particularly for
continued agricultural use and fish & wildlife habitat, strongly argue for containment of future urban
expansion within the boundaries depicted on Lathrop's General Plan Diagram.
Other physical constraints also influence the direction, extent and pace with which a community can grow.
Most common of these factors is the availability or capability to expand wastewater, water and storm
drainage facilities. Lathrop currently has a capability for domestic water supply which is limited to existing
and future development within the existing City Limits (all of Sub-Plan Area #1 north of Route 120 to Roth
Road. Limitations to available capacity in Manteca's regional wastewater treatment plant do not permit
urban expansion west of Interstate 5. Storm drainage fares better in that positive off-site drainage is
provided to the San Joaquin River for the existing urban area. However, any significant urban expansion
will require major addition(s) to the existing collection system.
                                                       2-10
Most cities must grapple with the cost and problem of trying to adapt their older existing infrastructure to
meet the needs of new growth. This process can be both time consuming and very expensive, with the cost
being borne by the user in the form of various kinds of development fees. Because the City of Lathrop can
create infrastructure from scratch, it can plan for a "design" population. This avoids the problems inherent
in trying to increase existing systems to handle capacities beyond their design. Also, use of modern
materials and construction methods will ease installation and on-going maintenance. Once complete, utility
infrastructure will be both new and efficient allowing for the competitive rates needed to attract industrial
and commercial users.
GOALS OF THE GENERAL PLAN
The goals of the General Plan are intended to set forth achievable ends which give meaning to the directions
for policy and action provided by the General Plan. They express the commitment of Lathrop's citizens to
the wise management of the environment. Goals express the highest aims to which the people aspire and
which should be reflected in the day-to-day conduct of the people's business. They also express what the
people are capable of achieving and what they are willing to work to achieve, over time.
Goal No. 1: Balancing the Social and Economic Costs and Benefits of Urbanization
The General Plan emphasizes the development of job-creating and tax revenue creating activities during the
early phases of development as a matter of primary importance to achieving other goals of the Plan. Despite
pressures and demands that are certain to emerge in order to build housing units at a rapid pace, a clear
policy of the General Plan is to monitor the pace and quantity of housing construction to assure a reasonable
balance with the growth of Lathrop's economic base.
A start at building an economic base sufficient to support housing development has been made through
approval of the Crossroads industrial and commercial park proposals at the southeast quadrant of the Louise
Avenue interchange with Interstate 5. Since the Crossroads project has been able to satisfy requirements for
water and sewer services, vigorous promotion of commercial and industrial development is possible before
new sub-regional water and sewerage system facilities are available for the development of lands west of
Interstate 5.
Goal No. 2: Equality of Opportunity
The creation of growth centers west of Interstate 5 and the rehabilitation of the existing community east of I-
5 offers unique opportunities to assure equality in opportunity for existing residents, for racial and ethnic
minorities and for people of low and moderate income in the provision and availability of public services
and facilities and in meeting employment and housing needs. Insofar as reasonably may be possible,
policies and proposals of the General Plan are intended to provide for and support the attainment of such
equality of opportunity.
Goal No. 3: Community Identity
Just as the loss of personal identity can contribute to emotional disorder, so can failure to establish and
maintain community identity lead to instability and disorder within the community-at-large. At the very
least, the lack of community identity can stifle community pride. At its worst, it can foster destructive
competition between the old center and the new and lose the identity for both areas in the process. It is a
goal of the General Plan that the old and new centers of development, which lay east and west of I-5
respectively, make a strong contribution toward the identity of the entire City of Lathrop. At the same time,
residents of all Sub-Plan areas are to be encouraged to develop a sense of pride and identity with their
immediate neighborhoods.
                                                      2-11
Goal No. 4: Quality in the Form, Design and Functions of the Urban Area
The building of a new growth center west of Interstate 5 and the rehabilitation of the existing growth center
must not and cannot be approached as a collection of subdivisions and commercial and industrial
enterprises, to be built out as rapidly as the private sector may desire. The City of Lathrop has a unique
opportunity and responsibility to control the timing and phasing of development; to create and hold more
directly to an overall town design; and to withhold the provision of essential public services if necessary to
gain the level of cooperation required of developers and landowners to assemble land and proposed units of
development in conformance with the town design.
New development and redevelopment is to reflect quality in community design and image. Development is
to be phased to create a community which exhibits the best that community building and management
experience will allow.
Goal No. 5: Enhancing the Quality of Life and Biological Resources
It is a goal of the General Plan to enhance the quality of living by preventing the degradation of the natural
environment, and by taking steps to off-set and alleviate the effects of that degradation which already has
occurred or which cannot be avoided. Biological resources are to be protected and preserved. Where
feasible, natural conditions should be emulated as features of the community's systems of public and private
open space.
Goal No. 6: Transportation and Circulation
It is a goal of the General Plan to guide and provide for the development of an integrated system of
transportation and internal circulation, and to provide access to other parts of San Joaquin County and the
region. This goal is intended to benefit all citizens of Lathrop, including the young, the elderly and the
physically handicapped, by seeking the following:
          -   Increased transportation safety
          -   The efficient movement of people and goods.
          -   Lower vehicle operating costs.
          -   Lower vehicle miles traveled with consequent reduction in vehicle emissions.
          -   Economy in street construction and maintenance.
          -   A circulation system correlated and consistent with the land use patterns fostered by the
              General Plan.
          -   Avoidance of the disruption of residential areas caused by through traffic on minor streets.
          -   Protection of rights-of-way needed for future Arterial and Collector street widening in
              developed areas.
          -   Access to boat launching and docking facilities.
Goal No. 7: Seismic Hazards
Goals for achieving and maintaining safety from seismic events include preventing serious injury, loss of
life, serious damage to critical facilities involving large assemblies of people, and loss of continuity in
providing services.
                                                      2-12
Goal No. 8: Public Safety Hazards
It is a goal of the General Plan to provide for public safety, including:
          -   The reduction of loss of life or property due to crime, fire, earthquake, flooding or other
              disasters or hazards.
          -   The provision of adequate medical and emergency services to reduce the effects of natural
              or man-made disasters.
          -   The promotion of citizen awareness and preparedness for emergency/disaster situations
              or potential for the incidence of crime.
          -   The implementation of adequate inter-agency disaster planning.
Goal No. 9: Noise Hazards
It is a goal of the General Plan are to protect citizens from the harmful effects of exposure to excessive
noise, and to protect the economic base of the City by preventing the encroachment of noise sensitive land
uses by such sources of adverse noise as vehicular freeway and street traffic, railroad traffic and industrial
operations.
Goal No. 10: Water Supply, Wastewater and Surface Water Management
It is a goal of the General Plan to provide for a secure source of fresh water for existing and future residents,
and for the reuse of wastewater and surface water so that there is not net increase in water pollution,
including point and non-point sources.
Other Goals
Other goals of the Plan more particularly relate to the topic of housing which is covered in Part IV-C of this
Plan document.
MAJOR POLICIES AND PROPOSALS OF THE GENERAL PLAN
The major policies and proposals presented in the remainder of Part II are of overriding significance, and
serve as working translations of the preceding statements of goals.
Annexation through Phased Development
The annexation of lands to the outer boundaries of urbanization depicted by the General Plan Diagram is to
be pursued through development phasing which seeks to avoid a disjointed pattern of urbanization, to avoid
creating unnecessary conflicts with continuing agricultural operations, and to avoid adverse impacts on the
provision and maintenance of public services and facilities. Annexation is not intended as a means to foster
the premature development of lands within the Lathrop Planning Area. However, annexation may be
viewed as an opportunity to assure that land will ultimately be developed in accordance with policies of the
Lathrop General Plan even though development soon after annexation may not be intended either by the
landowner or the City.
Limitations Upon the Timing of Development
While development may occur over a 20 year period or more, the rate of development will be determined in
large part by the availability of and capability for financing public services and facilities. The addition of
another 23,000 people will most likely begin in the next 2-3 years, depending on how soon the City is able
                                                       2-13
to secure a permanent source of surface water to meet municipal and industrial needs, and assuming that the
first stage of a new sewage treatment plant west of I-5 is financially assured.
The City's ability to stay abreast of its financial and service capabilities will require continuous monitoring.
Once a system is in place, it will be relatively easy to identify current conditions and to estimate the
probable impacts of new development proposals. Rather than adhering to an arbitrarily fixed percentage of
annual growth as a matter of policy, it will be the City's responsibility to manage the growth rate in relation
to physical and financial capability for municipal service while being consistent with all applicable policies
and proposals of the General Plan.
Maintaining Reasonable Balance in Housing Type
Residential expansion should reflect the considerable variety of housing types that comprise the residential
market of the region. In addition to conventional single-family detached housing of 1,500-2,500 sq. ft.,
there is a strong market for small lot detached and attached (townhouse) single-family purchase housing for
entry level buyers as an alternative to multi-family rentals. As an alternative to large multi-family rental
projects, there is a strong market for owner-occupied multi-plexes. Other alternatives are the purchase and
rental condominium, the single story garden apartment and well-designed mobile home park. As an overall
standard, the City should seek to maintain a 70% to 30% ratio in the combined variety of single-family units
provided as compared to the combined variety of multi-family units. This percentage is a fair reflection of
regional characteristics of housing market demand, and will assure that Lathrop will meet its fair share of
the regional market for housing to meet the needs of low and low-moderate income households.
Another dimension of the housing market will be the demand generated by the large-scale Stewart Tract and
Central Lathrop employment centers and the growing demand for retirement-oriented housing. This
housing demand will require variety in density, style, size and amenities to meet the needs of a new
population.
Achieving Visual and Functional Quality in New Development
Several related polices are necessary to assure quality in the functional and aesthetic characteristics of new
development, as follows:
1.        Architectural design review should be required of all Planned Developments (PD's), and of all
          multi-family, office, commercial, institutional and industrial uses.
2.        Eligibility for density bonuses under Planned Development applications should be based on
          objective criteria to be included in the zoning ordinance.
3.        Except for density bonuses mandated by State law or by voluntary proposals for households of
          very low, low and moderate income, density bonuses for Planned Developments within Low
          Density residential areas should be prohibited. Voluntary proposals which do not meet State
          standards for a mandated bonus would still be given consideration for the granting of a bonus
          equal to 10% of the total number of housing units proposed.
4.        Features of the urban open space system are to include neighborhood and community recreation-
          parks, pedestrian corridors along arterial streets and boulevards, recreation corridors along natural
          and man-made drainages and waterways, recreation corridors which connect with major
          components of the school and park system, a municipal golf course and a municipal marina.
          Neighborhood parks should be adjacent to and integrated with elementary school sites as well as
                                                        2-14
         being freestanding. Community parks should be adjacent to and integrated with high school sites,
         as well as being freestanding.
5.       Major components of the regional open space system are to include a park and recreation corridor
         along the San Joaquin River, natural waterways and riparian vegetation, a pedestrian and bike trail
         linking all three Sub-Plan areas, and private marinas open to the public along the San Joaquin River.
         Access to trails should be designed so as to prevent use by motor vehicles, including motorcycles,
         motorbikes and similar off-road vehicles.
         An important component of the open space system will be landscaped corridors on either side of
         expressways and some arterial streets as a means to buffer residential areas from traffic noise and
         glare. These corridors may vary in width and design to accommodate such recreation pursuits as
         walking, biking, golf, and nature study. A corridor for eventually combining bike and
         pedestrian circulation is proposed separate from the Arterial street system.
Residential Features of the Plan
A concept basic to the design of residential areas in Sub-Plan Areas # 1 and 2 is to create residential
"villages". Each village may be served by a Village Center with a convenience-oriented (neighborhood
level) shopping center and community services, one or more schools and recreation-parks centrally placed to
the neighborhoods they serve, and bordered by components of the community open space system. Villages
would be defined by elements of the major street system and would be comprised of two or more
neighborhoods accommodating a variety of housing types and with aggregate populations in the range of
7,000 to 10,000.
In addition to the Village Center, easily accessible facilities may be provided for the range of public and
private "community" services needed close to places of residence. Examples include churches, nursery
schools, childcare centers, senior centers, clubs, convalescent homes, clinics and professional offices. These
uses may be grouped to create a village center within walking distance of a majority of residents served.
Community uses of this type typically require 20% to 25% of the developed area of a community, but rarely
is the need given the planning attention it deserves. For lack of a proper planning context, such community
services often have to settle for less than optimum locations within the entire community which may be in
conflict with other more intense and incompatible types of land use. The Village Concept of development is
intended to overcome these limitations.
Each village and village center could have its own distinctive architectural character, with major activity
centers connected by pedestrian-oriented open space corridors either along or separate from the street
system. This approach is important to achieving identity among residential areas. The scale and variety of
shopping and community services that could be found in each village center will be influenced in part by the
economic characteristics and housing densities of the residential areas to be served.
Furthermore, in Sub-Plan #2, residential uses may be a part of the Residential/Mixed Use designation.
These areas are located in the core of Central Lathrop. These dwellings will be higher density in nature and
may be mixed vertically or horizontally with the Main Street District commercial uses, or be a single use.
This designation provides for a vibrant and lively mixed use district in which local serving uses and spaces,
and employment opportunities are immediately accessible to residents.
The zoning designations for SPA #3 will allow for the creation of a single, larger town center that will
provide retail shopping and services for the ultimate population of approximately 25,000 residents on
Stewart Tract. It will also attract other Lathrop residents and others in the region for shopping and
entertainment. The objective is to create a mixed-use, citywide attractor that is occupied by daytime
                                                      2-15
workers and nighttime residents.
A town center on the Stewart Tract will provide retail opportunities for nearby residents and the
employment center daytime workforce population. For the residents within the residential districts
elsewhere on Stewart Tract, small convenience-oriented (neighborhood level) shopping and services will
be available in keeping with the goal of encouraging pedestrian rather than vehicular travel.
On Stewart Tract, the distinct character of the various neighborhoods will be created by their orientation
to the perimeter natural environment or the internal waterway features, rather than their orientation to a
village shopping center. Perimeter river-oriented homes will have direct access to the river. Residents in
internal neighborhoods will gain easy access to lake edges and a communitywide trail system, along
which parks will be developed. As in SPA’s #1 and #2, each SPA #3 neighborhood’s key activities or
places will be linked by park-like pedestrian corridors.
Commercial Features of the Plan
Commercial features of the Plan include the designation of the following categories:
         -    Neighborhood Commercial (in SPA #1 and #2)
         -    Village Commercial (in SPA's #2 and #3)
         -    Community Commercial
         -    Residential/Mixed Use (in SPA #2)
              Specialty Commercial
              Office Commercial
              Office Commercial/Variable Residential/Wastewater Treatment Plant
         -    Regional Commercial
         -    Service Commercial
         -    Freeway Commercial
         -    Recreation Commercial
         -    Waterfront Commercial
         -    Town Center
         -    Employment Center
Neighborhood, Village, Specialty, Residential/Mixed Use and Community Commercial centers are intended
to provide retail, office and personal services. Regional Commercial areas will provide for region-serving
levels of activity, including regional shopping, convention center, and headquarters offices. An employment
center located on Stewart Tract will provide up to 6 million square feet for office, administrative/back/office
uses and research and development. On Stewart Tract recreation commercial land, and in the employment
center, theme parks would also be appropriate uses. Office Commercial and Office Commercial/Variable
Residential/Wastewater Treatment Plant uses are permitted within the Central Lathrop area. These uses will
permit various office, regional and local retail, research and development, and similar uses to occur.
Service Commercial areas provide for the location of such service-connected uses as auto sales and repairs,
building materials supply, equipment service, and storage. Two basic sub-categories involve large and
small land users. Large land users typically provide services to other business and to industry, while smaller
land users cater to the needs of the residential household. Freeway Commercial uses would cater primarily
to the needs of the highway traveler, including hotels, motels, inns, restaurants and auto services.
                                                       2-16

Industrial Features of the Plan
Industrial proposals are confined to lands east of Interstate 5 and north of State Route 120 in areas
traditionally planned (and partially developed) for such use, where rail and highway accessibility is assured
and where conflicts with established and planned residential areas can be avoided.
Public and Institutional Facility Features of the Plan
Educational facilities provided for by the Plan include public elementary and secondary schools. All
educational facilities would be connected by the system of open space recreation corridors which also
connect Village residential areas with major commercial and recreation activity centers of the community.
A Civic Center is proposed along the westerly extension of Lathrop Road or on Stewart Tract in West
Lathrop. The Center typically would include administrative offices of the City and school districts and
branch offices of the County, along with such cultural facilities as a community auditorium, library and
theater for the performing arts. Such public uses as branch libraries and clinics could also be included
within Village Centers.
Provision is made for a major medical complex along the west side of I-5 between the Lathrop Rd. and
Louise Avenue interchanges. The complex would provide for public and private medical services, including
a full range of both generalized and specialized services, as appropriate. Specific uses might include general
and specialized hospitals, clinics, medical and nurses training, doctor's offices, laboratories and nursing
homes arranged in accordance with a carefully devised plan and program which embraces the medical
service and health care needs of San Joaquin County and the region.
Transportation Features of the Plan
A combination of freeway, street, transit, bikeway and pedestrian facilities are proposed for the movement
of people and goods within the community and between Lathrop and metropolitan centers to the north,
south and west. An important objective of the total transportation system is to de-emphasize reliance on the
automobile to the extent possible while continuing to recognize its practical necessity as a dominant mode
of surface transportation.
Freeway segments important to the Plan include I-5, I-205, Route 120 and Route 99 providing for
interregional highway travel to all parts of the State and points out of state. A system of multi-lane limited
access arterials comprises the core of the street circulation system connecting major sectors of the
community, reinforced by a system of Arterial and Collector streets providing access to all activity centers
and residential villages. Local bus transit would be accommodated by Arterial street corridors, connecting
major activity centers throughout the City. A system of bikeways and pedestrian walks would be included
within a system of community and village open space corridors. Bikers would use the street system to move
east and west through I-5 interchanges.
A major proposal of the transportation system is to provide for rail transit connection between the
community and the San Francisco Bay Area to the west, and with the Stockton and Sacramento
metropolitan areas to the north. Another important proposal is to maintain an option for accommodating the
right-of-way for a high speed interregional rail connection between Southern California and the San
Francisco Bay Area. The more localized transit connection with the Bay Area will be an important means
of access to Stewart Tract. A commuter rail station exists in Lathrop for the Altamont Commuter Express
(ACE) train. The original ACE train plan called for that temporary Lathrop station to be relocated to
Stewart Tract. If a transit terminal is built alongside the former SPRR right-of-way close to the Stewart
Tract employment center, these parking areas might also be made available for weekend transit users.
                                                      2-17
Ultimately, this location would allow counter commuters to use the ACE train to reach the Stewart Tract
employment center from the Bay Area.
Lathrop enjoys ease of access to the Stockton Municipal Airport for jet passenger and freight service and for
general aviation. Over time, growth in passenger and freight service can be expected as metropolitan
airports at San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose approach levels of traffic saturation.
Features of the Urban Open Space System
Major components are to include:
1.       A system of community-wide open space corridors throughout the entire urban area, including
         sections that border boundary levees along the San Joaquin River and important sloughs, sections
         along the freeway and expressway systems and sections along the Southern Pacific and Union
         Pacific Railroads.
2.       Wildlife habitat, including wetlands, to be created for the disposal of treated wastewater, and to
         enhance resource management characteristics of the planning area.
3.       Golf courses, community recreation parks, public and private marinas and boat landing facilities,
         and recreation open space corridors connecting with all major activity centers of the community.
         An interconnected system of waterways through part of the urban complex is also proposed.
4.       Neighborhood recreation-parks adjacent to school sites.
5.       Local pedestrian/bikeway corridors within residential neighborhoods which connect with the
         community recreation corridor system.
6.       Irrigation of open space corridors and golf courses through re-use of treated wastewater.
7.       The protection of areas along either side of the I-5 merges having potential for sand and gravel
         extraction.
Redevelopment and Revitalization
The City should create a Redevelopment Agency and adopt a Redevelopment Plan for older sections of the
community which exhibit various degrees of blight and/or where opportunities may exist to achieve greater
value and utility in the use of land for the benefit of the property owner and the City. The Redevelopment
Program is considered essential to assuring that the existing community will gain significant benefits of
growth and development that will occur west of Interstate 5 and south of Route 120.
Adoption of Specific Plans as Primary Tools of General Plan Implementation
A number of Specific Plans are envisioned which are to serve as the primary instruments of the City of
Lathrop in carrying out policies and proposals of the Lathrop General Plan. In many respects, development
of the Lathrop New Town calls for the application of techniques of design, phasing, financing and
regulation which have emerged in the creation of new towns in other parts of the country, such as Columbia,
Maryland and Foster City and Irvine, California. But unlike such new towns which have been sponsored by
single private development corporations, development of the Lathrop New Town will be sponsored by a
variety of unrelated private corporations and an existing municipality. In addition, the County of San
Joaquin must play an important role in achieving with the City of Lathrop the progressive transition of land
from agricultural to an urban status while maintaining the integrity of adjacent lands where urban
                                                      2-18
development is not called for or desired. Under these conditions, special tools are needed to coordinate the
development process in a manner consistent with policies and proposals of the General Plan. The Specific
Plan will provide most of these tools.
The authority for the preparation and adoption of Specific Plans is provided in State Planning Law. A great
deal of innovation is encouraged by this process. For Lathrop, the Specific Plan(s) will have several related
functions:
1.       The interpretive function of the Specific Plan indicates the degree of flexibility which is to be
         permitted; it provides development standards to be applied to the actions of the City and the
         private sector; and it provides guidance to the phasing and coordination of development activity.
2.       The illustrative function describes and illustrates the ways in which private and public
         developments may be designed in a manner consistent with the General Plan. Photographs,
         sketches and diagrams are provided liberally to aid this function.
3.       The regulatory function sets forth the process of development regulation and even the regulations
         to be applied to private and public development actions. Development regulations can be tailored
         to a given project, a group of projects or all projects, in lieu of regulations otherwise prescribed
         by the City's zoning ordinance. Different procedures and regulations for Planned Development
         will be required to reflect the different conceptual and practical characteristics of large v. small
         ownerships.
As to the number of Specific Plans required, one should be devised for the existing community east of
Interstate 5 in conjunction with preparation of the Redevelopment Plan. A second will be needed for the
development on the Stewart Tract west of the San Joaquin River. Several will be needed for all of SPA #2
west of I-5 to the San Joaquin River because of its size and multiple land ownerships. Regardless of location
and number, Specific Plans will require consistency with the General Plan, including designs interrelated
with adjacent Specific Plan areas.
An Urban Design Concept or Design Guidelines that sets forth the design guidelines for all elements of the
public realm and the development standards for each land use may be used in conjunction with a Specific
Plan to assist in ensuring high quality development is implemented.

                                          SECTION A - LAND USE
INTRODUCTION
The following text, when taken together with the General Plan Diagram, sets forth the body of policies and
proposals which are to provide the basis for the zoning and development of all public and private land
within the community. Land use categories included in the text and on the Diagram are described under
proposals for Land Use in Section A of the Community Development Element. Proposals for Circulation
and Traffic are described in Section B, proposals for Housing appear in Section C, and proposals for Water-
Sewerage-Drainage-Solid Waste appear in Section D.
For purposes of describing land use policies and proposals, Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2 are combined, while
Sub-Plan Area #3 is described separately. This is necessary to reflect the distinctly different character of
land use proposals for these combined and separate areas. SPA's #1 and #2 cover the area within the
existing City Limits east of Interstate 5, the area outside the City Limits south of Route 120 and east of I-5,
and the proposed area of urban expansion which lies west of I-5 and east of the San Joaquin River. SPA #3
addresses the proposal on the Stewart Tract. Figure IV-1 - the 20 Year General Plan - is intended as a
generalized version of the General Plan Diagram. The more complete General Plan Diagram is included as
a folded insert inside the back cover of the document.
DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES
Sub-Plan Area #1 - Lands East of Interstate 5
Priorities of development east of Interstate 5 are dependent on the availability of adequate water supply and
sewage treatment capacity. Most of the remaining area of residential development potential east of I-5 is
located between Lathrop Road and Squires Road, north of that part of the existing residential area known as
"Lathrop Acres". This area was proposed for development just prior to the City's embarking on its General
Plan program, with a decision to delay the "Country Squire" project pending completion of the General Plan
Program. It is envisioned that the Country Squire Planned Development would constitute the first major
residential development to occur after adoption of the General Plan. This priority takes account of the
considerable environmental, design and engineering study already completed for the project.
Approximately 162,000 gallons per day of capacity in the Phase II sewage treatment plant expansion is
reserved for Country Squire, which would serve about 580 of the 1,000 housing units proposed.
Consequently, the Country Squire project would also be an important component of the first stage of
permanent sewerage facility construction that is also needed to serve development west of Interstate 5.
Other areas of potential residential development are limited primarily to infill of vacant properties within the
mostly developed town site and the redevelopment of older housing areas. The largest area of
redevelopment potential is "Lathrop Acres" which is located immediately north of Lathrop Rd. and east of
I-5.
Areas having early potential for retail and highway commercial development primarily involve lands
located at the easterly quadrants of the Lathrop Road and Louise Avenue interchanges with I-5. The largest
commercial project being considered in the short term is the Factory Stores center proposed at the southeast
quadrant of the Louise Avenue interchange. Industrial development priorities will of necessity be limited to
                                                      4-A-1
lands already served by the existing collection system until sewage treatment facilities can be expanded
(Phase II) or new facilities are provided. Freeway and Service Commercial areas in the vicinity of Roth
Road similarly depend on capability for sewerage facilities.
Sub-Plan Area #2 - Lands West of Interstate 5 to the San Joaquin River
Sub-Plan Area #2 is comprised of a portion of the West Lathrop Specific Plan (Mossdale Village), the
Central Lathrop Specific Plan, and extends north to Bowman Road between I-5 and the San Joaquin River.
The first phases of the Mossdale Village projects are currently under construction.
Priorities for commercial development would typically emphasize Freeway Commercial uses until the
population of Sub-Plan Area #2 increases (in combination with Area #1) to where the market will support
initial stages of a community shopping center on either side of the Lathrop Road interchange. Development
of the larger "downtown" south of Lathrop Road cannot be expected until sometime after the year 2000.
The 2004 Amendment to the Wastewater Master Plan considers three alternatives for the placement of
Wastewater Recycling Plant #2 (WRP2). One of the alternatives is to locate WRP2 in the northeast corner
of the Central Lathrop Specific Plan area. The other alternatives are to place WRP #2 North of the Central
Lathrop Specific Plan and closer to the San Joaquin River or southwest of the Central Lathrop Specific Plan
in the Crossroads Business Park.
Sub-Plan Area #3
The concept for Stewart Tract is a master planned development where people can live, work and enjoy
their leisure time. About 40,000 vehicles commute every day from homes in this area to jobs in Silicon
Valley and the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area. These travelers are seeking gainful employment yet
want to own a home that they can afford. Many kept their job in the Bay Area, bought a family home
with a backyard in San Joaquin County and now endure lengthy commutes.
The General Plan designates an employment center use on the Stewart Tract for a variety of businesses in
the office, back-office/administrative and R&D sectors to locate as Bay Area land costs continue to rise
and employers recognize the increasing need to locate jobs where their workers live. The demand for this
type of land will increase. This trend is already evident as Alameda County continues to attract
businesses historically found in San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose. Such employers are now looking
closely at San Joaquin County, in part because they seek a wide range of available housing with extensive
amenities for their employees, such as would be offered here.
New housing arranged along the edges of a central lake and the edges of the San Joaquin River will
accommodate the families whose breadwinner(s) currently lose two to four hours in traffic each day. The
costs of long commutes on family life, the price of land in the Bay Area and the large, qualified
workforce in San Joaquin County will encourage more local businesses. Housing uses designated for the
Stewart Tract are projected to greatly expand the range of types of housing in Lathrop, in terms of home
styles, sizes and neighborhood character. Also, Stewart Tract homes prices will match a broad spectrum
of household incomes. Other amenities, such as private and public marinas, a town center with shops and
services and the opportunity for a 21st century school system will complement the new homes and
workplaces.
The vision revolves around establishing a way of life oriented toward the waterways that epitomize the
delta environment. A central lake, lakeside and river’s-edge parks and open space along with extensive
habitat restoration and conservation are key parts of the proposed development on Stewart Tract. Levee
improvements that will greatly increase flood protection in the vicinity are also essential elements of the
                                                    4-A-2

proposal.
In Southeast Stewart Tract, recreation commercial, public facilities and resource conservation activities may
take place.
LAND USE STANDARDS
State Planning Law requires that the Land Use Element incorporate standards for population density and
building intensity. All development projects are governed by General Plan goals and policies, zoning and
building code regulations, as well as other applicable City regulations.
Residential development is more adaptable to an application of population and building standards with
minimum lot sizes (zoning) and density ranges (General Plan) than non-residential development. Given the
wide variety of uses and activities that are permitted in the non-residential zones, it is more difficult to apply
strict development standards to commercial and industrial projects. Building intensity and employment
density will vary by activity. The Zoning Code regulates actual building intensity (lot coverage) for specific
projects through the application of minimum setbacks, maximum lot coverage, height restrictions, and
parking and landscaping requirements.
The population and employment densities and building intensities provided in the sub-sections which follow
were applied in analyzing community wide development impacts.

            AREAS #1 AND #2 LESS THE CENTRAL LATHROP SPECIFIC PLAN AREA
RESIDENTIAL LAND USE POLICIES AND PROPOSALS
Housing and Population Density Standards - All Sub-Plan Areas
The General Plan provides five basic categories of residential density as shown on Figure IV-1 and on the
General Plan Diagram included at the back of this document. Note that the definition of "net acre" is the
actual amount of land available for residential use. The residential densities are designated on the General
Plan Diagram, for Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2 (excluding the Central Lathrop Specific Plan area), Sub-Plan
Area #2 (Central Lathrop Specific Plan area), and for Sub-Plan Area #3. For Sub-Plan Areas #1 and non-
Central Lathrop Specific Plan areas of Sub-Plan #2, Low Density areas would have from 1 to 7 housing
units per net acre of land available for residential use; Medium Density would have from 8 - 15 units per
net acre; and, High Density would have from 16 - 25 units per net acre. Associated with a combining
district, designated residential densities within the Central Lathrop Specific Plan area of Sub-Plan #2 are
Variable Density would have from 3-16 units per acre; Residential/Mixed Use would have from 10-40
units per net acre; and High Density would have from 15-40 units per net acre. Housing in Sub-Plan Area
#3 will be designated with a combining district that allows all three types of housing in each area, in
accordance with regulations set forth in the Specific Plan for that area. In Sub-Plan Area, Low Density and
Variable Density ranges from 1-9 units per net acre, Medium Density is from 6-20 units per net acre and
High Density is 15-40 units per net acre.
While single-family detached housing units would be the predominant housing type in the Low Density
areas, any combination of housing types would be possible under the Specific Plan and/or Planned
Development (PD) approach to design, provided that the average ratio of site area per dwelling unit does not
fall below the ratio for all lands in the Low Density category. As an example, 100 gross acres of residential
                                                     4-A-3
land will typically require 25 acres in public streets, leaving 75 net acres actually available for conventional
6,000 sq. ft. lots. At 7.0 housing units per net acre, the 75 acres would yield 525 housing units. However, it
may be possible under a PD approach to gain an extra number of units as an incentive to better design and
amenity than otherwise would result from conventional lot design. This can occur where internal streets are
to be held privately as common area by all owners of units residing in the PD project area, and which is not
therefore subtracted from gross acreage to determine "net" acreage. In the 100 gross acres example, and
assuming about 15% of the area is required for public streets, a net of 85 acres remains for calculating
housing yield. Under a theoretical maximum, as many as 617 housing units could result. As a practical
matter, the number of extra units would be negotiable, depending on the amount of affordable housing and
common recreation open space and other amenities to be provided.
Calculations for property where two or more density ranges would be involved would require applying the
separate density standards shown below in Table IV-1.
                                                          TABLE IV-1

         Density Category                       Units per Net Acre                              Persons per Net Acre
            Low                                        1- 7                                          1.0 - 22.0
            Medium                                     8 - 15                                       20.0 - 37.5
            High                                      16 - 25                                       32.0 - 50.0
The standards of housing and population density shown in Table IV-1 for Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2 are
intended to indicate the desirable range of population that would result from the standards of housing
density. While the population range per net acre is not to be considered absolute either as to the minimum
or maximum number of people allowed, any persistent excess of the maximum would be in conflict with the
intent of the Housing Element of the General Plan to avoid overcrowding of housing [See Section C, Part IV
for further discussion of policies relating to overcrowding.]1
An important residential development policy is that the maximum number of housing units for any
density range is not to be considered as a "right" but rather as an "entitlement" to be granted under special
circumstances. The maximum number of units may be exceeded only through the PD process and then only
on the merits of a request for the maximum. Factors to be considered in judging the merits typically would
include the character and density in any adjacent development, efficiency in street design, housing
affordability, housing design and quality and open space and recreation amenities.
For purposes of calculating population holding capacity of the General plan, the average number of units per
net acre was used for each density category, multiplied by the typical household size for each category.
These calculations are discussed for each of the density categories in the descriptions which follow.
  1
         Because of variations in household size, the households which may occupy a given net acre of land may collectively
         exceed the standard. However, the impact of such variations will be virtually immeasurable when viewed on the basis
         of a block, a subdivision, a neighborhood or the community as a whole.
                                                              4-A-4

                            (LESS CENTRAL LATHROP SPECIFIC PLAN AREA)
Low Density [LD]:
Building Intensity:                    1-7 housing units per net acre
Population Density:                    1-22 persons per net acre
Typically, Low Density in Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2 will involve single-family detached housing on lots
having a minimum area of 6,000 sq. ft. However, larger lots are encouraged. The average number of
housing units per net acre is 5.5, and the average population density per net acre is 16.0 based on a factor of
3.2 persons per household. Zoning consistency with variations in LD development is provided by the R-1-
6 zoning district. The Planned Development (PD) process is available for application in LD areas as a
means to achieve innovation in overall design, including a mixture of dwelling types and density transfer.
An important policy limitation in LD areas is that density bonuses above the range provided for a
given density category in Table IV-1 cannot be granted except as required under Government Code
Section 65915 where a minimum percentage of housing units are proposed for lower income housing. 2
Section 65915 requires that the City either grant a density bonus equal to 25% of the maximum number of
housing units otherwise allowed in areas designated for residential use, or grant concessions in design and
improvement standards or provide capital improvements equal to the differential value involved, or grant
other concessions as prescribed by law.3
Government Code §65852.1 and 65852.2 govern the creation of "granny-flats" and second units in single
family and multiple family zoned areas. To a large extent the State Law supersedes the ability of a local
agency from preventing the installation of such units but does provide an avenue for architectural review.
The density provisions of each land use designation have been set after consideration of the above
referenced sections.
Except for bonuses mandated by the Government Code, other bonuses are prohibited except as may be
obtained through the PD process as described above under "Housing and Population Density
Standards. This is necessary in order to protect the integrity of areas already developed in Low Density
that are adjacent or in close proximity to proposed new subdivisions in undeveloped LD areas. An example
of incompatibility that can result is increased traffic generated by a density bonus project that depends on its
access from streets serving established single-family housing on conventional lot sizes of 6,000 sq. ft. or
more.
 2
         Section 65915 states that density bonuses be provided when a housing developer proposes at least 20% of the total
         number of units for "lower income" households (as defined by law) or at least 10% of the total number of units for
         "very low income" households (as defined by law).
 3
         At least two concessions are required involving any combination of the following: a) a reduction in site development
         standards, or a modification of Zoning Code requirements or architectural design requirements which exceed the
         minimum building standards approved by the State Building Standards Commission; b) approval of mixed use zoning
         in conjunction with the housing project if commercial, office, industrial or other use will reduce the cost of the housing
         development, and if these other land uses are compatible with the housing project and the existing or planned
         development in the area of the proposed housing project; c) other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by
         the developer or the City which result in identifiable cost reductions.
                                                                4-A-6

Medium Density [MD]:
Building Intensity:               8 -15 housing units per net acre
Population Density:               20-38 persons per net acre
Medium Density in Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2 provides for a wide variety of housing types within walking
distance of shopping districts and employment centers. MD housing types would include zero lot line,
multi-plexes, patio homes on lots with reduced front yard setbacks, garden apartments, condominiums,
townhouses, and mobile homes in mobile home parks. The average number of housing units per net acre is
12, and the average population density per net acre is 29.0 based on a factor of 2.5 persons per household.
Zoning consistency with General Plan designations of Medium Density is achieved by the RM-3 zoning
district of the Zoning Ordinance or by City adoption of a Specific Plan for the involved areas. Within the
Medium Density category, several more specific designations (subcategories) may be provided in order to
establish limits on the number of housing units to be allowed under the Zoning Ordinance. Consistency
between subcategories of MD areas and the Zoning Ordinance is achieved through application of the PD
process.
High Density [HD]:
Building Intensity:               16 - 25 housing units per net acre
Population Density:               32 - 50 persons per net acre
High Density in Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2 is reserved exclusively for lands along elements of the Arterial
and Collector street system within walking distance of the Central Business District. The average number of
housing units per net acre is 21, and the average population density per net acre is 42 based on a factor of
2.0 persons per household.
Zoning consistency with the High Density designation of the General Plan is achieved by the RM-2 and
RM-1.5 zoning districts, or by any applicable Specific Plan. Within the High Density category, several
more specific designations (subcategories) may be provided in order to establish limits on the number of
housing units to be allowed under the Zoning Ordinance. A special High Density category not shown on the
General Plan Diagram is intended for application to above-ground floors of commercial structures within
the Central Business District (CBD). While the maximum number of housing units is the same as for other
HD areas, no other regulations apply except those that may be specified by the Zoning Ordinance or
applicable Specific Plan.
An important residential development policy for both Medium Density and High Density areas is that
the minimum number of units shown in the density range of Table IV-1 shall not be reduced in order to
reinforce commercial land use, transit and infrastructure proposals of the Plan, and policies of the Housing
Element concerning the City's fair-share responsibility in meeting low-moderate income housing needs of
the region.
Low Density Proposals
Areas proposed for Low Density in Sub-Plan Area #1 east of Interstate 5 are limited primarily to lands
north of Lathrop Acres and west of the Sharpe Depot in the vicinity of Squires Road (Country Squire), and
to vacant parcels that would in-fill mostly developed single-family areas between Lathrop Road and Louise
Avenue. Lands north of Lathrop Acres have historically been designated for industrial development under
previous County versions of the General Plan for Lathrop. However, there are important reasons for
designating this area for Low Density, including the following:
                                                    4-A-7
1.       The need to reinforce policies of the General Plan that call for the redevelopment of much of
                Lathrop Acres to the south of Country Squire as a residential neighborhood.4
2.       The need to reinforce Community Commercial development proposals near the I-5/Lathrop Road
                interchange.
3.       The abundance of land already designated for Light Industrial use at other locations east of the
         freeway.
4.       The need to reinforce new Low Density residential use and Neighborhood Commercial use east of
         Lathrop Acres and north of Lathrop Road.
5.       Lack of past industrial development interest in the land.
Areas proposed for Low Density in Sub-Plan Area #2 west of Interstate 5 are concentrated in three
"Villages" separated by Arterial streets and/or open space corridors between the San Joaquin River and the
north-south Golden Valley Parkway located generally parallel to and west of the alignment of Interstate 5.
One of these Villages lies north of the proposed Central Business District (CBD) with mostly Low Density
and Medium Density housing. The other two lay south of the CBD on either side of the proposed Louise
Avenue expressway. Each of these Villages would be served by an elementary school and neighborhood
park.5 All three would be served by a single Village Center because of the proximity of Community
Commercial to the most northern village. [Note: The Village Center is described separately under
Commercial proposals.] A Specific Plan or multiple integrated Specific Plans will be required to fully
develop the concept and the development standards to implement this concept for Sub-Plan Area #2.
Medium and High Density Proposals
Areas proposed for Medium and High Density in Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2 as shown on the General
Plan Diagram are located primarily in close proximity to the freeway interchanges. Within Area #1,
Medium Density is concentrated north of Lathrop Road, to be accomplished under a Redevelopment Plan
for Lathrop Acres. A second concentration is located along Harlan Road reflecting the existing mobile
home park.
Within SPA #2, Medium and High Density is concentrated in close proximity to the Central Business
District (CBD) along the Golden Valley Parkway corridor. This proximity to retail commercial and major
transportation corridor becomes important to the feasibility of a local transit system, and to reinforce the full
potential of the CBD as the eventual major social and economic activity center of the community. Housing
for the elderly would be an important component of these density categories.

         As described in Part II, the Village concept represents a modern day return to the type of pedestrian and transit-oriented
         neighborhood planning which characterized much of city planning practice prior to the mid-1960's. The neighborhood
         school/park was a central feature, together with convenience shopping within walking distance of most homes. This
         concept became somewhat obscured by policies imposed on the Courts by school districts to eliminate racial segregation
         within communities and to prevent its reoccurrence. The bussing of students became a common means to carry out
         Court mandates. In creating a "new town", it is possible for Lathrop to incorporate the neighborhood or village planning
         concept. The term "village" being used today is mostly synonymous with the neighborhood planning concept of
         yesterday.
                                                             4-A-8
Development Standards for Medium and High Density Areas
All undeveloped land within SPA's #1 and #2 shown for Medium or High Density on the General Plan
Diagram shall be developed in accordance with the following development policies and standards:
1.      The extent and rate at which multi-family development is allowed to occur during a given year shall
        be governed by realistic demands in the housing market. Unsubstantiated local market potential for
        multi-family proposals may be grounds for project disapproval, even though multi-family use is
        called for by proposals depicted on the General Plan Diagram or as described in the General Plan
        text.
2.      Multi-family projects shall include landscaped open space in addition to yard areas required by the
        zoning ordinance, to be developed for the common recreation use of tenants. Minimum facilities
        may be required for common recreation areas. Examples include tot lots for pre-school children,
        and passive recreation areas for lounging, sun bathing, barbecuing, quiet conversation and reading,
        including area to be shaded by trees and shade structures.
3.      Where multi-story housing units are proposed adjacent to existing or planned Low Density areas,
        building elevations and the location of windows, balconies and air conditioning units above the first
        story shall be reviewed by the City to assure visual compatibility and residential privacy.
4.      Flexibility should be allowed by applying a lesser standard in the amount of off-street parking
        required for senior citizens housing where adequate open space is provided to permit an eventual
        ratio of 2.0 off-street parking spaces per housing unit if the development is ever converted in whole
        or in part to rentals or condominiums which no longer are intended for senior citizens.
5.      Notwithstanding the provisions of Item 4, above, all multi-family housing projects shall provide off-
        street parking for visitors at locations reasonably central to the units to be served at the rate of one
        space for each four (4) units.
6.      Site development and maintenance shall be in accordance with a comprehensive landscape
        development plan, including automatic irrigation.
COMMERCIAL LAND USE POLICIES AND PROPOSALS
Community Commercial Centers
Building Density:                        Generally 1-2 stories
Land Use Intensity:                      Up to 35% site area coverage6
Community Commercial centers are located on the east side of the Lathrop Road and Louise Avenue
interchanges with I-5, and along Harlan Road north of Louise Avenue. These properties are expected to
develop primarily as shopping centers as the City's population grows, and most likely before significant
commercial development occurs within the Central Business District in SPA #2. Community Commercial
shopping centers are intended to provide the full range of retail goods that may be required by the
population of the community and surrounding area, limited only by factors of market competition from
  6
        This much lower percentage of coverage than that prescribed for the CBD reflects the 1-story character of building and
        off-street parking area that is characteristic of community shopping centers.
                                                              4-A-9
similar centers in nearby communities.
Office Centers
Building Intensity:               Generally 1-2 stories
Land Use Intensity:               Up to 90% site area coverage within or adjacent to CBD; up to 65% at
                                  other locations.
The separate designation for Offices is intended to recognize large-scale office complexes as distinct centers
of business activity in close relation to the CBD, including so-called "regional" offices which serve as
headquarters for large-scale business operations that are regional, statewide or national in their service
characteristics. As a practical matter, office centers become part of the CBD when ground floor space is
devoted largely to retail use. Office centers are encouraged between Golden Valley Parkway and I-5
between the Lathrop Road and Louise Avenue interchanges. Smaller centers are proposed along Lathrop
Road and Harlan Road east of I-5.
Village and Neighborhood Commercial Centers
Building Intensity:               Generally 1 story
Land Use Intensity:               Up to 35% site area coverage
The Village Center is broader in concept as compared to the more traditional "neighborhood" shopping
center. It is larger (15-30+ acres in area) and provides for a much wider selection of professional and
household services, and public and semi-public services needed by residents of the surrounding
neighborhood(s) which comprise the Village. A retail shopping center of 8-10 acres would be a major
component of the Village Center, providing mostly for the sale of convenience goods and personal services.
A large supermarket and discount drugs would serve as major tenants once sufficient trade area population
exists. Other tenants might include the small variety store, grocery, deli, bakery goods, liquor, video shop,
ice cream shop, restaurants, coffee shops, laundry and dry-cleaner, barber, beauty salon, body building,
exercise and diet centers, small appliance repair and similar convenience sales and service activities. Public
and semi-public uses might include a library, senior center, private education, clinics, day care, convalescent
homes, lodges, and churches and similar uses. The Neighborhood Centers (all located east of I-5) would be
limited mostly to convenience stores and personal services.
A single Village Centers is proposed in connection with the three residential villages designated for SPA #2
because of the proximity of Community Commercial areas which can also be expected to include
convenience stores. Existing smaller Neighborhood Centers are shown north at Lathrop Road/5th Street,
along Seventh Street, and at Louise Avenue intersections with Cambridge Drive and Seventh Street.
Service Commercial Centers
Building Density:                 Will vary by types of service commercial use, but generally 1-3 stories
Building Intensity:               Up to 65% site area coverage
Service Commercial centers are shown on the General Plan Diagram in proximity to points of freeway
access and industrial development. Service centers for large land users would be located primarily north of
Roth Road and along Yosemite and McKinley Avenues south of Yosemite in S-P Area #1, and along the
freeway south of the Louise Avenue interchange in Area #2. Examples of large land users include building
materials supply, lumber yard and planing mill, warehousing and distribution for wholesale trade,
contractors, open yards for equipment storage, furniture storage, corporation yards and utility yards. Many
of these types of service commercial activities will provide services to other businesses and to industry.
                                                    4-A-10
The smaller centers located along the Louise Avenue corridor at McKinley Avenue are intended primarily
for lower intensity service operations which cater mostly to the needs of residential households. A wide
range of service activities meets this criterion, including rug cleaning and supply, nurseries and garden
supply, landscape contracting, building contracting (painting, electrical, plumbing, air conditioning,
irrigation, cabinets, etc.), car washing, auto repair, upholstery, canvass and glass shops, mini-storage and RV
storage.
Freeway Commercial
Building Density:                   Generally 1-2 stories
Building Intensity:                 Up to 60% site area coverage
This classification of commercial activity is somewhat of a hybrid in that it caters to uses which serve the
regional market for specialized sales and service activities as well as uses which cater more strictly to the
needs of the highway traveler. Specialized activities might include factory store centers, discount centers
for home furniture, appliances, home improvement and sports, and commercial recreation centers for such
activities such as bowling, skating, tennis, racquetball, water-oriented amusements and miniature golf.
Uses which cater to the highway traveler include motels, restaurants, auto and truck sales and service, fuel
stations, auto repair, RV sales and service, boat sales and service, sports equipment, bank service, truck
stops and terminals, bus stops and facilities for overnight camping and RV parking.
Waterfront Resort Commercial
Building Density:                   Generally 1-2 stories
Building Intensity:                 Up to 60% site area coverage
Waterfront Resort Commercial caters to water-oriented recreation activities afforded by access to the San
Joaquin River or to nearby artificially created lakes within the southern part of Sub-Plan Area #1. Examples
include fishing, swimming, water skiing, power boating, small boat racing, sailing, and house boating.
These centers would include marina and boat launching facilities, lodging, restaurants and small shops to
provide clothing, equipment and sundries that relate to a water recreation experience.
Regional Commercial
Building Density:                   Generally multi-story
Building Intensity:                 Up to 35% site area coverage
The "Regional Commercial" designation is intended to include the large-scale regional shopping center with
multiple department store tenancy, and which may involve 40-100 acres in area depending on the population
served. For Lathrop, the potential for such a regional center depends on serving the regional population
within the Stockton-Manteca-Lathrop-Tracy corridor, and including smaller cities and unincorporated
communities and rural areas of south-central San Joaquin County.
Several sites offer potential for the Regional Commercial center. They include lands within SPA #2 along
the west side of I-5 between the Louise Avenue and Lathrop interchanges, and lands within SPA #1 south of
the Yosemite Avenue interchange.
                                                       4-A-11
Flexibility in Commercial Development
Proposals for the classifications of retail activity described above are to some extent to be considered as
offering flexibility for ingenuity and innovation in the selection, promotion, design and development of
commercial uses and areas. This is especially true of the Freeway Commercial and Service Commercial
categories, of the Office and Community Commercial (CBD) categories and of the Service Commercial
category. Within the Village Commercial category, the list of permitted and conditional uses of the Zoning
Ordinance need to be sufficiently broad to accommodate the full range of retail, personal service,
professional office, public and semi-public and other uses envisioned. Hard and fast limitations on the
selection and mixing of uses that has dominated zoning practice for most of the 20th Century is discouraged
in favor of a Planned Development and/or Specific Plan process which permits flexibility if operational and
aesthetic conflicts among uses are avoided in the development process through excellence in site and
building design and functional arrangement among uses.
Development Standards for Commercial Areas
The following development standards apply within commercial areas:
1.       The visual interface between commercial and residential areas shall be designed and developed so
         as to avoid obtrusive visual impacts of commercial activities on nearby residential areas.
2.       All outdoor storage areas shall be visually screened with ornamental fencing or walls, and
         landscaping.
3.       Shade trees shall be provided within off-street parking areas as determined under site plan review.
         Generally, the standard shall be a ratio of one tree per five lineal parking spaces, placed along the
         line between parking bays and with trees at both ends of a line of parking spaces.
4.       Street trees and frontage landscaping, with automatic irrigation, shall be provided for all
         commercial sites outside of the CBD, and may be required by the City within the CBD.
5.       The use of drought tolerant plant materials is to be encouraged.
INDUSTRIAL LAND USE POLICIES AND PROPOSALS
Industrial development is provided for only within Sub-Plan Area #1. Given the potential of the greater
Lathrop Planning Area for attracting job-creating enterprises having a regional market orientation, industrial
land use policies and proposals are intended to match and exceed housing expansion to where the City's
economic base is more than equal to the task of supporting such housing.
Industrial Development Policies
Policies in support of the industrial land use designations shown on the General Plan Diagram include the
following:
1.       Areas designated for industrial use are intended to take advantage of rail and freeway access.
2.       Areas designated for industrial use are to assure that there will be sufficient long-term availability of
         industrial land to expand the City's economic base and capability for meeting the on-going costs of
         public services required by the community. A slow pace of industrial development is not to be
                                                     4-A-12
         construed alone as justification for designating industrial land areas for another type of urban use
         unless such use would be of a regional commercial character.
3.       Industrial proposals should be located where possible within an industrial park designed for the
         accommodation of a community of industries that are compatible in terms of operational
         characteristics, aesthetic qualities, utility service requirements and street circulation.
4.       Industries are to be developed and operated in such manner as to avoid damage, destruction or
         degradation of the environment.
Industrial Proposals
Building Density:                   1-4 stories in height
Building Intensity:                 Up to 90% site area coverage, excluding off-street parking and loading
Limited Industrial:
Limited Industrial use is proposed primarily within the corridor formed by the (former) Southern Pacific and
Union Pacific Railroads extending from north of Roth Road to south of Yosemite Avenue. The term
"limited" implies the accommodation of industrial operations which are relatively low in intensity of
operations, clean in character of appearance and operation and which generally require modest sites of 5-20
acres.
General Industrial:
General Industrial use is proposed within the Crossroads Industrial Park bordered by Louise Avenue,
Interstate 5 and the Southern Pacific Railroad, and in the corridor formed by the S.P. Railroad and
McKinley Avenue between Louise Avenue and State Route 120. These areas provide opportunities for
large-scale industries requiring substantial acreage, with access to rail and freeway facilities. The term
"general" implies industrial operations which are relatively high in intensity of operation and which may
require special conditions such as noise attenuation equipment or emission control equipment to mitigate
potential adverse impacts.
Flexibility of Selection within Limited and General Industrial Categories
Sufficient similarities between Limited and General Industrial categories exist that the two categories should
not be considered mutually exclusive. Except for site area requirements, many types of both large and small
industries have operations which generate similar densities of labor, materials consumption, product
distribution and traffic. It is also common to find as high a quality of design and appearance in a large
industry as in a small one. Moreover, small and large industries which have economic ties often require
location in close proximity to each other. Thus, it is important that a reasonable level of flexibility be
introduced when the City reviews the selection of industries proposed within the Limited and General
Industrial categories.
Industrial Development Standards
Because of often prominent visibility, industrial sites should be subject to the same standards for visual
screening with ornamental walls, screen fencing and landscaping and street trees, frontage landscaping and
parking lot landscaping as provided for commercial areas, above. Architectural design standards are to be
provided as deed restrictions within industrial parks.
                                                        4-A-13
PUBLIC, SEMI-PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONAL FACILITIES
This broad category of land use includes park and recreation areas, public schools, government offices and
utility service yards, drainage basins, hospitals, churches and religious institutions.
Park and Recreation Areas
Park and recreation areas are shown on the General Plan Diagram and are described as part of the Resource
Management Element in Part V.
School Sites
All existing school sites are to be retained for the purpose. One or more high school sites may be needed in
proximity to the residential villages to be served in SPA #2, with access from elements of the Arterial street
systems. A general location is denoted on the General Plan Diagram by the "HS" symbol. A stadium
facility may be needed to meet major athletic and team sport requirements of the high schools at a location
where night lighting and crowd noise will not adversely affect residential environments. Several options
exist within the industrial corridors described above.
New elementary school sites are shown by the "ES" symbol in conjunction with neighborhood parks within
each of the residential villages shown in SPA #2. A site is also shown east of Harlan Road and north of
Lathrop Acres in SPA #1. A symbol is intended to denote one or more sites in a given area, depending on
specific requirements to be determined during the Specific Plan stage of development approval.
School sites should be interconnected by recreation corridors that encourage pedestrian and bicycle use with
a minimum of conflict with the street system. These locations are to be considered somewhat flexible
because of the complexities involved in planning for new school facilities under State supervision.
However, as developers create Village residential proposals, planning and design should provide for the
integration of school and park sites and recreation corridors.
City & County Government Office Facilities
City government administrative offices would remain at their present locations until such time as a new City
Hall complex is required and rearrangement of space allocations may be necessary. Current City Hall
facilities should meet the needs of the City until the year 2000 or thereafter, when the City reaches a
permanent population of about 20,000. A new facility will not be needed before that time unless current
leased space becomes unavailable. A new facility is envisioned along the Lathrop Road corridor within or
immediately adjacent to the CBD or in the Stewart Tract town center. The site should be large enough (10-
15 acres) so that the site will have a useful life equal to that of the buildings it will accommodate, including
branch offices of County government (e.g., library, court and social services).
Four to five new fire stations are proposed in proximity to Village Centers and major commercial and
industrial areas. The City will eventually require a Corporation Yard for the storage and maintenance of
service vehicles and equipment. A variety of suitable locations will be available for consideration within
most of the Service Commercial or Industrial areas shown on the Plan Diagram.
Medical and Other Health Care Facilities
Medical and health care facilities that may be required should be located within stable environments, and
where emergency access from the freeway and the entire community is available via the City's Expressway
and Arterial street systems. Medical and medically related offices, hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and
                                                      4-A-14
rehabilitation, convalescent and nursing centers should be in close proximity to each other wherever
possible. A hospital site and site for medically related offices and other uses is shown on the Plan Diagram
along Golden Valley Parkway west of Interstate 5 between the Lathrop Road and Louise Avenue
interchanges. Offices for various types of medical and dental practice would also be appropriate within
Village Centers.
Churches and Other Religious Facilities
Churches and other religious facilities should be located along elements of the Arterial and Collector street
system to assure convenient access from residential neighborhoods and an environment compatible with
religious service functions. While some churches may be located within or adjacent to Village Centers, the
need for church sites at other locations should also be considered during the process of reviewing
development proposals.
CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE COMPONENTS OF THE LAND USE ELEMENT
State Law requires that the Land Use Element of the General Plan provide also for "...the proposed general
distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land for ... agriculture, natural resources,
recreation and enjoyment of scenic beauty..." and "...solid and liquid waste disposal facilities." Areas
subject to flooding must also be identified as part of the Land Use Element. In this regard, only lands within
the Stewart Tract are within the 100 year flood plain.
Policies and proposals dealing with these categories of land use are described in appropriate detail within
Section D of Part IV and within Part V of this document.
                     LANDS EAST OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER IN SUB-PLAN
                   AREA #2- CENTRAL LATHROP SPECIFIC PLAN AREA ONLY
GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The Central Lathrop Specific Plan envisions a vibrant and livable community composed of a mix of
residential neighborhoods; retail, office, service-related and other employment generating land uses; and
public/semi-public uses such as schools, parks, and other civic oriented facilities. A maximum of 6,800
dwelling units and 5 million square feet of commercial uses are planned.
The Plan is founded upon proven town building principles that have been applied in fresh and innovative
ways. These principles provide a development framework and vision which, when implemented in
accordance with this Specific Plan, results in the creation of a distinctive community character that is
memorable, encourages social interaction and ages with elegance and visual richness.
The land plan for the Central Lathrop Specific Plan is organized around the following six principal design
themes:
1.       A pedestrian-oriented central city core that includes neighborhood serving commercial, civic and
         cultural uses, a community park, and a high school all designed to establish a community
         centerpiece and create a focal point for the Plan area. Refer to the Lathrop Center Plan, a
         component of the General Plan, for additional information and direction.
2.       A band of regional commercial (retail, office, and other similar uses) uses adjacent to the I-5
         freeway corridor that makes use of the visibility and prime freeway access provided directly by
                                                     4-A-15
        the Louise Avenue and Lathrop Road interchanges, and indirectly by the Roth Road interchanges
        while buffering the residential neighborhoods to the west from freeway related impacts. This
        location affords prime visibility, a synergy of uses and activities, and convenient access to local
        and regional services.
3.      Traditional neighborhoods organized around interior neighborhood parks and schools, and
        featuring higher residential densities designed to provide efficient land use, more affordable
        housing without reducing quality or amenities, better use of public infrastructure, and a “smart
        growth” antidote to sprawl. A variety of housing densities and product types are provided to
        expand purchase and rental opportunities to households at a broad range of economic levels.
4.      An interconnected pedestrian and bicycle pathway system that links the neighborhoods to the
        village center, parks, and schools as well as to each other. The Plan area is pedestrian friendly,
        with an extensive system of pedestrian and bicycle trails.
5.      A comprehensive park system that will be comprised of a linear park and open space located
        along and providing access and views to the San Joaquin River, and neighborhood and
        community parks scattered throughout the Plan area in order to maximize access to recreational
        opportunities.
6.      Quality design that emphasizes the provision of public spaces such as landscape corridors, parks,
        streets, and other public common areas, and the integration of diverse architectural styles and
        product types to establish an aesthetic standard for the Plan area.

   RESIDENTIAL LAND USE POLICIES AND PROPOSALS
   Housing and Population Density Standards
   Housing and population density standards for the CLSP area of Sub-Plan #2 are intended to
   accommodate a wide range of residential densities and building intensities. While certain residential
   densities are proposed per the Plan, the population density or persons per acre may vary because each
   acre may have a wider range of housing types than is typical. Refer to the Central Lathrop combining
   district zoning in the Lathrop Municipal Code for zoning and development criteria, and the Central
   Lathrop Design Guidelines (A companion document to the CLSP) for development and design
   standards.
                                                   4-A-16

Variable Density (VR-CL)
Building Intensity:       3-16 housing units per net acre
Population Density:       2.0-3.5 persons/household
Variable Density Residential uses include single family or multi-family units provided by way of a
variety of product types. These uses are typically scattered throughout the interior of the Plan and
may include either detached or attached units. The density range is between 3 and 16 units per acre,
with an average density of 7.25 units per acre per unit parcel. Neighborhoods may be designed to
accommodate conventional lots, small lots, clusters, duets, zero lot lines, courtyards, townhouses, and
other innovative lotting strategies and product types.
An innovative planning concept of the Central Lathrop Specific Plan is the introduction of the
Variable Residential Density (VR) zoning designation. The majority of the Plan’s residential land use
is zoned VR. This new zoning designation replaces the low and medium density zoning designations
traditionally relied upon in distinguishing residential land uses other than high density. In recent
years, however, a wider variety of both detached and attached single family housing products have
been introduced that blur the distinction between the low and medium density residential zoning
categories. The principal purpose of the VR zone is to encourage the development within each CLSP
neighborhood of a diverse mix of housing types that incorporates these new products.
The Variable Residential zoning district is designed to accommodate an evolving housing market in
which there is a growing demand for higher density housing products and for home value that is a
reflection of the quality of construction and the level of amenities rather than the size of the home or
the lot. This diversity of market demand is based on lifestyle factors and personal preferences as well
as pricing considerations. The CLSP objective of encouraging a diverse mix of housing product types
and densities within neighborhoods is also based on the planning premise that variety in terms of
architecture and site design make for a more interesting and exciting built environment.
Implicit in the Variable Residential zoning designation is the expectation that attached townhouses at
a density of approximately 15-16 units per acre may be constructed immediately adjacent to an estate
home subdivision with minimum 6,000 square foot lots and a density of approximately 3-4 units per
acre.
High Density (HR-CL)
Building Intensity:       15-40 housing units per net acre
Population Density:        1.9-2.1 persons/household
High Density Residential uses generally require attached units and accommodate a variety of product
types such as flats, townhouses, condominiums, live/work, lofts, and apartments. These uses are
typically located in the core of the project, adjacent to higher intensity uses and streets to buffer less
dense neighborhoods. These locations provide residential units within walking distance of the city
center. The net density range is between 15 and 40, with an average density of 16 dwelling units per
acre per unit parcel.

MIXED LAND USE POLICIES AND PROPOSALS
Residential/Mixed Use (R/MU-CL)
Building Intensity:           10-40 housing units per net acre
Population Density:           1.9-2.1 persons/household
Land Use Intensity:           0.17-0.6 FAR
Maximum Site Coverage:        90%
Residential/Mixed-use can accommodate all commercial uses, all residential uses, or a mixture of the
two. This designation permits a wide variety of uses to occur and provides flexibility to respond to
market demand. While various residential and commercial uses are permitted, no one use is required.
Mixed-use development provides a wide range of lively and convenient interactions between different
land uses. Commercial uses are more local serving in nature. These designations are located in the
core of the project, the Main Street District of City Center, adjacent to non-residential and higher
intensity uses and serve to buffer less dense neighborhoods and provide a transition between densities
and uses. These units are typically attached, but can also be detached. The average building intensity
is 16 units per acre, while the average land use intensity is 0.3 FAR.
Office Commercial/Variable Residential/ Wastewater Treatment Facility (OC/VR/WWTP-CL)
Building Intensity:              3-16 housing units per net acre
Population Density:               1.9-2.1 persons/household
Land Use Intensity:              0.17-0.6 FAR
Maximum Site Coverage:           70%
The Office Commercial/Variable Residential/ Wastewater Treatment Facility land use designation
allows local and regional serving retail and office uses singly, or mixed with up to 500 residential
dwellings, or mixed with wastewater related facilities and infrastructure, including spray fields and
ponds. If none or fewer of those units allocated to this area are constructed within this designation, the
remaining units may be transferred to other areas of the CLSP, so long as the procedures of the Transfer
of Residential Unit Allocations, found in Chapter Eight: Implementation of the Central Lathrop Specific
Plan are followed. The average building intensity is 7.25 units per acre, while the average land us
intensity is 0.3 FAR.
COMMERCIAL LAND USE POLICIES AND PROPOSALS
Lathrop Center
The heart of the Central Lathrop Specific Plan -- Lathrop Center -- provides the City and the Plan
area with an identifiable city core that incorporates a mix of uses (commercial, civic, and residential)
in a pedestrian-oriented setting to create a social and cultural centerpiece for the project. The creation
of opportunities for the siting of public facilities such as a civic center are emphasized, along with
other significant community elements such as a community park, and the City’s first high school.
This mix of uses, linked by interconnected streets and trails, fosters a vibrant core that functions as
the City’s “town center”.
Lathrop Center streets will function as a main street promenade, complete with wide sidewalks and
canopy shade trees to establish a human scaled and pedestrian oriented place. The adjacent primary
east-west axis (Lathrop Road) forms a community wide “signature” street terminating at its western
                                                4-A-18

end at the San Joaquin River and associated trails and open space systems. The overall Lathrop
Center area is approximately 145 acres in size. Refer to the Lathrop Center Plan for additional
information.
The I-5 Commercial Corridor
A retail and employment corridor has been concentrated paralleling Interstate 5, providing convenient
access to and visibility for the commercial and office land uses located there. These land uses
provide for an extensive array of local and regional goods and services as well as employment
opportunities to the residents within the Plan and the City of Lathrop.
This placement provides for a centrally located commercial area within the City of Lathrop and
reduces transportation trips and/or trip lengths within the community. By siting these uses adjacent to
the Interstate, they serve to buffer the residential, civic, park, and school uses located in the interior of
the Plan from traffic noise, fumes, and congestion. These commercial uses are conveniently
accessible by walking and bicycling, as well as by vehicular and public transportation systems.
Commercial Intensity Standards
Community intensity standards for the CLSP area of Sub-Plan #2 are intended to accommodate a
wide range of land uses, intensities, and coverages. While certain building intensities and coverages
are proposed per the Plan, the intensity or coverage may vary because each acre may have a wider
range of commercial types than is typical. Refer to the Central Lathrop combining district zones in
the Lathrop Municipal Code for zoning and development criteria, and the Central Lathrop Design
Guidelines (a companion document of the CLSP) for design guidelines.
Neighborhood Commercial (NC-CL)
Land Use Intensity:              0.17-0.45 FAR
Maximum Site Coverage:            60%
Neighborhood Commercial uses supply the types of convenience shopping for goods and services
necessary to provide for local residents as well as smaller scale local serving office development.
Residential uses are a permitted secondary use of the site if located above the commercial uses. The
average land us intensity is 0.3 FAR.
Specialty Commercial (SPC-CL)
Land Use Intensity:              0.17-0.4 FAR
Maximum Site Coverage:           60%
The Specialty Commercial land use designation provides for a variety of office and retail
opportunities with a strong emphasis towards uses that have a recreational and/or local commercial
character and that reflect the proximity of this site to the river. Uses permitted include sports
equipment rentals, restaurants and other food services, and shops. The average land us intensity is
0.25 FAR.
                                                4-A-19
Office Commercial (OC-CL)
Land Use Intensity:               0.17-0.6 FAR
Maximum Site Coverage:            70%
Office Commercial uses provide regional as well as local serving retail and business/professional
workspace. These uses are located along Interstate 5 for greater visibility and freeway access, while
providing a buffer to the non-commercial uses to the west. Typical uses include a wide variety of
shopping including grocery/drug, large floor plate stores, smaller specialty retail, restaurants and fast
food, as well as professional offices, incubator and research and development space, and small
business flex space. Hotels are also a permitted use within the Office Commercial designation. Any
mix of office and commercial uses are permitted within this designation. The average land us
intensity is 0.3 FAR.
PUBLIC/SEMI-PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LAND USES
Public/Semi-Public (P/SP-CL)
Land Use Intensity:               0.17-0.45 FAR
Maximum Site Coverage:            70%
Public/Semi-Public permits the development of civic, cultural, and governmental uses that serve the
community. These uses typically are provided by the City or other public entity, and may include a
civic center, library, fire station, police station, animal shelter, cultural center, senior center, or boys
and girls center. Neighborhood Commercial is an underlying land use if a portion of or the entire
Public/Semi-Public site is not developed as such. Development alternative applications may be
submitted to the City if the civic center complex and/or other public uses are not located on this site
within two years of CLSP approval. The average land us intensity is 0.3 FAR. Additionally, many of
these uses are permitted or conditionally permitted in other land use zones as uses such as churches,
animal shelter, and corporation yard are not appropriate within the city center.
K-8 Schools and High School (K8-CL and H-CL)
School facilities are under the jurisdiction of the Manteca Unified School District.
K-8 Schools provide educational and recreational opportunities for children between kindergarten and
eighth grades. In addition, these schools may provide joint use facilities with the community and
neighborhood parks, as well as contain storm water and water quality facilities.
High School is the designation for the school serving grades ninth through twelfth. This facility may
provide joint use opportunities for City residents in addition to containing storm water and water
quality facilities.
Schools are linked to neighborhoods by the use of sidewalks and multi-use trails interconnected
through the Plan area.
                                                  4-A-20
PARKS AND OPEN SPACE LAND USES
Parks (NP-CL and CP-CL)
Neighborhood Parks provide local recreational opportunities such as play and tot lots, ball fields, free
play areas, and picnic facilities for residents in adjacent neighborhoods. These parks generally
ranging, from 4 to 5 acres, may be joint use facilities with schools, and may contain storm water and
water quality facilities.
Community Parks allow for local and community recreation opportunities for those who live or work
in Lathrop. These parks are larger in size and provide a wide array of recreational and entertainment
opportunities which may include field sports, group picnic facilities, free play and natural areas, a dog
park, trails, a swimming center, and an indoor athletic facility. This designation includes the
riverfront linear park that parallels the San Joaquin River. This linear park provides dual multi-use
trails/maintenance roads, free play lawn areas, and picnic facilities. Community parks may be joint
use facilities with schools and may contain storm water and water quality facilities
Open Space (OS-CL)
Open Space designations encompass a large variety of natural features, buffers, storm water and
water quality management, natural habitat preservation and maintenance, and active or passive
recreational opportunities which include the river, associated lands along the river and levee, drainage
corridors, and other uses such as boat launches, picnic facilities, and fishing sites. Permitted uses
include passive and active recreation, linear detention basins and other storm water and water quality
features, and trails.
                                               4-A-21
                              LANDS WEST OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER
                                           IN SUB-PLAN AREA #3
GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Sub-Plan Area #3 represents the largest remaining area in Lathrop that is available for future master-
planned development. The 5,794-acre Stewart Tract represents a unique opportunity to control phasing of
a large-scale mixed use development designed to establish an integrated community environment west of
Interstate 5.
Sub-Plan Area #3 is envisioned as a master planned development integrating recreation-oriented
residential villages, activities centers, recreation-oriented commercial enterprises, and a regional
employment center, developed around a newly planned town center and regional commercial area.
Recreational facilities will include a golf course, parks, ball fields, tennis courts, and other similar
facilities. Development will take advantage of the proximity of the site to the San Joaquin Delta, by
offering a marina, boating, water skiing, canoeing, fishing, wildlife excursions and other water-related
activities.
The General Plan designates commercial uses in Sub-Plan Area #3. Commercial uses include an
employment center consisting of approximately 4-6 million square feet of office/business park uses, a
highway commercial area, recreation commercial and a mixed use town center with retail, entertainment,
restaurant commercial and residential uses. This development is intended to provide employment
opportunities for residents of the Lathrop area.
The General Plan also designates the Stewart Tract for residential uses. Housing areas are designated for
the perimeter of the tract along the rivers and in the interior of the tract, new neighborhoods will be
oriented around a central man-made lake and a grand canal. The lake will likely have many fingers,
extending into many of the neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods may be islands, surrounded by Stewart
Tract waterways; other neighborhoods may surround a golf course. In the most urban neighborhoods
(near retail and services within a town center), a grided street and park system will extend from the homes
to the grand canal with its wide promenade. In other neighborhoods, convenient small-scale retail will be
provided.
The General Plan designates a variety of parks, recreation and open space areas throughout the Stewart
Tract. Much of the tract’s perimeter will be preserved as a predominantly natural ecosystem, with
extensive eco-restoration within Paradise Cut. New shaded riverine aquatic habitats areas will be created
on the tract’s perimeter. Homes that abut the river edges will have views of natural habitats and yet will
be able to dock their own boats along the river. Housing along the edges of the internal central lake will
also have access to the water’s edge, with the opportunity for boat docks and water-related sports.
Neighborhood and community parks are also planned along the lake. Recreation areas range from the
more formal town center plazas and lakeside parks to traditional ball fields for league play.”
Goal: A new residential area that contains a mix of uses that supports the development of the Stewart
Tract, and promotes the economic and community vitality of Lathrop.
Objective 1: To create a community comprised of distinctive neighborhoods and to encourage
aesthetically and functionally compatible development which reinforces the physical character and
desired image of the City of Lathrop.
Policy 1.1:       A Specific Plan shall be prepared to guide and specify the distribution, location and
                  extent of land uses for Sub-Plan Area #3.
                                                    4-A-22

Policy 1.2:      Development of Sub-Plan Area #3 shall be designed to promote the efficient use of the
                 Stewart Tract while preserving important natural resources.
Policy 1.3:      The City shall promote patterns of development that facilitate the efficient and timely
                 provision of urban infrastructure and services.
RESIDENTIAL LAND USE POLICIES AND PROPOSALS
Housing and Population Density Standards
Housing and population density standards for Stewart Tract are designed to accommodate a full range of
residential densities and building intensities. While low, medium and high density housing is proposed on
Stewart Tract, the population density or persons per acre may vary because each acre may have a wider
range of housing types than is typical.
Low Density
Maximum Building Intensity: 9 housing units per acre.
Maximum Population Density: 32 persons per net acre (at 3.5 persons per household).
Medium Density:
Maximum Building Intensity: 20 housing units per net acre
Maximum Population Density: 50 Persons per net acre (at 2.5 persons per household).
High Density
Maximum Building Intensity: 40 housing units per net acre
Maximum Population Density: 100 Persons per net acre (at 2.5 persons per household)
Objective 2: To promote diversity in housing options while ensuring community compatibility and
quality residential development.
Policy 2.1:      The Specific Plan for Sub-Plan Area #3 shall identify the ranges of housing and
                 population densities expected for the SPA’s residential areas.
Policy 2.2:      Residential development within Sub-Plan Area #3 shall provide a variety of housing
                 types and a range of lot sizes throughout the Stewart Tract.
Policy 2.3:      Housing diversity within Sub-Plan Area #3 shall be encouraged through a mix of housing
                 types and sizes, attractive design, innovation in site planning and design, and housing
                 opportunities for a variety of income levels.
Policy 2.4:      The City shall promote residential project design within Sub-Plan Area #3 which reflects
                 and considers natural features, noise exposure of residents, visibility of structures,
                 circulation, access, and the relationship of the project to surrounding uses. Residential
                 densities and lot patterns will be determined by these and other factors.
Policy 2.5:      Residential subdivisions within Sub-Plan Area #3 shall be designed to provide well-
                 connected internal and external street and pedestrian systems.
Policy 2.6:      The City shall discourage the development of isolated, remote, and/or walled residential
                 projects that do not contribute to the sense of community desired for Sub-Plan Area #3.]
                                                    4-A-23

Policy 2.7:       Generally, areas proposed for Lower Density Residential Development in Sub-Plan
                  Area #3 should be located along the San Joaquin River and along Paradise Cut where
                  lower density is compatible with these natural habitat areas. They would also be located in
                  the western part of the Stewart Tract in proximity to golf course and other open space
                  amenities. The Low Density housing environment will be given specific physical
                  dimension as part of the Specific Plan for West Lathrop.
Policy 2.8:       Areas proposed for Higher Density in Sub-Plan Area #3 should be located within and
                  nearby the town center, central canal or lake and employment center, as well as near
                  convenience retail or other workplaces.
Development Standards for Residential Areas
Development standards for residential areas shall be presented as part of the Specific Plan for Stewart Tract.
Standards shall be devised which address all major components of development, operation and maintenance,
including site planning, architectural design, utility services, the design of parks, recreation areas and other
open space amenities, streets, street furniture, modes of transportation including transit, and the maintenance
of building and site areas. Development standards shall be further refined as a part of the Urban Design
Concept(s) for each development area. In addition, the developer shall provide an organizational framework
that will be capable of consistent application to the development process and to the maintenance and
operation of developed areas.
COMMERCIAL LAND USE POLICIES AND PROPOSALS
Commercial Land Use Categories
The following categories reflect the uniqueness, intensity and variety of commercial uses proposed. The
range of categories selected includes the following:
          -   Recreation Commercial
          -   Regional Commercial
          -   Mixed Use
          -   Neighborhood Commercial
Recreation Commercial
This category involves theme parks, entertainment, participatory activities, spectator events, and commercial
lodging. Taken together, this category embraces a wide variety of uses which reflect the dynamic character
of the market for commercial recreation and entertainment related activities. This suggests that some initial
uses may eventually change and that some entirely new uses may emerge even before some of the current
proposals are carried out. Evidence of evolutionary change in theme park attractions is provided by well
established theme parks in the United States.
Unless otherwise indicated, all of the uses which comprise the Recreation Commercial designation are to
reflect the following building density and intensity standards:
          Building Density:        Will vary from single story to multi-story towers and specialized
                                   structures.
          Building Intensity:      Up to 90% site area coverage, excluding off-street parking
                                                     4-A-24
Theme Park: A theme park caters to family experiences and amusements within a specially created
environment and atmosphere.
Entertainment Commercial: This category typically would involve the performing arts, nightclub dining
and dancing, celebrity shows and revues, movies and dinner theater.
Sports Activities and Events: This category responds to urban/metropolitan leisure demand, involving
participatory sports activities and spectator events. Participatory activities might involve golf courses
(executive and 18-hole championship), racquet sports, roller and ice skating rinks, bowling centers, water
parks and similar activities. Spectator activities may include amateur and professional team sports and
special commemorative and other public events.
Lodging Commercial: This category includes all forms of commercial lodging facilities other than those
covered by the Recreation Residential category, including hotels, motels, inns, lodges, bed and breakfast and
overnight facilities for motor homes and campers. These types of commercial lodging would also have such
support facilities as specialty sales, sporting goods, convenience goods, and personal and financial services
that are typical of major resorts.
Flexibility in Commercial Development
As suggested previously, the concept of flexibility in the selection of uses to be included in the various
commercial recreation attractions becomes a central policy of overriding importance. Similarly, it is an
important policy that the location of uses be considered flexible within the general limits of access described
under the topic "Commercial Concentrations", above. This degree of flexibility is needed as the market
feasibility of use selections becomes better understood and as the most promising physical relationship
among uses can be identified.
Regional Commercial
This category includes a large employment center in Sub-Plan Area #3. It would contain office, research
and development and administrative or “back” office uses. Ancillary uses to serve the daytime residents of
the business park, such as cafes, would also be expected to locate with these major employers.
Maximum Building Density: Will vary from single-story to multi-story structures up to a height of 125
feet.
Maximum Land Use Intensity: Minimum FAR of .25 to maximum FAR of .5.
Maximum Site Coverage: 65%.
The Regional Commercial use designation allows a broad range of commercial uses including regional-
and community-serving retail, service, and office uses. This land use category specially allows office
uses which provide neighborhood, citywide, and regional services such as real estate, accounting, legal,
etc.; local-serving commercial services such as laundries, dry cleaners, beauty salons, finance, and video
rentals, etc.; local, community, and regional serving retail uses; employment centers; restaurants and bars;
recreation-oriented commercial uses such as gyms, marinas, or golf courses, hotels, bed and breakfast
inns; and, entertainment and cultural facilities.
Objective 3: To promote employment-generating uses within Sub-Plan Area #3 in order to meet the
present and future needs of City residents and maintain economic vitality.
Policy 3.1:       An employment center on the Stewart Tract shall be developed at a minimum FAR of .25
                  and a maximum FAR of .5 (1 to 10 stories).
                                                     4-A-25

Policy 3.2:      An employment center shall be designed to support a variety of employment-generating,
                 commercial uses, including, but not limited to R&D, office and administrative uses.
Policy 3.3:      Commercial development within Sub-Plan Area #3 shall be designed to encourage and
                 facilitate pedestrian circulation within and between commercial sites and nearby
                 residential areas.
Mixed Use
Maximum Residential Building Intensity: 3 to 40 housing units per acre.
Maximum Land Use Intensity: .5
Maximum Population Density: 32 to 100 persons per net acre.
The purpose of the town center mixed use designation is to provide for the integration in a single project
of both residential and commercial uses. In the town center category, housing is permitted but not
required. The town center district within Sub-Plan Area #3 allows the placement of residential units over
street level businesses, as well as development of residential uses adjacent to compatible commercial
uses. Within areas designated mixed use, project densities up to 40 units per net acre will be allowed.
Additionally, this designation will support commercial uses in Sub-Plan Area #3.
Objective 4: To provide mixed use development within Sub-Plan Area #3 as a “smart growth”
alternative to development which separates housing from jobs and local services.
Policy 4.1:      The City shall encourage development of a new town center within Sub-Plan Area #3 to
                 provide a variety of goods and services to area residents.
Policy 4.2:      The City shall require minimal, or in some cases no, building setbacks for commercial
                 and office uses in a town center within Sub-Plan Area #3.
Policy 4.3:      Mixed Use Commercial uses shall be developed at a minimum FAR of .5 and a
                 maximum of (1 to10 stories). The higher densities and building heights may be
                 considered as they provide special opportunities to combine mixed use residential and
                 commercial uses.
Policy 4.4:      The Mixed Use Commercial designation shall provide for the development of buildings
                 and sites that contain a mix of uses, including the vertical integration of housing with
                 retail, office, civic or other uses.
Policy 4.5:      Town Center Commercial development should be allowed in commercial areas where the
                 residential component is compatible with the desired commercial function of the area.
Policy 4.6:      Public uses (e.g., day and senior care facilities, community meeting rooms, recreation
                 facilities, police and fire stations, etc.) shall be integrated, as necessary, with other
                 commercial and residential uses in areas designated for Mixed Use.
Neighborhood Commercial
Policy 5.1:      The City shall encourage the location of new neighborhood commercial development
                 within Sub-Plan Area #3 near residential neighborhoods, the town center, and/or major
                 transportation corridors.
                                                      4-A-26

PUBLIC, SEMI-PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONAL FACILITIES
The possible need for public, semi-public and private institutional facilities shall be determined at the time
of Specific Plan preparation, including schools, park and recreation areas, government offices, medical and
health care facilities, private clubs and lodges, and churches and other religious institutions
The Tracy Unified School District and the Banta School District provide traditional elementary, middle
and high schools. These districts are considering allowing combined K-12 schools on one or more sites.
These schools would have a curriculum focus or “magnet” such as science. This type of school is being
considered on Stewart Tract. Alternatively, traditional K-8 and high school sites and facilities may be
provided.
The Public, Semi-Public and Private Institutional Facilities designation identifies areas where
governmental or institutional type uses are anticipated within Sub-Plan Area #3. Such uses include public
facilities such as schools, libraries, police and fire stations, public agency facilities, post offices, and
utilities. Quasi-Public uses include, but are not limited to, churches, medical facilities, and community
centers.
Objective 6: To designate adequately sized, well-located areas for the development of public and quasi-
public facilities to serve both community and regional needs.
Policy 6.1:        New public and quasi-public facilities necessary for emergency response, health care, and
                   other critical functions shall be located outside areas subject to natural or artificial
                   hazards.
Policy 6.2:        Public facilities, such as wells, pumps, tanks, and yards, shall be located and designed so
                   that noise, light, odors, and appearance do not adversely affect nearby land uses.
Policy 6.3:        Sub-Plan Area #3 should provide sufficient land area for school sites. In the alternative,
                   the City may establish appropriate mechanisms for funding development of school
                   facilities through the use of development fees.
Flexibility in Development Phasing
Within the context of flexibility described above, development priorities for Sub-Plan Area #3 seek to
maximize the opportunity for success while allowing for uncertainties in the market for development related
policies include the following:
1.        Phase 1 development is to focus on land in close proximity to the proposed arterials providing
          access to Stewart Tract. A clear intent is to relate development to an assured capability of access,
          including transit access, without adverse impacts on the environment. Development of adequate
          circulation will be a major component of the Specific Plan prepared for West Lathrop.
2.        Phase 1 development will be conditioned on the availability of permanent supplies of domestic
          water to adequately serve Phase 1, and capability for reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation and
          other appropriate purposes consistent with applicable regional water quality control standards.
3.        All development phasing shall be undertaken to avoid the premature conversion of agricultural
          land to urban use, and to avoid conflicts with existing farming operations.
                                                      4-A-27

4.        Phasing shall provide for the appropriate extension of infrastructure to the boundaries of the next
          phase, and for the development and maintenance of open space corridors.
While final decisions on the extent of development to be included in initial and subsequent phases of
development will be determined in large part by the economic impacts of the project suggested by this
phasing will be very significant to Lathrop and other cities of the region. During the anticipated 20+ year
period of project construction, several thousand temporary construction jobs will be created. At build out, it
is estimated that about 17,000 new jobs will be created. The project will also contribute sales tax revenue,
property tax revenue and occupancy and inventory tax revenues.
RESOURCE, CONSERVATION & OPEN SPACE
The Resource/Conservation/Open Space designation includes agricultural land, wildlife habitat,
watershed areas, parks, rangeland, and conservation areas of Sub-Plan Area #3. Specific permitted uses
within this area will be determined according to the River Island Specific Plan but may include golf
courses, agricultural activities, grazing, campgrounds, ball fields, public and private parks, marinas,
hiking trails, habitat preservation and restoration, resource conservation areas, and other low-intensity
uses.
Objective 7: To designate land within Sub-Plan Area #3 to promote public and private recreational
facilities to serve the needs of residents and visitors while affording opportunities for habitat
conservation.
Policy 7.1:       New parks and recreational facilities including, but not limited to, parks, plazas and ball
                  fields, should be integrated with residential neighborhoods, as new residential
                  development occurs within Sub-Plan Area #3.
Policy 7.2:       Water-oriented recreational development, such as marinas, boating areas, and parks shall
                  be encouraged within residential neighborhoods and commercial areas along Stewart
                  Tract waterways.
Policy 7.3:       Significant natural open space and cultural resources should be identified prior to
                  development and incorporated into site-specific development project design.
Policy 7.4:       Development within Sub-Plan Area #3 should be planned and designed to avoid or
                  minimize effects on areas rich in wildlife or of a fragile ecological nature (e.g., areas of
                  rare or endangered plant and animal species, riparian areas). Alternatively, where
                  avoidance is infeasible or where equal or greater ecological benefits can be obtained
                  through off-site mitigation, the City shall allow project proponents to contribute to off-
                  site mitigation efforts in lieu of on-site mitigation.

                                               SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
USE OF SPECIFIC PLANS IN GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
Because of the degrees of flexibility to be accorded development within SPA's #2 and #3, The Specific Plan
is intended to be the primary instrument of General Plan implementation.7 Specific Plans may be adopted
either before or after annexation but under all circumstances shall be adopted prior to the approval of a
Tentative Map or other land use entitlement. Development on Stewart Tract and Central Lathrop shall be
governed by a Specific Plan and associated Urban Design Concept(s) and/or Design Guidelines. Several
integrated Specific Plans shall be provided to eventually cover all of SPA #2. The Specific Plan shall fulfill
the interpretive and illustrative functions described in Part II of this report. In addition, the Specific Plan
and Urban Design Concept(s) shall provide a set of development regulations to be applied, in whole or part,
in lieu of or in addition to provisions of the City's Zoning Ordinance. The Specific Plan shall also set forth
the standards of architectural design, site planning, landscaping, signage and exterior building and site
maintenance to be applied and administered. [Note: see Part VII for further discussion of the Specific Plan.]
OTHER LAND USE PROPOSALS EXAMINED
While several "sketch plans" were prepared for the entire Lathrop planning area prior to the selection of land
use proposals depicted on the 1991 General Plan Diagram, the final configuration of land uses in SPA's #2
and #3 are the subject of Specific Plans. Initial proposals were based on very long range assumptions of
development potential beyond the 20 year perspective now reflected by the General Plan. Prior to
incorporation in the 1991 General Plan, those initial proposals were modified because of factors concerned
with transportation, circulation and traffic, infrastructure development costs, and environmental impact.
Those initial land use proposals have since been modified by the West Lathrop Specific Plan prepared for
the Mossdale Village and Stewart Tract portions of Sub-Plan Areas #2 and #3 (respectively) and adopted by
the City of Lathrop in 1996 and the Central Lathrop area of Sub-Plan Area #2 and adopted by the City in
2004. The City ensured that the Central and West Lathrop Specific Plans responded to these factors
summarized below because of their importance to the study of environmental impacts and the need for
mitigation measures that have been made a part of Stewart Tract proposals as presented in this General Plan
document.
Transportation, Circulation and Traffic Considerations
1.       The magnitude and complexity of urbanization anticipated by the General Plan over the next 20
         years requires that transportation and circulation requirements be satisfied in significant part by
         external and internal modes of transit and the concurrent need to reduce dependence on the
         automobile. [See transit proposals in Section B of Part IV].
2.       The location of the Lathrop Planning Area alongside Interstate and State freeway facilities requires
         a vehicle circulation system that avoids use of the freeway system as a means of moving traffic
         among points in the Lathrop urban area, and which preserves potential for through traffic increases
         along freeway sections well into the future.
3.       The land use pattern for Stewart Tract requires the concentration of more intensive commercial
         areas in close proximity to transit stations and arterial access from the freeway system.
  7
         The term "Specific Plan" shall be consistent with the meaning and content of a Specific Plan as prescribed under Article
         8, Chapter 3, Division I, Title 7 of the California Planning and Zoning Law.
                                                                4-A-29
Infrastructure Development Costs
By the general location of more intensive uses as shown on the General Plan Diagram, excessive costs will
be avoided in extending streets and utilities to the site. The land use configuration also avoids the potential
for adverse cumulative impact on existing agriculture in the northwestern half of the Stewart Tract since
initial phases of development can occur nearest to existing infrastructure and subsequent development will
proceed toward the northwest when the market exists for the uses proposed there.
Environmental Concerns
The more important environmental concerns posed by the original plan included the following:
1.       The potential for freeway traffic congestion and the need for a transit mode (covered above).
2.       A requirement to place the wastewater treatment plant and basic disposal ponds at a high elevation
         and therefore a prominent location on the Stewart Tract.
3.       A need to set aside substantial acreage for winter storage of treated wastewater [if disposal ponds
         are to be located on the Stewart Tract].
4.       A need to increase the size of open space areas that can be used for wildlife habitat enhancement.
5.       The need to avoid any development within the Paradise Cut flood plain except wildlife parks and
         similar uses that will not reduce the amount of land available for containing flood waters.
6.       The need for development phasing that will maintain the integrity of agricultural operations on
         lands that are not slated for early conversion to urban use.
These environmental limitations as posed by the original sketch plan for the Stewart Tract are met and/or
avoided by proposals shown on the General Plan Diagram and as described in the General Plan text.

                   SECTION B - TRANSPORTATION & CIRCULATION
INTRODUCTION
The Transportation & Circulation component of the Community Development Element includes state
highways, arterial and collector streets, minor streets, pedestrian ways, alleys, bicycle routes, railroad
service, local and regional transit and regional air transport. Requirements for these facilities are based on
the land use proposals described in Section IV-A, and as shown on the General Plan Diagram. Traffic
projections are based on the transportation model being utilized by the San Joaquin County Council of
Governments, and take into account projected regional demands of through traffic on the freeway system as
well as demands generated by the projected pattern of land use for Lathrop.
Circulation facilities within the community are a function of land use in that they exist to move people and
goods among the centers of various land use in (and outside) the community. In addition, the extent of use
imposed by such centers of activity on any circulation facility is a product of the collective demand of land
use to be served. It therefore follows that close correlation with the Land Use Element has been established
as a pre-requisite to the planning of circulation facilities. Of special importance is assurance that adequate
capacity and safety will exist for each of the circulation components at such time as they will be needed
over the 20 year planning period to 2012.
THE REGIONAL SETTING
The combination of freeway, rail, air and local street and road systems within south-central San Joaquin
County provides an unusually good transportation network as a basis for accommodating urbanization in
the Lathrop area. The most important facilities having regional impact are the interstate highways I-5 and
205, State Route 120, State Route 99, the transcontinental lines of the (former) Southern Pacific and Union
Pacific Railroads and the Stockton Metropolitan Airport. These facilities converge at or near the Lathrop
planning area, linking the community with other regions of the State and the Nation. They place Lathrop
"on line" for interregional and interstate air, rail, truck and automobile traffic, and, as a consequence,
enhance the economic opportunities of the community.
FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF HIGHWAYS AND STREETS
The functional classification of highways and streets shown on the General Plan Diagram includes
Freeway, Arterial, and Collector streets, along with Minor streets which are not shown on the Plan
Diagram. Since traffic generation is a function of land use, two different sections of the same street may
require different standards of design and improvement because of different levels of projected traffic, even
though the street is classified for the same function(s) throughout its entire length.
Freeways
Interstate 5 (I-5) is part of the national system of Interstate and Defense Highways, extending from British
Columbia to the Mexican border. It is the most important component of the Interstate system for north-
south interregional and interstate travel. Locally, it connects with Interstate 205 along the southern
boundary of the Lathrop planning area, providing a direct link with the San Francisco Bay Area. I-5 is
                                                     4-B-1
developed to 6-lanes through the planning area, with a potential for 8-lanes plus an auxiliary lane in each
direction. Access to I-5 is provided by interchanges at Roth Road, Lathrop Road and Louise Avenue.
Interstate 205 (I-205) and its connection with I-580 west of Tracy provides the only east-west interstate
freeway linkage between the Central Valley and the California Coast between the Los Angeles basin and
Interstate 80 at Sacramento. It is developed with four lanes to its connection with I-580 west of Tracy and
is being considered by Caltrans for widening to six lanes in the next 5-10 years.
State Route 120 along the southern part of Sub-Plan Area #1 connects Lathrop with the Sierra foothill
communities and mountain recreation areas to the east. It provides vital freeway linkage between
communities along Route 99 south of Manteca through the San Joaquin Valley, and with the S.F. Bay Area
via Interstate 205 at Lathrop and I-580 west of Tracy. Developed initially as a three-lane freeway, SR 120
is scheduled for expansion to four lanes from the Yosemite Avenue interchange to Route 99 by 1996 or
earlier.
Route 99 four miles east of Lathrop is part of the State's freeway system and is developed to full freeway
standards with an interchange at Lathrop Road and a freeway-to-freeway connection with SR 120. Until
construction of I-5 in the 1970's, Route 99 was the only north-south freeway serving the Central Valley.
Arterial Streets
Arterial streets form the principal network for cross-town traffic flow within the community and connect
areas of major traffic generation. They also provide connections to the City of Manteca just east of
Lathrop and with important elements of the County Road system, such as Airport Way. Airport Way,
located one mile east of Lathrop, is a north-south County Arterial connecting with the City of Stockton on
the north and Route 120 at Manteca on the south, and provides a direct connection with the Stockton
Metropolitan Airport.
Arterial streets shown on the General Plan Diagram are intended to provide a high level of traffic service by
the number of traffic lanes provided and wide spacing of intersections with other through streets.
Generally, arterials do not allow direct access to abutting properties. Arterial streets may control access to
abutting property by requiring back-on development (with ornamental walls or fencing and landscaping),
by the spacing of intersecting streets and by limiting driveway connections. Arterial streets also provide for
the collection and distribution of traffic to and from Collector streets which provide internal access to
residential, commercial and industrial areas.
Collector Streets
Collector streets provide for traffic movement between Arterial and Minor streets and for traffic movement
within major activity centers. They also provide direct access to abutting properties.
Minor Streets
Minor streets provide for direct access to abutting properties and for very localized traffic movements
within residential, commercial and industrial areas. Under ideal conditions of street design, they are of
short length and do not allow for through traffic.

Alleys
Alleys are intended to provide secondary access to abutting properties and to accommodate utility lines and
refuse disposal services. They are most often located to the rear of properties and occasionally provide side
access to parcels. Alleys exist only in the 14 block older residential area between 5th and 7th Streets south
of Roth Rd. to O Street. Some new alleys will likely be a part of the residential neighborhoods on Stewart
Tract and Central Lathrop.
POLICIES AND PROPOSALS FOR INTERSTATE AND STATE ROUTE FREEWAYS
SERVING THE LATHROP AREA
I-5, I-205, SR 120 and SR 99 are all experiencing heavy current peak hour traffic demands as the result of
the extensive residential expansion that is occurring in the region which in turn is due to the demand for
housing for people employed within the San Francisco Bay Area. Because of their role in the interstate and
state highway systems, traffic on these highways can be expected to increase substantially over the next 20
years. Because of practical constraints to the number of lanes and traffic capacity that can be added to any
freeway section, protection of the "through" traffic function of the freeway becomes paramount.
Policies
1.        The City should protect the through traffic functions of Interstate and State Route Freeways
          serving the Lathrop area by planning arterial street alignments which will avoid the need or desire
          to utilize freeway sections for short, local area interval trips as if they were elements of the local
          arterial street system.
2.        Land use designations along freeway sections should take into consideration the visual and noise
          impacts associated with existing and future traffic levels on these major traffic carrying facilities.
3.        Freeway interchanges should be improved to carry the demands of traffic generated by
          development in Lathrop in keeping with the principle that responsibility for improvements must
          reflect the fair apportionment of traffic to existing and future regional demands v. local demands.
Proposals
Only existing interchanges (with some improvements) will be required on I-5 and SR 120. A new
interchange at I-5/Squires Road will not be required as previously proposed by the Draft General Plan/EIR
published August 1, 1991. Expansion of the existing partial interchange at Yosemite Avenue is needed to
serve the considerable industrial growth envisioned along the north-south corridor framed by the railroads,
and is planned by Caltrans. One new interchange will be required along I-205 to accommodate traffic
generated by new development on Stewart Tract. The most likely candidate is to convert the grade
separation at Paradise Road to a full interchange. The ones shown on the General Plan Diagram are
illustrative. Final location(s) will be determined during implementation of the West Lathrop Specific Plan.
                                                        4-B-4
POLICIES AND PROPOSALS FOR ARTERIAL STREETS
Policies
1.       Arterials constructed to boulevard standards are to be the principal carriers of north-south traffic
         through SPA's #2 and #3. They typically involve 4-6 lanes but in rare cases can be 2 lanes,
         depending on the amount of traffic capacity required along a given section, with landscaped
         dividers between intersections and left turn lanes and signalization at each intersection. Sufficient
         right-of-way is required to include room for landscaped pedestrian corridors along either side.
         Spacing between intersections with crossing streets should be in the range of 1,000 to preferably
         2,500 feet. Spacing between "T" intersections should be at least 800 feet. On-street parking is to
         be prohibited. [See Figure IV-2 for typical right-of-way cross sections].
2.       Arterials are to be typically constructed for 4-6 lanes of traffic with left turn lanes provided at
         intersections, although in infrequently arterials may be 2 lanes wide. Development through
         residential areas should be designed to back-on to the Arterial, with ornamental walls and
         landscaping along the right-of-way line. In areas where development fronts the arterial, the design
         for a 2- or 4-lane facility should provide for a minimum right-of-way of 84', with 12' travel lanes,
         two 8' parking lanes and two 10' minimum planting strips for the accommodation of sidewalks and
         street trees. Commercial sidewalks 10' in width need only be provided in retail commercial areas
         and along the frontages of other pedestrian-intensive uses. Street trees should be provided along all
         Arterial streets. Rights-of-way should be widened at the approaches to major intersections to
         provide space for additional turn lanes. [See Figure IV-3 for typical rights-of-way cross sections.]
3.       Arterial streets serving Service Commercial and Industrial areas are to be designed and constructed
         to standards which reflect heavy truck traffic and the need for longer turning radii for trucks at
         intersections. On-street parking shall be prohibited.
Proposals
A north-south arterial (designated Golden Valley Parkway on the Plan Diagram) is proposed west of I-5
extending north and south from Lathrop Road on an alignment generally parallel to I-5 to avoid pressure to
use I-5 for local traffic movement. This arterial would eventually cross the San Joaquin River, extending
into Stewart Tract, with eventual connection to one or more interchanges with I-205 farther west.
An east-west arterial bisecting the center of the Central Lathrop Specific Plan area is Lathrop Road, which
currently exists only on the eastern side of I-5. This arterial will provide access to collector streets,
neighborhoods, and commercial centers.
Another arterial is proposed to eventually enter Stewart Tract by crossing the San Joaquin River as an
extension of Louise Avenue (now referred to as River Islands Parkway). Neither of these arterials to
Stewart Tract will be needed until substantial commercial development occurs on Stewart Tract. In the
interim, Manthey Road (the frontage road along the west side of I-5) will continue to provide access onto
the Stewart Tract from SPA #2. With lane improvements, Manthey may provide primary access to the
Stewart Tract from the north for 5-10 years. An eventual third arterial could enter Stewart Tract from the
east (under I-5) via the southwesterly extension of Yosemite Avenue from its interchange with SR 120.

              FIGURE IV-3
ILLUSTRATIVE ARTERIAL CROSS-SECTIONS
                 4-B-7
Overall phasing and secondary impacts of circulation improvements shall be indicated in both the West
Lathrop and Central Lathrop Specific Plans.
Arterial streets alignments west of I-5 are illustrative. These Arterials serve as boundaries between
residential villages and between commercial and non-commercial areas. North-south Arterials east of I-5
include McKinley Avenue, Howland Road and Harlan Road. The east-west Arterials are Roth Road,
Lathrop Road, Louise Avenue and Yosemite Avenue (extending east from its interchange with SR 120).
The arterial street proposal is designed to significantly alter existing traffic patterns which rely heavily on
Lathrop Road and Louise Avenue interchanges with I-5 to accommodate traffic generated to and from
Manteca. The key elements in this regard will be the following:
1.       Improve Roth Road to 6 traffic lanes between I-5 and Airport Way, along with railroad separation
         structures.
2.       Improve Airport Way to 6 traffic lanes from Roth Road to SR 120.
3.       Improve Yosemite Avenue to 6 traffic lanes from SR 120 to the Manteca city limits.
4.       Improve Lathrop Road and Louise Avenue to 4 traffic lanes between I-5 and the Manteca city
         limits; provide railroad separation structures along Lathrop Road.
5.       Construct an at-grade crossing of the Southern Pacific Railroad from the Crossroads Industrial
         Park along the line of Vierra Avenue and curving south to Yosemite Avenue.
These improvements will permit east-west traffic desiring access to I-5 to be diverted around the existing
developed area of Lathrop, thus reducing traffic impacts on the Lathrop Road and Louise Avenue
interchanges and on freeway sections between Roth Road on the north and the I-5/SR 120 merge on the
south. These and other arterial street proposals will assure volume-to-capacity ratios on all street sections
at Level of Service C, and on all interchange ramps at Level of Service D.
COLLECTOR STREETS
Policies
1.       Collector streets are to be designed to carry from 500 to 5,000 vehicles per day. Where average
         daily traffic (ADT) is projected to be less than 4,000, a ROW of 60' may be sufficient. As an
         illustration, development might involve two 11’ or 12' travel lanes, two 8' parking lanes and two
         10' minimum planting strips with sidewalks. Sidewalk width may not have to exceed 4'- 5' in width
         except where intensive pedestrian traffic is expected. [See Figure IV-4]
2.       Where ADT is projected above 4,000 to 5,000 in residential areas, a 64' right-of-way may be
         required. In commercial and industrial areas, four lanes of traffic may be required. Where ADT is
         projected above 5,000, with high peak hour traffic, wider cross-sections will be required. Rights-
         of-way may require widening on their approaches to Arterials or other Major Collector streets in
         order to provide suitable turn lanes.
                                                     4-B-8

3. The high costs of converting a deficient Collector street to the appropriate standards required for
   existing and projected traffic should be limited to only those streets where either: a) high current
   and projected volumes of traffic are involved; b) joint funding is possible; c) significant
   contributions of private or assessment district funds are involved as part of the cost of developing
   adjacent lands; or d) where the rate of serious accidents has been high and where hazards to public
   safety are great.

                                                  Proposals
Collector streets shown on the Plan Diagram for areas east of I-5 and west of the S.P. Railroad for the
most part follow existing streets which already serve as Collectors. Collector streets shown west of I-5 and
in undeveloped areas east of I-5 are intended to be more illustrative of providing internal access within
residential, commercial and industrial areas.
THE MINOR STREET SYSTEM
Minor street deficiencies have become extensive in the older residential areas of Lathrop, including broken
pavement (ripples and chuckholes), missing or deteriorated curb/gutter/sidewalk sections and inadequate
drainage. Minor streets are to be designed to carry up to 500 vehicles per day, with a typical ROW of 60'
and a minimum of 40' between curbs. Other rights of way widths, both less and greater, have been
approved within the West and Central Lathrop Specific Plan areas. [See Figure IV-5 for typical cross-
sections that may be applied.]
Minor Street Policies
1.       To keep Minor street volume within design capacity, street length shall be kept under 1,200 feet
         where possible unless interrupted by an Arterial or Collector street.
2.       Design standards shall permit innovation and flexibility by the developer in relation to land use
         proposals under Planned Development procedures of the Zoning Ordinance or under any applicable
         adopted Specific Plan.
3.       In view of deficiencies in existing Minor streets, the City should consider forms of funding which
         include direct public sources (e.g., through redevelopment or assessment districts) as a means of
         overcoming Minor street deficiencies. Curb, gutter, sidewalk and paving needs along Minor streets
         might alternatively be made the responsibility of affected property owners. Under this approach,
         the City could assume responsibility for engineering services and additional costs occasioned by
         higher standards of street construction and drainage than were involved at the time of original
         street construction. The City might also share equally in total costs where a majority of property
         owners are willing to accept assessment proceedings or another appropriate method of collective
         project financing.
4.       Policies for Minor streets are intended to reflect options for reducing through traffic on minor
         streets between intersections with Arterials. This policy seeks to eliminate the use of Minor streets
         as thoroughfares through residential areas where they extend parallel to nearby Arterials or
         Collectors for many blocks and are often used as substitutes for Arterials or Collectors.
         Illustrations of how this policy may be implemented are shown on Figure IV-6.
ALLEYS
While alleys can provide an important means of secondary access to residential, commercial and industrial
areas, their use is to be restricted to providing access to the rear of residential uses which front upon an
Arterial or other street types, to provide parking access to the rear of multi-family residential sites, and to
provide parking and loading access to commercial and industrial sites. Certain parts of the City are
                                                    4-B-12
encouraged to explore innovative and alternative neighborhood design and unit plotting within the
community that utilizes alleys. Alleys are permitted within the Central Lathrop Specific Plan area.

ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO REDUCING THROUGH TRAFFIC ON MINOR STREETS
                                4-B-14
                                              TRUCK ROUTES
Other than streets where local truck deliveries are required, truck routes are to be limited to arterial streets
which serve commercial and industrial areas close to freeway interchanges, to the Roth Road, Lathrop
Road, and Louise Avenue (River Islands Parkway) arterials east of Interstate 5 and to the arterials which
provide access to Stewart Tract. These routes are intended to carry heavyweight commercial and industrial
vehicles through and around the community with minimum disruption to local auto traffic and minimum
annoyance to residential areas.
BICYCLE ROUTES
The system of open space corridors proposed throughout existing and future areas of urban development
are intended to accommodate bike paths and walkways separate from the street system. Within Sub-Plan
Area #2, the basic system would connect all school sites, park sites, commercial areas which serve
Villages, and the City Center. Within Sub-Plan Area #3, selected open space corridors would assure
bicycle and pedestrian movement throughout Stewart Tract to complement other transit intended to
minimize (and in some cases avoid) use of the automobile among commercial and residential areas. Within
Sub-Plan Area #1, bicycle routes would be included as part of the street system, with Class II striping
provided as part of the roadway along the Roth Road, Lathrop Road and Louise Avenue arterials, along
Harlan Road and Seventh Street. Other routes within S-P Area #1 would be made a part of the roadway
without striping.
THE RAILROAD CORRIDORS
The (former) Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroad corridors carry main line freight traffic through
the community. All Arterial street crossings are protected by automatic signals and gates, but the noise
generated by train traffic can adversely affect the immediate environment adjacent to the railroads. This is
especially true for the (former) Southern Pacific because of its relationship to existing and planned
residential areas.
Both the (former) S.P. and Union Pacific Railroad corridors are to be preserved (and if necessary
expanded) in recognition of their potential for high speed inter-regional rail service in the future.
TRANSIT FACILITIES
Transit proposals are critical to the land use proposals of the General Plan which call for major commercial
and industrial expansion of the community within both growth centers, and in consideration of commuters
who will live within or close to Lathrop.
Regional Transit
Regional transit capability potentially exists by utilizing the (former) Southern Pacific and the Union
Pacific Railroad lines/rights-of-way which connect with the Bay Area to the west, the Stockton and
Sacramento metro areas to the north and major cities of the San Joaquin Valley and Southern California.
This capability has been under study since the 1970's and there is an excellent chance that such service will
be initiated during the 1990's. The General Plan Diagram shows transit stations (illustrative) along the
(former) S.P. Railroad for regional transit, with potential service provided to major cities of the Bay Area-
                                                    4-B-15
Sacramento-Stockton triangle. One station is shown within Stewart Tract because of the importance of
regional transit as a means to mitigate the adverse impacts of added traffic on the freeway system and
regional air quality. A second station (not shown) is proposed near the junction of the S.P. lines at Lathrop
Road and McKinley Avenue. This second station has potential in the event that high speed transit becomes
a reality between the Los Angeles Basin and the Bay Area via the S.P. mainline through the San Joaquin
Valley.
Local Transit
Adequate provision for the establishment of a bus system as the initial approach to local transit is to be
considered a fundamental policy of transportation and circulation. Planning for an integrated bus system
should be made a requirement of Specific Plan preparation so as to identify the streets requiring turnouts
for bus stops. The implementation of a bus system to connect residential areas with major activity centers
is an objective to be considered during early stages of buildout. Such a system will be especially important
to provide express service to major employment centers during peak hours of commuting from Lathrop's
residential areas.
FINANCING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE TRANSPORTATION/CIRCULATION SYSTEM
Financing street and highway improvements has become complicated by the reduction of funds formerly
available from the State and Federal governments, and by the reduction in local property taxes after
passage of Proposition 13. Gas tax subventions to municipalities have dropped relative to amounts
received prior to the oil price increase of the mid-1970's because of the greater mileage per gallon gained by
modern vehicles. Moreover, not all of the gas tax money is allocated to transportation purposes originally
intended by the Collier-Burns Act. As financial capabilities to maintain and improve streets and highways
have diminished, cities and counties have had to turn to new and sometimes innovative sources of funding.
The 1/2 cent sales tax approved recently by San Joaquin County voters is an example of local government
filling the gap left by reduced state and federal funding. Another example is the special fee established
upon new development by the County for needed improvements to the County road system.
One of the more important new means to finance Arterial street improvements in California cities is the use
of fees required by local ordinances for fair-share contributions by developers of non-residential as well as
residential areas toward the off-site cost of intersection improvement, signalization and arterial street
widening. Such fees are needed to aid the City in overcoming deficiencies of existing Arterial streets, such
as Lathrop Road and Louise Avenue between I-5 and the east city limits. Fees levied in relation to the
amount of traffic generated by a project may be the only way in which the City can accumulate the amount
of matching funds necessary to gain federal and state funding for such a project.
Another type of fee that may be required is that necessary to off-set required long-term improvements to the
freeway system serving the City that are occasioned by the demands of Lathrop-generated traffic. Whether
or the extent to which such a freeway traffic mitigation fee may be required is discussed in the General Plan
EIR made a part of this document.
While developer fees and state and federal monies will help, they will not raise the funds necessary to
overcome the substantial deficiencies in street improvements that have accumulated over the years, and that
continue to increase each year. Streets in older areas of the City are in some cases experiencing rapid
decline because of age, lack of improvements, and inadequate maintenance. For these areas, the only
                                                     4-B-16
solution (and perhaps the fairest) may be the formation of assessment districts for properties that would
benefit directly from the improvement.
Assessment district financing for street (and other improvements) is practiced extensively throughout
California. Property owners within a district are charged according to the proportional benefits they
receive. Assessment districts are not imposed by a City Council. While they may be sponsored or urged
by the City for consideration by landowners, they are very often created at the behest of the affected
property owners. The process begins with a request to the City for certain improvements from a
neighborhood or specific area of the City. Boundaries are then established, and the City Engineer prepares
plans for the improvements. Plans and estimated costs for the proposed improvements are mailed to all
property owners within the boundaries of the potential district. The plans are later posted prominently
throughout the potential district and published in the local newspaper. If protests to the proposed district
are minimal, a resolution is drafted for consideration by the City Council. If protests are substantial, or if
there is any question raised as to the extent of resistance, then the Council can call for an election. A
majority of 50.0+ % of the eligible voters is needed for approval, whereas a 50.0% vote can defeat a
proposal. A City Council can overrule a negative response from the voters by a four-fifths majority only if
the project is deemed essential for public safety.
Because of Lathrop's modest current size, consideration should be given to forming an assessment district
for the entire City in order to overcome the deficiencies that already exist. Under this approach, developers
of land could also be charged fair-share fees to contribute toward amortizing the costs of certain types of
off-site improvements (e.g., intersection signalization) provided through assessment district financing.
The California Legislature has also provided relatively new means to finance certain types of improvements
and services required on a large-scale basis. The Mello-Roos and Marks-Roos approaches offer significant
opportunities for financing many types of capital improvements that will be required as the community
grows.
REGIONAL AIR TRANSPORTATION
The City is extremely fortunate in having the Stockton Metropolitan Airport within only a few minutes
travel time. This jet airport is capable of handling any of the existing commercial passenger and freight jet
aircraft in use. Consequently, its contribution to the advantages of Lathrop as a major center of economic
activity within the County is potentially significant. The County General Plan calls for expanding Airport
Way as a principal means of access to the airport from both Manteca and Lathrop.
It is important to note that the City of Stockton is proposing to extend the airport's "Area of Influence"
south to Lathrop Road in the City of Lathrop. This will require that the City acquire navigation easements
over affected land areas. [See discussion under the Section B - Noise, of the Hazard Management Element
in Part V of this document.]

                                      SECTION C- HOUSING
INTRODUCTION TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
Recognizing the importance of providing adequate housing in all communities, the State of California has
mandated a Housing Element within every General Plan since 1969. It is one of the seven elements
required by the State. Article 10.6, Section 65580 – 65589.8, Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the
Government Code sets forth the legal requirements of the Housing Element and encourages the provision
of affordable and decent housing in all communities to meet Statewide goals. Specifically, Section 65580
states the element shall consist of ". . . an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing
needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources and scheduled
programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing." The element must also
contain a five-year housing plan with quantified objectives for the implementation of the goals and
objectives of the Housing Element. The contents of the element must be consistent with the other
elements of the General Plan.
Meeting the housing needs established by the State of California is an important goal for the City of
Lathrop. As the population of the State continues to grow and scarce resources decline, it becomes more
difficult for local agencies to create adequate housing opportunities while maintaining a high standard of
living for all citizens in the community.
This Housing Element (2003-2008) was created in compliance with State General Plan law pertaining to
Housing Elements and was adopted by the Lathrop City Council on June 15 2004.
PURPOSE
The State of California has declared that “the availability of housing is of vital statewide importance and
the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family is a
priority of the highest order.” In addition, government and the private sector should cooperate to provide
a diversity of housing opportunity and accommodate regional housing needs. At the same time, housing
policy must recognize economic, environmental and fiscal factors and community goals within the
general plan.
Further, State Housing Element law requires “An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of
resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs.” The law requires:
       q    An analysis of population and employment trends
       q    An analysis of the City’s fair share of the regional housing needs
       q    An analysis of household characteristics
       q    An inventory of suitable land for residential development
       q    An analysis of the governmental and non-governmental constraints on the improvement,
            maintenance and development of housing
       q    An analysis of special housing needs
       q    An analysis of opportunities for energy conservation
Adopted June 2004                                   1

       q   An analysis of publicly-assisted housing developments that may convert to non-assisted
           housing developments
The purpose of these requirements is to develop an understanding of the existing and projected housing
needs within the community and to set forth policies and schedules which promote preservation,
improvement and development of diverse types and costs of housing throughout Lathrop.
ORGANIZATION
Lathrop’s Housing Element is organized into three primary sections:
Summary of Existing Conditions: This section includes an inventory of resources, housing cost and
affordability, at-risk units, suitable land for development, and a section discussing constraints, efforts and

Housing Needs, Issues/Trends: This section includes a discussion of State issues and policies, regional
housing policies, and Lathrop’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) and housing issues.
Housing Program: This section identifies housing goals, policies and objectives. Funding sources are
identified and schedules for implementation are set forth. In addition, a quantified objectives summary is
provided.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
State Law requires that “…the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated,
internally consistent, and compatible statement of policies….” The purpose of requiring internal
consistency is to avoid policy conflict and provide a clear policy guide for the future maintenance,
improvement and development of housing within the City.
This Housing Element is part of a comprehensive Lathrop General Plan. The plan was last revised in
December 2002 and amended January 2003. All elements of the Lathrop General Plan have been
reviewed for consistency and the Housing Element was prepared to assure compatibility with the
remaining elements.
CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
In the past, the City of Lathrop has made diligent efforts to solicit public participation pertaining to the
development of the 1991 General Plan, and subsequent revisions, specific plan developments, and the
zoning ordinance. These processes included workshops, public review and citizen participation.
Meetings are held at various times to ensure that all members of the community have access to the
participation process.
Public participation for the 2003-2008 Housing Element included a series of public workshops and public
hearings. Notices were posted in English and Spanish in the local newspaper, at the City Hall, the senior
center, the community center, at the public schools, and in the San Joaquin County Library. In addition, a
public review draft, dated November 2003 was prepared and made available to the community for a 60-
day review period. No written comments were received by the City. Copies of the draft were made
Adopted June 2004                                   2

available in public facilities such as the City Hall, the library, the community center, and the City’s
website. Copies were mailed to 19 service providers and individuals representing all economic segments
of the population including local housing developers, utilities, nearby Cities, the Salvation Army, and the
San Joaquin Housing Authority, See Attachment F. Finally, during the preparation of the Housing
Element, local groups and individuals were consulted by phone such as the senior center, affordable
housing developers, and City Council members.
REVIEW OF PREVIOUS ELEMENT
State law requires the City of Lathrop to review its Housing Element in order to evaluate:
    a.   “The effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the community’s housing goals and
        objectives.”
    b. “The progress of the City, County, or City and County in implementation of the Housing
        Element.”
    c. “The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives and policies in contributing to the
        attainment of the state housing goal.”
The remainder of this section fulfills this State requirement.
EFFECTIVENESS OF PREVIOUS ELEMENT
The State’s housing goal is met by an assignment of gross allocations of housing unit goals to regional
governments, which in turn allocate the housing unit goals to counties and cities. The document produced
by regional governments that allocates housing unit goals is referred to as the “Regional Housing Needs
Assessment” (RHNA). Due to a lack of State funding, regional governments did not produce a RHNA
between 1994 and 1998. The last funded RHNA for San Joaquin County was in 1990 from the San
Joaquin Council of Governments (SJCOG) and covered the period 1991 through 1996. Since there was
not a RHNA between 1994 and 1998, the 1990 RHNA remained in effect through the end of 2001. For
accuracy of reporting, the 1990 period has been extended to 2001. Even though the title of this Housing
Element includes the dates “2003 - 2008,” it will actually cover the needs and accomplishments for the
period 2002 through 2008. The 2003-2008 RHNA is discussed in Section 2.2-New Construction Needs,
p. 55.
According to the California Department of Finance (DOF) housing unit estimates, three out of seven
incorporated cities, including the City of Lathrop, under the jurisdiction of SJCOG were not able to
achieve the goal for new construction during the previous Housing Element period. Cumulatively, the
RHNA for San Joaquin County was for 32,657 new units. A total 21,040 units were constructed.

The effectiveness of Lathrop’s Housing Program in meeting regional housing needs can be measured by
the level of achievement. The level of achievement is simply the actual construction divided by the
RHNA goal. Many uncontrollable factors influence the City’s effectiveness. Over the 10-year Housing
Element period, various factors such as market fluctuations, available programs, willing lenders, qualified
developers and the political climate, all combined to influence new housing unit creation in the City of
Lathrop. The result was that the City achieved 73.0 percent of its RHNA objective between 1991 and
2001, the effective dates of the last reporting period.

During the years of 1990-1996, the state went through a major recession, which adversely affected the
housing industry. Though out this recession, Lathrop experienced slow job growth, which resulted in a
decrease in demand for housing and a low interest in developing new housing units.
Prior to the recession, the City of Lathrop had existed as a community in San Joaquin County. When it
incorporated in 1988, the City of Lathrop was largely developed or had significant territory already zoned
for uses that would not necessarily meet the City’s RHNA. This existing development and pre-existing
zoning made only small parcels available to create multi-family housing. To try to meet its housing
needs, the City of Lathrop attempted, unsuccessfully, to create a redevelopment agency to assist potential
Adopted June 2004                                  4

home developers with the aggregation of smaller parcels in the existing core of the City. Without the
power to help aggregate smaller parcels into more economic sizes for development, few developers were
interested in pursuing opportunities in Lathrop.
To further hamper any decision to look in Lathrop for affordable housing was the relative lack of
infrastructure, particularly wastewater treatment capacity. The majority of domestic wastewater flows in
Lathrop are treated at the regional wastewater quality control facility in Manteca. The amount of flow
treated at the Manteca plant is regulated by contract. As such, there was little available flow to support
more intense land uses than currently exist in Lathrop. The only wastewater treatment plant located in the
City of Lathrop handles only commercial and industrial wastewater from a business park. However, in
May 2003, the City of Lathrop approved a contract to expand the wastewater treatment plant to handle
wastewater coming from newly developing communities west of the freeway (see discussion below).
Finally, the City implemented density bonuses and other opportunities to defray the costs of housing
projects, thus making the resultant housing more affordable. Despite these efforts to attract affordable
housing developers, no new low-income housing has been built. Recognizing the need for affordable
housing in the community, the City of Lathrop staff has solicited non-profit housing developers, met with
these developers, demonstrated properties, and reviewed City concessions such as density bonuses and
capital facility fee reductions. However no developers as yet have agreed to develop affordable housing
in Lathrop, preferring the larger markets of the nearby cities of Stockton and Manteca.
Seeing the impediments created in the existing core of the City from the prior county zoning program, the
City has looked to the newer areas of land it has annexed to the City since 1995. Under the City’s
General Plan, new areas being considered for annexation to the City of Lathrop must follow a specific
plan planning process. The specific plan planning process envisions a cooperative environment where all
types of housing are integrated into larger areas, thus easing or eliminating the need for individual
developers to aggregate land. In specific, the West Lathrop Specific Plan takes a global approach to the
provision of jobs and housing for the community as it develops. The West Lathrop Specific Plan
envisions mixed-use communities where people can live and work in the same area. The Plan features a
mix of densities built into the zoning which will encourage the development of a broader range of housing
types, while also providing jobs for residents. Both multi-family and medium-density housing types are
included in the Plan.
The Plan itself has been further refined by the recent adoption of the River Island Urban Design Concept
and the Mossdale Landing Urban Design Concept. Each Urban Design Concept, or UDC, creates
neighborhoods of mixed uses and mixed densities to integrate all types of housing and residents. By
designating these areas, the City of Lathrop has zoned land to provide for parcels in the size,
configuration, and locations necessary to attract builders and developers. More importantly, the
infrastructure necessary to support these developments, including water and wastewater treatment, has
been sized to support these different densities. Having ready access to necessary infrastructure is another
impediment to the development of affordable housing the City of Lathrop has removed.
While the City has installed mechanisms to allow for low and very low-income housing, due to lack of
developer interest and market factors beyond its control, the City did not meet the RHNA affordable
housing goals. However, as outlined above, the City has now put in place zoning and other land use
controls necessary to assist developers who wish to pursue these types of projects, without the
impediments of the past. However, the City has been very successful in attracting developers who build
new entry-level single-family housing for moderate and above moderate income households. In addition,
the City has also developed a moderately successful rehabilitation program where 14 homes have had
repairs. Table 3 demonstrates the effectiveness of the 1999 Housing Element.

APPROPRIATENESS OF GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Overall, the City has been moderately effective in meeting the objectives set forth by the 1999 Housing
Element. The effectiveness of the Housing Element can be identified in three examples. First, $270,042
of the $392,259 CDBG and HOME funds allocated for housing rehabilitation has been spent. Lack of
responses for this City program is based on two factors. First, the overall condition of the housing stock
in the City is very good, see p 41, and secondly, the promotion of the program is not widespread.
Accordingly, over the next planning period, the City will promote this program targeting neighborhoods
identified by the City in need housing rehabilitation.
Second, the City has recognized the need for affordable housing, by offering incentives such as fee
reductions, density bonuses, and technical support. City staff representing numerous City departments
(e.g. planning, building, finance) meet with potential developers to provide an opportunity to strategize
about project design, City standards, necessary public improvements, and funding strategies (where
appropriate). However, despite these efforts no organizations have chosen to develop affordable projects
in Lathrop. As discussed in section 2.2 N one possible reason for the lack of interest by developers is the
lack of currently available high-density vacant residential land. However, over the 2003-2008 Housing
Element planning period, the vacant land zoned for high density residential in the specific plan areas has
become available to developers to provide affordable housing options.
Finally, while the building department has addressed code violations in an attempt conserve the character
of existing neighborhoods and housing units, due to staff and funding constraints a full time code
enforcement department has not been established. In order to adequately address preservation issues, the
City is in the process of establishing a code enforcement program. In addition, the City is in the process
of establishing a Task Force that will examine the blighted areas of Lathrop and develop strategies for
improvement and rehabilitation.
In addition to these three areas of concern, the remainder of this document examines the housing needs of
the City of Lathrop as it grows over the next five years. Those housing issues not adequately addressed in
the previous housing element will be addressed in the “Policy and Programs” section of this document.
Such programs include measures to mitigate governmental constrains on housing, improve the City’s
service to special needs residents, and address infrastructure constraints.

EXISTING CONDITIONS AND DEMOGRAPHIC DATA
The purpose of this chapter is to summarize and analyze the existing housing conditions in the City of
Lathrop. It consists of two major sections: Section 2.1 - Summary of Existing Conditions - an analysis of
population trends, employment trends, household trends and special needs groups, and Section 2.2 –
Inventory of Resources - an analysis of existing housing characteristics, housing conditions, vacancy
trends, housing costs and availability, “at-risk housing” and suitable lands for future development.
SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
 It is important when evaluating housing needs to analyze demographic variables, such as population,
 employment, and households, in order to assess the present and future housing needs of the City of
 Lathrop. This section utilizes sources, such as the 1980-2000 U.S. Census, State Department of Finance
 (Demographic Research Unit), San Joaquin County Council of Governments (SJCOG) and Datum
 Populus. See Appendix A for a complete list of data sources.
POPULATION TRENDS

The City of Lathrop is second in population growth rate of the four surrounding cities. Between 1990 and
2000, Lathrop had an estimated 52.7 percent growth rate. This increase in growth can be attributed to the
increasing demand for housing in the area and the willingness of commuters to move further from their
place of employment, (see Table 14, Employment by Commuting Patterns). At the time of the 2000
Census, Lathrop was the second smallest city in the area.

Between 1990 and 2000, the median age in Lathrop increased from 27.0 to 30.0 years of age, which
implies an aging population. Specifically, persons between the ages of 35-44, the largest age cohort,
represented 17.8 percent of the population in 2000, and increase of 87.4 percent since 1990. In addition,
the 25-34 age cohort experienced the most significant proportional loss since 1990. In 2000, the percent
of the population under 20 represented 37.8 percent. The senior population, age 65 and over, represented
only 6.1 percent of the population in 2000.

Overall, the City and County median age is slightly less than that of the State. For example, in 1990, the
state median age was 31.5 years, while the City and County median ages were 27.0 years and 29.9 years,
respectively. Over the past ten years, the median age in the County and the City has increased but are still

In 1990, operators, fabricators and laborers were the prominent occupations for the Lathrop labor force;
over one fourth of the labor force was employed in this occupation type. Since 1990, there has been a
steady increase in the percentage of persons employed in managerial and professional specialties
occupations and technical, sales and administrative support occupations. In 2000, technical, sales and
administrative support occupations replaced operator, fabricator and labor as the predominate profession
in the labor force. According to EDD, in 2002 those in the technical, sales, and administrative support
services in San Joaquin County earned on average $28,184 a year, 12.3 percent less than those in the
manufacturing industry, and 45.8 percent less than those in the managerial and professional specialty
occupations. Therefore, as the percent of employed persons continue to grow in the technical, sales, and
administrative support occupations, so will the demand for housing affordable to those persons employed
in these occupations.

HOUSEHOLD TRENDS
The change in the number of households in a city is one of the prime determinants of the demand for
housing. Households can form even in periods of static population growth as adult children leave home,
through divorce, and with the aging of the population.
The number of persons per household is an important indicator of the relationship between population
growth and household formation. For example, if the number of persons per household is decreasing
with steady population growth, then households are forming at a faster rate than population growth.
Conversely, if population were growing faster than households, then the persons per household would
increase.
Between 1980 and 1990, persons per household slightly increased for the City of Lathrop and in San
Joaquin County. Specifically, the City of Lathrop rose from 3.4 persons per household to 3.5 persons per
household. The increase in persons per household indicates that the population increased at a faster pace
than household formation between 1980 and 1990.
Since, the number of persons per household has become more static in the City of Lathrop and San
Joaquin County. According to the 2000 Census, there were 3.5 persons per household in the City and 3.0
persons per household in San Joaquin County.

Household size is also an important factor in determining the size of housing units needed within a
jurisdiction. In the City of Lathrop, “large” households containing five or more persons represented 28.1
percent of all households in 2000, about 14.8 percent less than the “small” households with one or two
persons. Households with 3-4 persons represented the fastest growing household size component
between 1990 and 2000, increasing from 36.8 percent in 1990 to 39.8 percent in 2000. This would
indicate a growing demand for moderate sized housing units with two to three bedrooms.
In general, the County of San Joaquin has a greater proportion of “small” households and a lesser
proportion of “large” sized households than the City of Lathrop.           For example, small households
comprised 49.1 percent of the households in San Joaquin County in 2000, 16.3 percent more than in the
City of Lathrop. Additionally, large households represented 18.1 percent in the County in 2000,
compared to 27.4 percent for the City.

Tenure, or the ratio between homeowner and renter households, can be affected by many factors, such as:
housing cost (interest rates, economics, land supply, and development constraints), housing type, housing
availability, job availability, and consumer preference.
During the period 1980 to 1990, the proportion of renter households increased from 18.5 percent of the
households to 23.0 percent in the City of Lathrop. However, since 1990 the percentage of renter
households have deceased to 19.3 percent in 2003. This decrease in the percentage of renter households
can be attributed to the growth of single-family homes built over the last 10 years, see p 43.
In comparison, San Joaquin County has a higher proportion of renter households. For example, 23.0
percent of the Lathrop households were renters in 1990, while 37.2 percent of the San Joaquin County
households were renters, a difference of 14.2 percent. In 2000, 21.8 percent of the Lathrop households
were renters, while 39.6 percent of the San Joaquin County households were renters, a difference of 17.8
percent. A possible explanation for this difference is the greater amount of rental opportunities available
in San Joaquin County as a whole compared to those available in the City of Lathrop.

The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimates area median family incomes
(MFI) annually. In turn, these MFI’s are utilized in many housing programs, such as CDBG, HOME and
LIHTC. Of particular note, the Stockton-Lodi MSA 2003 MFI was $50,600.
In addition to estimated annual income, HUD has established standard income groups. They are defined
as: (1) Very Low Income, which are households earning less than 50 percent of the MFI; (2) Low Income,
for households earning between 50 percent and 80 percent of the MFI; (3) Moderate Income, for
households earning between 80 percent and 120 percent of the MFI, and; (4) Above Moderate Income are
households earning over 120 percent of the MFI. Generally, these categories are used to determine
household eligibility for federal, and local programs.
Based on the 2003 HUD MFI and household income tables, the proportion of households in the Very Low
and Low Income groups is substantially less than those in the Moderate and Above Moderate categories.
For example, approximately 25.2 percent of households make less than 80 percent of the HUD designated
Stockton-Lodi MSA Median Family Income, which translates to 842 households. In comparison, 74.8
percent of households are in the Moderate and Above Moderate categories.

 OVERPAYMENT
 Generally, overpayment for housing considers the total shelter cost for a household compared to their
 ability to pay. Overpayment is an important measure of the affordability within the City of Lathrop.
 Specifically, overpayment is defined as monthly shelter costs in excess of 30 percent of a household's
 income. According to the Census, shelter cost is the monthly owner costs (mortgages, deeds of trust,
 contracts to purchase or similar debts on the property and taxes, insurance on the property and utilities) or
 the gross rent (contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities).
 A total of 839 households, which is just under 29 percent of all households, in the City of Lathrop, pay in
 excess of 30 percent of their income for shelter. Owners had a lower percentage of households who
 overpay with 31.5 percent, while 34.4 percent of renters overpay. The overpayment situation is
 particularly critical for renters with annual incomes less than $34,999 where almost 395 households (52.5
 percent) are cost burdened.

SPECIAL NEEDS
As noted in Government Code Section 65583 (a)(6), within the overall housing needs assessments there
are segments of the population that require special consideration. These are generally people who are low
income and have less access to housing choices. These special housing needs groups include the elderly,
disabled, single parent households, large families, farm workers, and homeless.
Elderly
Many elderly households live in housing that costs too much or live in housing that does not accommodate
specific needs for assistance. Due to various circumstances, an elderly household may have difficulties
staying in their home community or near family. The purpose of this section is to determine the housing
needs for all characteristics of the elderly community, defined as persons over the age of 65 years.
As the population of seniors in the City increases, so do their collective needs. Traditionally, the senior
population has only represented a small proportion of the overall population of the City. In 1980, there
were 263 seniors in Lathrop, which represented 7.1 percent of the total population in the City. Between
1980 and 1990, the senior population increased by 6.7 percent annually. Since 1990, the senior population
has increased by an additional 43.4 percent to 631. Currently, the senior population is estimated at 728
persons, which equates to 6.2 percent of the total population.

In 1990, only 11.2 percent of the senior households in Lathrop were renters. In the State, 27.7 percent of
senior households were renters, and 27.3 percent were renters in San Joaquin County. Change in the
proportion of senior renters is dependent on the quantity of housing options and the propensity to convert
from ownership. In 2000, the proportion of the City’s senior renters had only increased by one percent to
12.2 percent. This demonstrates the consistency in renter opportunities available to seniors. The majority
of senior renters in the City lease single-family homes.

In the 2000 Census, a majority of the senior population, 90.2 percent, lived in family households, which
are defined as a householder living with one or more persons related by birth, marriage or adoption. A
total of 9.8 percent of the senior population are in non-family households. Non-family households are
persons living alone or with non-relatives only. In 2000 there were no seniors living in group quarters.

Eligibility for federal programs is based on the median income of the county or statistical area in which
the project or program is located. In this case, eligibility will be based on the 2000 HUD Median Family
Income of $36,333 for a two person household in the Stockton- Lodi MSA. Using that as the basis, 42.5
percent of senior households in the City of Lathrop are considered Above Moderate Income, 28.1
moderate income, and 29.4 percent are in the low and very low income groups.

An important statistic to measure the affordability of housing in the City of Lathrop is ‘overpayment’.
Overpayment is defined as monthly shelter costs in excess of 30 percent of a household’s gross income.
According to the 2000 Census, a total of 14.0 percent of senior households were in overpayment
situations, of which 41.2 percent of households and 8.9 percent of owner households were overpaying. In
California, 64.4 percent of the senior renters and 17.6 percent of senior owner households overpay for
shelter. In San Joaquin County, 46.7 percent of the senior renters and 25.3 percent of the senior owners
overpay for shelter.
In Lathrop, 14.0 percent of senior households are paying more than 35 percent of their income toward
shelter, a majority of which are owners. These senior households are cost burdened and would benefit
from publicly assisted housing or other types of public assistance.

There are several types of services and facilities available for senior citizens, including:
    •   Senior Housing: The vast majority of senior households living in the City of Lathrop own their
        home and most of the renter households reside in single-family housing. As the senior population
        continues to grow, the City recognizes the potential demand for senior designated rental housing
        and will provide assistance to developers who wish to build affordable senior rental housing.
    •   Senior Center: A senior center is operated by the Lathrop Parks and Recreation Department. The
        center offers activities such as exercise classes, art classes, music programs, planned day trips,
        periodic health screenings, and legal services. In addition, brown bag lunches and congregate
        meals are offered to low income seniors.
    •   Transportation: The County of San Joaquin operates a fixed route and dial-a-ride bus system;
        both systems offer significant fare reductions for seniors, students, and low-income individuals.

Disabled Persons
Three types of disabled persons are considered as having special housing needs: Physically, Mentally, and
Developmentally Disabled. Each type is unique and requires specific attention in terms of access to
housing, employment, social services, medical services and accessibility within housing.

persons were between the ages of five (5) and 64 and the remaining 370 were 65 years of age or older.

Large households often have lower incomes, which frequently results in overcrowding in smaller
dwelling units and in the acceleration of unit deterioration. According to the 2000 Census, there were 789
large households in the City and 2,105 housing units of three or more bedrooms. This would indicate an
adequate number of larger housing units.

The number of large families has been gradually increasing in Lathrop and consequently demand will
increase for larger homes with more bedrooms. Although the supply of larger housing units has
approached the demand in the past, overcrowding is increasing for the larger families.
Farmworkers
Estimating farmworkers and those households associated with farm work within the State is extremely
difficult. Generally, farmworker population contains two segments of farmworkers: permanent and
migratory (seasonal). The permanent population consists of farmworkers who have settled in the region
and maintain local residence and who are employed most of the year. The migratory farmworker
population consists of those who typically migrate to the region during seasonal periods in search of farm
labor employment. Traditional sources of population estimates, including the 2000 Census, have tended
to significantly underestimate farmworker population. Moreover, different employment estimation
techniques result in diverse estimates of local agricultural employment. Nonetheless, a range of estimates
of farmworkers in the State can be derived.
Further, by applying assumptions derived from surveys specifically targeted to farmworkers, aggregate
population (both workers and households) can be estimated. These estimates indicate that average annual
employment of farmworkers in California is about 350,000, with peak period employment of about
450,000 within the State. This employment demand is filled by between 650,000 and 850,000
farmworkers within the State. Total population (including family members) associated with these
workers is between 900,000 and 1.35 million persons.
While the City of Lathrop’s primary industries are services and manufacturing, the City is located in the
heart of the San Joaquin Valley, which is prime agricultural land. San Joaquin County is a leading
producer of milk, grapes, cherries, tomatoes, walnuts, almonds, hay, asparagus, nursery, and apples.
According to the 2000 Census, there were only 135 persons employed in the farming, fishing and forestry
occupations in the City of Lathrop, which is an increase of 24 persons since the 1990 Census. There are
no fishing or forestry industries in the City and therefore it is assumed that all 135 persons were employed
as farmworkers. This equals 3.1 percent of all employed persons in the City.

The City of Lathrop welcomes the development of farmworker housing in any zone that permits the type
of housing being built (i.e., multifamily or single family) without any special conditions. Farmworker
housing, both seasonal and permanent, can be developed in land zoned for multifamily use by right and in
accordance with the same processing standards for other multifamily housing. The land known as
Lathrop Acres is identified by the City as being the most adequate site for developing farmworker
housing, though farmworker housing is allowed in any appropriately zoned site. This land totaling
approximately 29 acres is currently zoned for multifamily use, is close to transportation and the City
center, and has access to infrastructure. Because the percent of the City’s farmworker population is small,
the housing needs of this group are addressed through its standard affordable housing strategies. While
there is no housing designated for farmworkers within the City of Lathrop, farmworker housing can be
found in the nearby community of French Camp and in the City of Stockton. The following is a list of the
migrant and permanent farmworker designated housing in San Joaquin County.

Single-parent Households
Single-parent households have special housing needs such as reasonable day care, health care, and
affordable housing. The most significant portion of this group is the female-headed households. Female-
headed households with children often have lower incomes, limiting their access to available housing.
Many housing experts believe these households are especially at risk of housing cost burden or
homelessness.
The 2000 Census counted 2,483 family households with children 18 years old and under in the City of
Lathrop. Of these households, 224, or 7.7 percent, are headed by single females.

Homeless Persons (Persons in Need of Emergency Shelter)
Homelessness continues as a regional and national issue. Factors contributing to the rise in homelessness
include the general lack of housing affordable to lower income persons, increases in the number of
persons whose incomes fall below the poverty level, reductions in public subsidies to the poor, alcohol
and substance abuses, and the de-institutionalization of the mentally ill. Homeless people, victims of
abuse, and other individuals, represent housing needs which are not being met by the traditional housing
stock. These people require temporary housing and assistance at little or no cost to the recipient.
Due to their transient nature, it is difficult to count the number of homeless in any one area. It should also
be noted that there are generally two types of homeless - the "permanent homeless", who are the transient
and most visible homeless population, and the "temporary homeless", who are homeless usually due to
eviction or personal crisis and may stay with friends, family, or in a shelter or motel until they can find a
permanent residence.
Local churches, Staff of the City, and the Lathrop Police Department estimate the number of homeless
persons living in Lathrop to be zero to two persons. Several services are available to the homeless, as
well as low-income residents of Lathrop, such as the San Joaquin food bank program, the Give Every
Child a Chance program, in addition to the meals on wheels program.
Special needs resources/Emergency shelters
Emergency shelters are not defined in specific zones, however, with a special Administrative Approval,
these types of shelter would be allowed in the Residential Multifamily zone. The City will amend their
zoning ordinance to specifically identify Emergency Shelters and Transitional Housing as allowable in
the Multifamily zone with special administrative approval. In order to attain approval for this type of
project, the planning department first reviews the site design in order to ensure that the project’s plan is
consistent with building and development standards. After the plan is reviewed, the emergency shelter
would go before the Planning Commission for final approval. There are no specific limitations for the
development of homeless shelters. In addition, permit conditions on this type of housing is limited to
those necessary to meet building codes, and development standards as described under the zoning

ordinance. While there is currently not a need for homeless shelters in the City, should one be proposed,
the City approval procedures, concurrent possessing, and incentives offered under objective 2-1 found at
the end of this element, would help facilitate and encourage the development of this special need
housing.
Transitional Housing is defined as interim housing helping families move from homelessness to self-
sufficiency by providing short-term housing (usually two years) at extremely low rent to qualified
families. This type of housing is considered multifamily in nature and is permitted in the high-density
multifamily residential district. This is the best zoning category for this type of special needs housing
because it conforms most closely to multifamily zoning development standards and is closest to public
services and transportation. In addition, the City of Lathrop also allows transition housing in the RA zone
with a CUP. If a CUP is requested, a hearing is held in front of the Planning Commission. Only those
conditions associated with existing City development standards are considered.
The County as a continuum of care generally provides services for the homeless. The continuum of care
begins with the assessment of the homeless individual or family then refers to appropriate housing where
supportive services are provided to prepare them for independent living. The goal of a comprehensive
homeless service system is to ensure that homeless individuals and families move from homelessness to
self-sufficiency, permanent housing, and independent living. While the City currently does not have a
need for homeless shelters, it continues to support the efforts of the County in this area by allotting a
yearly $5,000 to the South County Crisis Center in Manteca. In addition, temporary shelter and services
to the homeless and displaced are provided within the County.
The following table is a list of emergency assistance and shelters for persons in need of transitional and
permanent housing. All of the emergency shelters are located within the County of San Joaquin.

        2.1.g.    OVERCROWDING
        Overcrowding is defined by the Census as more than one person per room living in a housing
        unit. Generally, a room is defined as living room, dining room, kitchen, bedroom(s) and finished
        recreation room.
        In 1990, 16.4 percent of the households in the City were considered overcrowded and by 2000
        that percentage decreased to 14.6 percent, or 421 overcrowded units. The situation is even more
        critical for renter households where 26.7 percent live in overcrowded conditions in 2000. This
        increase in overcrowding can be attributed to the decreasing affordability of homes in the City.
        Households are less able to afford higher bedroom sized homes and overcrowding occurs.

EXISTING HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
The proportion of single-family units in the City of Lathrop increased significantly since 1990, while the
proportion of 5+ unit housing structures (i.e., multifamily) has decreased. For example, single-family
units comprised 79.6 percent of the housing stock in 1990 and 85.2 percent in 2000. At the same time, 5+
unit housing structures were 0.5 percent in 1990 and now represent 0.2 percent of the housing stock. In
general, over the last 23 years, there has been a decrease in the number of 2 or more unit structures
reported during the Census.

HOUSING CONDITIONS
In July of 2003, a citywide assessment was conducted to identify general housing conditions. The
condition of housing was assessed by a wind-shield survey examining the exterior quality and condition
of the units, by building permit data, and building inspector expertise. Table 45, Housing Condition
Summary, summarizes information collected during the survey. Of the 3,252 housing units located in the
City, only 3.3 percent are need of some rehabilitation.

The City of Lathrop takes a proactive approach toward housing conditions through its housing rehabilitation
programs. The existing housing rehabilitation program is successfully maintaining the housing stock.
Lathrop has used Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to provide rehabilitation assistance.
Over the last Housing Element period 14 units were rehabilitated. The goal of the 2003-2008 period is for the
rehabilitation of 15 more units.
Approximately, 39.7 percent of the total Lathrop housing stock (occupied and vacant units) was built
from 1990 to 2000. Another 23.9 percent of the housing stock was built between 1980 and 1989.

         Substandard housing indices, without physical inspection, can generally be judged as
         overcrowding, units lacking complete plumbing, and units constructed before 1940 without
         diligent maintenance. In 2000, the percentage of overcrowded units in the City was 14.2 percent.
         Also, 1.3 percent of the housing was built before 1940 and 0.3 percent of the units lacked
         complete plumbing facilities. In San Joaquin County, 14.0 percent of the housing units were
         overcrowded, while 8.0 percent were built before 1940.

RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION TRENDS
A total of 1,118 housing units were constructed in the City of Lathrop over the last 12 years. Of the new
homes all were single-family residential except one permit, which was issued for a duplex in 1993.
Based on the figures in Table 47, Building Permits by Year, an average of 112 new housing units are
constructed each year in Lathrop. Like the previous RHNA, this average construction will not be
sufficient to meet the new Regional Housing Needs Assessment of 1,029 over five years. Including the
housing production in 2003, a total of 560 new units would result over five years - a shortfall of 469 units.
However, the City has taken a proactive land use planning approach to future residential development and
has zoned sufficient land to meet, or exceed, the RHNA at all income levels. Since 1992, the City of
Lathrop has annexed over 5,000 acres of land, which can accommodate over 19,000 housing units.

VACANCY TRENDS
Vacancy trends in housing are analyzed using a “vacancy rate” which establishes the relationship between
housing supply and demand. For example, if the demand for housing is greater than the available supply,
then the vacancy rate is low, and the price of housing will most likely increase. Additionally, the vacancy
rate indicates whether or not the City has an adequate housing supply to provide choice and mobility.
HUD standards indicate that a vacancy rate of five percent is sufficient to provide choice and mobility.
In 2000, the Census reported a vacancy rate of 3.4 percent. The California State Department of Finance
(DOF) Population Research Unit publishes an annual estimate of population, housing units, vacancy, and
household size for all incorporated cities in the State. In 2003, the DOF estimated the vacancy rate for all
housing units in Lathrop was 2.9 percent. However, the DOF estimate is for all housing unit types and
does not exclude seasonal, recreational, or occasional use structures and all other vacant. Table 48,
Occupancy Status of Housing Stock, shows the characteristics of the City’s vacant housing units per the
2000 Census.

According to the California Metrolist, there were a total of 64 single-family listings in the City of Lathrop
on July 28, 2003. The estimated vacancy rate for single-family dwellings is 2.3 percent based on a total
of 2,811 single-family units. This indicates a “tight” housing market, indicating that there will be an
increasing demand for new housing, but insufficient supply to meet that demand. This effect will further
decrease affordability of single-family housing.

HOUSING COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
One of the major barriers to housing availability is the cost of housing. In order to provide housing to all
economic levels in the community, a wide variety of housing opportunities at various prices should be
made available. The following table describes the acceptable monthly payment for households in the four
major income groups: Very low, Low, Moderate and Above Moderate.

Single-family Sales Units
Since 1980, the median sales price for single-family housing in the City has increased at a stable rate.
Between 1980 and 2000, prices increased by an average of $70,000 each decade. Within the last three
years, the median price of homes has increased significantly. This sharp rise in median sales price is due
to the great demand for housing in the $150,000 - $250,000 price range, and similar higher priced homes
in more developed areas and nearby cities. There is a seller’s market in the City of Lathrop, with sellers
not being able to keep up with demand. Currently the average selling price of a home in Lathrop is
$290,000.

Rental Units
According to the 2000 Census, the median rent was $817 in the City of Lathrop, compared to $617 for
San Joaquin County. In July 2003, a survey of local property management companies was conducted to
ascertain the current price for rental listings in the City of Lathrop. This survey indicated that the median
rent for a single-family rental home was $1,000. Rents ranged from $900 for a two bedroom duplex, to
$1,500 for a four-bedroom house. There are no subsidized properties in the City of Lathrop
2.2.e (5) Affordability
Affordability is defined as a household spending 30 percent or less of household income for shelter.
Shelter is defined as gross rent or gross monthly owner costs. Gross rent is the contract rent, plus utilities.
In most cases, the contract rent includes payment for water, sewer and garbage. “Gross monthly owner
costs” includes mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, utilities (including gas and electric), condominium
fees, and site rent for mobile homes.
As noted on page 26, 34.4 percent of renter households pay in excess of 30 percent of their income for
shelter. To put this in perspective, Table 50, Affordable Rental Rates, shows the current 2003, income
ranges based on the Median Family Income (MFI) of $50,600 along with the “affordability range.” For
instance, a very low income family of four can generally afford a total of $573 a month for rent and
utilities in a two bedroom apartment. The current market rental rates are affordable to those households
with moderate and above moderate incomes. Most low income households could afford a two bedroom
duplex.

Apartment utilities are $46 for a studio, $50 for a one bedroom, $59 for two bedroom, $68 for three
bedroom, and $77 for four bedroom.
While shelter costs for rental units are generally figured to be affordable at 30 percent of gross income,
households are able to obtain a mortgage loan based on 35 percent of gross income. This is subject to
individual credit and budgeting conditions, and those with less revolving loan-type debt can generally
find financing for a more expensive home. For instance, using the income categories, very low income
households in Lathrop could afford a home up to $86,900; however, currently there are no homes
available at that price.
AT - RISK HOUSING
California Housing Element Law requires all jurisdictions to include a study of all low-income housing
units which may at some future time be lost to the affordable inventory by the expiration of some type of
affordability restrictions. The law requires that the analysis and study cover a five-year and a ten-year
period, coinciding with updates of the Housing Element. Following are some of the programs that may
be expiring:
    §        Prepayment of HUD mortgages: Section 221(d)(3), Section 236, Section 202, and Section
             811, and Farmers Home (RHS) Section 515/516 subsidies to tenants and/or owners.
    §        Low income use restrictions on Section 236(j)(1) projects are for the full 40-year mortgage
             term. However, owners have the option to repay the remaining mortgage at the end of the
             first 20 years.
    §        FHA-insured mortgages under the Section 221(d)(4) program have no binding use
             restrictions. The affordability of these projects is governed by the Section 8 contracts
             maintained on the projects which are now approved on a year-to-year basis.
    §        Opt-outs and expirations of project-based Section 8 contracts – Section 8 is a federally
             funded program that provides for subsidies to the owner of a pre-qualified project for the
             difference between the tenant’s ability to pay and the contract rent. Opt-outs occur when the
             owner of the project decides to opt-out of the contract with HUD by pre-paying the remainder
             of the mortgage. Usually, the likelihood of opt-outs increases as the market rents exceed the
             contract rents.
         §        Other – Expiration of the low-income use period of various financing sources, such as
                  Low-income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), bond financing, density bonuses, California
                  Housing Finance Agency (CHFA), Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and

                 HOME funds and redevelopment funds. Generally, bond financing properties expire
                 according to a qualified project period or when the bonds mature. Density bonus units
                 expire in either 10 or 30 years, depending on the level of incentives.
INVENTORY OF AT RISK RENTAL HOUSING UNITS
According to the California Housing Partnership Corporation, the USDA, and the Housing Authority,
there are no government assisted rental properties in the City of Lathrop that may be at risk of opting out
of programs that keep them affordable to very low and low-income households over the five year Housing
Element Period (2003 - 2008) and for the subsequent five years (2012). Normally, the inventory consists
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Redevelopment Agency, multifamily bonds and density
bonus properties. Target levels include the Very Low-income group and the Low-income group.
Currently there are no subsidized apartment complexes within the City.
Strategies to attain Affordable Units
The City of Lathrop recognizes the need for the development of attractive affordable housing with in the
City. As a result, the City has established a strategy, which will be implemented to attract affordable
housing. This strategy includes developing a brochure which describes available funding sources and
development incentives for affordable housing, sending requests for proposals to non-profit developers
and developers of low income housing, and finally having a ‘group meeting’ with City staff and potential
developers. This group meeting involves planning staff, the Lathrop Manteca Fire District, and police
staff, building staff, and developers to address the questions and concerns potential developers have for
the development of affordable housing. Planning department staff, then accompanies the developer to
potential available locations. The City staff will then work closely with the developer to process needed
applications and permits in a timely manor.
The following is a list of potential financial resources considered a part of the City's overall financial plan
to deal with attaining affordable units. The number and availability of programs to assist cities and
counties in increasing and improving their affordable housing stock is limited, and public funding for new
projects is unpredictable. The list includes local, state and federal programs.
         •       Multifamily Housing Program (MHP): The MHP program assists in the new
                 construction and preservation of permanent and transitional housing for lower income
                 households. Funding is provided through the Proposition 46 Housing Programs. Eligible
                 applicants include local public agencies, for-profit and non-profit developers and
                 corporations, limited equity housing cooperatives, individuals, American Indian
                 reservations and rancherias, and limited partnerships in which an eligible applicant or an
                 affiliate of the applicant is a general partner.
         •       Housing Authority of the County of San Joaquin is a Public Housing Authority with
                 jurisdiction within the City of Lathrop and the County of San Joaquin. It administers
                 federal and state funds for its public housing projects and government assisted housing
                 units such as Section 8 Rent Subsidy.
         •       Preservation Opportunity Program will provide supplemental financing for at-risk
                 subsidized rental developments receiving bond financing from CalHFA. Funding is
                 provided through the Proposition 46 Housing Programs.

• Preservation Interim Repositioning Program (PIRP): The purpose of this program is to
  preserve assisted rental housing at-risk of conversion to market rate use. Funding is
  being made available through the Proposition 46 Housing Programs. The State
  Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) will make one short-term
  loan to a single non-profit entity which may then use the loan proceeds to either finance
  the at-risk rental units by others or directly purchase at-risk developments. If the non-
  profit selected by HCD elects to fund a lending program, other non-profits, for-profits,
  and public agencies may be eligible to apply for assistance from that entity.
• Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds: The City of Lathrop participates
  in the San Joaquin CDBG consortium. The City utilizes CDBG funds for rental and
  owner housing rehabilitation activities, infrastructure, public facilities and public
  services. Proceeds from those activities are deposited into a revolving loan fund
  established from low interest loans for rehabilitation and are used to retain subsidized
  housing projects whose federal assistance is expiring among other projects.
• Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Federal law requires that banks, savings and
  loans, thrifts, and their affiliated mortgaging subsidiaries, annually evaluate the credit
  needs for public projects in communities where they operate. Part of the City's efforts in
  developing preservation programs will be to meet with the Community Reinvestment Act
  Lenders Group organized by the Lathrop Community Development Department to
  discuss future housing needs and applicability of the Community Reinvestment Act.
  Although an unpredictable resource, it is important to establish a working relationship for
  future problem solving.
• Low-income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC): The LIHTC Program provides for
  federal and state tax credits for private and non-profit developers and investors who agree
  to set aside all or an established percentage of their rental units for households at 60
  percent of AMI for no less than 30 years. These tax credits may also be utilized on
  rehabilitation projects, contributing to the preservation program.
• The program begins when developers and investors apply for an allocation of tax credits
  from the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (CTCAC). Tax credits are
  awarded on a competitive basis each year. Compliance is monitored according to
  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules and regulations.
• The Federal Home Loan System facilitates the Affordable Housing Program (AHP) and
  Community Investment Program (CIP) for the purposes of expanding the affordable
  housing supply. The San Francisco Federal Home Loan Bank District provides local
  service. Subsidies are awarded on a competitive basis usually in the form of low-interest
  loans and must be used to finance the purchase, construction, and/or rehabilitation of
  rental housing.
• The Urban Predevelopment Loan Program, conducted through HCD, provides the funds
  to pay the initial costs of preserving existing affordable housing developments for their
  existing tenants. Priority is given to applications with matching financing from local
  redevelopment agencies or federal programs.

         •       Preservation Financing Program, operated through California Housing Finance Agency
                 (CHFA), offers tax exempt financing for the acquisition or refinancing of a project with
                 an expiring Section 8 contract.
Redevelopment Agency
The City of Lathrop currently does not operate a redevelopment agency. However, the City is in the
process of establishing a taskforce to examine the rejuvenation of the Lathrop Downtown area. This
taskforce will be assembled to examine code enforcement issues, propose suggestions on the
beautification and rehabilitation of the area, and preserve the historic character of Lathrop.
RESIDENTIAL ZONING AND DENSITY
The housing industry always responds to market demand. In the City of Lathrop, residential zoning
targets all income groups. Lathrop’s policies and planning efforts have made it very clear that residential
development of all types is welcome and supported.
Zoning
Title 17 of the Lathrop Municipal Code, the Lathrop Zoning Ordinance, provides the zoning provisions
for the City. The Lathrop City Council adopted the zoning code on March 22, 1992. Zoning for the City
of Lathrop is defined as follows:
Urban Reserve District (UR)- The purpose of this district is to hold in reserve those areas designated by
the general plan or specific plan to be held in reserve for future urban expansion and to preserve the
availability of agricultural land and vacant land required for future urban expansion and to prevent the
premature development of land where the range of municipal-type services are not yet available.
Residential uses include a single-family dwelling in those areas designated for low or medium density.
Second dwelling units are permitted with administrative approval.
 Residential Districts
Residential Acreage (RA)- The purpose of this district is to provide living area which combines the
advantages of both urban and rural location by limiting development to low density concentrations of
single-family dwellings and permitting limited numbers of animals and fowl to be kept. Single family
units, are permitted on this zoning designation. Mobile homes and second dwelling units are permitted
with administrative approval, and nursing homes, and transitional housing are allowed with a Conditional
Use Permit (CUP).
R One-Family Residential District (R-1-6X and R-1-5) - The purpose of this district is to provide
appropriately located areas for low-density housing, encouraging a suitable environment of family life,
and to provide space for community facilities needed to complement urban residential areas, and for
institutions, which require a residential environment. The R-1-6 district is intended for exclusive
application to those areas where only single-family detached housing is permitted. R-1-5 district is
intended to provide small lot single-family housing only under Planned Unit Development procedures as
an affordable housing alternative to apartment living. Residential uses include single-family dwellings,
small family daycare, family care home, and “an alcoholic recovery facility”. Second dwelling units,
mobile homes, and large family day cares are allowed with administrative approval.
Multifamily Residential District (R-M- MH8, RM-3, RM-2, RM-1.5) - The purpose of this district is for
the development of multifamily residential structures at densities consistent with the policies of the
general plan. The RM-MH8 district is designated for mobile home park development, RM-3 is

designated for medium density residential, RM-2 is designated for high density residential removed from
the commercial district, and RM 1.5 is designated for high density residential in the vicinity of the central
business district and commercial center. Single-family housing, multifamily housing including
transitional housing, and group homes are permitted in this designation. Nursing homes, boarding
housing, mobile homes second dwelling units are allowed with administrative approval. Charitable
institutions and mobile home parks are allowed with a CUP.
Commercial Districts- The purpose of these districts is to provide appropriately located areas for a full
range of office, retail commercial, and service commercial uses, to strengthen the City’s economic bases,
to minimize the impact of commercial development on residential districts, and to provide opportunities
for residential development on the site of commercial development or on separate sites in certain districts.
Commercial Neighborhood District (CN) - The purpose of this district is for the provision of retail and
personal service facilities to satisfy the convenience needs of the consumer relatively close to the
consumer’s place of residence. This zoning designation allows for the mixed use of commercial and
residential developments with administrative approval.
Central Commercial District (CC) - The purpose of this district is to provide a wide range of retail stores,
restaurants, hotels, commercial recreation, personal services business services, and financial services.
Mixed use housing as in accordance with RM-1.5 is permitted with a CUP.
Commercial Service District (CS) - The purpose of this district is to provide areas for uses involved with
servicing equipment, materials and products which do not require the manufacturing, assembly,
packaging, or processing of articles or merchandise.
Highway Commercial (CH) - The purpose of this district is to provide areas for uses required by the
traveling public. Residential housing is not permitted.
Industrial Districts- The purpose of these districts is to minimize the impact industrial uses have on
residential and commercial districts.
Limited Industrial (IL) - The purpose of this district is to provide sites for light industrial uses. No
residential uses are permitted.
General Industrial District (I)- The purpose of this district is to provide for a full range of manufacturing,
industrial processing, general service, and distribution uses. Residential housing is not permitted.
Density
Residential growth areas and densities are among the issues and policies addressed in the General Plan.
Residential densities are specified for each residential land use designation, and the General Plan provides
for a wide range of residential densities. Single family detached housing densities range from 2 dwellings
per acre to 9 units per net acre. Multiple family densities, including but not limited to attached, zero lot
line, and apartments, range from 8 to 25 dwelling units per net acre.
Zoning districts specify minimum lot size, permitted uses, conditional uses, building height and front, and
rear and side yard setbacks. Zoning districts further the health, safety, and welfare of the residents. For
example, setbacks in residential districts are established to ensure the adequate provision of light, air and
open space for residents. In addressing the minimum lot size, the zoning districts must be consistent with
the densities of the General Plan. Single-family zoning districts have minimum lot sizes ranging from
5,000 to 6,000 square feet. Residential land zoned multifamily zoning districts have a minimum lot sizes
of 3,000 square feet. Agricultural zoning districts have a minimum lot size of 20,000 square feet for each

dwelling unit. Table 51, Zoning Categories and Usable Density, defines the minimum lot area for the
various residential zoning districts.
Planned Development zoning districts and Mixed Use combining districts allow for the use of special
design criteria for maximum utility of the site and to allow maximum design flexibility within density
limitations. These limitations are ultimately determined by the City Council using acceptable planning
practices and standards. Within these project areas, special residential development such as clustering
and density transfers is encouraged. Planned development areas are allowed in all the residential districts
by rezoning the property from the base district. An example of this type of planned development is the
River Island project located west of the San Joaquin River. This tract will be developed to allow for a mix
of uses including commercial, recreational, and residential at varying densities. For example, the
maximum density for low density residential is 9 units per acres, 20 units per acre for medium density,
and 40 units per acre for high density residential. The Mossdale Landing Project will be developed
according to the approved Specific Plan and will include low, medium and high density Residential.
The City’s development standards are applicable to residential zoning districts. Development standards
include, but are not limited to, building height, yard setbacks, lot area, site plan review, parking space
requirements, and parkland requirements. These requirements were adopted through the public hearing
process and reflect the minimum standards thought necessary for protection of the public.
When a developer proposes a housing development, state law requires that the city provide incentives for
the production of low-income housing. A density bonus agreement between the developer and city is
used to set forth the incentives to be offered by the city (i.e. allowing increased density over that typically
allowable in the respective zoning district) and the requirements of the developer. Such an agreement
requires that 25 percent of the units in the development be made available for low-income families, and
that those units, whether they are for sale or rent, shall remain available for low-income persons for a
period of thirty years.

NEW CONSTRUCTION NEEDS
The City of Lathrop falls under the jurisdiction of the San Joaquin County Council of Governments
(SJCOG) that uses a predominately demographic formula to allocate the regional housing needs among
the incorporated cities and unincorporated county. This process results in a Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) and the number reflected in that assessment must be considered when the housing
element is prepared.
SJCOG does not set housing policy. They have adopted the philosophy that each city within its
jurisdiction knows their own needs and resources and should have the responsibility for developing their
own policies to meet their portion of the regional housing need.
Historically, COGs prepared RHNAs every five years according to a statewide schedule prepared by the
State. However, during the early 1990s the State suspended funding for the development of the RHNA,
and the previous report prepared by SJCOG covered the period 1990 to 1996. The current RHNA is for
the 2001 through 2008 period. SJCOG housing needs figures are limited to new housing construction.
That number is then allocated to income groups.
Income Group Goals
The purpose of the income group goals is to ensure that each jurisdiction within a COG attains its share of
the state housing goal without any relative disproportionate distribution of household income groups. The
household income groups are defined according to the HUD Median Family Income (MFI): Very-low
(less than 50% of MFI), Low (50-80% of MFI), Moderate (80-120% of MFI) and Above-moderate
(greater than 120% of MFI).
Lathrop RHNA
The 2001 SJCOG Housing Plan determined that 18.3 percent of the households in Lathrop are classified
as Very-low Income, and an additional 15.4 percent of households have been determined to be Low
Income. The assessment must include an analysis of the housing need for all income groups including the
18.3 percent of households with Moderate Incomes and the 48.0 percent with Above Moderate Incomes.
Construction needs are derived from SJCOG population and household growth projections. The income
group proportions are then applied toward the construction need, which results in a goal for the number of
housing units by income group within the City of Lathrop.
For the period 2001 to 2008, the City of Lathrop has been given a construction need of 1,029 new housing
units (see Table 54). The specific need by income group is depicted in the following table. Since 2001
the City of Lathrop has constructed 285 units, of which, based on sales price, all homes built were in the
Above Moderate income group. The majority of the homes were build by William Lyon Homes as part
of a large subdivision. According to the developer the homes within the above-moderate category were
priced between $233,000 to $315,000. As a result the City of Lathrop has a current construction need of
744 units.

2.2.l. AVAILABLE RESIDENTIAL ZONED LAND
In addressing the estimated housing needs identified in the Housing Needs Assessment section of this
housing element, State law requires that this element contain “An inventory of land suitable for residential
development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment….” This inventory must
identify adequate sites which will be made available through appropriate zoning and development
standards and with public services and facilities needed to facilitate and encourage the development of a
variety of housing types for households of all income levels.
As part of the 2003-2008 Housing Element update, an analysis of the residential development potential of
vacant land in the City of Lathrop was completed in June 2003. Appendix D provides a summary of
available residentially zoned land throughout the City of Lathrop. The City of Lathrop has a current policy
to implement the provisions of AB 2292 (Dutra) and prevent the down zoning of a residential property
without a concomitant up zoning of a comparable property.
According to the State Department of Housing and Community Development’s “Housing Resources –
Q&A,” - “The analysis of the relationship of suitable sites to zoning provides a means for determining
the realistic number of dwelling units that could actually be constructed on those sites within the current
planning period of the housing element. The analysis should also identify the zones the locality believes
can accommodate its share of the regional housing needs for all income levels.”
Table 55 (Vacant Residential Acreage and Units) is a listing of vacant land by general plan classification
along with the conservative unit capacity for this classification. A total of 1498.1 acres of vacant land are
currently zoned residential in the City of Lathrop that will accommodate up to 12,882 new housing units
– 12,108 more units than that needed to meet the City’s current Regional Housing Needs Assessment of
744 new units to be built by 2008. In addition, The City will annex an additional 240 Acres currently in
the City’s sphere of influence in the summer of 2004 for the Central Lathrop Specific Plan. This plan will
accommodate an additional 439 high-density residential units, 2,532 medium density and small lot units,
and 1,984 low-density single-family units. The City will continue to monitor the status of the
underutilized land and encourage non-profit developers to purchase this land for affordable multifamily
projects.
Within the City of Lathrop, the high density residential district has the lowest cost of construction per unit
and would therefore be most suitable for very low and low-income construction. In addition, fee costs are
traditionally smaller per unit in the higher density zones. Single-family zones are most suitable to
moderate and above moderate income housing construction. Those areas, including the River islands
project and Mossdale Landing, which is built by specific plan, will accommodate a wide variety of zoning

types. The urban design concept for River Islands at Lathrop include a community of 11,000 housing
units, a town center, schools, open space, recreational facilities, and an employment center. Zoning in
this plan calls for low, medium and high-density residential units. The urban design concept for
Mossdale Landing includes 1,700 dwelling units, commercial and office space, schools, parks and open
space. Zoning in this plan calls for low and medium density residential units. Development of these
plans will begin in 2004.
Although high-density zones will currently accommodate approximately 1,322 multifamily units at a
density of 8-40 units to the acre, exceeding the City’s RHNA requirement, the City will continue to meet
with the development community to ensure that this is sufficient to meet market demand, will monitor
zone change requests on a quarterly basis, will monitor demand at the time of the Annual Update as
required by the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR), and will initiate zone changes,
including annexations, as necessary to meet demand.

INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABILITY
Water and sewer is readily available to all residential vacant land within the developed portions of the
City. The City is divided into three planning districts, lands east of Interstate 5, lands west of Interstate 5
to the San Joaquin River, and the Stewart Tract. For each of these quadrants, the City has established
policies for future urban growth. The City has adopted several master plans including water and sewer
that will allow for infrastructure to be made available as additional housing is developed. In addition
three new water wells and a wastewater treatment plant expansion has been approved.
There are no environmental constraints that would inhibit developers from building on the parcels
identified in the vacant land survey. Lathrop is not located in a flood zone and is characterized by flat
land. As a result, no major grading would be required on these parcels. The vacant parcels identified in
Appendix D are of general parcel size and can accommodate the densities of the designated zoning.

CONSTRAINTS, EFFORTS, AND OPPORTUNITIES
The purpose of this chapter is to analyze potential and actual governmental and non-governmental
constraints on the maintenance, improvement and development of housing in the City of Lathrop. A
discussion of Lathrop’s efforts to remove constraints and to promote energy conservation is included.
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
State and Federal Policy
Actions or policies of governmental agencies, whether involved directly or indirectly in the housing market,
can impact the ability of the development community to provide adequate housing to meet consumer
demands. For example, the impact of federal monetary policies and the budgeting and funding policies of a
variety of departments can either stimulate or depress various aspects of the housing industry. Local or state
government compliance or the enactment of sanctions (sewer connection or growth moratoriums) for
noncompliance with the federal Clean Air and Water Pollution Control Acts can impact all types of
development.

State agencies and local government compliance with state statutes can complicate the development of
housing. Statutes such as the California Environmental Quality Act and sections of the Government Code
relating to rezoning and General Plan amendment procedures can also act to prolong the review and approval
of development proposals by local governments. In many instances, compliance with these mandates
establishes time constraints that cannot be altered by local governments.
Local governments exercise a number of regulatory and approval powers which directly impact residential
development within their respective jurisdictional boundaries. These powers establish the location, intensity,
and type of units that may or may not be developed. The City's General Plan, zoning regulations, project
review and approval procedures, development and processing fees, utility infrastructure, public service
capabilities, and development attitudes all play important roles in determining the cost and availability of
housing opportunities in Lathrop.
Land use controls
The General Plan is the primary land use control document. This policy document not only establishes the
location and amount of land that will be allocated to residential development, but also establishes the intensity
of development (in terms of unit densities and total number of units) that will be permitted. While nearly all
components or elements of the General Plan contain goals and policies that influence residential
development, it is the Land Use Element that has the most direct influence.
The City of Lathrop Development Standards does not contain any unduly restrictive provisions. Building
height, setbacks, lot areas, and parking requirements are generally within the range of other similar sized
cities in the State.

Local Entitlement Fees and Exactions
Part of the cost associated with developing residential units is related to the fees or other exactions
required of developers to obtain project approval and the time required to conduct project review and
issue land use entitlements. Critics contend that lengthy review periods increase financial and carrying
costs, and that fees and exactions increase expenses. These costs are in part passed onto the prospective
homebuyer in the form of higher purchase prices or rents.
A brief survey demonstrates the average cost in planning fees charged by the City of Lathrop. For
example, Lathrop requires a fee of $3,360 for a general plan amendment, while the Stockton and San
Joaquin County fees are all greater. In Lathrop, the average cost for a 20-lot subdivision would be $9,175
with a general plan amendment and a zone change, while in nearby Stockton, the total cost is $10,660.
However, in Manteca the average cost would be $5,500, less than the fee in Lathrop. It is the City’s
policy that all development “pay its own way,” and not be subsidized by the General Fund. The section
on Constraint Removal, p 71, explains how the City of Lathrop addresses these constraints for affordable
housing.

Fees, land dedications, or improvements are required in most housing development in order to provide an
adequate supply of public parkland and to provide necessary infrastructure (streets, sewers, and storm drains)
to support the new development. While such costs are charged to the developer, most, if not all, additional
costs are passed to the ultimate product consumer in the form of higher home prices or rents.
The significance of the necessary infrastructure improvements in determining final costs varies greatly from
project to project. The improvements are dependent on the amount and condition of existing infrastructure
and the nature of the project. A Capital Facility Development Fee to offset the cost of transportation,
police, general government, and fire protection is assessed to each new housing unit constructed within
the City of Lathrop. The amount of the fee is determined by the zoning and location of the project. For
example, on average, the per unit fee cost is $2,446 - $5,058 for low density residential and $1,600 -
$3,716 for high density residential. This fee will be deferred in affordable housing projects if it can be
clearly demonstrated that the fee (alone) will increase the cost of the housing so that it is no longer
affordable to low income households. Therefore, fees are not considered a constraint on the construction
of higher density, affordable housing in Lathrop.

The Manteca Unified School District serves the City of Lathrop. This district has a school impact fee on
development; this fee of $3.66 per square foot, can add significantly to the cost of development, but is
consistent with the amount established by California Government Code Section 65995 et seq. Senior
housing is exempt from school fees because it does not impact the demand for schools.
Compliance with numerous governmental laws or regulations can also add to the cost of housing.
Requirements which relate to site coverage, parking, and open space within developments can indirectly
increase costs by limiting the number of dwelling units which can occupy a given piece of land. This is
especially true with larger units when the bulk of the buildings and increased parking requirements
occupy a substantive share of the site. In some instances, developers must decide whether or not to build
smaller units at the maximum allowable density or fewer larger units at a density less than the maximum.
Either solution can have different impacts on the housing market.
Building a higher number of smaller units can reduce costs and provide additional housing opportunities for
smaller households but does not accommodate the needs of larger families. Larger units can be made
available to families, but because of their size and lower density, the cost of these units is higher.
Other development and construction standards can also impact housing costs. Such standards may
include the incorporation of additional design treatment (architectural details or trim, special building
materials, landscaping, and textured paving) to improve the appearance of the development. Other
standards included in the Uniform Building Code require developers to address such issues as noise
transmission and energy conservation, and can also result in higher construction costs. While some
features (interior and exterior design treatments) are included by the developer as amenities to help sell
the product in the competitive market, other features (i.e. those required to achieve compliance with
energy conservation regulations) may actually reduce monthly living expenses. However, all these
features may add to the initial sales price, resulting in an increasingly difficult hurdle for many new
homebuyers to overcome.
There is a growing concern that the prevailing wage requirements of SB 975 will adversely impact the
production of low income housing in California. By increasing wage costs for builders of low income
housing, prevailing wage requirements likely will reduce the number of housing units that can be
produced with existing resources.
Processing and Permit Procedures
The time required to process a project varies greatly from one project to another and is directly related to
the size and complexity of the proposal and the number of actions or approvals needed to complete the
process. The following chart identifies the most common steps in the entitlement process. It should be
noted that each project does not necessarily have to complete each step in the process (e.g., small scale
projects consistent with General Plan and zoning designations do not generally require Environmental
Impact Reports, General Plan Amendments, Rezones, or Variances). Also, certain review and approval
procedures may run concurrently. Since a majority of Environmental Impact Reports (EIR) are prepared
in response to a General Plan Amendment request, these two actions are often processed simultaneously.
Lathrop also encourages the joint processing of related applications for a single project. As an example, a
rezone petition may be reviewed in conjunction with the required site plan, a tentative tract map, and any
necessary variances. Such procedures save time, money, and effort for both the public and private sector.
However, it is important to note that processing timelines could not be made any shorter without violating
State laws, particularly as they relate to public noticing, compliance with the California Environmental
Quality Act, etc.
For all proposed projects for more than four units, the City invites the developer to a Predevelopment
Meeting. These meetings provide developers with an opportunity to meet with various City staff
representing numerous City departments (e.g. planning, building, public works etc.) to strategize about
project design, City standards, necessary public improvements, and funding strategies (where
appropriate). In addition, the City staff will assist the developer through the permit processing to ensure a
rapid processing time. In general, these larger scale projects take 90 days to complete the approval
process, depending on CEQA requirements. After a staff level review, a report is submitted to the
Planning Commission recommending acceptance of a project. If the project does not require any zone
changes, variances, or other actions that would require City Council approval, the project can then move
forward in its construction permits.
For small-scale development such as infill single-family homes, or duplex development in appropriately
zoned areas, the applicant meets with a planner for site review to ensure that all development standards
are met. If the proposed project does not require any other action such as a lot split or zone change, the
project is then approved by the planning department and construction permits are able to be obtained.
This process takes 30 days.

Building Codes and Enforcement
Compliance with Building Code standards often adds to the cost of construction, but is seen as necessary
to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens. Compliance results in greater construction costs
up front but ensures that the buildings retain their structural integrity. The City of Lathrop does not have
any amendments to its building codes that might diminish the ability to accommodate persons with
disabilities.
In November 2002, the City of Lathrop adopted the 2001 Uniform Building Code (UBC), Uniform
Housing Code, and the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings. New structures must
conform to the standards of the UBC. When a project is plan checked, it is reviewed for minimum
compliance with the 2001 California Building Codes (CBC). This includes Electrical, Plumbing,
Mechanical (heating & cooling), Structural, Energy Compliance, Non-Structural (building exits, interior
environment, etc.) and Disabled Access (commercial buildings). The Uniform Housing Code is not
applicable to structural modifications or additions. The Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous
Buildings applies to all buildings, old or new. These building codes ensure structural integrity, and
facilitate the City’s efforts to maintain a safe housing supply.
On- and Off-Site Improvements
For residential projects the City requires both on- and off-site improvements. These include: curb/gutter
and drainage facilities, sidewalks, paved streets, landscaping and water and sewer service. Such
improvements are required as a condition of the subdivision map, or if there is no required map,
improvements are required as part of the building permit. These on- and off-site improvements promote
the health, safety and general welfare of the public.
Curbs/gutters and drainage facilities direct storm and runoff water out of residential developments. City
roadways are required to be paved. Pavement creates an all-weather roadway, facilitates roadway
drainage, and reduces dust. It also produces a high speed circulation system and facilitates relatively safe
traffic movement. Roadways are classified by the City according to traffic needs. They are as follows:
     •    Arterial – 4-6 lanes, 84 feet right-of-way
     •    Expressways- 4-6 lanes, landscaped dividers with left turn lane
     •    Collector – 2-4 lanes, with a 50 - 64 foot right-of-way, with parking lane
     •    Minor - 2 lanes, 50 foot right-of-way
Arterials and collectors are designated on the General Plan according to existing and projected needs.
Developers are responsible for the development of roadways associated with the residential project and
also participate in regional transportation system improvements through payment of a Capital Facilities
Fee (refer to discussion in Section 2.3, Constraints, Efforts, and Opportunities).
Sidewalks are for movement of pedestrian traffic. Where sidewalks are available, safety of pedestrian
traffic is enhanced, particularly for school-age children, the elderly and the physically impaired.
Landscaping is required for all zoning districts. Such landscaping would include, but not be limited to,
shrubbery, trees, grass and decorative masonry walls. Landscaping contributes to a cooler and more
aesthetic environment in the City by providing relief from developed and paved areas. All landscaping is
installed by the developer and must be approved prior to occupancy of any building.
Development of and connection to municipal water and sewer services are required as a condition of
approving tract maps. Water service is necessary for a constant supply of potable water. Sewer services
are necessary for the sanitary disposal of wastewater. These off-site requirements allow for the
development of much higher residential densities.

Persons with Disabilities
Specifically, compliance with SB 520 (Article 10) is met by permitting supportive multifamily or single-
family housing for the disabled in any residential zone that permits non-designated single or multifamily
housing.
The City of Lathrop offices are handicapped accessible. Disabled applicants are treated with the same
courtesy as all applicants. They are provided one-on-one assistance to complete the forms for zoning,
permits, or other building applications. The City will reasonably accommodate any specific verbal or
written request for assistance. Applications for retrofit are processed over-the-counter in the same
process as for improvements to any single-family home.
The City of Lathrop continually reviews its ordinances, policies, and practices for compliance with fair
housing laws. A recent review resulted in a broadened and revised definition of “family” to include State
and Federal definitions relating to unrelated adults living together as a household unit.
All multifamily complexes are required to provide handicapped parking as per California State standards.
One parking space is provided for each dwelling unit designed for people with disabilities. The City
works with the developers of special needs housing and will reduce parking requirements if the applicant
can demonstrate a reduced need for parking.
The City permits group homes with six or fewer persons in any residential zone without restriction or
additional permits. This allows proponents to locate these facilities in any area they can afford without
additional development or permit costs. The development of group homes is, therefore, a market issue,
not a jurisdictional issue.
Currently, small State-licensed group homes are permitted in multifamily residential districts, large State-
licensed group homes are permitted with administrative approval. There are no regulations relating to the
siting of special needs housing in relationship to distance or location to one another. The City of Lathrop
holds public hearings for every change or amendment to any ordinance, policy, program, procedure,
funding, or other similar action. There is no public comment request for the establishment of a state-
licensed group home, regardless of size. The City will amend the zoning ordinance to allow State
licensed group homes, foster homes, residential care facilities, and similar state-licensed facilities,
regardless of the number of occupants, and are deemed permitted by right in a residential zoning district,
pursuant to State and federal law.
There are no special conditions for group homes that also provide services, such as counseling, if there
will be six persons or less in residence, or if the larger facility is located in a commercial zone or civic
center. However, if the larger facility is planned in a residential zone, the service component will become
a part of the Use Permit process outlined above.
NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
The ability to address the underserved needs of the citizens of the City of Lathrop is challenging,
especially since so many of the impediments to providing services are beyond the scope of municipal
governments. The responsibility for identifying, responding to, and mitigating these needs rests with the
variety of agencies providing services. Funding limitations exist at all levels.

The private market influences the selling and rental prices of all types of housing. This includes existing and
new dwelling units. While actions within the public sector play important parts in determining the cost of
housing, the private sector affects the residential markets through such mechanisms as supply costs (e.g.,
land, construction, financing) and value of consumer preference.
AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING
Another constraint affecting housing costs is the cyclical nature of the housing industry. Housing production
can vary widely from year to year with periods of above-average production followed by periods of below-
average production. Fluctuations are common in most industries, but appear to be more dramatic in the
homebuilding sector because of the susceptibility of the industry to changes in Federal fiscal and monetary
policies. Lathrop has a relatively stable housing market despite interest rate fluctuations. Building permits
for new residential units average 112 units per year since 1992.
One of the significant components to overall housing cost is financing. After decades of slight
fluctuations in the prime rate, the 1980’s saw a rise in interest rates, which peaked at approximately 18.8
percent in 1982. As the decade closed and the economy weakened, the prevailing interest rate was around
10 percent. The decade of the 1990’s has seen interest rates drop dramatically, fluctuating between six
and eight percent. Through 2002, the rates on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage have varied between just
below six percent and eight percent. For the first time since the 1960’s, some mortgage rates have fallen
below six percent.
According to data in Chart 9, the current average sales price for a single family home sold in Lathrop is
$290,000. Assuming a 10 percent down payment, and a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, the Principal-
Interest-Taxes-Insurance (PITI) payment can be estimated between $1,716 for a six percent interest rate
and $2,637 for an 11 percent interest rate. These monthly payments are affordable for households with
incomes between $68,640 and $105,480. In 2003, an estimated 10.4 percent of the Lathrop households
have incomes of $105,480 or greater, so about one tenth of the households can afford the typical single-
family home despite fluctuations in the interest rate.

         * Assumes a 10 percent down payment and Taxes and Insurance at $152 per month. ** Assumes
         30 percent of income towards net monthly payment.
First Time Homebuyer
Another aspect of a comprehensive housing program is the need to assist low income entry level
homebuyers. These households could be caught between increasing rents and the difficulty of saving
money for a down payment, while preferring an opportunity to own a home and accumulate equity.

These households generally are willing to pay up to 35 percent of their income in order to own their own
home.
Lathrop participates in the Pacific Housing Finance Agency. This program varies from traditional First
Time Home Buyer programs because the agency will purchase the home for the qualified buyer, then
lease that home to the buyer at a lower interest rate. In addition, the agency will finance a 3 percent down
payment and pay the closing costs. The buyer will then make lease payments for 39 months at a fixed
mortgage rate of 4.8 percent. After the 39 months, the title reverts to the program participant and a
competitive interest loan is issued for the remaining amount. Pacific Housing Finance agency will only
buy a home for up to $300,700 and the participating household must not have an income over $81,000.
The agency was developed to help those households who can afford to make monthly payment on a house
but cannot afford the costs associated with purchasing a home.
COST OF LAND
The cost of raw, developable land has a direct impact on the cost of a new home and is, therefore, a
potential non-governmental constraint. The higher the raw land costs, the higher the price of a new home.
Normally, developers will seek to obtain City approvals for the largest number of lots obtainable on a
given parcel of raw land. This allows the developer to spread the costs for off-site improvements (e.g.,
streets, water lines, etc.) over the maximum number of lots. Currently, residentially zoned land ready for
development sells for $180,851 per acre.
As the availability of vacant residential land becomes scarcer over time, the cost of vacant land will
increase in the City of Lathrop. However, with the amount of currently vacant residentially zoned land, it
will be several years before availability adversely affects land costs. As a general rule, if the land cost in
the City of Lathrop remains within 35 percent of the total cost of construction, then the availability of
land should not pose a significant constraint on the development of housing for all income groups.
COST OF CONSTRUCTION
The costs of labor and materials have a direct impact on the price of housing and are the main
components of housing cost. Residential construction costs vary greatly depending upon the quality, size,
and the materials being used. In 2002, construction costs are on average $63.30 per square foot for single
family units.
Product design and consumer expectations also influence the types and styles of units being constructed.
Today's new homes are quite different than those produced during the 1960's. Numerous interior and
exterior design features (e.g. larger master bedroom suites, microwave ovens, trash compactors,
dishwashers, wet bars, decorative roofing materials, exterior trim, and architectural style) make it difficult
to make direct comparisons in costs over the years. In a highly competitive market, many consumers
consider these "extra touches" as necessities when buying a new home. While the basic shelter or "no
frills" house has met with varying degrees of consumer acceptance, the high costs of homeownership may
lead to a return to less complicated designs.
A significant constraint to many families is the specific design features (lack of recreational facilities or
unit size and design) in individual projects that are not suited for children. In addition, design features
such as stairs, hallways, doorways, counters, and plumbing facilities may restrict access to handicapped
persons.
CONSTRAINT REMOVAL EFFORTS
The City of Lathrop has instituted actions aimed at reducing the impact of the public sector role in housing
costs. The City's processing policies regarding "piggyback" or concurrent review of related applications for a
single project also reduce overall time and costs.
Although the City's processing and development fee structure accounts for only a fraction of the final costs,
cost implications for developers of low-income housing can be significant when any increase inhibits the
ability to provide units affordable to their clients. The City’s Capital Facility Development Fees are
significantly less for multifamily projects than single-family projects.
The City provides cost reductions to developers through its adopted Density Bonus Ordinance when low
and very-low income housing units are proposed. Further cost reductions occur in the form of increased
densities and concessions such as flexibility in site development standards and zoning code requirements,
and/or accelerated plan check.
Cost reductions occur through the more efficient use of land in the Commercial/Residential land use zone
and the Planned Development (PD) program. For example, the PD residential districts of the zoning code
allow design flexibility through, but not limited to, small lots, zero lot line, cluster developments, mixed
unit types, and high-rise apartments.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
Two basic and interrelated approaches to creating energy conservation opportunities in residences are
conservation and development.
Conservation
Conservation can be accomplished by reducing the use of energy-consuming items, or by physically
modifying existing structures and land uses. The California Energy Commission first adopted energy
conservation standards for new construction in 1978. These standards, contained in Title 24 of the California
Administrative Code, contain specifications relating to insulation, glazing, heating and cooling systems, water
heaters, swimming pool heaters, and several other items. Specific design provisions differ throughout the
State depending upon local temperature conditions. Because of the warm climate, some of the insulation and
heating standards are significantly less stringent in Lathrop.
The California Energy Commission revised the standards for new residential buildings in 1981. These
"second generation" standards were then delayed until 1983 when AB 163 was passed which provided
options for complying with the standards.
Although the energy regulations establish a uniform standard of energy efficiency, they do not ensure that all
available conservation features are incorporated into building design. Additional measures may further
reduce heating, cooling, and lighting loads, and overall energy consumption. While it is not suggested that all
possible conservation features be included in every development, there are often a number of economically
feasible measures that may result in savings in excess of the minimum required by Title 24. Title 24 energy
requirements are consistently reviewed in all building applications processed in the City.
Development

Solar energy is a viable alternate energy source for the City of Lathrop. There are two basic types of solar
systems: active and passive. In passive solar systems, the structure itself is designed to collect the sun’s
energy, then store and circulate the resulting heat similar to a greenhouse. Passive buildings are typically
designed with a southerly orientation to maximize solar exposure, and are constructed with dense material
such as concrete or adobe to better absorb heat. Properly placed windows, overhanging eaves, and
landscaping can all be designed to keep a house cool.
Active solar systems typically collect and store energy in panels attached to the exterior of a house. This
type of system utilizes mechanical fans or pumps to circulate the warm/cool air, while heated water can
flow directly into a home’s hot water system. Solar cells absorb the sun’s rays to generate electricity and
can substantially reduce electric bills. Technology has made the cells increasingly efficient, and has
reduced their cost to the level that may make them more popular with the average consumer.
Although passive solar systems generally maximize use of the sun’s energy and are less costly to install,
active systems have greater potential application to cool and heat a house, and to provide it with hot water
and electricity. This may mean lower energy costs for Lathrop residents.
Approximately 63.6 percent of the City’s housing stock has been built since 1980 and most of these units
benefit from Title 24 and other energy conservation measures. Some conservation opportunities will come
from remodeling existing residences. Major opportunities for residential energy conservation include
insulation and weatherproofing, landscaping, and maximizing orientation and lowering appliance
consumption. With the energy crisis of 2001, many new residential structures are incorporating energy
conservation equipment and design, as well as technological advances (such as automatic timers to control air
conditioning, lighting, etc.) to help reduce energy dependence.
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides gas and electric service to Lathrop residents. This company
offers a variety of energy conservation programs and information services that are available to residents.
Pacific Gas and Electric Rebates
    •    Weatherization: If homes and apartments are not sealed tightly, energy used for heating and
         cooling can be wasted. Weatherization helps to decrease energy costs and increase comfort.
         Weatherization services may include attic insulation, weather stripping and caulking around areas
         where air leakage occurs, exhaust fan dampers, air duct repair, water heater blankets, and low-
         flow showerheads. Approved low income residents may be eligible for free weatherization

ISSUES, TRENDS. AND QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this chapter is to assess state, regional, and local housing issues, in order to provide a
foundation for the City of Lathrop’s Housing Program.
STATE ISSUES AND POLICIES
In 1980, the State of California amended the Government Code by adding Article 10.6 regarding Housing
Elements. By enacting this statute, the legislature found that "the availability of housing is of vital
statewide importance, and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for
every California family is a priority of the highest order. The early attainment of this goal requires the
cooperative participation of government and the private sector in an effort to expand housing
opportunities and accommodate the housing needs of Californians of all economic levels. Local and state
governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested in them to facilitate the improvement and
development of housing to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of
the community..."
A May 22, 2000 update to the Statewide (1996-2000) Housing Plan indicates that California may have to
accommodate 45 million people by 2020. To meet the enormous needs for housing and other services, the
State will have to use all the resources at its disposal.
The five-year housing strategy is intended for the utilization of federal resources toward housing needs in the
state. Three broad objectives are identified for the use of federal funds:
•    Meeting low-income renters needs.
•    Meeting low-income homeowners needs.
•    Meeting the needs of homeless persons and households requiring supportive services.
Within the five year strategy is a sub-list of strategies that are intended to address housing as a statewide
concern:
     •  Development of New Housing (assisting local governments in preparing and implementing housing
        elements of their general plan, expedited permit processing for affordable housing, funding
        resources, and fostering partnerships between housing providers).
     •  Preservation of Existing Housing and Neighborhoods (rehabilitation of existing homes, code
        enforcement, preserving government-assisted housing projects, and mobile home ownership).
     •  Reduction of Housing Costs (development on surplus and under-utilized land, self-help construction
        and rehabilitation programs, tax-exempt bonds for development and rehabilitation, financing and
        manufactured homes, eliminating duplicative environmental review procedures, and revising
        regulations that add to the cost of housing development).
     •  Much higher levels of housing construction are needed to adequately house the State’s
        population.

   •    High housing cost burdens are increasingly an issue for both owners and renters. The
        combination of upward price pressure in the housing markets and relatively tight urban housing
        markets has led to increasing cost burdens, particularly for low-income renter residents.
   •    In some portions of the State, the level of overcrowding has dramatically increased.
   •    A substantial portion of affordable rental housing developments statewide are at risk of
        conversion to market rate use.
   •    Significant numbers of temporary agricultural workers migrate throughout the State, facing
        housing challenges that impact their welfare.
   •    Homeless individuals and households face significant difficulties in obtaining shelter and
        reintegrating themselves into the broader society.
LATHROP ISSUES AND TRENDS
The following is a summary of housing trends in Lathrop.
   •    Over the last Housing Element period, the Lathrop Housing Program was effective in meeting
        73.0 percent of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) goals.
   •     Recognizing the need for affordable housing in the community, the City of Lathrop staff has
        solicited non-profit housing developers, met with these developers, demonstrated properties, and
        reviewed City concessions such as density bonuses and capital facility fee reductions. However
        no developers as yet have agreed to develop affordable housing in Lathrop, preferring the larger
        markets of the nearby cities of Stockton and Manteca. The City will continue to make efforts to
        attract developers to construct affordable housing within the community.
   •    With a viable General Plan and consistent zoning, the City has provided for housing growth far
        beyond this housing element period. A total of 5,497 acres of vacant land are currently zoned
        residential in the City of Lathrop, and will accommodate up to 12,900 new housing units –.
        12,156 more units than that needed to meet the City’s current Regional Housing Needs
        Assessment of 744 new units to be built by 2008.
   •    Five key household trends impacting Lathrop’s housing are:
             - A decrease in affordability of single family homes
             - A high demand for subsidized rental units
             - A projected increase of 2,290 households over the next five years.
   •    Currently 96.2 percent of the Lathrop housing stock is in good condition, 3.3 percent is in need of
        some sort of rehabilitation, and only 0.5 percent or 5 units were found to be dilapidated.
   •    There are no at-risk housing units currently located in the City of Lathrop.
   •    With the approval of several urban plan designs, the City of Lathrop is expected to experience
        housing growth over the next five years that far exceeds the RHNA requirements.

POLICY GOALS AND QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
The goals, objectives, and programs of the 1999 City of Lathrop Housing Element focused on
recommending studies to determine the housing needs of the community. The current update continues to
address the adequate site issues, the availability of federal and state housing programs and housing
preservation, the identification and mitigation of constraints to affordable housing, and the identification
of incentives.
The objectives in this update will be quantified to meet the RHNA for the City, as prescribed by San
Joaquin Council of Governments.
The City of Lathrop has six broad housing priorities:
     1. Assist in the development of housing opportunities and accessibility for all economic levels in the
        City.
     2. Remove constraints that hinder the production and conservation of affordable housing projects.
     3.  Provide and maintain an adequate supply of sites for the development of affordable new housing.
     4. Preserve, rehabilitate, and enhance existing housing and neighborhoods.
     5. Ensure that all housing programs are available without discrimination on the basis of race, color,
        religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, marital status, age, household composition or size, or any
        other arbitrary factor.
     6. Encourage and enhance intergovernmental, public, and private coordination and cooperation to
        achieve an adequate supply of housing for all residents of the community.

The following pages are and explanation of the River Island and Mossdale Landing Specific Plans in
terms of permitted uses, timing, availability, and land use controls. Map A Show the location of the
proposed the specific plans located in Lathrop and the anticipated timing.
MAP A: SPECIFIC PLAN LOCATIO
                                    RIVER ISLANDS SPECIFIC PLAN
River Islands is a planned community located in Lathrop, California. Encompassing nearly 5,000 acres,
River Islands will be a community of 11,000 homes, a vibrant town center, an employment center with
thousands of jobs for local residents, and an extensive open space system. Map B shows the eight
districts that will encompass the River Islands specific plan. These districts include the Town Center,
Employment Center, East Village, West Village, Old River Road, Lake Harbor, Lakeside, and
Woodlands. The parcels that will comprise the approximate 33.5 acres of High Density Residential are
located in the Town Center, near services, transportation, and employment. Map C demonstrates the
location and parcel size of the Multifamily land within the Town Center (see the outlined portion).
Currently, the River Islands Specific Plan waiting to receive State and Federal entitlements to begin the
development of this project. While the River Islands Specific Plan already details the location and
appropriate zoning designations of residential, multifamily and commercial space, it is anticipated that the
first phase of the River Islands project, the Town Center, will be subdivided into individual parcels that
can be purchased by developers in 2005. The multifamily component of this area will equal the 33.5 acres
and will accommodate 1,200 units. The parcel sizes will be large enough to develop multifamily projects.
The Town Center district is expected to be ready for development in 2006, which allows for the
multifamily land located within this specific plan to be available for multifamily development within the
current housing element-planning period. Development in the other districts will commence in 2007
starting with the East Village district immediately adjacent to the Town Center. It is further anticipated
that the employment Center, and West Village will be ready for map subdivisions, in 2008-2009. Full
development of the River Islands project will be completed over the next 20 years. The following is a
description of the various residential zones located within the River Islands Specific Plan.
Low Density Residential: The purpose of this district is to provide appropriately located areas for low-
density housing, and to provide space for community facilities needed to complement urban residential
areas, and for institutions, which require a residential environment. The parcel sizes range from smaller
lots for smaller affordable home to large lots designated for large home development. Permitted Uses:
residential uses including single-family dwellings, small family daycare, family care home, and “an
alcoholic recovery facility”. Second dwelling units, mobile homes, and large family day cares are
allowed with administrative approval. The density of the Low Density Residential is 3-9 units per Acre.
Within the specific plan there is approximately 1,011 acres available for this development, which will
allow for a total anticipate 8,200 units.

  Medium Density Residential: The purpose of this district is for the development of multifamily
  residential structures or small lot single-family homes. Ideal uses include small multifamily complexes
  and small lot urban style single-family housing. Single-family housing, multifamily housing, and group
  homes are permitted in this designation. Nursing homes, boarding housing, mobile homes second
  dwelling units are allowed with administrative approval. Charitable institutions and mobile home parks
  are allowed with a CUP. The density of the Medium Density Residential is 6-20 units per Acre. Within
  the specific plan there is approximately 112 acres available for this development, which will allow for a
  total anticipate 1,600 units.
  High Density Residential: The purpose of the zone is to provide apartment style homes near services,
  transportation and places of employment. Permitted uses include multifamily housing, and group homes
  in this designation. Nursing homes, boarding housing, mobile homes second dwelling units are allowed
  with administrative approval. Charitable institutions and mobile home parks are allowed with a CUP.
  The density of the High Density Residential is 15-40 Units per Acre. Within the specific plan there is
  33.5 acres available for this development, which will allow for a total anticipate 1,200 multifamily units.
  The River Island Development Standards are similar to those of the City of Lathrop General Plan and
  does not contain any unduly restrictive provisions. Building height, setbacks, lot areas, and parking
  requirements are generally within the range of other similar sized cities in the State.

       SECTION D - WATER, SEWERAGE, DRAINAGE & FLOOD CONTROL
INTRODUCTION
Section D of the Community Development Element is intended to provide guidance for the elimination of
deficiencies in existing utility services and obstacles to the expansion of utility services to adequately serve
existing and future development within the Lathrop planning area. The four components of this section
require careful interrelated planning and management, and particularly with respect to combined effects on
water demand, available water sources and the groundwater basin. These three considerations in water
management are paramount in their combined importance to achieving the full potential of urbanization
depicted by the General Plan Diagram. Since the initial General Plan, two key events have occurred that
move the City much closer to the provision of wet utilities for build-out of the plan area. These two events
include the signing of the Water Supply Development Agreement with SSJID in 1995 and the approval of
the Water, Wastewater and Recycled Water Master Plan (Master Plan) in 2001 and as amended in 2004.
The impact of these events is described in this chapter. [Note: Solid waste management is discussed in Part
V under "Open Space for Health, Welfare and Well-Being".]
The policies and proposals which follow describe the conditions to be considered and the "concepts" to be
followed in updating master plans for water supply, sewerage and drainage/flood control. Given agreement
on the concepts of service proposed, detailed master plans for these utility services will be guides for the
preparation of Specific Plans for the City's sub-plan areas.
A STRATEGY AND PROGRAM FOR MEETING REQUIREMENTS FOR MUNICIPAL
WATER SUPPLIES
The City of Lathrop currently derives all of its domestic water supplies from well fields. The distribution
system was originally developed by the Lathrop County Water District prior to Lathrop's incorporation.
On July 1, 1991, the Lathrop County Water District was merged with the City as the Water Division of the
Public Works Department. Since that date, the water distribution system has been substantially expanded.
 The City's water service area currently encompasses most of the developed land between Interstate 5 and
the Union Pacific Railroad from Yosemite Avenue north to Roth Road, along with some agricultural
acreage and a few homes along the Dos Reis Road corridor extending west of I-5 to the San Joaquin River.
Groundwater quality in the area generally west of the former Southern Pacific Railroad remains a problem
for the City primarily because of salt water intrusion and pollution from agricultural and industrial sources.
 The potential for salt water intrusion is especially significant as an obstacle to having a dependable long-
term supply of groundwater to meet the needs of the expanding urban area as depicted by the General Plan
Diagram. The potential limitation on water supplies posed by the continued overdraft of groundwater
throughout the region is a matter of continuing serious concern.
Studies conducted during preparation of the General Plan and the Master Plan suggest that the City should
pursue a strategy and program which will draw on several water sources for assuring the availability of a
firm supply of good quality water to meet the needs of urban expansion. The Master Plan reviewed these
resources and concluded that the following remain as viable potential water sources:
1.       Existing developed and expanded groundwater resources within the General Plan boundaries of the
         City.
                                                     4-D-1
2.       Obtain water from the South San Joaquin Irrigation District in accordance with the Water Supply
         Development Agreement.
3.       Convert riparian and appropriative rights to San Joaquin River, Old River and Paradise Cut water
         from agricultural use to urban use.
4.       Obtain rights to groundwater in the vicinity of Oakwood Lakes south of Interstate 5 and State
         Route 120.
5.       Purchase, transport and upgrade water that is or may become available from watersheds outside
         the immediate Lathrop area.
The City adopted a Water, Wastewater and Recycled Water Master Plan in July of 2001 and as amended
concurrently with the CLSP approvals. That plan forms the basis for the provision of water, wastewater
and recycled water to the General Plan limits within the City of Lathrop. Based on that Master Plan, the
community needs to plan to meet an eventual water need as identified in the Master Plan.
The Basic Strategy
The basic strategy proposed is to perfect an initial firm supply of water of sufficient quantity and quality to
assure urban expansion to meet all future needs. To achieve this objective, steps should be followed
simultaneously if possible in order to meet water needs for the area of urban expansion east of the San
Joaquin River (Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2) and for Stewart Tract (Sub-Plan Area #3) west of the River.
As an on-going responsibility, the City will develop and maintain its existing groundwater resources within
the City Limits. This will include at least one new well within the initial incorporated City limits. The City
will also expand the existing well field to provide additional ground water south of Yosemite Avenue per
the Master Plan.
Participation with the South San Joaquin Irrigation District
The South San Joaquin Irrigation District was founded in 1910 to build the original Melones Dam on the
Stanislaus River and deliver irrigation water to farmers within the river's watershed served by the District.
The role of the SSJID has changed over time. While retaining its name, the District's role is becoming that
of a supplier of municipal water. The District commissioned a study of the needs and feasibility of
supplying Manteca and Lathrop with potable water. A Phase 1 study demonstrated the merit of the District
developing a better source of municipal water by using good quality surface water from the Stanislaus
       1
River. The District's objective is to become the wholesaler of treated water to serve several cities and
communities, including Lathrop. In October, 1995, the cities of Lathrop, Manteca, Escalon and Tracy
signed Water Supply Development Agreements with SSJID to deliver potable water to these cities.
The District's present approach is to use Stanislaus River water stored behind New Melones Dam as the
basic source of supply. This water would flow by gravity with further storage in Tulloch Reservoir
(behind Goodwin Dam). Water would then be diverted to Woodward Reservoir and then to a treatment
plant where only minimal treatment would be required, with conveyance via a pipeline to take-off points at
each community. This project has become known as the South County Surface Water Supply Project
   1
         City of Manteca and Lathrop County Water District: Water Resource Evaluation, Phase 1, Prepared for the
South San Joaquin Water District, Montgomery Engineers, September, 1989.
                                                         4-D-2
(SCSWSP) and anticipates delivery of potable water in the year 2005. The first phase will deliver up to
8,007 AFY to Lathrop, with Phase 2 delivering a total of 11,791 AFY.
Potential Availability of Good Quality Groundwater
For SPA's #1, #2, and #3 obtaining the rights to firm supplies of good quality groundwater on lands of
deep sand deposits in the vicinity of Oakwood Lakes is still an option. A series of rulings and discharge
requirements applied to Oakwood's operations appear to give it the "right" to extract some 9,000 acre-feet
per year and to sell and transport water.
Groundwater aquifers at Oakwood Lakes and directly west of the River between the Union Pacific Railroad
and the I-5 merge are somewhat unique for the area in that they are fairly shallow, being supplied by the
underground movement of water from the areas east of Lathrop and Manteca. These aquifers do not
appear to be connected to those where the City now obtains its water supplies and which may become
adversely affected by saltwater intrusion in the future.
Converting Agricultural Water Rights to Urban Use
Concurrent with obtaining and expanding rights to groundwater, the City should work with the River
Islands development group in obtaining rights to convert agricultural water entitlements for the Stewart
Tract to urban use. Water Right License No. 2637 appropriates water from the San Joaquin River for
agricultural use on lands of the Stewart Tract. This License would provide enough water for urban
expansion of both the Stewart Tract and the area east of the San Joaquin River if conversion to urban use
is authorized. Modification of the license to allow urban water use requires action by the Division of
Water Rights of the State Water Resources Control Board.
An application to the Division of Water Rights would be made by the owner of License No. 2637. It will
be important to retain the right to agricultural use of water for lands which will continue in agricultural use
under phased development. Agricultural operations may remain for many years, but only if current
irrigation waters continue to be available. The option of converting these water rights for potable use on
the Stewart Tract was identified in the Master Plan and in the EIR for the SCSWSP. This option remains
an alternative in the event there is any delay in provision of potable water by SSJID via the SCSWSP.
Obtaining Rights to Other Waters of the Region
A possibility exists that the City of Lathrop can purchase rights to waters from one of several watersheds
where unappropriated waters either exist now or will exist under regional and state plans for developing
water projects that will expand the availability of water for municipal and industrial use. Potential sources
of high quality water include the Stanislaus and Calaveras Rivers. Through programs of water exchange, it
may also be possible to obtain waters from other sources which drain to the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta. By exchanging water with other users, high costs of water transport can possibly be avoided.
An important consideration of any exchange or transport of water from other areas is that existing flow
regimes of some rivers and Delta waterways that might be involved are considered inadequate by the State
Lands Commission to protect public trust resources, such as spawning fisheries. Therefore, the intent of
any water exchange, diversion and transport must avoid any net decrease in river flows and if possible
increase flows in the San Joaquin River to the point at Lathrop where waters would be pumped from the
River for treatment and domestic use.
                                                     4-D-3
Legal Considerations
Legal considerations will likely affect the selection of the final strategy for obtaining water even more than
the technical and financial considerations involved.
Plan Policies and Proposals
In addition to the strategy recommended above for obtaining firm supplies of water, the following policies
provide guidance for updates of the Master Plan and progressive development of a water treatment and
distribution system(s) to meet the needs of the future urban pattern.
1.       The City of Lathrop is the most logical governmental entity to assume management responsibility
         for water service to the developing urban pattern. However, this preference allows for the creation
         of other special districts, including Irrigation Districts, especially if these districts can provide
         utility improvement financing that protects the City’s existing rate payers. Development within the
         City's three sub-plan areas is to be served by the City under development agreements between the
         City and project developers.
2.       Urban development outside the existing city limits shall not be allowed to occur until reasonable
         certainty is established that additional firm supplies of potable water will be available to meet the
         needs of urban expansion into perpetuity.
3.       Any Water, Wastewater and Recycled Water Master Plan update should provide for the eventual
         integration of the water well and distribution system serving the existing community with the
         system(s) needed to serve areas of urban expansion to avoid potential future problems of
         groundwater quality associated with the existing system.
4.       In developing additional groundwater sources to meet requirements for firm water supply, the City
         will be required to meet State and Federal standards of water quality, including concern for such
         factors as taste, odor control, color, removal of any unique compounds of minerals identified
         through water testing, and need for disinfection and/or residual chlorination.
5.       Pressurized water for fire suppression should be available at flows in the range of 1000 gpm (for
         all residential areas) to 3000 gpm (for commercial, industrial and institutional areas) for a period
         of 60 to 120 minutes over and above normal community water uses. The City Fire Chief is to
         be consulted in establishing specific fire suppression plans for new development, including the
         need for automatic sprinkling systems in non-residential and multi-family residential developments
         and the need for above-ground storage to assure capacity for required periods of fire flow.
WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS
As used here, "wastewater management" involves the collection, treatment and disposal of domestic and
commercial/industrial sanitary sewage, with a level of treatment that will allow reuse of the effluent for the
irrigation of residential, commercial, and public uses; schools; public parks; and recreation and open space
areas. The Water, Wastewater and Recycled Water Master Plan anticipated that some treated wastewater
would be discharged to land under a Regional Water Quality Control Board Waste Discharge Requirement,
with the balance disposed of as seasonal discharge of treated effluent to the San Joaquin River. In this
way, the treated effluent would be used as a resource to reduce the amount of potable water needed to serve
new development.
                                                      4-D-4

Collection, Treatment and Disposal Concepts
A First Stage System to Serve the Three Sub-Plan Areas
One of the alternatives in the approved Master Plan allows for separate sewerage systems to be developed
to manage wastewater generated by urban expansion east and west of the San Joaquin River. However, the
Master Plan also allows an expansion of the City’s existing treatment facility located within the Crossroads
Industrial Park to serve residential and commercial expansion in the southern portion of S-P Area #2 and in
S-P Area #3. For Area #3, this approach would satisfy demand unless and until a point when a separate
treatment plant on the Stewart Tract becomes justified or desirable. If a separate treatment plant is
constructed on the Stewart Tract that serves the entire Stewart Tract, the capacity in the treatment plant
east of the San Joaquin River that had been funded by Stewart Tract development could be purchased by
development east of the San Joaquin River. The 2004 Amendment to the Wastewater Master Plan
considers numerous alternatives for the placement of Wastewater Recycling facilities.
Since the City incorporated, the Manteca Water Quality Control Facility has been expanded by the Phase 2
Expansion, and the Phase 3 Expansion is nearing construction. By contract, the City of Lathrop continues
to be provided 14.7% of the capacity of all expansions of this facility, so long as Lathrop pays its share of
these expansion costs.
Recycling and Reuse
The recycling of treated wastewater occurs after treatment and filtration is complete and beneficial reuse is
possible. Reuse of treated wastewater for recreation area irrigation (e.g., golf courses, parks, open space
corridors and ornamental ponds or lakes), urban development area irrigation (e.g., variable density
residential front and rear yards, multi-family common landscape areas, and commercial and public uses
common, buffering, and screening areas), for wash down of commercial areas, and to enhance wildlife
habitat is a major policy of the General Plan both from the standpoint of water conservation, and as a
means to achieve a net reduction in the total amount of water needed for urban use as compared to
continued agricultural use.
For reuse as public contact irrigation water, the effluent will have to meet local, regional, state and federal
requirements of water quality, including filtration, maintenance of specified levels of suspended solids, and
disinfection. The effluent could be applied by above ground or below ground irrigation systems. Areas of
application may in some cases require fencing. Another type of reuse could occur through the application
of partially treated effluent. Settled effluent would be applied to fenced areas that are away from the
general public and which produce commercial animal feed crops (e.g., alfalfa, native hay, milo, corn), or to
productive open space managed as wildlife habitat.
A third alternative would involve seasonal discharge of effluent to the San Joaquin River under permit
authorization of the Environmental Protection Agency and Regional Water Quality Control Board. This
method would help eliminate the need for large-scale water storage during the wet season. It was the
conclusion of the Master Plan and EIR that year round discharge of tertiary treated effluent to the San
Joaquin River would not constitute a significant impact upon the river. It is therefore safe to conclude that
seasonal discharge (when the river flows are higher) would have even less impact upon the environment and
is a reasonable path to pursue. It is to be noted that full seasonal storage will be required for the amount of
effluent generated at any given time in the development process until such time that a permit for seasonal
discharge is obtained.
                                                     4-D-5

Industrial Pre-treatment of Liquid Waste
As a general principal, the pretreatment of industrial waste streams will be required for any industries that
could otherwise contribute excessive levels of BOD or contaminants to the sewage treatment and disposal
process. Policies governing pre-treatment were developed during preparation of the Master Plan.
SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL
A Drainage System Master Plan for Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2 was approved by Lathrop in 1992. That
master Plan noted that parts of the older sections of Lathrop have limited drainage systems, including
blocks west of Seventh Street and in Lathrop Acres north of Lathrop Road. Most of the recently developed
and developing areas are served by a series of detention ponds interconnected with an outfall line extending
southwest along the alignment of Louise Avenue and pumping system for disposal into the San Joaquin
River.
The potential for flooding within Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2 under conditions of a 100 year intensity storm
was eliminated with the reconstruction and enlargement of the levee along the east side of the San Joaquin
River in the late 1980's. This work was accomplished under the auspices of land developers to standards of
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and of the State. The works extends from south of Interstate 5 to the
Weston Ranch area of Stockton, well north of the City, effectively protecting all of the area east of the river
within the Lathrop planning area. Most of the land between the river and Interstate 5 is in irrigated
agriculture, with an extensive underground piping system and an above ground system of ditches for water
conveyance.
A Drainage Master Plan for the Sub Plan Area #3 (Stewart Tract) was approved the City of Lathrop in
1996 as part of the WLSP. That Master Plan noted that the potential for flooding within Sub-Plan Area #3
is significant under current conditions of levee construction and elevation. The Stewart Tract was
originally cleared, diked and developed for irrigated agriculture during the early and mid 1900's. An
extensive underground irrigation system is in place, and the land has been leveled to several elevations and
sloped and graded for flood irrigation. Concrete pipelines at least 48' in diameter extend throughout the
Tract. Flooding valves and checks control the direction of water flow. A system of open drainage ditches
connects with pumping stations that dispose drainage waters to the San Joaquin River, Old River and
Paradise Cut. The Stewart Tract would be nearly saturated at times without this system of ditches and
pumps. A rock dam (weir) was installed across the south end of Paradise Cut that only allows water into
Paradise Cut from the San Joaquin River during high river flows. However, recent analysis of the
operation of this weir shows that it is allowing less water during storm events to flow down Paradise Cut
than was intended with the original Corp of Engineers design. The possibility of directing more flows down
Paradise Cut is being reviewed, and if successful, could lower the elevation in the San Joaquin River and
Old River downstream of the rock weir during high flow events.
As noted in the Master Plan, major work will be required to improve the levee system surrounding the
Stewart Tract before urbanization can occur. Levees around the Tract and along the San Joaquin River are
"Project Levees" subject to the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers and State Reclamation Board. The
Corps and the Reclamation Board serve as lead agencies in providing criteria, elevations and specifications
for levee revetment and improvement. The existing levees were constructed to protect Stewart Tract from a
50-year flood. Flood flows that exceeded this level have resulted in flooding Stewart Tract in the past,
including in 1997.
                                                    4-D-6
Elevations of project 100 year flood stages are shown on Corps maps available at the Flood Plain
Management Office of the Corps in Sacramento. Stewart Tract Project 100 year flood stages range from
15' above msl (mean sea level) to 28' above msl. The high southeasterly elevation is due to railroad and
road embankments with restricted flow capacities that traverse the Tract in at least four locations. Each
restriction causes backwater curves that raise the flood stage elevation at a given location.
Up to 16 miles of existing levees may need rebuilding and improvement to protect the area to be urbanized
from a 100 year frequency flood flow. Any amendment to the Drainage/Flood Control Master Plan for
Stewart Tract should seek to provide protection on a phased basis consistent with phases of development
proposed and approved by the City under the Specific Plan process.
The pumping of uncontaminated surface water from the three sub-plan areas to the San Joaquin River will
not degrade waters of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. However, uncontaminated surface water is
difficult to achieve because of such contaminants as petroleum distillates from vehicles which are deposited
on road and parking area surfaces. New EPA and State Water Quality regulations require the removal of
certain contaminants before discharge to surface waters or groundwater. These requirements generally are
governed by population and/or type of runoff water involved (i.e., commercial, industrial, residential). At
this time, the conceptual approach to surface water drainage is to provide for on-site detention prior to
pumping to natural water courses.
Information and analysis developed during preparation of the General Plan indicates that sufficient capacity
exists in natural water courses within and adjacent to the Lathrop planning area to allow safe management
and control of flood waters external to areas of proposed urbanization. The primary watercourses involved
are the San Joaquin River, Old River and Paradise Cut.
Stewart Tract Flood Control and Drainage Policies
1.        Flood control and drainage construction is to meet standards set by the U.S. Corps of Engineers,
          the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the California State Reclamation Board, the
          California Department of Water Resources, and Reclamation District No. 2062. In each case, the
          most conservative requirements will govern unless otherwise agreed to by the agencies involved.
2.        Levees along the San Joaquin, Old River and Paradise Cut require reconstruction to elevations that
          meet Project levee Standards (approximately 20 feet above mean sea level at the juncture of the
          San Joaquin and Old River, 25 feet at Mossdale Bridge, 25 feet at Paradise Cut and Old River and
          31 feet on the San Joaquin River at the Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way, one-half mile south of
          Interstate 5). The required increase in levee height cannot be determined precisely until field
          mapping and soil investigations of the levees have been completed. All levee construction (within
          their authority) is to be accomplished under Encroachment Permits issued by the California State
          Reclamation Board.
3.        Analysis shall be provided during amendments to the Drainage System Master Plans to indicate
          that no new flood threats will be created external to the Lathrop planning area as a result of flood
          control and drainage works constructed with and perimeter to the planning area.
4.        Amendments to the Drainage System Master Plans will require the determination of required
          conveyance systems and pumping stations, including the availability of standby power units for
          pump station operation. The financing of levee reconstruction for the Stewart Tract should provide
          for local reclamation district management of the funds in accordance with plans approved by
                                                     4-D-7
   appropriate federal, state and local agencies. Phased levee reconstruction should be integrated with
   City approved plans for phased urbanization. Work should proceed under a financial program and
   work schedule reviewed by the City of Lathrop, including capital costs, costs of operation and
   maintenance and methods for achieving periodic repairs, reconstruction and system up-grading.
5. Amendments to the Drainage System Master Plan shall include provision for sites and works that
   eventually may be required for the removal of surface water contaminants prior to discharge to
   water courses.
6. The costs of flood control facilities and for surface water drainage systems in all sub-plan areas,
   should be funded entirely by affected land developers or other non-City financing. These costs
   must also cover the costs of City review and monitoring of work proposals, permits and land
   acquisitions, including legal, engineering and right-of-way work to be conducted by or for the City.
7. The costs of operating and maintaining flood control and drainage facilities by the City are to be
   funded through the creation of maintenance districts or other appropriate mechanisms that avoid
   burdening the General Plan.
8. The design of surface water detention and conveyance facilities may provide for multi-purpose
   recreational and wildlife habitat use of surface waters within recreation and other open space
   corridors to the maximum feasible extent. Detention reservoirs should assist in controlling the rate
   of surface water runoff and for the control of debris, sediment and contaminants.
9. Positive control of surface water runoff and sediment during wet weather is required for all types
   of construction activity required as part of the urban development process. This should include
   requirements for avoiding excessive slopes, trapping of sediments and debris, prohibition of
   grading during periods of rainfall, requirements for stockpiling and reuse of native topsoil and
   revegetation or temporary covering of barren areas to avoid sedimentation of drainageways.
                                               4-D-8
                                                PART V
                     RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Resource Management Element (RME) brings together two mandatory elements and one optional
element into a single functional element of the General Plan. They are: Conservation and Open Space
(mandatory) and Recreation (optional).
RELATIONSHIP TO REQUIREMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
In addition to providing important policies for the management of local resources, the RME is intended to
aid the City in determining whether a proposed public or private project is likely to have a "significant
effect" on the environment as defined by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). In
conjunction with this element, the General Plan EIR serves as the foundation for environmental assessments
for specific projects within the community. While subsequent environmental assessments, including Initial
Studies, Negative Declarations and various types of EIR's, may reference and summarize material from any
part of this General Plan document, the information and policy in this Section will have special relevance
for many projects.
In fostering the objectives of CEQA, RME policies permit sponsors of public and private projects to
consider all but the most site specific environmental factors during the earliest stages of project conception.
This will avoid unnecessary risks during later stages of the development process.
OPEN SPACE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
For convenience and simplicity in organization and description, all General Plan elements included under
the RME are covered under the following open space classification system:
A.       Open Space for Managed Resource Production, including prime agricultural lands, lands
         producing specialty crops, and lands for grazing, mineral production and water supply.
B.       Open Space for the Preservation of Natural and Human Resources, including fish and wildlife
         habitat, unique geological and landscape and historical features.
C.       Open Space for Health, Welfare and Well-Being, including lands to protect the quality of water
         resources, to provide for the disposal of solid and liquid wastes, and to improve the quality of the
         airshed and to protect developed lands from flooding.
D.       Open Space for Shaping Urban Growth, including lands to preserve community identity,
         lands necessary to prevent excessive costs in the provision of urban services and facilities, and
         lands which give form and dimension to the character of the urban pattern.
                                                 5-1
E.       Open Space for Outdoor Recreation, including neighborhood and community recreation parks,
         school site recreation areas, regional and state parks, recreation corridors and trails, unspoiled
         natural areas, and scenic and recreation travel corridors.
The relationship of this classification system to the General Plan Elements included in the RME is shown in
Table V-1. This matrix illustrates the interrelated character of these elements and why the open space
classification system provides such a useful vehicle for describing proposals of the RME.

General Plan included as part of the RME.
OPEN SPACE FOR MANAGED RESOURCE PRODUCTION
Proposals for this category concern preserving productive agricultural lands which lay generally along the
western boundary of the urban area depicted on the General Plan Diagram, and the preservation of lands
having significant value for mineral production.
Agricultural Lands
While it is extremely important to minimize the amount of agricultural land converted for urban use, and to
avoid premature conversion, it is also recognized that virtually all urban expansion west of Interstate 5 and
the land south between the I-5/SR 120 merge and the Union Pacific Railroad must take place on land which
now is being farmed or which has been farmed. The consequences of any policy of absolute preservation
of agricultural land would be to create a monopoly in the urban land market and eventually stymie urban
expansion to the detriment of long-range economic and social interests of the community.
                                                  5-2
As noted in Part 2 of this document, the Lathrop General Plan fits the definition (for the most part) of being
an "end state plan" in that there will be little opportunity to expand the urban area beyond current
boundaries and that what expansion may occur would not involve any lands west of the San Joaquin River
and north of the Stewart Tract on Roberts Island. Roberts Island is recognized as an agricultural preserve
involving lands classified as "prime land" for the production of agricultural crops. Land south of the
Stewart Tract between Paradise Cut and Interstate 205 also lays outside of the Lathrop planning area.
While some of these lands (within the City of Tracy's sphere of influence) may urbanize under policies of
the Tracy General Plan, the Lathrop General Plan Diagram shows only the need for arterial road
connections between I-205 and Stewart Tract.
Further considerations are: 1) that while Lathrop's urban expansion requires the conversion of substantial
agricultural land, such conversion will lessen the need for continued conversion in other nearby
communities of the region (e.g., Stockton, Manteca, and Tracy); and 2) that such conversion will occur
under "new town" development policies which seek maximum efficiency in the utilization of land for urban
purposes at a level which would be difficult if not impossible to duplicate in other communities.
In evaluating the total impact of urbanization on agricultural land, it is important to understand that the
amount of land shown for conversion assumes highly positive economic conditions in order to justify the
extent of urbanization shown on the General Plan Diagram. An alternative to the General Plan as proposed
is to recognize the possibility that the amount of land to be urbanized would be reduced automatically if
long-term market conditions prove insufficient to support it. A reduction in the amount of planned
urbanization is discussed in the "alternatives" and "growth-inducing" sections of the General Plan EIR.
Agricultural Land Policies:
1.       The extent of urbanization proposed within the three Sub-Plan Areas is based on the principle that
         the capacity to accommodate population and economic growth is dictated by the need to preserve
         environmental qualities rather than the potential of Lathrop to grow beyond its planning area
         boundaries. If future conditions indicate a potential for further urbanization greater than that
         encouraged by the General Plan west and south of the planning area, such potential is to be
         satisfied within the sphere of influence of local governments other than Lathrop.
2.       Exclusive agricultural zoning shall be continued on agricultural lands outside the boundaries of the
         three sub-plan areas.
3.       The protection of agricultural lands outside of the three sub-plan areas shall be reinforced by firm
         policies of the City to not permit the extension of sewerage and water service to such lands.
4.       The City, the County and affected landowners should develop a comprehensive approach to the
         cancellation of Williamson Act contracts on lands needed for early phases of urban development.
         Projects that are intended to take more than five years to complete shall be phased to allow
         agricultural operations to continue as long as feasible on lands to be developed after five years.
The procedure for cancellation of Williamson Act contracts is provided in Section 51245 of the
Government Code. Basically, it will require that affected land owners must first notify the County or City
by a Notice of Non-Renewal of their intent to not renew their contracts, followed by findings of the Lathrop
City Council that cancellation is consistent with the purposes of the Williamson Act or is in the public
interest. To reach the point of findings, property within the County must first be annexed to the City so
that the City can succeed to responsibility for Williamson Act contract management from the County.
                                                   5-3
Prior to annexation, the General Plan calls for the preparation of one or more Specific Plans involving
mutual interests in the development of property. This requirement will avoid the premature conversion of
agriculture land to urban use and assure the physical integrity of remaining agriculture land (including
contracted land). All of the above presupposes that the affected lands will have been included in an
expanded sphere-of-influence by the San Joaquin County LAFCO.
Having adopted a "right-to-farm" ordinance prior to completion of this General Plan, the City has taken an
important step to minimize and hopefully eliminate the potential for urban-agricultural conflicts at the
margin of the urban pattern.
Mineral Resources
Lands requiring preservation for the extraction of valuable mineral resources are shown on Figure V-1, and
are located south of State Route 120 and generally east of the Interstate 5/205/Rte 120 merge near the
southeast end of the Stewart Tract. These lands include deposits of sand which have high value for use in
the making of high quality Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) used in building construction. These lands
have been classified by the State Department of Conservation as Mineral Resource Zone-2 (MRZ-2), and
have also been designated by the State Mining and Geology Board as shown on Figure V-1.5. 1 By
definition MRZ-2 involves "areas where adequate information indicates that significant mineral deposits are
present, or where it is judged that a high likelihood for their presence exists." Approximately 884 acres are
involved, of which 161 acres already has been permitted (Oakwood Lakes sector). Remaining unpermitted
deposits are estimated as involving 90 million tons of sand, at a thickness of about 80' and a PCC grade of
60%. Because these deposits are considered important to the area and to be of regional and statewide
significance, the City of Lathrop is required to incorporate mineral resource management policies in its
General Plan which will accomplish the following:
-        Recognize mineral information classified by the State Geologist and designated by the State
         Mining and Geology Board.
-        Assist in the management of land use which affect areas of statewide and regional significance.
-        Emphasize the conservation and development of identified mineral deposits.
Owners of some of the lands classified as MRZ-2 indicate that they fully intend to extract the sand deposits
in accordance with a reclamation plan to be approved by San Joaquin County prior to developing the
property with a lake for commercial recreation use. This property lays between I-5 and the Union Pacific
Railroad, immediately west of the San Joaquin River.

Mineral Resource Policies:
1.       Lands classified by the State Department of Conservation as MRZ-2 as shown on Figure V-1 and
         as designated by the State Mining and Geology Board as shown on Figure V-1.5, are urged for
         protection to assure their availability for mining under applicable provisions of State Law and local
         ordinance. If determined practical and feasible, these lands are to be mined and reclaimed in
         accordance with the provisions of the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975, as
         amended, prior to their being utilized for the various urban purposes depicted on the General Plan
         Diagram and described in this document.
2.       While the depth of the known sand deposits of regional significance is considerable, the potential
         for mining to this depth is recognized only for the lands between the I-5/SR 120 merge and the
         Union Pacific Railroad. Lands classified MRZ-2 and designated on Stewart Tract may be mined
         to a much lesser depth, or not at all, because of the potential of this site location for Regional
         Commercial and Highway Commercial development.
3.       Lands classified MRZ-2 and designated as described above shall be zoned by the City with a
         combining "mineral resource open space zone" to identify the presence of known mineral deposits
         and which may restrict the encroachment of incompatible land uses in those areas for which
         mineral conservation is urged. As an alternative, such restriction may be included in any Specific
         Plan applicable to the affected property.
4.       In consideration of mineral policy #2, above, lands classified MRZ-2 and designated may be
         developed for urban use without first being mined only if compelling reasons can be stated by the
         City in writing in support of such action and upon fulfilling the requirements of Section 2762(d)
         and Section 2796(a) of the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975, as amended. Action by
         the City shall consider the need to balance mineral values against alternative land uses, and the
         importance of these mineral deposits to the regional market demand for their use.
OPEN SPACE FOR NATURAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES
Vegetation, Fish and Wildlife Habitat
As described in the EIR (Part III - Environmental Setting), the Lathrop planning areas possesses fish and
wildlife habitat of intrinsic value, including agricultural lands, riparian vegetation and wetlands. Certain
areas are either known or suspected of providing habitat for the Swainson's hawk, and possibly other
threatened species of birds, animals and plants. The waters of the San Joaquin River and its tributaries
also remain important fisheries for salmon, steelhead and other valuable species of fish and aquatic life.
It is to be noted that as the center of the State's fresh water distribution system, the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta is critical to fish and wildlife habitats, including migratory birds of the Pacific Flyway.
Because the Lathrop planning area is located within the boundaries of the Delta, it is incumbent on the City
of Lathrop to include policies and proposals in its General Plan which reflect the special planning
approaches necessary to adequately protect the valuable Delta resource.
Most of the fish and wildlife habitats within the planning area, and especially those along the western
border of SPA #2 and along Paradise Cut within SPA #3, are therefore of importance for preservation into
perpetuity.
                                                   5-7
Vegetation, Fish and Wildlife Policies:
The following policies seek not only the retention of virtually all of the beneficial habitat which now exists,
but also to enhance habitat which has been degraded and to create new habitat where feasible.
1.      The objective of habitat retention calls for:
        -    The integration of waterway habitat areas as part of the area wide system of open space.
        -    The preservation of all stands of vegetation along waterways which provide habitat, and
             achieving a standard of "no net loss of wetland acreage".
        -    The careful introduction of public and private recreation activities within habitat areas which
             will not disturb natural conditions either through intensity of operations, high levels of noise
             generation, or scarring of the landscape through development activity.
        -    The retention of hedgerows and other habitat areas within intensively farmed acreage which are
             compatible with agricultural operations.
        -    The protection of fisheries by preventing discharge of contaminated surface waters to
             waterways.
2.      The objective of habitat enhancement calls for:
        -    The improvement of natural habitat along waterways.
        -    The creation of new habitat within multi-purpose open space area designated for reuse of
             treated wastewater for wildlife management and recreation.
        -    Cooperative approaches among landowners to manage farmlands so as to increase the numbers
             of desirable species of wildlife.
3.      The City has adopted (effective October 15, 1996) a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for the
        Swainson's hawk. The acquisition of lands required as replacement habitat for nesting and
        foraging is to be funded by fees imposed upon developers whose land development activities would
        threaten, endanger or eliminate existing habitat within the Lathrop planning area. The HCP shall
        be based upon a current habitat field survey taken during the Swainson's hawk nesting season to
        determine whether Core Conservation Areas or only foraging habitat exists.
        It is the intent of the City of Lathrop to be a good steward of its biological resources for the benefit
        of its citizens and the general public. The General Plan EIR acknowledges that significant impacts
        would occur to Swainson's hawks, and potentially significant impacts could occur to other species.
        Mitigation measures are provided in the General Plan EIR to mitigate the impacts. The purpose of
        the following information is to clarify the proposed mitigation as a matter of General Plan policy.
        a.        A mitigation concept is presented on page 8-D-8 which states that the City should adopt its
                  own HCP, or possibly participate in the plan being prepared by the City of Stockton. The
                  City intends to prepare an HCP, in cooperation with other jurisdictions that would
                  mutually benefit from Lathrop's HCP. Information and data from Stockton's HCP will be
                  used to the extent appropriate. The City shall implement the following to fully mitigate
                  impacts described in this policy and the EIR:
                  1. An HCP developed by the City, which meets the standards specified by the State of
                      California Department of Fish and Game.
                                                  5-8
            2. Participation in the “Stockton Plan”. The “Stockton Plan’ is a Habitat Management
                Plan which is, as of April 22, 1992, being developed by the Cities of Stockton, Tracy
                and Lathrop and the County of San Joaquin.
            3. Until it is participating in an HCP, the City shall not pre-zone and/or annex any real
                property or approve a specific plan for the development of real property, unless these
                conditions are met:
                     a. For each acre annexed to, pre-zoned by or which is the subject of a specific
                         plan (subject to an event), the City will mitigate the loss of Swainson’s hawk
                         habitat by providing a one-to-one ratio habitat, including foraging habitat, or
                         equal value.
                     b. All property subject to an event shall be considered Swainson’s hawk habitat.
                         Habitat acquired for will be called the “preserve acreage”. “Preserve Acreage”
                         may also consist of conservation easements, and in lien fee ownership of
                         property and shall be subject to the following conditions:
                             1. The “preserve acreage” must meet regulations specified by the State
                                  of California Department of Fish and Game.
                             2. The “preserve acreage” must be located within one mile of the
                                  property subject to the event.
                             3. The “preserve acreage” shall be deeded to the Department of Fish and
                                  Game, or the Land Utilization Trust.
                             4. A mitigation fee shall not be sufficient mitigation for real property
                                  subject to an event, but actual mitigation by acquisition of real
                                  property or a conservation easement shall be required.
                             5. A management fee will be collected in an amount to ensure that
                                  sufficient income will be available to manage the preserve property.
   b.       Lathrop's HCP will be completed prior to the City allowing specific project EIR's to be
            completed for projects proposed west of Interstate 5. This will ensure that the necessary
            mitigation plans and agreements with the State Department of Fish and Game (DFG) are
            in place for protection of Swainson's hawks. The HCP process will commence as soon as
            reasonably possible after General Plan adoption, involving close cooperation with DFG. It
            is recognized that foraging habitat is one of the most important elements required for
            preservation of Swainson's hawks.
4. Developments proposed in sensitive biological areas shall be required to provide a site-specific
   analysis of the impacts of the project on fish and wildlife habitat. Because of the large-scale
   character of development proposed in the vicinity of biologically sensitive environments, including
   the conversion of several thousand acres of agricultural land to urban use, project proposals should
   be made to address ways in which new or enhanced habitat may be created as a trade-off to the
            general environmental impacts on biological resources associated with development under
   the General Plan.
5. Land use within areas of riparian habitat shall be restricted to nature-oriented passive recreation,
   which may include an arboretum, zoological gardens, hiking and nature study essential linear
   infrastructure and other such uses compatible with existing or enhanced riparian habitats.
   Structures, which would reduce the amount of area available for water detention, should be
   prohibited within the Paradise Cut flood plain unless they are accompanied by concurrent
   expansion of such detention areas in or adjacent to Paradise Cut.
                                              5-9

6.       A naturally landscaped corridor shall be provided along the western perimeter of SPA #2, which
         lies west of Interstate 5. This corridor should be wide enough to serve as a major component of the
         recreation and open space system, and should provide for a system of pedestrian, bicycle and
         equestrian trails where such uses are compatible with riparian habitats, where they exist. This
         corridor will also assure public access to the San Joaquin River as required by State policy and law
         and as permitted by RD-17.
     7. The visual amenities of water and its potential as wildlife habitat are to be reflected where feasible
         in all developments by the inclusion of bodies of water as components of urban form. Such bodies
         of water may be in the form of lakes, ponds, lagoons, simulated streams or similar features which
         can be integrated by design within recreation open space corridors, parks, commercial and
         residential areas and public sites. The multi-purposes use of water bodies for surface water
         drainage, flood control, wastewater reclamation, wildlife management, recreation and visual
         amenity is encouraged.
Landscape Features
Lands within or adjacent to the urban development boundary for the Lathrop Growth center are mostly
devoid of any natural landscape features. However, ornamental trees and shrubs within the urban pattern
(and croplands around it) have become essential components of the urban landscape, providing shade,
accent, color, windbreaks, and visual screening. Street trees have become especially important to the
residential environment. In contrast, commercial/industrial areas east of Interstate 5 are almost barren of
tree and shrub plantings.
1.       Appropriate trees within public rights-of-way are to be retained and new street trees planted and
         maintained in accordance with policies and procedures of a Master Street Tree Plan and Street
         Tree Ordinance. Only trees which are either badly diseased, disruptive of street improvements
         because of root growth, or dangerous to the public shall be allowed to be removed.
2.       The installation of street trees shall be made a condition of approval of residential, commercial,
         industrial and institutional development along such streets.
OPEN SPACE FOR HEALTH, WELFARE AND WELL-BEING
Considerations in this category are limited to air quality and solid waste management. Policies and
proposals with respect to the topics of water supply, sewerage, drainage and flood plain management are
provided in Section IV-D of this document. Proposals concerning seismic and noise hazards are provided
in Part VI of this document.
Air Quality Management
Currently, the City and its environs are impacted by conditions of air pollution generated along the major
transportation corridors and population centers of the region, and from the San Francisco Bay Area. The
interregional transfer of air pollutants from the Bay Area and by traffic along freeway sections upwind of
Lathrop is substantial during the summer and fall months of the year. The community is also adversely
affected by particulates generated by the plowing of land in spring and the burning of agricultural wastes.
The extent of residential development and the concentrations of commercial and industrial land use
envisioned by the General plan will generate vehicle traffic on the freeways and local street system to such
                                                  5-10
an extent that adverse impacts on air quality can be expected unless important mitigation measures are
carried out during early stages of urban development. In developing the final General Plan document and
Final EIR, significant changes in land use and transportation policy were incorporated that lessens
significantly the extent of adverse impacts on air quality that are expected. [Note: see the General Plan
EIR for a discussion of projected vehicle emissions and for reference to mitigation measures made a part of
the General Plan.]
Solid Waste Management
The City manages solid wastes in accordance with policies of the County's Solid Waste Management Plan
(SWMP) as they pertain to Lathrop. The County of San Joaquin is responsible under agreement with the
cities of the County for providing all facilities necessary to meet requirements of the SWMP and State
Law, including resource recovery plants, transfer stations and landfills. Solid wastes pickup throughout the
community is accomplished under a franchise agreement between the City and Lathrop Environmental
Services.
The City is preparing a Source Reduction and Recycling Element of the SWMP. 2 This Element sets forth a
plan and program for accomplishing significant reductions in the amount of waste to be disposed of to
landfills. Reduction targets are 25% diversion by 1995 and 50% by 2000. This amount of diversion
becomes very significant in light of solid waste generation from Lathrop, assuming 50% and 100% build-
out scenarios. In 1990, Lathrop disposed about 6,900 tons of solid wastes to landfills managed by the
County. This amounts to about 5.4 pounds/person/day as compared to a countywide average in 1988 of
nearly 8 pounds/person/day. Under a scenario where about 50% of the land development envisioned by the
General Plan would occur, Lathrop would generate an amount of waste in the order of 40,000 tons.
Assuming that the recycling target of 50% was being met, the amount of waste would be about 20,000
tons. Changing the assumptions to 100% build-out under the General Plan plus 50% recycling, the annual
amount of waste would increase to about 40,000 tons. While commercial recreation facilities typically are
large generators of solid waste as a single source, no assumption is made that waste generation will be
greater per capita because patrons will not likely generate any more waste there than they would at home.
Air Quality and Solid Waste Management Policies:
1.       Mitigation of air quality impacts is to be achieved in part through the design and construction of an
         efficient system of arterial and collector streets and interchange and freeway improvements that
         will assure high levels of traffic service and the avoidance of unmanageable levels of traffic
         congestion.
2.       Mitigation of air quality impacts is to be achieved in part through the development of a regional
         rail transit service to be incorporated into early stages of development.
3.       The City shall adopt standards, which require industrial process analysis before the fact of site and
         building permit approval to assure compliance with State air quality and water quality standards.
         Standards shall provide for periodic monitoring of industrial processes, which could have an
         adverse impact on water or air quality. Industrial process review that may be required should be
  2
         Source reduction and recycling is mandated by provisions of AB 939 enacted in 1989 which also requires that all
waste management operations in the County be integrated as part of a single County-wide Integrated Waste Management Plan.
                                                      5-11
        conducted as part of environmental assessment by an engineer licensed in California having
        demonstrated experience in the industrial processes involved.
4.      The City shall require positive control of dust particles during project construction activities,
        including watering or use of emulsions, parking of heavy equipment on paved surfaces, prohibition
        of land grading operations during days of high wind (beginning at 10 mph, with gusts exceeding 20
        mph), and prohibition of burning on vacant parcels. The City should seek the cooperation of
        agricultural operators to refrain from the plowing of fields on windy days, and to keep loose soils
        under control to the extent reasonable to avoid heavy wind erosion of soils.
5.      The beneficial effects of open space and vegetation on the air resource are to be reflected in the
        arrangement of land uses depicted on the General Plan. Heavy plantings of trees are encouraged
        to assist in maintaining oxygen levels.
6.      The need to protect and preserve the air resource within the planning area and to reduce levels
        of vehicle emissions of air pollutants imposes practical limitations on the extent to which the City
        can depend on the automobile as the principal source of transportation into the next Century.
7.      Environmental assessments for development projects proposed consistent with the General Plan
        shall provide all of the information required under the "Waste Plan Format for Development
        Projects" that is employed by the San Joaquin County Department of Public Works.
Archaeological and Cultural Resources
As described in the EIR (Part III - Environmental Setting), there are several known areas of cultural
resources within the Lathrop planning area, and a potential for uncovering similar resources during the
process of land development. Maps of known cultural resources have been provided to the Lathrop City
Planning Department, to be used in avoiding adverse impacts on such resources.
Archaeological and Cultural Resource Policies:
1.      Existing known archaeological and cultural resources are to be protected, beginning with the
        filing of an application for development in the immediate vicinity of such resources. The City
        shall follow the procedures set forth in Appendix K of CEQA Guidelines. Confidentiality shall
        be maintained between the City and developer to avoid vandalism or desecration of such
        resources. Alternatives for development design intended to protect cultural resources shall be
        reviewed by a Native American having competence in understanding and interpreting the
        importance of the resources and of the most desirable methods to assure their preservation.
2.      The potential loss of as yet unknown archaeological and cultural resources shall be avoided by
        close monitoring of the development process. The close proximity of properties intended for
        development to natural watercourses or to known archaeological or cultural resources shall be
        taken as a signal by the City and developer of a potential for unearthing unknown resources. In
        such cases, the City shall instruct the developers, construction foremen and City inspectors of the
        potential for damage to artifacts and sites, and provide written instructions requiring a halt to all
        excavation work in the event of any find until the significance of the find can be evaluated by
        competent archaeological and Native American specialists. The costs of such protection work
        shall be the responsibility of the developer.
                                                 5-12
OPEN SPACE FOR SHAPING URBAN GROWTH
Open space in the Lathrop area that has the effect of shaping the pattern of urban growth includes the
extensive acreage of agricultural land that borders the community on the south and west and the Union
Pacific Railroad that shapes the pattern on south and east. Agricultural lands north of SPA #2 divide the
future development patterns of Lathrop and Stockton. A permanent agricultural open space buffer should
be considered along the Bowman Road corridor, which forms the northern part of Lathrop’s proposed
sphere-of-influence. No other special measures are required except those provided previously under the
topic of Open Space for Managed Resource Production. The San Joaquin River and the sloughs, which
border the Stewart Tract on the north and south, combine to assist in establishing clear boundaries for the
future urban pattern, which are to be reinforced by policies concerning agricultural land preservation and
the extension of municipal sewerage and water services.
OPEN SPACE FOR OUTDOORS RECREATION
The Recreation component of the RME describes a comprehensive system of recreation areas, facilities and
services needed by people of the community. Outdoor recreation proposals include both neighborhood (or
village) and community-wide systems of recreation open space to assure a variety of recreation opportunity
for people who reside in the community and visitors to the community.
Discussion of "recreation" often is plagued by misunderstanding and vagueness concerning the very
meaning of the term. However, there is widespread agreement within the field of recreation management
that the term is well defined broadly as follows:
"Recreation encompasses all forms of activity and planned inactivity which are undertaken voluntarily for
pleasure, fun, relaxation, exercise, self-expression, or release from boredom, worry or tension. Recreation
is physically and psychologically rejuvenating because it occurs apart from the essential routines of one's
life."
Recreation Roles and Responsibilities
Every present-day indicator of economic and social trends points toward the availability of an increasing
proportion of leisure time. Therefore, a serious attempt to meet the needs of City residents in the face of
existing deficiencies and demands will require a substantial commitment by the City, other agencies of local
government and private groups. A key factor is the complexity of recreation activity. Participation in
recreation activity is an individual choice made on the basis of knowledge, skill, aptitude, and social and
economic status. A myriad of recreation pursuits exist, and new forms continue to emerge even before
society has learned to respond to older ones.
The pervasive nature of recreation works against the establishment of clear-cut allocations of responsibility
of governments at all levels. Patterns of use do not observe jurisdictional lines. It is common to find
regional use of local areas and facilities, and local use of regional, statewide and federally sponsored areas
and facilities. Similarly, the roles of the City and local school districts can become blurred. Under these
circumstances, inequities develop when any given jurisdiction fails to assume its fair share of responsibility.
The basic roles of each level of government and the private sector are summarized below prior to defining
more specifically the roles for the City of Lathrop. The function of supplier provides the clearest basis for
allocating responsibilities:
                                                  5-13

The primary roles of the City and the Manteca Unified, Banta and Tracy High School Districts as
suppliers are to provide those park and recreation areas, facilities and programs which are needed to meet
neighborhood and community needs of residents of the Lathrop urban area.
The primary role of the County of San Joaquin as a supplier is to provide those park and recreation
areas, facilities and programs necessary to meet the "County day-use" needs of all residents of the County.
Such needs are largely of an outdoor recreation character for which demand exists within one-half to one
hours driving time, including sightseeing, picnicking, day-use and limited overnight camping, hiking,
boating and natural area swimming, hunting and fishing.
The primary role of the State of California as a supplier is to preserve and (as appropriate) develop for
park and recreation purposes those areas which have natural or historic values which will benefit the people
of the regions of the state and the entire state.
The primary role of the private sector as a supplier is to enrich recreation opportunity for self-
determining groups and the individual which cannot be met easily, or at all, by government. As used here,
the phrase "private sector" refers to civic, fraternal, religious, service and charitable organizations, to
commercial recreation interests and to voluntary services by individuals.
The Unique Role of Non-Commercial Private Groups
Non-commercial private groups pursue a wide range of recreation opportunities to meet the specific needs
of the people they represent. Such activity needs to be coordinated with activities of the City and of public
and private schools. Lathrop has many private groups whose activities offer a direct recreation experience
for the participant as well as for the recipient of the service rendered by the group. One of the most
significant contributions is experience in meeting the needs of various age groups, and in meeting
specialized needs within a given age group.
Examples for younger age groups include organized team sports for baseball, football and soccer, YMCA
and Scout troops. Examples for adults and the elderly include programs and events sponsored by fraternal
organizations, senior citizens and churches. Private groups typically render types and levels of recreation
service for which there is limited demand, as compared to broader demands involved in the recreation
services provided by the City and local school districts.
The Role of Commercial Recreation
Commercial recreation interests have an important role to play in meeting specialized needs of individuals,
and where significant investment in land, facilities and equipment may be involved. Examples include
health and athletic clubs, bowling alleys, outdoor theaters, entertainment centers, golf country clubs, riding
stables, and hunting and gun clubs.
Financial Constraints
With the local taxing limitations imposed by Proposition 13, and the assumption by the State of a majority
of school construction and operation financing, traditional roles of recreation service are no longer possible.
In response to these limitations, many cities throughout California have imposed fees upon developers to
meet their fair share of neighborhood and community-wide recreation needs. Special recreation districts
have also been created to assure that existing residents pay their fair share to satisfy unmet needs. And,
volunteerism and private sector activity is on the increase.
                                                  5-14
At this point, the City has little capacity to enlarge its role as a direct supplier. Indirectly, the City can
channel funds from recreation development fees or from State grants and loans to provide needed facilities
at school sites. Greater application of the "user fee" concept is also needed where those who benefit from a
service pay for the service on a self-sustaining basis. This approach is especially useful for maintaining
facilities which benefit only a minority of residents. For some recreation activity, it may be possible to
attract private funding to replace certain traditional roles of the City and local school districts.
Recreation Goals and Policies
Goals:
With more people in the labor force, increased technology and the shorter work week, the amount of leisure
time has increased for most people. For the unemployed, the amount of leisure time is excessive. Some
people experience the lack of opportunity for creativity and self-expression on the job, and less physical
exertion is required for most jobs. With birthrates again on the rise, and life span increasing, the need for
recreation is being extended over a longer period of time.
People need to understand and have alternative ways to productively utilize leisure time to accomplish their
own goals and to receive satisfaction from each recreation experience. They also need to be self-starters in
initiating recreation activities as compared to depending solely on what government might provide. Taking
these factors into consideration, the Recreation component of the Resource Management Element focuses
on the attainment of the following goals:
1.        To provide recreation which enables individuals to choose from a variety of opportunities,
          including (but not limited to): music, dance, arts and crafts, sports, drama, nature study, games,
          special events, trips and educational activities.
2.        To provide recreation opportunities for persons of all age groups, religious and ethnic
          backgrounds, economic levels, abilities (including the disabled) and for both sexes.
3.        To assure quality leadership in the provision of recreation opportunity, including skill
          development, individual and group activities, creativity and self-expression, socialization, self-
          fulfillment, involvement, the constructive release of tension and anxiety, individual growth,
          meeting expressed needs and wants, and carry-over value throughout one's life.
4.        To provide year-round recreation programming which involves the public in program planning,
          evaluation and implementation.
5.        To enlighten and educate people for the worthy use of leisure time.
Recreation Policies:
The following statements of policy are recommended for adoption by the City, and the Board of Trustees of
the Manteca Unified and Tracy High School Districts:
1.        It is the policy of the City and the School Districts, functioning under a joint powers or other
          appropriate written agreement, to provide the quantity and quality of recreation opportunity
                                                  5-15
   necessary for individual enjoyment and to assure the physical, cultural and spiritual benefit of
   recreation for all people of the community.
2. The City and School Districts support the creation of a means to achieve a permanent and stable
   funding for local recreation services.
3. The recreation program will encompass the needs of all age groups, concentrating on activities and
   experiences which people are mostly unable to provide for themselves and spanning the following
   range of active and passive recreation needs:
   a.     Big muscle activity:       organized sports, informal (free) play, swimming and physical
          education.
   b.     Creative play: activities which engage the imagination of youth to build or create an
          individual experience from simple elements such as sand, water, wood, space, paving, turf,
          and a wide variety of natural and man-made objects.
   c.     Social activities: experiences which offer the time and atmosphere for an appraisal of social
          values, with a sharing and interchange among people, and where little is required in the way
          of prescribed levels of performance and individual preparation.
   d.     Rhythms, music and the performing arts: solo opportunities of self-expression as well as
          group participation in the dance, drama, singing, or the playing of a musical instrument.
   e.     Hand-Intellect: painting, sketching, sculpture, arts & crafts.
   f.     Mental-Intellect: reading, writing, speaking, and learning.
   g.     Nature-Learning: outdoor learning experiences involving birds, animals, vegetation, soils,
          water, weather and other elements of nature.
   h.     Service activities: personal involvement for the satisfaction of others.
   i.     Relaxation: used here as doing things which generally require little effort and resulting in a
          sense of calm and repose.
   j.     Solitude: the opportunity to re-create through quiet and moments alone.
4. The range of recreation opportunities listed above will be provided through the development of
   general and specialized areas and facilities at the neighborhood and community level throughout
   the urban area.
5. The fulfillment of recreation needs will be accomplished through a coordination of effort and
   programming on the part of the City, local school districts, and charitable, service, religious, and
   civic organizations, which takes maximum advantage of fiscal and physical resources, and
   individual and group interest, leadership and talent within the community, both public and private.
6. Through an ongoing coordinated effort, a "framework for cooperation" should be developed and
   maintained by the City and School Boards. This framework should clearly delineate the areas of
                                            5-16
        responsibility to be retained by each jurisdiction. Examples of topics include fee structures,
        contracts for maintenance and operation and coordination and sponsorship of recreation
        programming.
7.      The City will encourage and, where appropriate, require the provision of recreation areas and
        facilities within residential areas and the community as a whole to meet the general and specialized
        needs of existing and future residents. The Recreation component of the Resource Management
        Element of the General Plan is intended to meet the criteria and standards required by the State
        Subdivision Map Act and by the Quimby Act for determining financial responsibilities of
        developers in meeting recreation needs of the community.
Recreation Demand and Space Requirements
The measurement of recreation demand is complex because demand is both dynamic and variable by its
nature. Recreation demand, and the amount of space required to accommodate it, varies among
communities depending on the socio-economic characteristics of the population to be served.
Consequently, proposals of the General Plan deal with "basic" needs at the neighborhood and community-
wide level, including specialized facilities, for a future population of about 30,000.
Types of Outdoor Recreation Areas
Four types of outdoor recreation areas are described for Lathrop which will be capable of accommodating
the full range of active and passive recreation previously described -- the Neighborhood Park, the
Community Park and the Landscaped Open Space Corridor.
Mini Park:
Mini parks are designed to provide recreational and aesthetic benefit primarily in areas of high population
density or commercial areas with high pedestrian use, and will be designed to include the specific needs of a
concentrated or limited population such as interior neighborhoods or employment areas. The Central
Lathrop Specific Plan Land Use plan illustrates a mini park within the Main Street District adjacent to the
Public/Semi-Public/Neighborhood Commercial and Residential/Mixed Use areas. Other mini parks may be
provided within CLSP project as individual builders prepare more detailed neighborhood and development
plans. The location, design, and program of these parks must be approved by the Lathrop City Parks
Department.
Neighborhood Park:
In general, a "neighborhood" is the area served by an elementary school. A neighborhood park may be a
combination school and park site that provides space for indoor as well as outdoor recreation activities.
Regardless of location, the neighborhood park is planned primarily for children in the 5-13 year age group,
and for families, and typically includes an area for pre-school age children. When it adjoins an elementary
school, it readily serves both school and neighborhood recreation needs. Like the school, it is within
walking distance of the homes in the neighborhood, serving upwards of 1,000 residences and a population
of 2,500 - 3,500.
Neighborhood and Community parks are to be designed to accommodate multi-level storm drainage
detention basins that will allow recreation use of areas not needed for detention during a given storm.
                                                   5-17
Community Park:
In general, a "community" is the area served by one or more secondary schools (High Schools). In a large
city like Stockton, it is a group of neighborhoods forming a recognized district of the city. In a small city,
it encompasses the entire boundaries of the city (existing and planned). In a City like that planned for
Lathrop, the service area of the community park will be the area served by a single high school. The
community park provides indoor and outdoor areas and facilities to meet a much wider range of recreation
interests than the neighborhood park. Among the facilities included are fields and courts for various sports,
a large swimming pool capable of competitive and non-competitive swimming (at different times), a
community center building (which may be a school building) for arts and crafts, clubs and social activities,
all of the areas and facilities found in a neighborhood park (if not already provided for the affected
neighborhood), family picnic areas, quiet areas and areas of natural beauty.
Landscaped Open Space Corridor:
The Landscaped Open Space Corridor can take several forms, including the pedestrian parkway separate
from auto traffic, a combined vehicle and pedestrian parkway, a buffer zone between residential and
commercial or industrial areas, or as a lineal park or paseo connecting with other components of the park
and recreation system or located separate from other areas such as along reaches of the San Joaquin River
or other waterways. Such corridors do not now exist within Lathrop, but they hold promise for enhancing
the overall aesthetic and recreation character of the community.
Neighborhood Standards
At the neighborhood park level, an overall standard of 2.0 acres/1,000 population of developed
parkland is needed to meet the needs of the future population. This standard can be met by either
neighborhood parks or mini parks. This standard reflects the actual experience of the City and the School
District in the provision of neighborhood parks (including school sites) for the July, 1989 population of
about 6,500 when the City officially became incorporated. Applied to the anticipated future population of
30,000, an additional 83 acres of neighborhood parks will be required throughout the community. To the
extent that this acreage may be combined with drainage basins, or as part of other public sites, money
otherwise required for park acquisition could be used for park development, including overcoming some
current deficiencies in recreation opportunity.
Ideally, a neighborhood park should be created in conjunction with an elementary school site. This will be
possible for all residential areas developed west of Interstate 5. Where a school site may not be provided,
sites of 3.0 - 5.0 acres will be required either free-standing or in conjunction with drainage basin sites,
depending on location in the expanding urban area, and generally within 1/3 to 1/2 mile of every residence.
Within Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2, development of a 3.0 - 5.0 acre neighborhood park adjacent to or
separate from an elementary school may require the following approximate space and use allocations. A
Central Lathrop Parks Master Plan has been produced to direct the formation of neighborhood parks within
its area, which allows neighborhood parks to range between 2 and 12 acres. Sub-Plan Area #3 includes a
variety of types of neighborhood parks and open space which independently or in combination may act as a
neighborhood park resource. Within Sub-Plan Area #3, development of a 3.0-5.0-acre neighborhood park
adjacent to or separate from an elementary school may require some or all of the following approximate
space and use allocations:
                                                 5-18
         -       Play lot and mothers area:         .......               0.15 acres
         -       Paved area for court games:        . . . . . . . 0.25 "
         -       Instructional swimming pool:       . . . . . . . 0.25 "
         -       Lawn area for free play & field sports: 1.35 "
         -       Quiet area:                        .......               0.50 "
         -       Perimeter landscaping:             .......               0.50 "
                          Sub-total :               . . . . . . . 3.00 acres
         -       Family picnic and barbecue:        . . . . . . . 0.50 "
         -       Quiet area of lawn and trees:      .......              0.50 "
                          Sub-total:                . . . . . . . 4.00 acres
         -       Added area for court games:        . . . . . . . 0.25 "
         -       Added lawn area for field sports: . . . . . 0.75 "
                          Total:                    . . . . . .. 5.00 acres
Public restrooms would be provided on a limited basis, whether or not the park is adjacent to a school site.
The space required for the instructional swimming pool would be developed as lawn area until the pool is
provided. No off-street parking space would be needed if the park is bounded on at least two sides by
streets. Diagonal parking should be considered on the park side of the street. If desired, the provision of
security to school building area can be accomplished by locked fencing of building areas, leaving the
remaining acreage open (except for safety fencing along streets) and available to the neighborhood during
non-school hours.
Mini parks are less than 2 acres in size. Amenities may include children’s playgrounds, plazas, turf, picnic
areas and special features such as a stage or water element. They should be designed to avoid non-
developable remainders or odd shaped parcels.
Community-Wide Standards
At the community park level, an overall standard of 3.0 acres /1,000 population of developed parkland
is needed to meet the needs of the future population of the entire city. This standard reflects the experience
of the City and the Unified School District in 1989 in providing community level park and recreation areas
and facilities.
By applying a standard of 3.0/1,000 to the anticipated future population, an additional 71 acres of
community parkland will be required. The distribution, size and uses allocated to new community parks
should take into consideration the availability of community level recreation opportunities already provided
at the recreation center and park on 5th Street, and opportunities for use of City and other public property
along the San Joaquin River.
A community park would be developed in conjunction with two high school sites. However, because of the
large service area of the Unified School District and the lineal shape of the planned urban area, it will be
appropriate to also plan for community park locations at other locations connected by open space corridors.
Since community park functions serve the entire community, there is not the same need for repetition of
recreation opportunities among several community parks as would be typical of neighborhood park
development. Within Sub-Plan Areas #1 and #2, overall, the following use and space allocations may be
required at several locations. A Central Lathrop Parks Master Plan has been created to guide the design
and provision of community parks within its boundaries and is located in the Central Lathrop Specific Plan.
Sub-Plan Area #3 includes a variety of types of community parks. Within Sub-Plan Area #3, the following
use and space allocations may be required at several locations:
                                                 5-19

          -        Field sports:                     . . . . . . . 6.00 "
          -        Paved area for court games:       . . . . . . . 2.75 "
          -        Family and group picnic area:     . . . . . . . 2.25 "
          -        Concrete for performances:        . . . . . . . 0.30 "
          -        Lawn area for free play:          . . . . . . . 2.25 "
          -        Natural area:                     . . . . . . . 3.00 "
          -        Off-street parking:               . . . . . . . 1.25 "
          -        Center for teenagers:             . . . . . . . 2.00 "
          -        Perimeter landscaping:            . . . . . . 2.20   "
                           Total:                    .......              21.00 acres
Specialized facilities are often included within or adjacent to community, citywide and regional parks in
larger communities. Specialized facilities proposed include a stadium for organized competitive sports, a
center for the elderly, a public golf course, an auditorium-theater with a seating capacity of 350 -500,
multi-purpose facilities at all schools which can be used for classes in arts and crafts, and similar creative
activities. The lack of adequate space for organized team field sports, including baseball, softball and
soccer, takes its toll on the turf at school sites, and on the availability of those sites for neighborhood and
community recreation activities. Separate fields may be needed, especially for soccer.
Open Space Recreation Corridors
The system of communitywide landscaped open space corridors shown on the General Plan Diagram is
illustrative of linkages required among school and park sites, shopping areas, the civic center, the cultural
center and other important activity centers of the community. These corridors are intended to provide an
important alternative to automobile transportation as a means of internal circulation within the community,
including pedestrian and bicycle paths that generally are separated from the street system. Additional
corridors and recreation areas developed as part of residential villages would link villages with the larger
system. Communitywide corridors would be publicly owned and maintained. Corridors within villages
could be owned publicly, or they could be owned privately to be maintained by a homeowners' association
for general public use.
The proposal for an open space corridor along the San Joaquin River is intended as a local community-
wide facility, but with the potential for eventual linkage with a regional facility that would connect Lathrop
with other communities to the north. As such, it would benefit a much larger population than Lathrop and
would require County participation in planning, development and maintenance. This corridor becomes
practical only if of sufficient width and access to avoid its being isolated from general view. It should
therefore be combined with a street placed away from the base of the levee system, with residential
development along the east side of the street facing the corridor, or with the provision of pedestrian and
bicycle linkages through cul-de-sacs, stub streets or driveways, or between lots where lots back or side onto
the corridor. Where properties are already developed in residential use along the levee, the corridor and
street should swing around the residence. An alternative would be a continuous open space corridor and/or
trail system alongside other waterways, such as lakes or canals that are linked to the San Joaquin River
system.
Specific standards for open space corridors are more difficult to define because of the possible variations in
design and purpose. The standards below are considered to be the minimums for the purposes involved:
                                                   5-20
Pedestrian parkway or paseos: A landscaped corridor would be alongside a street and a paseo would be
separated from streets for the use of pedestrians. Bicycles are not allowed typically because of safety
conflicts with foot traffic; however both pedestrians and bicyclists are permitted on the multi-use trails
located within Central Lathrop due to the greater trail widths provided. Pedestrian parkways should be a
minimum of 20' when connecting with streets at a cross-block location (i.e., through a block). When
bordering the rear or sides of residential lots for distances of several hundred feet or more, they should be
25’ wide as a minimum to provide space for a walk with trees and lawn.
Vehicle/pedestrian parkway: A pedestrian parkway located alongside a public street for the purpose of
creating an aesthetically pleasing corridor for both drivers of vehicles, bikers and pedestrians. The
parkway should be a minimum of 25' in width to permit a walk placement within a corridor of lawn,
groundcover, shrubs and trees. The vehicle/pedestrian parkway can be used effectively where residential
development is designed to back-on to a street and where vehicle access to lots is waived through the
subdivision approval process.
Community-wide open space corridor: This corridor is illustrated on the General Plan Diagram as a
meandering swath of open space extending along the length of the San Joaquin River. The width of this
corridor would vary, depending on location and intended use. A series of recreational amenities, trails, and
linkages with neighborhoods and pedestrian/landscape corridors would result in a typical width in the range
of 60’-100’. These corridors may include areas for wildlife habitat, drainage and flood control basins,
wastewater detention basins and other low intensity public use and where irrigation of vegetation will occur
through the reuse of treated wastewater.
Landscaped buffer corridors: These corridors serve as buffer zones between types of land use (e.g.,
between residential & commercial, residential & industrial, and public and commercial/industrial) may be
multi-purpose by providing visual screening, noise attenuation, and recreation area. When located at the
periphery of industrial areas, the corridor often is landscaped for pedestrian use by walking and jogging
employees during various work breaks. When located at the periphery of a multi-family complex, the
corridor can become a lineal recreation corridor (depending on width). Widths typically would vary from
20' to 50'. An important proposal of the General Plan is to provide a landscaped buffer corridor along the
entire length of the Manthey Road corridor adjacent to the west side of Interstate 5 within the Mossdale
Village portion of SPA #2. As Manthey Road will be abandoned in the remaining area of SPA # 2, a
landscaped area comprised of planting and/or storm water detention basins, should be provided along the
western edge of Interstate 5. This buffer, while acting both to screen the view of freeway traffic and assist
in reducing the effects of traffic noise, should permit views into the commercial areas for marketing
purposes. Buffers generally also lend themselves to the incorporation of storm drainage detention basins as
proposed for Neighborhood and Community parks.
Standards
In determining the amount of land dedication, land development and/or fees required of a developer, it is the
intent of this section that the requirement shall not exceed a combined standard of 5.0 acres/1,000
population for neighborhood and community level recreation areas and facilities. The land, fees, or
combination thereof are to be used only for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating existing
neighborhood or community park and recreational facilities. Where housing density bonuses are proposed,
or where housing unit increases occur as the result of the Planned Development process, additional
requirements for the provision of open space corridors may be justified.
                                                 5-21

Fees, Costs and Timing of Park and Recreation Development
Since land dedication for parks will be required in a relatively few instances as urban growth and expansion
occurs over the life of the General Plan, fees to cover the equivalent of capital costs of land dedication and
development would be the most common form of developer contribution. The more specific basis for
determining actual costs to the developer and the procedure to be followed are to be provided by City
ordinance and resolution as approved by the City Council. Fees shall be based on the costs of land
acquisition and development that are current for the time when approval of a permit for residential land
development is being sought from the City. In order to keep costs current, the enabling ordinance shall be
amended annually, on or about July 1, by resolution of the City Council. Amended costs for site
development should be adjusted based on a current and authoritative index as may be determined by annual
resolution of the City Council prescribing the amount of fees required. Amended costs of land acquisition
shall be determined by the appraisal process provided by local ordinance.

                          HAZARD MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Hazard Management Element combines the Safety and Noise Elements into a single element. [Note:
the Safety Element is in itself a combination of the Seismic Safety and Safety Elements previously required
by State Law but which were combined in the law as a single element in 1985.]
                                            SECTION A - SAFETY
INTRODUCTION
Section 65302 (g) of the California Government Code describes the requirements of the Safety Element as
follows:
          (g) "A safety element for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the
effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope
instability leading to mudslides and landslides, subsidence and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body;
flooding; and wildland and urban fires. The safety element shall include mapping of known seismic and other geologic
hazards. It shall also address evacuation routes, peak load water supply requirements, and minimum road widths and
clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified fire and geologic hazards.
          To the extent that a county's safety element is sufficiently detailed and contains appropriate policies and
programs for adoption by a city, a city may adopt that portion of the county's safety element that pertains to the city's
planning area in satisfaction of the requirements of this subdivision.
          Each city shall submit to the Division of Mines and Geology of the Department of Conservation one copy of the
safety element and any technical studies used for development of the safety element.
In 1989, the City of Lathrop adopted the County's Seismic Safety and Safety Elements of the County
General Plan as they applied to the Lathrop planning area. This Hazard Management Element replaces the
previously adopted elements of the County General Plan in their entirety.
SEISMIC HAZARDS
Seismic hazards refer to earthquake-induced ground shaking, ground rupture, liquefaction or water
movement (tsunamis). The City of Lathrop is located within a seismic zone which could be impacted by
strong groundshaking from a moderate to large earthquake on active and potentially active faults to the east
and west of San Joaquin County. The faults that could be involved are the San Andreas, Hayward,
Calaveras and Green Valley-Concord faults to the west, the Midland fault zone to the north and the Bear
Mountain and Melones fault zones to the east. [See map in Part II.] The potential for faults within the
County to generate moderate to large earthquakes causing strong ground shaking is low. 1 Of the known
  1
                   Draft Environmental Impact Report on the San Joaquin County Comprehensive Planning Program,
          Baseline Environmental Consulting, June, 1990,
                                                            6-1
fault lines in San Joaquin County, none are currently classified by the State Geologist as being active. The
most prominent fault within the County is the Tracy-Stockton Fault which passes the Lathrop area in a
northeasterly direction extending along a meandering line from North Tracy to South Stockton.
Localized ground shaking and liquefaction pose the most significant seismic hazards in the County and in
the Lathrop area. Because of the unreinforced levees which surround the Stewart Tract, the high water
table and loose soils of the Tract and of lands immediately east of the San Joaquin River, the potential for
levee breaks due to ground shaking and loss of foundation bearing due to liquefaction must be considered
as serious impediments to development without extensive mitigation before the fact of development. 2
Strong ground shaking also poses a serious threat to any unreinforced masonry structures built before 1933
that remain in the old part of town. Earthquake-generated ground shaking can cause non-structural hazards
as well, such as falling ceilings and parapets, broken light fixtures, shattered glass and dislodging of
furniture and equipment.
The Lathrop area could be impacted by a quake along the San Andreas Fault of a magnitude 8.0-8.5. This
requires the application of Zone II provisions for construction under requirements of the Uniform Building
Code (UBC) for "normal facilities" and Zone 2 x 2 provisions for construction under requirements of the
UBC for "critical facilities". Since new construction can be designed to withstand probable seismic
shaking without collapse, the greatest existing danger for the Lathrop Planning Area is in the potential for
liquefaction and levee failure in Sub-Plan Area #3, and the continued use of older structures, and especially
those of unreinforced brick or other masonry construction within Sub-Plan Area #1.
SEISMIC GOALS AND POLICIES
Goals for achieving and maintaining safety from seismic events include preventing serious injury, loss of
life, serious damage to critical facilities involving large assemblies of people, and loss of continuity in
providing essential public services. The achievement of these goals is to occur through implementation of
the following policies: Once the appropriate fire fighting equipment is procured for buildings higher than
50’, maximum permitted building heights shall be that noted in the Central Lathrop Specific Plan and
Design Guidelines.
1.        Inventory all buildings which are unsound under conditions of "moderate" seismic activity;
          buildings having questionable structural resistance should be considered for either rehabilitation or
          demolition. Structures determined by the City's Building Official to be structurally unsound are to
          be reported to the owner and recorded with the County Recorder to insure that future owners are
          made aware of hazardous conditions and risks.
2.        All new building construction shall conform to the latest seismic requirements of the Uniform
          Building Code as a minimum standard.
3.        The present building height limit of 50 feet shall be maintained, with a maximum of four stories.
          This policy should stay in force until such time that high rise construction is desired and capability
          for evacuation and fire fighting in upper stories is possible through the availability of appropriate
  2
          Liquefaction occurs when a water-saturated and loosely bound soil loses its strength and liquefies during prolonged
          and intense ground shaking, such as occurred in San Francisco's Marina District during the Loma Prieta earthquake of
          October, 1989.
                                                             6-2

    equipment. For Sub-Plan Area #3, at that time the maximum building height limit shall be 125 feet,
    with a maximum of ten stories.
4.  Facilities necessary for emergency service should be capable of withstanding a maximum credible
    earthquake and remain operational to provide emergency response.
5.  Preliminary soil compaction tests and geotechnical analysis of soil conditions shall be submitted
    as part of the justification for development proposals contained in any Specific Plan.
6.  Soil compaction tests, and geotechnical analysis of soil conditions and behavior under seismic
    conditions shall be required of all subdivisions and of all commercial, industrial and institutional
    structures over 6,000 square feet in area (or in the case of institutional structures, those which hold
    100 or more people).
7.  A preliminary soils report is to be prepared by a registered geo-technical engineer for any
    residential development project, based upon adequate test borings. If the report indicates the
    presence of critically expansive soils or other soil problems which, if not corrected, would lead to
    structural defects, the developer shall provide for and submit the findings of a soil investigation of
    each non-residential lot or housing site proposed. The soil investigation shall be prepared by a
    state-registered civil engineer and shall recommend corrective action likely to prevent structural
    damage to each dwelling to be constructed. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, any
    recommended action approved by the Building Official shall be incorporated into the construction
    of each dwelling.
8.  A preliminary geologic report, prepared by a state-certified engineering geologist and based on
    adequate test borings, shall be submitted to the Building Official for every subdivision, planned
    development or other residential project at the time of submitting a tentative map or other type
    of development application to the City.
9.  If the preliminary geologic report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soil
    problems (e.g., potential for liquefaction which if not corrected could lead to structural defects, the
    developer shall provide such additional soils investigation for each development site as may be
    requested by the Building Official. The geologic investigation shall be prepared by a state-certified
    engineering geologist and shall, recommend further corrective action likely to prevent structural
    damage to dwelling units. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, any recommended action
    approved by the Building Official shall be incorporated into site preparation and the construction
    of each dwelling.
10. The provisions of policy nos. 6 - 9, above, shall be applicable to all commercial, industrial,
    institutional and public development projects.
11. The City should adopt an Earthquake Disaster Plan in coordination with San Joaquin County and
    local special districts. The Plan should identify hazards that may occur as the result of an
    earthquake of major magnitude. The Plan should be sufficiently broad in scope to include the
    designation of evacuation routes and means to coordinate all local government agencies in assisting
    local residents in the event of a major earthquake, large-scale fire or explosion, or hazardous
    chemical spill or release of hazardous air-borne gas.
                                                  6-3
12.      All lines which are part of the domestic water distribution system should be looped to assure
         adequate pressure in the event of major fire, earthquake, or explosion. Emergency standby power
         generation capability should be available at all water wells to assure water availability in the event
         of a major power failure.
HAZARDS TO PUBLIC SAFETY
Only hazards posed by man-made structural or chemical (urban) fires and from criminal activity are
covered by the Safety Section of the Hazard Management Element. Hazards from flooding along with
policies proposed for flood plain management have been addressed in Part IV-D under the topic "Surface
Water Drainage and Flood Control".
SAFETY GOALS AND POLICIES
Goals and policies concerning public safety cover fire safety, law enforcement and large-scale conditions of
emergency. Fires and crimes are largely caused by and are avoidable through human action. The degree to
which they represent threats depends in part upon the organization of the community and the facilities and
services available. While planning and prevention are probably the best protection against fire hazards,
fires are not entirely preventable. Once a fire ignites, fire suppression activities take center stage, requiring
rapid response by one or more engine companies, an adequate supply of water (or chemical suppressants)
and good access to the source of flames.
Criminal activity occurs when an opportunity is presented, such as an unlocked car or house. As in the
case of fire protection, the ability of the police force to protect citizens requires emphasis on crime
prevention as well as crime suppression. Once a crime has been committed and its occurrence is known,
the ability of police to respond and apprehend becomes paramount.
Large-scale emergencies that can have an impact on the entire community requiring evacuation include
hazardous waste spills, explosions, urban conflagration, and flooding from dam or levee breaks.
Goals
Goals of the Safety Element seek to accomplish the following:
1.       The reduction of loss of life or property due to crime, fire, earthquake, flooding or other
         disasters or hazards.
2.       The provision of adequate medical and emergency services to reduce the effects of natural or man-
         made disasters.
3.       The promotion of citizen awareness and preparedness for emergency/disaster situations or potential
         for the incidence of crime.
4.       The implementation of adequate inter-agency disaster planning, including evacuation of all or parts
         of the community to safe areas of the County.
Policies
The above goals are to be achieved through the implementation of the following policies:
                                                      6-4
1.       The City will continue to give high priority to the support of police protection, and to fire
         suppression and prevention and life safety functions of the Fire Department. Ultimate expansion
         of the City's fire service is to include additional stations affording adequate response within a
         maximum of 3-4 minutes to all parts of the urban area.
2.       The City will work to maintain a fire flow standard of 3,000 gpm for all commercial and industrial
         areas, and 1,500 gpm for residential areas, to assure capability to suppress urban fires.
3.       The City will maintain a street system which is capable of providing access to any fires that may
         develop within the urban area, and which is capable of providing for the adequate evacuation of
         residents in the event of an emergency condition of magnitude.
4.       The City will continue to maintain and update emergency service plans, including plans for
         managing emergency operations, the handling of hazardous materials and the rapid cleanup of
         hazardous materials spills.
5.       The City will continue to cooperate with the County of San Joaquin and other agencies in pre-
         disaster planning activities such as evacuation required in the event of a serious breach of an
         upstream dam capable of flooding the community.
6.       The City will seek to reduce the risks and potential for hazards to the public through planning and
         zoning practices and regulations which avoid hazardous land use relationships, and by the
         continued and timely adoption of new-edition building and fire codes.
7.       Neighborhood watch programs will be encouraged in all residential areas of the City.
Emergency Conditions
Capability for Evacuation:
From the above policies, it is clear that further work is required in the development of inter-agency
responses to emergencies that may require large-scale evacuation of the local population. In the event of
such emergency, Lathrop can depend on its freeway and arterial street systems which afford a number of
options for evacuation. The freeway system provides a means for evacuation from floods because of the
higher elevation of Interstate 5 and State Route 120 through the community as compared to the local street
system. The City is presently served well by a series of east-west arterial streets and several north-south
collectors (in Lathrop and Manteca to the east) that allow local traffic to by-pass areas that may be closed-
off due to emergency conditions. These arterials and collectors also provide access to the freeway system
at six interchange locations, including Roth Road, Lathrop Road, Louise Avenue, Yosemite Avenue,
Stewart Road (on the Stewart Tract) and at Airport Way (in west Manteca).
Peak Load Water Supply, Road Widths and Structural Clearance:
Peak load water supply requirements are indicated under Policy #2, above. As they exist and are planned,
all road widths will be capable of collectively managing traffic under conditions where large-scale
evacuation of the local population may be required. The area of greatest potential vulnerability exists in
the event of a major earthquake which could seriously damage and therefore impair traffic flow along the
freeway system.
                                                      6-5
Requirements of the City's Uniform Building Code and Zoning Ordinance assure adequate clearance
between and around structures. Even in the oldest sections of the community, clearance around buildings
poses few if any problems in the event of emergency.
                                                   6-6
SECTION B - NOISE
INTRODUCTION
The City of Lathrop has previously adopted the Noise Element of the San Joaquin County General Plan.
By this current General Plan document, the City's previous Noise Element continues in force and effect as
if wholly contained herein. The statements of goals and policies which follow supplement those of the
adopted Noise Element.
GOALS AND POLICIES FOR NOISE ABATEMENT AND CONTROL
Goals
The Goals of the Noise Element of the General Plan are to protect citizens from the harmful effects of
exposure to excessive noise, and to protect the economic base of the City by preventing the encroachment
of incompatible land uses near noise-producing roadways, industries, the railroad, and other sources. As a
point of reference, Figure VI-1 illustrates the different degrees of sensitivity of various land uses to their
noise environment, and the range of noise levels considered to be appropriate for the full range of land use
activities involved. For example, exterior noise levels in the range of 50-60 dB CNEL (Community Noise
Exposure Level) are generally considered to be acceptable for residential land uses, allowing normal indoor
and outdoor residential activities to occur without interruption. In contrast, industrial activities relatively
insensitive to noise may be located in a noise environment up to 75 dB CNEL without adverse affects.
Examples of noise levels common to various outdoor environments are shown in Figure VI-2.
Policies
The following policies reflect the commitment of the City to the noise-related goals outlined above:
1.       Areas within the City shall be designated as noise-impacted if exposed to existing or projected
         future noise levels exterior to buildings exceeding 60 dB CNEL or the performance standards pre
         scribed in Table VI-1.
2.       New development of residential or other noise sensitive land uses will not be permitted in noise-
         impacted areas unless effective mitigation measures are incorporated into project designs to reduce
         noise to the following levels:

*Each of the noise level standards specified in Table VI-1 shall be reduced by five (5) dB for pure tone noises, noise consisting primarily
           of speech or music, or for recurring impulsive noises. The standards should be applied at a residential or other noise-sensitive
           land use and not on the property of a noise-generating land use. Nighttime and Daytime standards are measured by dB.
                                                                       6-10
         a. Noise sources preempted from local control, such as railroad and highway traffic:
                       - 60 dB CNEL or less in outdoor activity areas;
                       - 45 dB CNEL within interior living spaces or other noise-sensitive interior spaces.
                       - Where it is not possible to achieve reductions of exterior noise to 60 dB CNEL
                          or less by using the best available and practical noise reduction technology, an
                          exterior noise level of up to 65 dB CNEL will be allowed.
                       - Under no circumstances will interior noise levels be allowed to exceed 45 dB
                           CNEL with windows and doors closed.
         b. For noise from other sources, such as local industries:
                       - 60 dB CNEL or less in outdoor activity areas;
                       - 45 dB CNEL or less within interior living spaces, plus the performance standards
                          contained in Table VI-1.
3.       New development of industrial, commercial or other noise generating land uses will not be
         permitted if resulting noise levels will exceed 60 dB CNEL in areas containing residential or other
         noise-sensitive land uses. Additionally, new noise generating land uses which are not preempted
         from local noise regulation by the State of California will not be permitted if resulting noise levels
         will exceed the performance standards contained in Table VI-1 in areas containing residential or
         other noise-sensitive land uses.
4.       Noise level criteria applied to land uses other than residential or other noise-sensitive uses shall
         be consistent with the recommendations of the California Office of Noise Control.
5.       New equipment and vehicles purchased by the City shall comply with noise level performance
         standards consistent with the best available noise reduction technology.
THE EXISTING AND FUTURE NOISE ENVIRONMENT
The major noise generators in Lathrop as described in Part II are the Interstate 5 and State Route 120
freeways, the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads, arterial streets, the airport at Sharpe Depot
and some industries. Facilities which are particularly sensitive to noise include schools and parks and
convalescent and general hospitals. These facilities are sufficiently removed from major sources of noise
so as not to be adversely affected.
Noise generators which can be expected to have impacts on residential development are Southern Pacific
Railroad operations, Sharpe Depot helicopter operations, Stockton Airport operations and I-5 freeway
traffic. All of these sources will affect residential development in the area between Lathrop Road and
Squires Road, East of I-5. Railroad operations can be expected to generate a 24 hour day/night average
exterior noise level of 72 dB at a distance of 50 feet west of the railroad right-of-way centerline. For a
single event, train noise levels at night can be expected to be in the range of 90-100 dB, with a maximum
A-weighted noise level of 90 dB. A single event helicopter flight could generate a noise level of 89 dB.
Noise contours distances expected for these sources are shown in Table VI-2 and on Figure VI-2.
Because of heavy flyover traffic, the Stockton Airport's "Area of Influence" is proposed for extension south
to Lathrop Road. This will constitute a new source of single event noise for Lathrop.

Noise contours from the sources listed in Table VI-2, and from State Route 120 and industries, are not
expected to have an adverse effect on existing and planned land use elsewhere within the planning area
because existing and planned land use at other locations along the railroads and freeways will be
commercial, industrial or open space. [Also see projected noise contours, Figures III-9 (in EIR) and VI-2]
Noise contours from Interstate 5 and the S.P. Railroad sources listed in Table VI-2 can be expected to vary
considerably in distance from their source into areas of commercial development on the Stewart Tract and
in SPA #2, depending on the size and configuration of commercial buildings that are closest to these
sources, and the width and extent of screen planting provided within landscape corridors developed along
the freeway (and railroad). As to building placement, the City will require that commercial buildings be
placed in such relation to each other and to noise sources that they will effectively block or redirect noise
levels away from residential and other non-commercial uses.
NOISE ATTENUATION
1.       Since residential land uses are prohibited within the 65 dB Ldn noise contour under State standards,
         it may be necessary to provide sound barriers along the west side of the S.P. Railroad and the east
         side of I-5 in order to meet the standard for exterior noise levels. Along the freeway, a landscaped
         buffer strip is also proposed for both visual screening and to further aid sound attenuation. Along
         the east side of Harlan Road, a landscaped corridor may also be required to further reduce the
         impacts of future freeway noise to meet State standards.
2.       Apply State Noise Insulation Standards where applicable to new single-family detached and
         attached housing units, hospitals, convalescent hospitals, and rest homes.

3.      Assure that commercial/industrial uses are constructed to maintain appropriate interior noise levels
        for customers and the work force.
4.      Require the placement of commercial and industrial buildings along Interstate 5 and the S.P.
        Railroad so as to block or otherwise direct noise levels away from residential areas.
5.      Develop and apply uniform standards of structural design and aesthetic quality to sound walls
        required along freeway sections, arterial streets and railroads, and as buffers between industrial
        and non-industrial uses of land. Sound walls along freeway and street rights-of-way shall include
        permanent landscaping of trees, shrubs and groundcover, and automatic irrigation, that is in scale
        with wall height and the lineal character of the corridor in which the wall is to be placed. Where
        appropriate, sound wall corridors shall be integrated with buffer, pedestrian and bicycle corridors
        as described under "Open Space for Outdoor Recreation" in Part V - Resource Management
        Element.
6.      Require the granting of navigation easements as a condition of all new development that will occur
        within the extended boundaries of the Stockton Airport Area of Influence. The easement shall be
        granted on behalf of the airport and shall implement procedures concerning notice and disclosure of
        airport impacts, including overflights and noise.
ENFORCEMENT
Noise Element Guidelines prepared by the Office of Noise Control of the State Department of Public
Health urge communities to adopt a community noise ordinance in order to carry out policies of the Noise
Element, and to assure compliance with State requirements for certain other noise control programs. The
City shall consider the adoption of such an ordinance.

      DIRECTIONS FOR GENERAL PLAN INTERPRETATION
                                 AND IMPLEMENTATION
INTRODUCTION
Part VII covers the principal means available and/or required to implement the Lathrop General Plan. It
begins with a discussion of how to interpret the Plan. Subsequent topics include the Specific Plan,
achieving zoning consistency with the General Plan, growth management, adopting a Comprehensive
Annexation Plan, updating the development fee structure, the Financial Plan, redevelopment, monitoring
progress in Plan implementation, implementation strategy and the Annual Report.
INTERPRETING THE GENERAL PLAN
Plan Diagram + Text + EIR = General Plan Document
The entire text of this document (including the EIR) and the General Plan Diagram which accompanies it
constitutes the Lathrop General Plan. While the Plan Diagram may typically be referred to more frequently
than the text, full understanding of applicable policies and proposals illustrated on the Plan Diagram
requires reference to the text. Such reference is essential to those of the private sector who are or will be
engaged in urban development, and those of the public sector responsible for carrying out various policies
and proposals of the Plan. In addition to City departmental and management staff, and the City Planning
Commission, City Council and Redevelopment Agency, the latter group includes the Manteca Unified
School District, Tracy High School District, Banta Elementary School District and agencies of County
Government and the State, such as LAFCO, the Council of Governments, County Community
Development, County Public Works and Caltrans.
Plan Flexibility
The word "general" is a key to understanding the nature of policies and proposals. It implies overall
agreement on major issues without a straight jacket of inflexibility; it implies variation and encourages
innovation while working toward the achievement of common goals; and it implies the need for adjustment
of policies and proposals as changing conditions may dictate. While not inflexible, neither is the Plan to be
viewed as being so flexible as to accommodate whatever position or policy may be sought through
interpretation.
A properly administered General Plan demands that the rule of "reasonableness" be applied to permit
flexibility, variation and adjustment as long as the integrity of basic policies and proposals is maintained.
However, any changes that are desired must result from careful study (as required by the State Planning
Law). Such study must be made independent of pending applications for controversial development
proposals, temporary fiscal problems and other "matters of the moment". The policies and proposals of the
Plan are not intended to be changed or twisted to accommodate special interests, whether public or private.
                                                     7-1
Plan Integrity
The integrity of the Plan must be maintained if it is to be an effective instrument of public policy among
units of government, private enterprise and the public-at-large. Moreover, if Plan policies and proposals
are ignored during the zoning process, or if they are changed without following the due process and
guidelines established by the State, the entire local planning process becomes subject to legal sanction.
This can include action by the Court, the Attorney General's Office and the State Office of Planning and
Research prohibiting the subdivision of land, approval of zoning permits and issuance of building permits
until corrective action is taken. This type of sanction has been taken against the planning programs of
several counties and cities in recent years.
Written Interpretation
The wide range and complexity of subject matter covered by the General Plan is certain to generate
questions of interpretation. As questions arise, the City's Planning Department should prepare written
interpretations for review with and concurrence by the City Council and other affected public bodies.
These written interpretations will become a body of official opinion and a public record for consistent
application of policies and proposals of the Plan, and for discussion during annual review and possible
amendments to the Plan.
USE OF THE SPECIFIC PLAN
In Part II of this document, the Specific Plan is described as a primary tool of general plan implementation,
with several Specific Plans required to cover the special needs of the established community, the new Sub-
Plan Area #2 west of Interstate 5 to the San Joaquin River, and the new Stewart Tract Sub-Plan Area #3.
Part II also lists the three basic functions of the Specific Plan, including interpretation of the General Plan,
illustration of General Plan policies and proposals, and the regulation of land use that can occur separate
and apart from that otherwise required under the zoning ordinance.
Authority and Application
Article 8, Chapter 3, Division 1, Title 7 of the Planning and Zoning Law provides the authority and
requirements for the preparation of specific plans [see Appendix "A" for the full text of the law.] Of
special note is the provision that exempts residential projects that are made the subject of an EIR for a
specific plan from any further environmental assessment unless conditions change to the point where the
EIR prepared for the specific plan is no longer adequate.
If desired for the established part of town, one or more specific plans can be developed to guide the
improvement of older areas. As an example, a specific plan can be prepared for all of Lathrop Acres,
providing urban design and policy guidance for carrying out a Redevelopment Project Plan as well as the
General Plan. For lands in SPA #2 extending west to the San Joaquin River, several specific plans
probably will be required involving different groups of property owners and/or developers. Since initial
development must be of sufficient magnitude to assure the financial feasibility to construct the first stage of
a wastewater management system, the initial specific plan for residential development may require several
hundred acres.
                                                       7-2
For Sub-Plan Area #3, a single specific plan would set forth the detailed plans and programs that will be
followed by a single group in developing the entire area proposed for urbanization during the next 20 years.
It may include a companion document, an Urban Design Concept, in which design guidelines for the public
realm and development standards for Stewart Tract land uses are provided. Of importance to all kinds of
areas requiring a specific plan, all specific plans must be made consistent with the General Plan and with
each other to the extent that they involve proposals for land use, circulation, open space or infrastructure
that must have continuity among lands covered by different plans.
The Mechanics of Landowner Cooperation
Simply stated, the mechanics for achieving successful specific plan preparation and adoption by the City
Council will be well organized cooperation among affected landowners to get the job done. With the
exception of large-scale projects under one or a related ownership, the essential principle is that landowners
must cooperate with each other in order to participate and succeed in the process of town building. This
principle is embodied in the General Plan as policy if Lathrop is to merge as a "new town" worthy of the
phrase and of the unique opportunity that exists to make it happen.
Shared Responsibility for Plan Preparation
The responsibility for Specific Plan adoption rests with the City. However, responsibility for Specific Plan
preparation may vary depending on the circumstances. For a large project under a single or related
ownership, involving significant acreage and/or a major component of proposed land use, the Specific Plan
would normally be prepared by the developer(s) in interest. For Sub-Plan Area #3, the Specific Plan would
be prepared in preliminary or "draft" form for the entire area designated for potential development by the
General Plan. Close coordination is required between the developer's planning and design team and the
City's planning, engineering, public works and management staff during the plan-making process so that
City officials can give constructive critique to the Plan's development rather than merely reacting after the
fact of receiving the draft Specific Plan. This process of shared responsibility is important to the developer
as well to the City, and is basically a reversal of roles from those involved in preparing the General Plan.
Since the City must reserve responsibility for final interpretation of a Specific Plan's consistency with the
General Plan, common sense dictates this shared approach to Plan development.
The more common example will occur in Sub-Plan Area #2, where there will be the need for several
owners to sponsor one or more Plans, or one owner to sponsor it and the others to participate along with
City staff in the process of review and critique as Plan proposals emerge. However, a third approach may
be required where the City engages more directly in the Plan-making function, working with multiple
owners to bring about a successful development proposal. This third approach would be useful where a
developer is not "in hand", but where the owners want to better understand the development opportunities
available. A request for revisions to a Plan prepared in this fashion can be expected once a developer
becomes directly involved.
Format and Content of a Specific Plan
While the law cited in Appendix "A" describes legislative intent and authority, wide latitude is given as long
as certain mandatory requirements of the law are met. For lands west of Interstate 5, the immediate task
will be to blend planning and design decisions for large sections of acreage into an integrated whole that
                                                      7-3
will give desired shape and dimension to the urban form that is called for in concept by the General Plan.
As guidance, the specific plan should include at least the following components:
1.       A summary of the goals, policies and proposals of the General Plan that are applicable       to the
         land area covered by the Specific Plan. This will serve to remind the user and       decision-makers
         of the principal thrust of the General Plan for which consistency is         required.
2.       A section which interprets the applicability of each element of the General Plan, the degree of
         flexibility which is permitted, development standards to be applied and guidance to the phasing and
         coordination of development activity required internally, and externally with adjacent properties.
3.       A section which illustrates the ways in which private and public improvements are to be designed.
         The liberal use of photographs, sketches and diagrams will be useful and necessary.
4.       Development regulations to be used in place of, or partial substitute for, regulations otherwise
         provided in the zoning ordinance. An applicant literally can write a new set of regulations to carry
         out design proposals that will apply only to lands covered by the Specific Plan involved. Such
         regulations can provide a process where decision-making rests with the developer for some types of
         regulation (e.g., architectural review), where it is shared with the City for others (e.g., site plan
         review) or where it rests solely with the City (e.g., procedural, due-process requirements).
5.       Coordination required with other adopted specific plans or plans in preparation, including the
         provision and extension of public and private improvements.
6.       Proposals for timing, phasing and financing of development.
7.       An environmental impact report provided either separately or as part of the Specific Plan document
         that describes all of the plan proposals which are built-in to the Plan as means to avoid the
         potential for adverse impacts on the environment, and which describes further impacts, and
         mitigation to be required by the City as development occurs under the Specific Plan.
ACHIEVING ZONING CONSISTENCY WITH THE GENERAL PLAN
State Law requires that the City's zoning ordinance and zone plan be consistent with policies and proposals
of the General Plan. As part of the City's current General Plan Program, a new zoning ordinance has been
prepared which meets this test of consistency. The ordinance provides a series of regulations and
procedures that will permit the progressive implementation of land use policies of the General Plan with
sensitivity to the needs of the established community east of Interstate 5 as compared to the specialized
needs of lands west of I-5.
The consistency doctrine holds that the regulation of land use through zoning must be based on and be
consistent with the local jurisdiction's land use planning policy. California assumed early leadership in
defining this doctrine. In 1965, the Court of Appeal decided in a landmark case that the general plan serves
as the "constitution" for all future development.1 Since then, a variety of legislative acts and court actions
 1
         See O'Loane v. O'Rourke(1965) 231 Cal.App.2nd774,782.
                                                        7-4
have combined to further this decision to where lack of consistency of actions under zoning and subdivision
ordinances with policies and proposals of a General Plan renders an action invalid.
Where land is zoned for a purpose that is inconsistent with the general plan, or where a zone change or
other permit is sought for a use that is not consistent with the general plan, an application for such
entitlement should not be accepted for processing since the requirement for denial becomes mandatory.
Examples of provisions of state law and legal precedents that require consistency with the general plan
include:
              -   Agricultural preserves established under the Williamson Act.
              -   Capital improvements programs; acquisitions and dispositions of public property.
              -   Development agreements.
              -   Projects undertaken by local housing authorities.
              -   Waste management sites
GROWTH MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
As used here, the phrase "growth management" refers to the policies and procedures to be followed in
managing the rate and extent of urbanization on an annual basis. As practical matter, there are a variety of
factors over which the City has little if any control or influence that can affect the annual growth rate.
Chief among them are recessionary forces affecting the State and Nation, and competitive forces affecting
the rate of growth among all communities of the region. Assuming that these forces are mostly positive and
stable over the course of the next two decades, then the goals and policies of the General Plan that give
direction to the growth management function are:
1.       The General Plan emphasizes the development of job-creating and tax revenue creating activities
         during the early phases of development as a matter of primary importance to achieving other goals
         of the Plan. Despite pressures and demands that are certain to emerge in order to build housing
         units at a rapid pace, a clear policy of the General plan is to limit the pace and quantity of housing
         construction to annual allocations in reasonable balance with the growth of Lathrop's economic
         base.
2.       Vigorous promotion of commercial and industrial development is possible before new sub-regional
         water and sewerage system facilities are available for the development of lands west of I-5.
3.       Assuming an aggressive economic development program for Lathrop, the City could develop an
         average of 500 housing units per year for 20 years.
4.       The City's ability to stay abreast of its financial and service capabilities will require annual
         monitoring. Once a monitoring system is in place, it will be relatively easy to identify current
         conditions and to estimate the probable impacts of new development proposals.
5.       Rather than adhering to an arbitrarily fixed percentage of annual growth as a matter of policy, it
         will be the City's responsibility to manage the growth rate in relation to physical and financial
         capability of municipal service.
                                                       7-5
6.       Specific Plans are required as a condition of development within SPA's #2 and #3. Such plans are
         to specify the probable rate and extent of development proposed, and how proposals for residential
         development relate to or are affected by Items 1 - 5, above. Specific Plans shall contain
         information regarding phasing, implementation strategies and means of financing improvements.
7.       Specific Plans must also carry out all of the related policies and proposals of the General Plan as
         they may affect the properties involved, as set forth in the elements of the General Plan and as may
         be required as means to further mitigate potential adverse significant effects on the environment.
8.       Developers of land will be required to meet all of the costs of public infrastructure that are
         reasonably related to and which are generated by their projects.
All of these policies are interrelated. In the next two years, the City should have its monitoring system in
place with the capability for updating the data base on population, housing, economic activity and
municipal finance, and for determining the probable fiscal and service impacts of alternative proposals for
development under the Specific Plan process. The results of such monitoring and impact analysis will
provide the City with relevant information for determining annual allocations of housing. A computer-
assisted monitoring program is required that will allow City personnel to be trained in its use and
management.
THE FINANCIAL PLAN
The City provides services to the people, and regulates certain activities for the common good. Therefore,
the most important decisions the City will make will be those that determine which services will be
provided and which level or standard of service will prevail. The framework for the systematic provision of
needed public services is the Financial Plan.
Components of the Financial Plan
The Financial Plan has three major components: 1) the capital improvements program; 2) the public
services program; and 3) the revenue program. Each of these components is integrated with the others to
provide a balanced view of requirements to overcome deficiencies and to meet emerging needs.
The capital improvements program provides a priority list of public improvements which will be needed
over a five year period. From this list, projects are selected and recommended to the City Council for
inclusion in the annual budget. Each year, the program is extended an additional year to maintain the five-
year perspective. Financial data, including capital project costs, revenue estimates and projected annual
costs of operation and maintenance become a vital part of the program.
The public service program provides a balanced view of the operating and capital expenditures required
for continuation and expansion of City services. It permits selection of the levels of service to be provided
under various departmental programs, indicating the impact which a given level will have on long-term
commitments to capital improvements and to costs of operation and maintenance.
The revenue program deals with the acquisition and allocation of funds necessary to carry out the capital
improvements and public services programs.

Value of the Financial Plan
From the vantage point of the citizen, the Financial Plan provides an understanding of the fiscal
requirements for meeting the needs for and maintaining public services and capital improvements. Utilized
to its full potential, the Plan will permit gradual achievement of community goals while avoiding an
atmosphere of crisis which can arise when revenues and spending are projected only on an annual basis.
From the vantage point of the City Council and City Manager, the Financial Plan becomes an essential
device for policy decision and the effective and efficient management of City affairs. It provides a
consistent means to examine needs, to evaluate their relative importance in relation to policies of the
General Plan, and to determine which needs can be met within the limitations of financial resources and the
ability and willingness of the community to pay for them.
Scheduling the Process
The process involved in preparing the Financial Plan is the same, basically, as that followed in developing
the annual budget. The steps required are:
         1.       Conception and initiation of capital projects.
         2.       Submission of capital improvement request forms to departments.
         3.       Analysis of revenue and expenditure patterns by the City Manager.
         4.       Review of departmental requests by City Manager.
         5.       City Manager makes recommendations to City Council.
         6.       City Council public hearings, review and adoption.
         7.       Construction plans, advertising and contract awards.
         8.       Coordination of projects among agencies (including intergovernmental and city/utility
                  company coordination).
         9.       Amendments to Financial Plan, including mid-year amendments as needed.
         10.      Begin the process again for the succeeding year.
REDEVELOPMENT AND REVITALIZATION
While use of the California Community Redevelopment Law procedures is new to Lathrop, selective
redevelopment and revitalization has been made a major policy of the General Plan as described at the end
of Part II. The approach made possible by California Statutes is that lands can be acquired and developed
for private purposes if a favorable private investment is possible and is assured by contract with the City's
Redevelopment Agency. The law also requires that needs of affected landowners be met fairly either
through opportunity to participate in the new development, or to sell at fair market value and be relocated
without incurring personal (or business) expense.
The procedure to be followed is highly technical and complex, but the results can be extremely rewarding.
An important goal of the General Plan is to assure that residents and landowners of the established
community have the opportunity to benefit from the City's efforts in managing the expansion of Lathrop as
a new town. These benefits can range from providing necessary improvements where they are lacking to
eliminating other forms of physical blight that prevent properties from realizing their economic potential.
The City's first redevelopment project area may cover much of the developed lands and intervening vacant
lands that lay within the existing City Limits. The first step in the process is to create a Redevelopment
                                                       7-7
Agency (the City Council) and have a Redevelopment Plan prepared which specifies the powers and
authority of the Agency, identifies the range of public improvements to be realized over time, the costs of
those improvements, and the extent and manner in which these improvements may be financed over the
years ahead utilizing the special financing tools that are available to a Redevelopment Agency by law that
are not otherwise available to a City Council.
The principal financing tool available under this law is "tax increment" or "tax allocation" financing.
Through this approach, a Redevelopment Agency may borrow money or sell debt instruments to finance
improvements in a project area. Repayment of these debts is made by capturing the incremental increase in
the tax base that occurs as the result of new development that takes place after adoption of the
Redevelopment Plan. The increment is the increase in taxes received between the time that a redevelopment
project is conceived and the time when the project is completed. The increase in taxes received is based on
the difference in assessed value that results from a project. The amount of original tax received by all local
agencies before a project is started continues to flow to those agencies. But the incremental increase in
taxes flows to the Redevelopment Agency for repayment of debts incurred in carrying out a project. Under
this approach, the feasibility is more easily established for attracting private investment to finance and
construct all of the private improvements associated with a project.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY AND ANNUAL REPORT
Amendments to the State Planning and Zoning Law (effective January 1, l985), require a systematic
approach to General Plan implementation. Section 65400 of the Government Code requires the
Planning Commission to investigate and recommend to the City Council "...reasonable and practical
means for implementing the General Plan or element of the General Plan, so that it will serve as an
effective guide for orderly growth and development, preservation and conservation of open space
land and natural resources, and the efficient expenditure of public funds relating to the subjects
addressed in the General Plan." The law further requires that the City Council receive an annual report
on the status of the General Plan and progress toward its implementation.
This requirement seeks to avoid the often fragmented and incomplete attention to Plan implementation that
has characterized the actions of too many cities and counties. The most common practices have been to
respond to requests for Plan amendments and zoning applications, to prepare a capital improvement
program, and to undertake special projects as desired.
What is needed in Lathrop to respond to these requirements is to classify and assign priorities to policies
and proposals of each Element of the General Plan. The classifications should define required kinds of
actions (plan, program, capital project or regulation), who is responsible (public agency, private
organization or individual), and the short, medium and long-range time frame involved. The decision on
priorities rests with the City Council. However, discussions should be undertaken also with other public
agencies and the private sector, with opportunity for participation by interested citizens through public
meetings and hearings. In some cases, collaborative or even separate actions from those of the City may be
required by other parties.
The State Office of Planning & Research has determined that the requirements for an Annual Report may
be met by completing and returning to the Office the annual questionnaire sent out by the Office to all cities
and counties each spring. However, a report made to the City Council in keeping with the letter and spirit
of the law is far more useful as a gauge of the City's commitment and success toward Plan implementation.

THE DEVELOPMENT FEE STRUCTURE
In response to recent legislation, the City Council adopted a set of preliminary development fees required of
private developers for on-site and off-site improvements. With adoption of the General Plan, the fees
should be revised to reflect any changes in basic assumptions and costs. Fees for water, sewerage and
drainage/flood control should be revised upon completion of the Master Plans for these facilities. Fees
should also be revised every 2-3 years to reflect any increases (or decreases) in construction costs that may
result from inflation.
