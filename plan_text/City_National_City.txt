                                  The General Plan identifies a preferred future for National
                                  City and steers land use and development policies in that
   Dynamic –

   Ambitious, full of
   new ideas,                     decisions in National City. This is the first comprehensive
   flexible, adaptable            revision of the city’s General Plan in thirteen years. The
   to new conditions,             previous General Plan was adopted in 1996. One of the main
   and produces                   objectives of this comprehensive update is to create a

                                  A.      What is a General Plan?
                                  California law requires every city and county in the state to
                                  prepare and adopt a comprehensive and long-range general
                                  plan for the physical development of the jurisdiction1. The
                                  general plan serves as a blueprint for both public and private
                                  future development and outlines goals, policies, and
                                  implementation measures that reflect the city’s values and
                                  priorities.
   Refer to Part 2 –
   Vision and Guiding             The following example shows the relationship among goals,
   Principles for                 policies, and implementation measures. The example is
   statements                     arranged to show a hierarchy from the general to the
   regarding National
   City’s values.
                                  specific – goal to implementation measure. Although only
                                  one policy and one implementation measure are listed in the
                                  example, goals may have multiple policies and policies may
                                  have multiple implementation measures. In addition,
                                  implementation measures may relate to more than one
                                  policy.

   technique
                                policies3. The following briefly describes the State
   intended to help             requirements for the seven, mandatory elements:
   achieve a specific            
   goal or policy.              •   The Land Use Element designates the general
                                    distribution and general location for specific uses of the
                                    land including population density and building intensity
                                    for residential uses, commercial uses, industrial uses,
                                    public facilities, and open space, among others.
                                •   The Circulation Element identifies the general location

                                    airports. This Element plans for a balanced multimodal
                                    transportation network that meets the needs of all users
                                    of streets, roads, and highways for safe and convenient
                                    travel.
                                •   The Housing Element assesses current and projected
                                    housing needs and establishes policies and proposals for
                                    improving housing and providing adequate housing sites
                                    to meet all economic levels. State law requires that the

                               natural and manmade hazards such as seismic, geologic,
                               flooding, and fire hazards.
                           •   The Noise Element identifies and assesses noise
                               problems and includes policies to protect the community
                               from excessive noise levels.
                           •   The Open Space Element details plans and measures for
                               the preservation of land for the managed production of
                               resources, protection of natural resources, and for public
                               health and safety.
                           •   The Conservation Element addresses the conservation,
                               development, and utilization of natural resources,
                               including water, forests, soils, rivers and creeks, wildlife
                               habitats, sensitive vegetation, and mineral deposits.
                           State law allows cities to adopt a general plan in the format
                           that best fits its unique circumstances and allows for the
                           inclusion of optional elements.4 National City has chosen to

                       B.      National City Profile
                       National City is located in San Diego County, approximately
                       five miles south of downtown San Diego and eleven miles
                       north of the Mexican border (Refer to Figure 1-1, Regional
                       Location). It encompasses 9.2 square miles and is
                       considered almost fully developed. It is bordered by the City
                       of San Diego to the north and east, the San Diego Bay to
                       the west, and the City of Chula Vista to the south. In
                       addition, a small unincorporated community, known as
                       Lincoln Acres, is located to the southeast of National City,
                       generally north of SR-54 and east of I-805. I-5 and I-805
                       cross National City from north to south, and SR-54
                       traverses the southern edge.
                       National City is San Diego County’s second oldest city and
                       was incorporated on September 17, 1887. It has a long and
                       rich history. The land that National City now occupies was
                       originally home to the Jamacha Tribe of the Diegueno
                       Indians and was later used by Spanish soldiers to graze
                       horses. It was part of the 26,000-acre El Rancho de la
                       Nacion Spanish land grant, which was granted to John
                       Forster, the son-in law of Mexican governor Pio Pico, in

                                         became a state in 1850, land grants were allowed to
                                         continue as private property under American law. After ten
                                         years, Forester sold his land to a French developer and in
                                         1868, it was purchased by Frank, Warren, and Levi Kimball.
                                         The Kimball brothers cleared the lands, built roads,
                                         constructed the city's first wharf and brought the first
                                         railroad into town. The Kimballs were responsible for
                                         opening the first post office and the first library in National
                                         City. They were also involved in several other business
                                         ventures including brick burning, lumber cutting, raising
                                         sheep, and growing produce. Frank Kimball worked with the
                                         US Department of Agriculture to plant a variety of items
                                         imported from other areas, including orange trees, lemon
                                         trees, eucalyptus trees, olive trees, grape vines, red oats,
                                         and potatoes5. In 1885 the Kimball brothers began
                                         advertising San Diego County by taking its best produce to
                                         national and international fairs, where it always won top
                                         honors. During this time many travelers took advantage of
                                         low cost train tickets and came to California intending to
                                         visit, but ended up settling here. The result was a financial
                                         boom4.
                                         National City experienced a sudden increase in building and
                                         population growth during the mid- to late 1880’s. By 1893,
                                         America experienced a serious economic depression due
                                         largely to overbuilding and shaky financing of railroads.
                                         During this time, Frank Kimball sold much of his land to
                                         Ralph Granger, a Colorado silver mining man. Ralph built a
                                         music hall, Granger Hall, where many famous musicians
                                         played.
                                         National City’s automotive heritage began in 1904 when
                                         Ralph Granger bought his first car. It was the first motor car
                                         in the City. The motor car was quickly accepted by the
                                         pioneers of National City. Clarence and William Hunt opened
                                         the first auto dealership in 1904. The brothers were
                                         contacted by the wealthy Arnie Babock, whose father built
                                         the famous Hotel del Coronado, to build a reliable sturdy
                                         motor car in their machine shop. The “Hunt Special” was
                                         successfully tested in 1910. While the Hunt Special was
                                         under construction, National City citizens learned about the
                                         new Ford Model T that sold for $850 and National Avenue
                                         (renamed National City Boulevard in 1978) was packed with
                                         vehicles sputtering down the newly paved road. In the late
                                         1920’s Chevrolet began to outsell Ford’s basic Model T and

Part One: Introduction
                                        National Avenue was graced by the automobiles of some of
                                        Hollywood’s most famous stars including Clark Gable and
                                        Jean Harlow. By 1955, car dealerships were flourishing
                                        along National Avenue and advertising themselves as the
                                        “Mile of Cars”6.
                                        Agriculture in National City experienced two natural
                                        disasters that would impact the industry. In 1913, a major
                                        frost damaged many of the fruit and olive trees and in
                                        1916, the Sweetwater Dam collapsed and a flood destroyed
                                        much of the farmland and several homes in its path to the
                                        ocean. As a result, various industries began to gradually
                                        replace farming. In 1954, the South Bay Plaza Shopping
                                        Center became the second shopping center to open in the
                                        county7.
                                        As of 2009, National City has a population of approximately
                                        56,5228. Since the 1990s, National City has experienced
                                        slight changes in ethnic mix. In 1990, 26.1% of residents
                                        were White, compared to 9.6% in 2009. The population of
                                        African Americans declined from 7.9% in 1990 to 4.7% in
                                        2009. The percentage of Hispanic/Latino residents
                                        increased from 49.8% in 1990 to 62.6% in 2009. In 1990,
                                        15.9% of residents were Asian/Pacific Islander, compared to
                                        19.3% in 2009. Filipinos make up a significant portion of
                                        this Asian population. These numbers indicate that National
                                        City has experienced an influx of immigrants from Mexico
                                        and Central America as well as from Asia and the Pacific
                                        Islands, while the population of White and African American
                                        residents has been decreasing. The percentage of other
                                        races or two or more races has increased approximately
                                        93% between 1990 and 2000, but still makes up a
                                        relatively small percentage of the total population at just
                                        fewer than 3%. Possible reasons for this increase include
                                        people becoming more aware of the mixed race designation
                                        and the US Census making it easier to choose this
                                        designation. Refer to Table 1-1.

                                            (SANDAG) 2050 Regional Growth Forecast estimates that
                                            National City is one of the six jurisdictions in the County
                                            that will grow at a faster rate than the regional average.
                                            National City’s population is expected to increase 23%
                                            between 2008 and 2030, while housing is expected to
                                            increase by 19.5%. By 2050, National City’s population is
                                            expected to increase by 60% and housing is expected to
                                            increase by 56%. Refer to Table 1-2.

                       PART 4: CITYWIDE IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES. To help
                       ensure that appropriate actions are taken to implement the
                       General Plan, Part 4 includes a set of implementation
                       measures. Implementation measures identify the specific
                       steps to be taken by the City to implement the policies
                       outlined in the General Plan. They may include revisions of
                       current codes and ordinances, plans and capital

                       The following principles govern how the National City
  implemented.         General Plan should be read, interpreted, and implemented.
                       Relationships between the Plan’s various goals and policies.
                       In California, the general plan is often characterized as being
                       a community’s “constitution” for development and
                       conservation. A general plan is called upon to address a
                       range of diverse, sometimes, divergent, public interests. A
                       city enjoys broad discretion to weigh and balance competing
                       interests in formulating general-plan policies. As discussed
                       in the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR)
                       General Plan Guidelines, “given the long-term nature of a
                       general plan, its diagrams and text should be general enough
                       to allow a degree of flexibility in decision-making as times
                       change.” (Office of Planning and Research 2003, page 14.)
                       All general plans, including this one, must also address a
                       host of concerns within a consistent, well-integrated policy
                       framework. In implementing the Plan, it is the task of the
                       City Council (or its delegates) to make policy determinations
                       in a manner that promotes the overall goals of the Plan and
                       the public welfare, in accordance with existing resources,
                       staffing, and priorities available at the time. Policy and
                       program implementation will require reasonable and

Adopted June 2011                       1-14                   National City General Plan

                                                                  Part One: Introduction
                       basis as the City Council, Planning Commission, City staff,
                       and others work to effectively implement the entire Plan.
                       Another      overall   principle   to   guide    the     reading,
                       interpretation, and implementation of the Plan is that none
                       of its provisions will be interpreted by the City in a manner
                       that violates state or federal law. In reading every provision
                       of the Plan, one should infer that it is limited by the
                       principle, “to the extent legally permitted.”
                       Background Reports. Preparation of this General Plan
                       involved developing a series of technical-background
                       reports. While these reports provided background
                       information utilized during the drafting the City’s General
                       Plan, they are not part of the Plan.
                       Introduction, Vision and Guiding Principles, Existing Setting,
                       Regulatory Framework, Existing and Projected Noise
                       Contours, Terminology, Roadway Classifications, and
                       Buildout Projections. These sections are not intended to
                       provide new goals or policies.         Rather, these sections
                       provide the general context, and in some cases the general
                       rationale, for the goals and policies mentioned in the
                       applicable Element(s). As noted above, the General Plan
                       should be general enough to allow a degree of flexibility in
                       decision-making as times change. While these sections may
                       aid in the interpretation of goals, policies, and land use
                       designations, they are not intended to be the exclusive
                       method of interpretation, but a factor the decision makers
                       may consider on a case-by-case basis.
                       To the degree that these sections conflict with the language
                       of the goals, policies, and land use designations they
                       accompany, the language of the goals, policies, and land use
                       designations shall govern.
                       Effect of headings and titles. The Plan’s goals and policies
                       are typically accompanied by a heading or title. These are
                       provided for convenience only. To the degree that these
                       headings or titles conflict with the text they accompany, the
                       text of the goals and policies shall govern.
                       “Why is this important?” Within the General Plan there are
                       sections labeled “Why is this important?” which occur
                       subsequent to the goals and policies. These sections are
                       not intended to provide new goals or policies. Rather, these
                       sections provide the context, and in some cases the
                       rationale, for the adoption of the goals and policies these
                       sections accompany. While these sections may aid in the
                       interpretation of the goals and policies, they are not

                       intended to be the exclusive method of interpretation, but a
                       factor the decision makers may consider on a case-by-case
                       basis.
                       To the degree that these sections conflict with the language
                       of the goals and policies they accompany, the language of
                       the goals and policies shall govern.
                       Sidebars. Sidebars in the context of this General Plan serve
                       two purposes: (1) The sidebars provide cross references to
                       other portions of the General Plan and related documents
                       which address similar or related issues. The City does not
                       intend to incorporate by reference documents located
                       outside the General Plan, such that a revision to these
                       documents would constitute a General Plan amendment. (2)
                       The sidebars also provide definitions for technical terms.
                       While these definitions are provided to give clarity to the
                       reader, they are not necessarily the exclusive definitions by
                       which the document is to be interpreted.
                       To the degree that these sections conflict with the language
                       of the goals, policies, and land use designations they
                       accompany, the language of the goals, policies, and land use
                       designations shall govern.
                       Plan Implementation. The City’s General Plan includes
                       specific implementation measures and indicators.             The
                       following principles guide Plan implementation.
                           •  Implementation can take time, especially when
                              needed resources are limited and required for more
                              than one program.
                           •  Because implementation can take time, the City
                              Council, and those to whom the Council delegates,
                              may need to prioritize programs.               The Plan
                              contemplates this ongoing process as part of
                              National City’s policy-making function.
                           •  While the Plan identifies specific programs,
                              implementation measures may be adjusted over time
                              based on new information, changing circumstances,
                              and evaluation of their effectiveness, so long as they
                              remain consistent with the intent of the Plan.
                           •  It is important to note that by adopting Citywide
                              Implementation Measures (Chapter 4), and Indicators
                              (Chapter 5), which are not required to be included in

                              establish additional general plan goals or policies.
                              Because the Implementation Measures and Indicators
                              are intended only as an aid in implementation of the
                              General Plan, they are included in the plan only for
                              convenience and updates to these sections will not
                              be considered amendments to the General Plan.
                           •  To the degree that these sections conflict with the
                              language of the goals, policies, and land use
                              designations they implement, the language of the
                              goals, policies, and land use designations shall govern.
                       Specific Plans. In some instances the General Plan discusses
                       and references Specific Plans. The City did not incorporate
                       these Specific Plans by reference into the General Plan, such
                       that revisions to the Specific Plans require a General Plan
                       amendment. (Government Code Section 65453) Rather the
                       Specific Plans were created to provide for the systematic
                       implementation of the General Plan. (Government Code
                       Section 65450 et seq.)
                       To the degree that the Specific Plans conflict with the
                       language of the goals, policies, and land use designations
                       they implement, the language of the General Plan’s goals,
                       policies, and land use designations shall govern.
                       F.     How to Use the General Plan
                       The City’s General Plan is intended for use by all members of
                       the community including residents, businesses, developers,
                       City staff, and decision-makers. The organization of the
                       General Plan allows users to find topics or sections that
                       interest them and to quickly review city policies. However,
                       users should realize that the policies throughout all
                       elements are interrelated and should be examined
                       comprehensively and must be considered together when
                       making planning decisions.
                       For residents, the General Plan indicates the general types
                       of uses that are permitted within their neighborhoods and
                       the long-range plans and changes that may affect their
                       neighborhoods. The General Plan also identifies the policies
                       the City will use to evaluate development applications. It
                       indicates how the City will attract businesses that provide
                       goods and services to meet daily needs and new jobs that
                       lessen the need to commute. The General Plan informs
                       residents how the City plans to improve transportation
                       infrastructure, continue to provide adequate public services
                       and facilities, and protect valued open spaces and

                       environmental resources. It also describes the actions the
                       City will take to help ensure that the city and its
                       neighborhoods remain great places to live.
                       For businesses, the General Plan outlines the measures the
                       City will take to protect investments and encourage future
                       success. Expectations for business districts are identified
                       and policies ensure that business operations will be
                       compatible with other businesses and nearby residential
                       areas.
                       For developers, or those moving homes or businesses to the
                       city, the General Plan introduces the community, provides
                       background       information,   and   outlines     development
                       regulations. It is important to review all maps and policies
                       throughout this General Plan, Design Guidelines, and the
                       National City Municipal Code to get a complete perspective
                       on how and where development may occur.
                       For decision-makers, the General Plan is a tool to help City
                       staff, the Planning Commission, other boards and
                       commissions, and the City Council make land use and public
                       investment decisions. Future development decisions must
                       be consistent with the General Plan.
                       The General Plan is also intended to help other public
                       agencies, from Caltrans to SANDAG to local school districts,
                       as they contemplate future actions in and around National
                       City.
                       G.       General Plan Preparation Process
                       This General Plan was prepared over a two year period by
                       City staff and a consultant team. The process began in
                       March of 2009 with a Strategic Plan Update workshop that
                       helped to establish the broad vision and guiding principles
  Refer to Appendix    that shaped the General Plan. In June of 2009, a student

  results.             was presented at a joint meeting with the City Council and
                       the Planning Commission. Additional existing condition
                       studies were prepared by the consultant team to help
                       inform policy development. In addition, key issues to
                       consider within the General Plan were identified by the public
                       through workshops and a survey that asked respondents to
                       identify National City’s existing strengths and weaknesses

                       and future opportunities and threats. Throughout Plan
                       development, the general public, the business community,
                       affected agencies and service districts, non-profit
                       organizations, and the City Council brought their ideas,
                       passions, and energy to the process by attending public
                       workshops, submitting comments through the City’s
                       website, engaging in meetings with City staff and the
                       consultant team, and participating in five City Council
                       working meetings where draft General plan concepts, goals,
                       policies, and implementation measures were discussed.
                       Based on the policy direction provided by participants and
                       the Preferred Land Use Plan, staff and consultants drafted
                       this General Plan and an update to the Land Use Code. In
                       considering this General Plan, the City’s Planning Commission
                       and City Council reviewed this document and its
                       accompanying Environmental Impact Report (EIR). After
                       public review, comment, and hearings on these documents,
                       the City Council certified the EIR, and subsequently adopted
                       this General Plan to guide development in National City.
                       The following timeline identifies the process that was
                       followed in the creation of this General Plan.

                      difference; use natural resources effectively and efficiently;
                      provide access to goods and services; promote safety in
                      public places; provide high quality education; cultivate the
                      arts; preserve and celebrate cultural and historic resources;
                      provide    access     to   open     space     and    recreational
                      opportunities; improve and protect the quality of air, water,
                      and food; promote healthy living; and cater to the needs of
                      the young, individuals, families, the elderly, and the disabled.
                      National City will be a place where people want to live, work,
                      and play.
                      B.     Guiding Principles
                      In 2007, National City adopted a Five-Year Strategic Plan to
                      address community and economic development. That plan

                             was updated in March of 2009. As part of the process, a
                             series of public workshops was held to identify significant
                             goals and objectives. Five interlocking guiding principles
                             were formed to promote collaboration, improve public
                             communication, and align city departments. These guiding
                             principles were expanded upon during the General Plan
                             Update process to become the basis for the goals, policies,
                             and implementation programs in this General Plan.
                                        SMART GROWTH: Recognize the importance of
                             linking land use and transportation planning. According to
                             the San Diego County Association of Government’s
                             (SANDAG) 2030 Regional Growth Forecast, San Diego
                             County’s population is expected to increase faster than
                             housing supply. This trend leads to higher housing costs,
                             forcing many residents to move to neighboring areas with
                             less expensive housing. These people become long distance
                             commuters, and with few transit options, San Diego
                             County’s freeways become more congested. The result is an
                             ongoing housing crisis and worsening traffic and air quality.
                             To help combat this problem, SANDAG adopted a Regional
                             Comprehensive Plan (RCP) in 2004. The RCP balances

                             support the RCP by basing its land use pattern on the smart
                             growth principles outlined in the RCP. Under this General
                             Plan, redevelopment, infill, and new growth will be targeted
                             into compact, mixed-use, and walkable areas that are
                             connected to the regional transportation system. Higher
                             density and intensity development will be focused around
                             transit stops and major corridors that link residences to

                             and recreational areas. This General Plan will result in
                             increased personal transportation options with priority given

                      equivalent to 1990 statewide levels by 2020. Senate Bill
                      375, which was signed into law in 2008, provides incentives
                      for integrating regional land use planning and local

                      consistent with AB32. It requires each metropolitan region

                      mixed-use development and alternative modes of
                      transportation to reduce passenger vehicle use. As of the
                      writing of this General Plan, SANDAG was working on its first
                      Sustainable Communities Strategy. National City will
                      continue to coordinate with SANDAG and align its local plans
                      with regional transportation and land use goals and policies.
                                  QUALITY OF LIFE: Improve the quality of life for
                      everyone within National City. National City is one of the
                      lowest income communities within San Diego County.
                      According to SANDAG 2009 estimates, the median
                      household income in National City is $46,731, whereas the
                      median household income for the region is $72,963.
                      National City also has a large “minority” population where
                      the majority of residents are Hispanic or Latino. The low
                      socio-economic status of National City residents has led to
                      overcrowded households, overpayment for housing, a
                      disproportionate share of undesirable land uses, crime, poor
                      education, and a lack of shopping opportunities.
                      National City has a series of auto services, light
                      manufacturing, and warehouse uses that are interspersed
                      throughout residential neighborhoods. This mixture of land
                      uses has resulted in community concerns related to traffic,
                      parking, noise, air quality, and hazardous materials exposure.
                      These same neighborhoods often lack public facilities and

                                  National City is devoted to improving the quality of life for
                                  all of its residents by recognizing these inequities and
                                  balancing new development and redevelopment with
                                  important community amenities accessible to all segments
                                  of the population. National City also seeks to improve
                                  quality of life for its residents by providing a mixture of
                                  housing         opportunities; offering  better      access     to

                                  cultural arts; addressing noise, nuisance, health, and
                                  maintenance issues; amortizing incompatible land uses over
                                  time, and ensuring that future generations can meet their
                                  environmental resource needs.
                                                  HEALTH AND SAFETY: Seek opportunities to
                                  improve public health and safety performance. According to
                                  San Diego County health statistics, National City suffers
                                  disproportionately from health issues compared to the rest
                                  of the region1. For example, in 2004, National City had the
                                  highest rate of deaths from diabetes in the County (41
                                  deaths per 100,000 population compared to 18 deaths per
                                  100,000 population countywide). In 2004, National City
                                  also experienced a high rate of deaths from coronary heart
                                  disease (191 deaths per 100,000 population compared to
                                  133 deaths per 100,000 population countywide). In
                                  addition, in 2005, childhood asthma hospitalization rates in
                                  National City were higher than the County average (247 per
                                  100,000 children compared to 140 per 100,000 children
                                  county wide).
                                  National City recognizes that there is a direct connection
                                  between how the city is physically structured and its
                                  residents’ health. The built environment influences how
                                  much people walk, drive, use public transit, or ride a bike,
                                  their level of stress, what type of food they eat, and the
                                  quality of their water and air – all factors that affect health
                                  and wellbeing. To encourage healthier living, this General
                                  Plan seeks to increase urban agriculture, make the city more
                                  walkable and bikeable, increase recreational opportunities,
                                  and improve air and water quality through sustainable

                                   schools. The General Plan identifies nine neighborhoods
                                   based on elementary school attendance boundaries (Refer
                                   to Figure 2-1). The local elementary school is intended to
                                   become a community gathering place within its

                             Providing educational opportunities to the community and
                             promoting citizen participation in local issues is a critical
                             component of this General Plan. National City strives to
                             improve the academic performance of schools, offer lifelong
                             learning opportunities, and maintain open and honest
                             channels of communication with its citizens.
                                         ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: Provide a framework
                             for sound economic development strategies. In addition to
                             the nine neighborhoods, National City has four business
                             districts: Downtown, the Mile of Cars, Plaza Bonita, and the
                             Harbor (Refer to Figure 2-1). Implementation measures for
                             these districts should focus on maintaining and enhancing

                             and providing living wage employment opportunities are
                             essential components of a sustainable community and are a
                             focus of this General Plan. Limited funding for
                             implementation programs is a major obstacle when it comes
                             to carrying out goals and policies. Therefore, viable funding
                             options and financial constraints were considered in the
                             development of General Plan programs.

                                          GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
                  The citywide goals and policies located within the following
                  elements are the heart of the General Plan. The goals and
                  policies flow directly from the Guiding Principles and address
                  a broad range of topics required by state law and those that
                  address unique local concerns. For each goal, there is an
                  explanation regarding its importance as it relates to
                  sustainability – advancing a prosperous economy, supporting
                  a healthy environment, and/or promoting social equity.
                  Goals and policies that are being relied upon for mitigation
                  purposes in the General Plan Update Environmental Impact
                  Report (EIR) are denoted by this symbol      ☼.
                  Citywide implementation measures for the policies are
                  located in Part 4.
                  The nine citywide elements of the General Plan are as

                                                        Land Use and
                        Community Character (LU)
                      A.      Introduction
                      The purpose of the Land Use and Community Character
                      Element is to plan for and identify where future development
                      and redevelopment should be directed. This element balances
                      growth and change with preserving and improving well
                      established residential neighborhoods and commercial and
                      industrial cores, and overall quality of life.
                      National City recognizes that creating a complementary mix
                      of residential, employment, commercial, service, food-
                      producing, and recreational uses is essential to supporting a
                      sustainable community. In addition, creating and preserving a
                      unique community identity fosters a positive sense of place
                      and enriches quality of life. Therefore, land use and
                      community character are integrated in this element to ensure
                      that the physical forms, patterns, and aesthetic features of
                      future development and redevelopment advance the City’s
                      desire for a higher quality of life and a more sustainable
                      future.
                      B.      Existing Setting
                      EXISTING LAND USES
                      To identify existing land uses within the planning area,
                      existing land use data obtained from the San Diego
                      Association of Governments (SANDAG) was verified or
                      corrected based on field observations as well as a review of
                      aerial imagery. Land uses in existence as of September of
                      2009 are shown in Figure LU-1. The existing land uses were
                      grouped in the following general categories:

                      communications, and utilities make up a large part of the
                      planning area mainly because of the freeways that run
                      through the city: I-5, I-805, and SR-54. Water also makes up a
                      large component because the city limits extend into San
                      Diego Bay.

                                     SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
                                     All solid waste in the city is collected by EDCO Waste and
                                     Recycling Services. Non-recyclable solid waste is sent to the
   Solid and liquid                  Otay Landfill, located at 1700 Maxwell Road in Chula Vista,
   waste disposal are                approximately ten miles south of National City and operated
   also addressed in                 by Allied Waste Industries. Recyclable materials are processed

   Element.                          (MRFs) in Southern California. Currently, the Otay Landfill is
                                     preparing a construction and demolition recycling site and
                                     operating a cogeneration plant, in which the gas from
                                     decomposing trash is used to power the landfill. The landfill
                                     has a maximum permitted throughput of 5,830 tons of solid
                                     waste per day. At the existing rate of disposal, operations
                                     are estimated to cease in 20212.
                                     As of January of 2010, one new landfill site, Gregory Canyon,
                                     is proposed in San Diego County. Gregory Canyon is located
                                     in North County, near the communities of Fallbrook, Vista, and
                                     Pauma Valley.            The 1,770-acre Gregory Canyon site is
                                     designed for a 30-year life expectancy. Its opening date is
                                     uncertain due to opposition to the facility.
                                     In south San Diego County, an initiative petition to provide for
                                     the siting of a new recycling center and solid waste landfill in
                                     the East Otay Mesa area of unincorporated San Diego County
                                     was filed by the proponents with the Registrar of Voters on
                                     August 18, 2009. On October 13, 2009, the County Board
                                     of Supervisors directed County staff to prepare a report on
                                     the proposed impacts of the petition to enable the Board to
                                     make an informed decision as to whether to adopt the
                                     proposed initiative by ordinance or to place it on the June 8,
                                     2010 ballot.
                                     These two sites, if permitted, would be potential disposal
                                     sites for National City’s waste once the Otay Landfill in Chula
                                     Vista reaches capacity. There are no plans to provide future
                                     solid waste disposal facilities within National City.

                             MILITARY FACILITIES
                             The impact of new growth on military readiness activities has
                             been considered as part of this General Plan update. All land
                             within Naval Base San Diego will remain designated as military
                             reserve. The Navy was consulted during the preparation of
                             this General Plan update and confirmed that the updated land
                             use changes, goals, and policies would not impact military
                             facilities or activities within or adjacent to the planning area.
                             The following facilities were also considered as part of this
                             update:
                                 •    The Army National Guard located at 303 Palm Avenue
                                      in National City. No changes have been made to the
                                      land use designation for this facility or to the
                                      surrounding land use designations that could affect this
                                      facility. An institutional land use designation is applied
                                      to the area, which accommodates the uses associated
                                      with the Guard.
                                 •    The US Government Navy Department located at 1005
                                      East Plaza Boulevard in National City. No changes have
                                      been made to the land use designation for this facility
                                      or to the surrounding land use designations that could
                                      affect this facility, which is located within an existing
                                      shopping center.        A major mixed-use land use
                                      designation is applied to this area which accommodates
                                      the uses associated with the Department.

                                    The state requires that the San Diego County Regional Airport
                                    Authority Board, as the Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC),
                                    prepare Airport Land Use Compatibility Plans (ALUCPs) for
                                    each public-use airport and military air installation in the
                                    county. For military air installations, the state also requires
                                    that the ALUC prepare the compatibility plans consistent with
                                    the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone study prepared by
                                    the military. The intent of an ALUCP is to help ensure
                                    compatibility between airports and future land uses that
                                    surround them by addressing noise, overflight, safety, and
                                    airspace protection concerns, thereby minimizing the public’s
                                    exposure to excessive noise and safety hazards within an

   Element for                      ALUC does not have land use authority, cities must implement

                                    The adopted ALUCP for SDIA was most recently amended in
                                    2004. National City is outside of the AIA identified in SDIA’s
                                    adopted compatibility plan. In the spring of 2010, the ALUC
                                    will begin a comprehensive update for the ALUCP for SDIA.
                                    The ALUCP for NAS will be prepared when the updated Air
                                    Installations Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) studies are
                                    available.
                                    A portion of the Salt Flats, located within the southernmost
                                    extent of National City as illustrated on Figure LU-3, lies
                                    within the AIA for Brown Field Municipal Airport. The Salt
                                    Flats are located within an area of the AIA that is outside the
                                    area of primary noise concern, but within the airspace
                                    protection and/or overflight notification areas. This area is
                                    referred to as “Review Area 2” in the Brown Field ALUCP and
                                    only contains land use restrictions that limit the heights of
                                    structures, particularly in areas of high terrain3.
                                    REDEVELOPMENT AREA
                                    California’s Community Redevelopment Law allows cities and
                                    counties to redevelop blighted areas. National City’s
                                    redevelopment area includes most of the land west of I-805.
                                    The City’s Redevelopment Division assists with revitalization
                                    through land assemblage, private and public redevelopment
                                    projects,        infrastructure           projects,        remediation        and

Part Three: General Plan Elements – Land Use
                             LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM
                             The California Coastal Act, which was passed by the
                             legislature in 1976, establishes the California Coastal
                             Commission as having jurisdiction over the coastal zone. The
                             Act outlines standards for development within the coastal
                             zone to protect, maintain, enhance, and restore the overall
                             quality of the coastal zone, maximize public access, assure
                             orderly and balanced utilization and conservation of coastal
                             zone resources, encourage mutually beneficial uses, and
                             assure priority for coastal-dependent and coastal related
                             development over other development on the coast. The Act
                             directs each local government within the coastal zone to
                             prepare a Local Coastal Program (LCP), which consists of a
                             local government’s land use plans, zoning ordinances, zoning
                             district maps, and actions that implement the provisions and
                             policies of the Coastal Act. After the LCP has been reviewed
                             and adopted by the local government, it is submitted to the
                             State Coastal Commission for review and certification. After
                             the LCP is certified by the Coastal Commission, review
                             authority for new development within the coastal zone
                             reverts from the Coastal Commission to the local government.
                             The local government must make the finding that the
                             development is in conformity with the approved LCP.
                             The coastal zone of National City includes all the area west of
                             I-5 and a small area east of I-5, south of 30th Street. The
                             coastal zone is controlled by three separate agencies: the San
                             Diego Unified Port District, the United States Navy, and the
                             City of National City. The land controlled by the Port District
                             is identified in the Port Master Plan, which has been approved
                             by the Coastal Commission. Federal lands under the
                             jurisdiction of the US Navy are under the jurisdiction of the
                             Federal Coastal Zone Management Act, which states that
                             military lands shall comply with coastal planning to the extent
                             that national security is not imperiled.

                             with the number of people in a given area, the total household
                             population for the planning area as of 2009 (56,588) was

                             the planning area as of 2009 (16,883) to arrive at the
                             existing number of persons per dwelling unit (3.35). For 2030

                      (California Government Code Section 65915 et seq.), a
                      developer, upon request, shall be granted a density bonus,
                      incentive(s),    concession(s),      and/or     modification    of
                      development standard(s) if the developer proposes to build a
                      qualified project satisfying criteria set forth in the city’s

                      The intent of the mixed-use land use designations is to
                      provide for a mixture of stores, services, restaurants, offices,
                      and homes (dwelling units) in close proximity, thereby

                      condominiums. The major mixed-use areas have a
                      comfortable, multi-modal environment with qualities such as
                      inviting street lamps; outdoor seating; pedestrian plazas;
                      attractive street trees; buildings that face onto sidewalks with
                      wide storefront windows and appealing architectural details;
                      bicycle facilities; and convenient access to transit stops and
                      stations.

                             there are three adopted specific plans in National City: the
                             Downtown Specific Plan, the Harbor District Specific Area
                             Plan, and the Westside Specific Plan.
                             The Downtown Specific Plan was adopted in 2005. National
                             City’s downtown is a compact and intense district featuring
                             City Hall, a library, social agencies, a college campus, and
                             numerous churches. The Specific Plan represents a major
                             effort to revitalize National City’s historic downtown area. It
                             establishes a central core of high rise residential and mixed

                         In November of 1988, the City adopted the Harbor District
                         Specific Area Plan, which is a resource-based environmental
                         implementation      plan     that     establishes     site-specific
                         conservation and development standards within the portion of
                         the City’s coastal zone south of Bay Marina Drive. The main
                         objective of the Harbor District Specific Area Plan is to be
                         consistent with and carry out the requirements of the
                         certified Local Coastal Program. Lands within this Specific
                         Plan are designated as tourist commercial with a FAR of 1.0,
                         medium manufacturing with a FAR of 4.0, and open space
                         reserve.
                         The Westside Specific Plan was adopted by the City in March
                         of 2010 and is the result of a collaborative effort by the
                         community, interested and concerned groups, and business
                         owners to revitalize the Westside and improve the quality of
                         life for its residents. Table LU-2 identifies the building
                         densities and intensities permitted within each Westside
                         Specific Plan zone.

  SB375 – A senate
                      The State of California has made significant strides in its
  bill that provides  efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the passage
  incentives for      of SB375 in August of 2008. It requires the preparation of a
  integrated          sustainable communities strategy as part of the regional
  regional land use   transportation plan. The purpose of the strategy is to reduce

  development while   greenhouse gas emissions by reducing passenger vehicle use

                      to be consistent with the regional transportation plan and
                      sustainable communities strategy (Senate Bill No. 375;
                      Government Code § 65080 (b)(2)(J)). The above goal and
                      policies are intended to achieve consistency between National
                      City’s land use plans and regional planning documents. This
                      requirement will help to lessen congestion on freeways,

                      ☼Policy LU-6.6: When reviewing future annexation proposals,
                      consider the preferences of residents and owners in the area,
                      San Diego County, and LAFCO as well as the financial impact
                      on the City.
                      Why is this important?
                      The land use decisions of one agency often have rippling
                      effects on other agencies. Working with and notifying other
                      agencies of National City’s local plans eliminates surprises and
                      helps to achieve a more coordinated development pattern. In
                      addition, California Government Code §65302 requires cities
                      and counties to consider the impact of new growth on military
                      readiness activities and facilities.

                      benefit to the community.
                      Policy LU-7.2: Support historic preservation, adaptive reuse,
                      and refurbishing of existing buildings and structures.

                             interests of the community.
                             Policy LU-7.6: Support the strategic conversion of certain
                             sections of streets into developable land only where the
                             conversion positively contributes to the redevelopment and
                             revitalization of the area, improves traffic safety, and does
                             not impede emergency access.
                             Why is this important?
                             National City is almost completely built out, but additional
                             population growth and development still needs to be
                             accommodated. Vacant parcels, underutilized parcels, and
                             existing vacant buildings are the most logical locations to
                             direct future development.

                      Policy LU-8.6: Leverage federal and state funds to support
                      public works projects.
                      Why is this important?
                      In many cases, the revenue that local governments receive is
                      not sufficient to provide adequate municipal services to area
                      residents. Acquiring other financing sources such as
                      development impact fees and government grants helps to
                      ensure that infrastructure and services can be maintained and
                      upgraded. In addition, it is important to ensure that public
                      facilities and services are equally distributed throughout the
                      city so that no one geographic area is underserved.

Part Three: General Plan Elements – Land Use
                             Why is this important?
                             State law requires consistency between specific plans and the
                             general plan (Government Code §§65454 and 65400), the
                             coastal land use plan of the Local Coastal Program and the
                             General Plan (Public Resources Code §30513; Government
                             Code §65300.5), and public works projects and the general
                             plan (Government Code §65455). Ensuring consistency
                             between these plans and the General Plan leads to the
                             implementation of General Plan goals and policies.
                             E. Build-Out Projections
                             Based on the allowable densities and intensities identified
                             within this Element, the maximum theoretical build-out of the
                             General Plan, assuming that every parcel is built to full
                             capacity, would result in approximately:
                                 •   48,232 new dwelling units;
                                 •   167,788 new residents;
                                 •   31.7 million square feet of new retail/office space; and
                                 •   18.9 million square feet of new industrial space.
                             It is unlikely that maximum theoretical buildout would ever
                             occur, since it assumes that every parcel is developed at the
                             maximum allowed density and intensity without taking any
                             other General Plan policy constraints or development
                             regulations into consideration. This pattern of development
                             would not be consistent with the historical growth patterns in
                             National City and is highly unlikely given the current economic
                             climate. Therefore, maximum theoretical buildout does not
                             provide an accurate or appropriate estimate of build-out of
                             this General Plan.
                             A more realistic assumption of the projected 2030 buildout of
                             this plan would result in approximately:
                                 •   5,091 new dwelling units;
                                 •   20,362 new residents;
                                 •   2.6 million square feet of new retail/office space; and
                                 •   3.2 million square feet of new industrial space.
                             These projections are based on a more realistic estimate of
                             the development that may occur on vacant or underutilized
                             parcels along with sites that are likely to redevelop within
                             National City, recognizing that there are constraints to
                             developing parcels to their full allowable densities and
                             intensities. Such constraints include parking and access

                      maximum allowed.

                             The street system within the planning area includes major
                             roadways, which are broken down into four classifications:
                             freeways, arterials, collectors, and local roads. Figure C-1
                             identifies the locations of these various roadway typologies
                             within the planning area. Definitions of these classifications
                             are provided below.
                             Freeway:          A state-designated, high-speed, high capacity
                                               route with limited direct access that serves
                                               statewide and interregional transportation
                                               needs.
                             Arterial:         A major local traffic channel, providing
                                               circulation across the City and access to major
                                               destination points throughout the region.
                                               These are usually comprised of four to six
                                               driving lanes, often with synchronized signals
                                               to help traffic flow.
                             Collector:        A local conduit that distributes vehicular traffic
                                               from neighborhoods or business districts onto
                                               arterials and sometimes to other collectors.
                                               These may serve as alternate routes to
                                               arterials for movement across the city.
                             Local:            A low capacity, low-speed road providing
                                               direct access to individual properties within
                                               neighborhoods. These roads usually consist of
                                               two driving lanes.
                             The National City street system plan also includes a

                                      VEHICULAR CIRCULATION SYSTEM
                                      The planning area currently has approximately110 miles of
                                      paved streets and 90 signalized intersections2. The existing
                                      roadway system generally follows a traditional grid pattern.
                                      The main regional freeway facilities through the planning
                                      area are I-5, I-805, and SR-54. Both I-5 and I-805 provide
                                      north-south movement while SR-54 is an east-west corridor.
                                      The City has 15 major arterial roadways providing circulation
                                      across the City and to major destination points throughout
                                      the region. These streets are typically four lanes and are
                                      generally spaced at half-mile intervals.
                                      Additionally, the City is served by 30 collector roadways
                                      that operate as local conduits to take users in and out of
                                      neighborhoods and business districts onto the arterial
                                      routes. These are generally two lane roads with signalized
                                      intersections.
                                      PARKING
                                      National City has a variety of parking options including on-
                                      street parking with and with out time restrictions (up to
                                      four hours), off-street parking lots, and residential garages,
                                      carports, driveways, etc. Designated permit parking districts
                                      are located in select neighborhoods. Permit parking districts
                                      are applied to areas which have over 70 percent occupancy
                                      for on‐street parking. In these areas, the City charges an
                                      annual fee to residents for a parking permit. The main

                             purpose of the program is to keep unauthorized vehicles
                             (mainly      from     industrial    shops     near      residential
                             neighborhoods) from monopolizing the residential street
                             parking supply. On‐street signage designates the allowable
                             amount of time vehicles without proper permits may park
                             before being liable for citations. Parking for commercial
                             vehicles and large trucks is restricted on certain streets as
                             well and is also identified by on‐street signage.
                             TRUCK ROUTES
                             National City has designated trucking routes originating
                             mainly from the Marine Terminal and linking to regional
                             highways (Refer to Figure C-8). The truck routes through
                             National City are either classified as “primary” or “alternate”
                             routes. Primary routes are generally described as the most
                             direct routes to freeways and are used for regional delivery.
                             Alternate routes are those roads used to move trucks
                             through the City to local destinations.

                                   The planning area is served by a regional transit system
                                   operated by the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System
                                   (MTS). There are nine bus routes running through the
                                   planning area with a total of 211 bus stops. Additionally,
                                   the planning area includes two MTS Trolley stations, which
                                   are located on the Blue Line Trolley running from Old Town
                                   and Downtown San Diego to the US-Mexico border. The 8th
                                   Street Trolley Station is located near the intersection of 8th
                                   Street and Harbor Drive, and the 24th Street Trolley Station
                                   is located near the intersection of 22nd Street and Wilson
                                   Avenue (Refer to Figure C-9).
                                   The planning area also will soon be served by the South Bay
                                   Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. The 21-mile BRT will
                                   provide high-speed transit connections between downtown
                                   San Diego and the Otay Mesa Border Crossing along the
                                   future I-805 managed lanes and a dedicated transitway
                                   through eastern Chula Vista. The new BRT will ultimately
                                   include 15 stations providing access to regional employment
                                   centers in downtown San Diego, the Otay Mesa Business
                                   Park, and the future Eastern Urban Center, as well as serving
                                   residential communities in Chula Vista and National City.
                                   The first phase of the project, between downtown San
                                   Diego and the Eastern Urban Center, is scheduled to be

                             The City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) identifies
                             funds to improve upon conditions affecting walkability.
                             Additionally, the City has implemented portions of its Safe
                             Routes to School program. The program’s primary objective
                             is to create safe and accessible walking corridors between
                             schools and the feeder neighborhoods. It aims to encourage
                             and increase the number of children who walk to school
                             through public outreach and education. Implementation
                             involves the installation of traffic safety enhancements such
                             as lighted warning beacons, radar speed feedback signs,
                             pedestrian countdown signals at street crossings, in-road
                             lights at crosswalks, increased street signage, and striping.

                             BIKEWAYS
                             The planning area contains two regional bikeways: The
                             Bayshore Bikeway and the Sweetwater River Bikeway. The
                             Bayshore Bikeway is a 26-mile regional bicycle route that
                             encircles San Diego Bay and passes through the planning
                             area along Harbor Drive and Tidelands Avenue and provides
                             a link to the nearby cities of San Diego, Coronado, Imperial
                             Beach, and Chula Vista. This route also provides an
                             alternative transportation option to many industrial and
                             military job sites.
                             The Sweetwater River Bikeway is located along the southern
                             border of National City with segments in Chula Vista. It runs
                             parallel with the Sweetwater River Flood Control Channel. It
                             is approximately 1.7 miles long and varies between eight
                             and ten feet in width. It connects to the Bayshore Bikeway
                             at the Sweetwater Channel near the Gordy Shields Bridge.
                             In addition, the City of National City’s Bikeway Master Plan
                             identifies the location of local bike routes (Refer to Figure C-
                             10).

                                      Rail lines within the planning area are primarily used to
                                      transport lumber, cars, and containers that have entered
                                      the country via the Port of San Diego at the National City
                                      Marine Terminal. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF)
                                      Railway and the San Diego and Imperial Valley Railway (SDIV)
                                      are the two companies currently operating on the rail lines
                                      within the planning area. Other than trolley service, there is
                                      no passenger rail service in National City.
                                      NATIONAL CITY MARINE TERMINAL
                                      National City is home to a major marine terminal owned by
                                      the Port of San Diego. The Port’s marine terminals are vital
                                      components of the San Diego region’s working waterfront,
                                      which includes maritime operators, ship builders, and other
                                      commercial and industrial businesses. The National City
                                      Marine Terminal is located at the westerly terminus of Bay
                                      Marina Drive. The terminal is a 125‐acre complex with eight
                                      cargo berths. The National City Marine Terminal’s main
                                      inventory consists of vehicles, lumber, and cargo. The
                                      facility is operated by Pasha Automotive and Distribution
                                      Services, and the terminal serves as the primary port of
                                      entry for a variety of automobile manufacturers.4
                                      AIR TRANSPORTATION
                                      Although no airports are located within the planning area,
                                      there are three airports located near National City: the San
                                      Diego International Airport (SDIA) at Lindbergh Field, the
   Refer to the Land                  Naval Air Station (NAS) North Island located in Coronado,
   Use Element for a                  and Brown Field Municipal Airport located south of the
   discussion of                      planning area in the Otay Mesa community of San Diego
   airport land use                   (see Figure C-11.) SDIA is located approximately 5 to 6
   compatibility.
                                      miles northwest of National City. It is the 29th largest
                                      airport in the U.S. in terms of passenger traffic and the only
                                      major large hub airport served by a single runway5. The San
                                      Diego Regional Airport Authority forecasts that by 2030,
                                      passenger traffic at SDIA will increase from the existing
                                      17.5 million passengers annually to 32 million passengers.
                                      This growth is anticipated to result in capacity constraints
                                      by 2015. To meet the increasing air transportation demand
                                      at SDIA, the Airport Authority is updating the SDIA Master
                                      Plan to guide the long-term phased development of SDIA

                                      maximizing terminal conditions and capacity, vehicle parking
                                      capacity, multi-modal ground connections, and passenger
                                      and cargo needs.
                                      NAS North Island is located in Coronado, across the Bay
                                      from SDIA. NAS North Island is the only west coast
                                      installation that provides direct access from an aircraft
                                      carrier to an airfield. The Naval Outlying Field at Imperial
                                      Beach is a component of North Island and serves as an
                                      important location for Naval helicopter training.
                                      Brown Field is a port-of-entry into the United States for
                                      private aircraft coming from Mexico into California. Brown
                                      Field is also heavily used by military and law enforcement
                                      agencies.

                             Why is this important?
                             Recent revisions in planning law recognize the importance of
                             planning for multiple modes of transportation, which provide
                             for the needs of all users (including pedestrians, bicyclists,
                             mass transit riders, motorists, etc.). (See AB 1358 [2008];
                             SB 375 [2008].)          Recent revisions in environmental
                             regulations also recognize that the overall effectiveness of
                             the transportation system should be considered.            (See
                             California Natural Resources Agency, Final Statement of
                             Reasons for Regulatory Action: Amendments to the State

                      REGIONAL CIRCULATION PLANNING
                        Goal C-3: Coordination with the regional mobility system.
                      Policy C-3-1: Consult with SANDAG regarding updates to
                      and implementation of the Regional Transportation Plan
                      (RTP).
                      Policy C-3-2: Work with Caltrans and adjacent jurisdictions
                      to plan and implement future roadway connections and

                      Policy C-3.3: Consult with MTS regarding updates to the BRT
                      and local bus routes and related activities.
                      Why is this important?
                      The Circulation Element is part of a larger body of plans and
                      programs that guide the development and management of
                      the transportation system.          SANDAG, as the regional
                      planning agency is responsible for developing the RTP, which
                      includes a long-range vision for buses, the Trolley, rail,
                      highways, major streets, bicycle travel, walking, goods
                      movement, and airport services. SANDAG also oversees the
                      planning, financial programming, project development, and
                      construction functions of MTS. Caltrans manages more than
                      50,000 miles of California's highway and freeway lanes,
                      provides inter-city rail services, and permits public-use
                      airports and special-use hospital heliports. Due to the highly
                      integrated    and    complex      nature    of    the     region’s
                      transportation facilities, it is important that local
                      transportation planning efforts be considered with the
                      regional system in order to attain the greatest efficiencies
                      and benefits for the City.

                             Why is this important?
                             Reducing vehicular trips, especially at peak commuting
                             times, can be accomplished through: improvements to
                             pedestrian circulation, bike and transit systems; increased
                             use of carpooling; and accommodations made by employers
                             to allow for flexible work schedules, including work from
                             home provisions.      Trip reduction, by whichever means,
                             translates into less traffic congestion, fewer greenhouse gas
                             emissions and improved regional and local air quality.

                      Policy C-5.10: Require new development and redevelopment
                      to provide sufficient parking. In determining what
                      constitutes sufficient parking, the City may take into
                      consideration: 1) the overall effectiveness of the circulation
                      system as a whole (i.e., pedestrians, bicyclists, motorized
                      vehicles, etc.); 2) the particular needs of a specific location
                      and/or project, and 3) the need for increased densities and
                      mixed-use development intended to aid in the reduction of
                      personal vehicle use and the corresponding reduction in air
                      pollution, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions,
                      and other environmental effects.
                      Why is this important?
                      Adequate parking is essential for both residents and visitors
                      and to the economic viability of commercial establishments
                      within a community. However, concentrated parking areas
                      can create substantial environmental impacts including, but
                      not limited to, hot-spots and increased stormwater run-off
                      and pollution. Parking lots can also interfere with pedestrian
                      and bicycle circulation. Balancing demand with these other

                      Policy C-9.3: Require new development and redevelopment
                      to provide connections to existing and proposed bicycle
                      routes, where appropriate.
                      Policy C-9.4: Encourage existing businesses and new
                      development or redevelopment projects to promote
                      bicycling and provide bike rack facilities, personal lockers,
                      and shower rooms.
                      Policy C-9.5: Encourage bicycling through education and
                      promotion programs in conjunction with the local school
                      districts.
                      Policy C-9.6: Keep abreast of bicycle facility innovations in
                      other cities and regions, and seek to incorporate these into
                      the bicycle network.
                      Why is this important?
                      Bicycling provides a very viable alternative to most in-town
                      trips that are typically taken by car, if the necessary
                      infrastructure to provide for cyclist safety is in place.
                      Bicycling offers many benefits to both the community and
                      the individual cyclist.     Bicycling is a non-polluting and
                      sustainable form of transportation that with greater use can
                      help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the city’s carbon
                      footprint. Also, it serves as a form of physical activity,
                      resulting in health benefits for the cyclist.

                      A.      Introduction
                      The Safety Element establishes goals and policies that work
                      to protect the community from risks of injury, loss of life
                      and property, and environmental damage associated with
                      natural and manmade hazards such as wildfires, geologic and
                      seismic hazards, flooding, hazardous materials, military
                      installations, and brownfields. It includes mapping of known
                      seismic and geologic hazards, along with areas subject to
                      flooding and fire risk. This element also includes methods to
                      reduce criminal behavior through environmental design and
                      response objectives related to police and fire operations and
                      emergency services. Although it is not possible to prevent
                      or mitigate all hazards and safety issues, their destructive
                      effects can be reduced to acceptable levels or avoided
                      through careful planning.

                      HAZARD MITIGATION PLANNING
                      The Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 requires all local
                      governments to create a disaster plan in order to qualify for
                      funding for hazard mitigation planning projects. The County
                      of San Diego’s Multi-Jurisdiction Hazard Mitigation Plan (Final
                      Draft 2010) includes all of the cities in the County, as well
                      as unincorporated areas. Hazard Mitigation Plans must be
                      updated every five years. The County of San Diego Hazard
                      Mitigation Plan is anticipated to be adopted by the Federal
                      Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 2010. The
                      Hazard Mitigation Plan addresses:
                      •   Earthquake;
                      •   Liquefaction;
                      •   Landslide;

                                    Earthquake
                                    An earthquake is a sudden motion or trembling that is
                                    caused by a release of strain accumulated within or along
                                    the edge of the Earth's tectonic plates. Common effects of
                                    earthquakes are ground motion and shaking, surface fault
                                    ruptures, and ground failure. Earthquakes also can trigger
                                    many secondary effects, such as landslides and rock falls,
                                    urban fires, building collapse, water tank or dam failures,
                                    disruption of essential facilities and systems (water, sewer,
                                    gas, electricity, transportation, and communications), and
                                    hazardous materials release1.
                                    There are five faults located near the planning area. They
                                    are listed below, including the most probable maximum
                                    Richter scale magnitude earthquake that each might cause2:

                                    area. Although located near fault lines, the planning area
                                    lies within medium-low to low shake potential zones.
                                    A compounding factor to the risks associated with seismic
                                    events within the planning area is the prevalence of
                                    unreinforced masonry buildings.                       Unreinforced masonry
                                    buildings are primarily older structures, typically constructed
                                    prior to 1973. Approximately 63% of structures in National
                                    City were constructed prior to 1970, compared to 38% in
                                    San Diego County overall.4 Unreinforced masonry buildings,
                                    due their construction type and age, are at greater risk for
                                    damage or collapse during a seismic event5.
                                    Liquefaction
                                    Liquefaction is a phenomenon in which ground shaking
                                    triggered by an earthquake causes loose soils to lose
                                    strength and take on the consistency of a heavy liquid.
                                    When the soils supporting structures liquefy, bearing
                                    strength is lost, and structures collapse. Historically, seismic
                                    shaking levels in the San Diego region have not been
                                    sufficient to trigger liquefaction6.
                                    Figure S-2 displays the location and extent of areas with a
                                    risk of liquefaction within the planning area, based on
                                    probabilistic ground acceleration data from the USGS and a
                                    Scenario Earthquake Shake map for Rose Canyon from the
                                    California Integrated Seismic Network (CISN). National City
                                    has a low liquefaction risk. However, there are some soil
                                    types in the western portion of the planning area which can
                                    amplify the risk of liquefaction. Hydric soils, or soils that are
                                    often saturated or characteristic of wetlands, can increase
                                    the potential for liquefaction7. The planning area contains a
                                    few hydric soils, including CkA Chino silt loam saline, Rm
                                    Riverwash, Tf Tidal flats, and TuB Tujunga sand. However,
                                    according to the 2006 United States Department of
                                    Agriculture (USDA) Soil Survey, there are very few areas in
                                    the City that contain these soil types (See Figure S-3).
                                    Landslides
                                    Landslides occur when masses of rock, earth, or other
                                    material move down a slope. They are influenced by human
                                    activity such as mining and construction, and natural
                                    factors, such as rain and topography. Landslides frequently

                                    determined by steep slopes that have 25% or greater
                                    incline, soil type, and soil-slip susceptibility as defined by the
                                    United States Geological Survey (USGS)8.
                                    National City is not identified as an area where significant
                                    landslides have occurred in the past. It is a highly urbanized
                                    area with very few slopes exceeding a 25% grade.
                                    Figure S-4 displays landslide hazards. The risk of landslides is
                                    low within the planning area.
                                    FLOOD HAZARDS AND INUNDATION
                                    A flood occurs when excess water from snowmelt, rainfall,
                                    or storm surge accumulates and overflows onto a river’s
                                    bank or to adjacent floodplains. Floodplains are lowlands
                                    adjacent to rivers, lakes, and oceans that are subject to
                                    recurring floods. Several factors contribute to the severity
                                    of floods including rainfall intensity and duration9.
                                    Historical Flooding
                                    Due to the City’s close proximity to the Bay and its
                                    relatively flat topography, the City has experienced flood
                                    damage from historical flooding events. The Sweetwater
                                    River drainage area comprises approximately 219 square
                                    miles, and according to historical floodplain maps, consisted
                                    of a poorly defined channel in a very broad floodplain. In
                                    1968, Congress authorized the construction of the
                                    Sweetwater Flood Control Channel and the associated SR-54
                                    construction10. Circa 1976, the Army Corps of Engineers
                                    (ACOE) started building the Sweetwater Channelization
                                    project (including widening the channel and the construction
                                    of levees) to reduce the limits of the existing floodplain.
                                    The ACOE project was designed to convey the 500-year
                                    flood within the channel in order to considerably reduce the
                                    overflow of the Sweetwater River11. The project included
                                    the construction of levees on both the north and south
                                    sides of the channel, which extend from I-5 to I-805. The
                                    Sweetwater River Channel protects historically flood-prone
                                    areas in National City, Chula Vista, and the unincorporated
                                    area of San Diego County.

                                     Flood Hazard Areas
                                     The potential for flood hazards in the planning area generally
                                     exists along the entire bayfront, as well as the three major
                                     drainage basins: Sweetwater River, Paradise Creek, and Las
                                     Puleta Creek.
                                     To prepare and mitigate hazards from flooding, National City
                                     participates in the National Flood Insurance Program.
                                     Potential flood zones are identified on flood insurance rate
                                     maps (FIRMs) that are supplied by FEMA. The maps are
                                     based on hydrologic (the distribution of water on the
                                     surface) analysis, and hydraulic (the movement of water)
                                     analysis. Data used in preparing the FIRMs includes
                                     information on historical storm systems, tides, waves, beach
                                     profiles, topography, and drainage patterns.
                                     FEMA designates flood hazard areas in a 100-year flood
                                     category and a 500-year flood category. The 100-year
                                     flood zone indicates the flood elevation that has a one
                                     percent chance of being equaled or exceeded each year.
                                     The 500-year flood zone indicates that the flood elevation
                                     has a 0.2 percent chance of exceedance each year. Figures
                                     S-5-A and S-5-B, “Flood Hazard Zones,” identify the
                                     floodplain areas within the planning area, along with the
                                     locations of critical public facilities (e.g., fire stations, police
                                     stations, schools, and government buildings).
                                     Figure S-5-A illustrates the floodplain limits depicted on the
                                     1997 FIRM maps. The floodplain limits for the Sweetwater
                                     River and the lower portion of Paradise Creek reflect the
                                     limits, prior to the construction of the Army Corps of
                                     Engineers (ACOE) Sweetwater River Channelization project.
                                     These FIRM panels indicate substantial potential flooding
                                     along the Sweetwater River.
                                     The ACOE project reduced the floodplain width along the
                                     Sweetwater River through the construction of channel
                                     improvements and flood control levees12.                       The floodplain
                                     and levee protection zones illustrated on Figure S-5-B
                                     reflects the ACOE channelization improvements and
                                     represents the most up-to-date FEMA information available.

   A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) was processed in 1997 to update the flood hazard mapping with FEMA to show the
effect of the channelization project. At the time of the publication of this General Plan, FEMA is in the process of
updating the FIRM panels. Since the levees are over 10 years old, the levees will fall into FEMA’s Provisionally
Accredited Levee (PAL) program. The levees will be shown as “provisional” on future FIRM panels until the
documentation has been provided to FEMA indicating that the condition of the levees are adequate according to FEMA’s
requirements. The Cities of National City and Chula Vista are cooperating with the County of San Diego to recertify the
levees. If the documentation is not accepted by FEMA, the levees would not be certified, and the levee protection
zones on both sides of the Sweetwater River would revert to being within a special flood hazard area as shown on Figure
S-5-A.

Part Three: General Plan Elements – Safety
                                    In addition to the riverine flood-prone areas identified on the
                                    FEMA FIRM panels, the planning area also may experience
                                    flooding within low-lying coastal areas due to tidal surges
                                    and in scattered areas throughout the City along smaller
                                    tributaries.
                                    Dam Failure
                                    Dam failure can cause a significant amount of loss of life and
                                    structures due to flash flooding occurring soon after the
                                    initial break. Dam failure is usually the result of age, poor
                                    design, or structural damage caused by a major event, such
                                    as an earthquake or flood. Dam failures are considered low
                                    probability, high-loss events.
                                    Two major dam failures have been recorded in San Diego
                                    County. They both occurred as a result of the Hatfield Flood
                                    of 1916, which caused the failure of both the Sweetwater
                                    and Lower Otay Dams, resulting in 22 deaths and $4.5
                                    million in damages13.
                                    The three closest dams to National City are the:
                                    •    Sweetwater Dam (5.33 miles away);
                                    •    Bonita Long Canyon Dam (4 miles away); and
                                    •    Eastlake Dam (9.5 miles away).
                                    Figure S-6 illustrates the dam failure hazard for the planning
                                    area. As shown on the map, there are some parts of the
                                    planning area, primarily along the southern boundary, that
                                    would be subject to inundation if the Sweetwater Dam
                                    failed.
                                    Coastal Storms, Coastal Erosion, and Tsunamis
                                    Coastal storms, coastal erosion, and tsunamis are mapped
                                    and profiled as a group since many of the same factors and
                                    risks are involved. Coastal storms can cause increases in
                                    tidal elevations, wind speed, and erosion. Between 1950 and
                                    2005, there have been eight Proclaimed States of
                                    Emergency for weather/storms in San Diego County. In
                                    January and February of 1983, the strongest El Niño-driven
                                    coastal storms caused over $116 million in beach and
                                    coastal damage. Other coastal storms that caused notable
                                    damage occurred during the El Niño winters of 1977-1978,
                                    1997-1998, and 2003-200414.

                                    Coastal erosion is the gradual wearing away of coastal land
                                    and occurs when more sediment is lost along a particular
                                    shoreline than is redeposited by the water body. The risk of
                                    damage due to coastal erosion in National City is very low
                                    because there are no steep cliffs along the shoreline.
                                    Tsunamis are waves caused by fault disturbances along the
                                    ocean floor. They travel at very fast speeds until they reach
                                    the coastline, where their speed and wavelength decrease
                                    and their height increase greatly. The largest tsunami effect
                                    recorded in San Diego occurred on May 22, 1960, and had a
                                    maximum wave height of 2.1 feet. In this event, 80 meters
                                    of dock were destroyed and a barge sunk in Quivera Basin in
                                    Mission Bay. Damage does not necessarily occur in direct
                                    relationship to wave height. Other tsunamis have occurred in
                                    San Diego County with higher wave heights, but did not
                                    cause as much damage as the 1960 tsunami.
                                    National City is relatively well protected from coastal storms
                                    and erosion because of its position within the San Diego Bay
                                    behind Coronado Island and the Silver Strand, an isthmus
                                    that connects Coronado to the main land. The tsunami risk
                                    primarily occurs along most of the coast and the mouths of
                                    Paradise Creek and Sweetwater River, as shown on Figure S-
                                    7.
                                    FIRE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES
                                    Structure Fires and Wildfire
                                    There are several fire risk factors affecting the planning
                                    area. An increase in the population of minors and seniors has
                                    caused greater dependence issues, as seniors and children
                                    require more assistance when evacuating a structure; the
                                    high cost of housing has led to the overcrowding of homes;
                                    and approximately 85% of the homes in National City are
                                    over 30 years old, and approximately 43% are over 50
                                    years old15 - this is the age at which electrical and heating
                                    systems are more likely to cause fires, if not properly
                                    maintained16.
                                    The planning area has pockets of grass, brush, and trees in
                                    between developed areas and in the hills located to the
                                    east. The proximity of native vegetation and the climate of
                                    the region contribute to a moderate to high risk of wildfires

                                    in the planning area, as illustrated on Figure S-8.17. The
                                    greatest risk for wildfires is within the southeastern portion
                                    of the planning area, due to its proximity to the Sweetwater
                                    Regional Park and other areas with higher concentrations of
                                    native vegetation. The remaining portion of the planning
                                    area contains a moderate risk for wildfires.

                                    343 East 16th Street, and Station 31 is located at 2333
                                    Euclid Avenue in unincorporated Lincoln Acres. The
                                    administration office is located at 1243 National City
                                    Boulevard. The Fire Department is comprised of three
                                    divisions: Administration, Fire Prevention, and Operations,
                                    and maintains a staff of 49 personnel that provide fire
                                    control, emergency medical service, rescue, and fire

                                    The National City Fire Department contracts with a private
                                    ambulance provider, to provide emergency medical services
                                    to the planning area. Fire department personnel typically
                                    arrive on scene first and provide basic and advanced life
                                    support services. When paramedic ambulance crews arrive
                                    to provide advanced life support services, fire department
                                    personnel regularly assist.
                                    In most instances, depending on staffing levels, the Fire
                                    Department provides a paramedic on both Engine 34 and
                                    Engine 31, in addition to paramedic services on ambulances
                                    provided by the ambulance provider.
                                    EMERGENCY AND DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
                                    During fiscal year 2005-2006, the President directed the
                                    Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to
                                    develop and administer a National Incident Management
                                    System (NIMS), which provides a consistent nationwide
                                    approach for federal, state, local, and tribal governments to
                                    work together more effectively and efficiently to prevent,
                                    prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters. National
                                    City has integrated NIMS into the emergency management
                                    system by providing all Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
                                    staff members with appropriate NIMS training. EOC staff
                                    members may perform multiple functions when the EOC is
                                    activated. Each City Department has assigned functions and
                                    positions. The goal is to have three individuals trained for
                                    each EOC position to allow for sustained 24 hour, 7 day-a-
                                    week EOC operations. The EOC manages the Department
                                    Operations Centers (DOCs), when they are activated, who in
                                    turn manage the field operations. The EOC requests
                                    additional resources from the County EOC when necessary19.
                                    The City adopted an updated Emergency Operations Plan in
                                    May 2010. The plan describes a comprehensive emergency
                                    management system which provides for a planned response
                                    to disaster situations associated with natural disasters,
                                    technological incidents, and nuclear-related incidents. It
                                    describes the overall responsibilities for protecting life and
                                    property and assuring the overall well being of the
                                    population. The plan also identifies the sources of outside

                                      CRIME PREVENTION AND POLICE PROTECTION
                                      According to the National City Police Department, the total
                                      violent and property crime incidents in the City decreased in
                                      2009 from 2008 (see Table S-1, below).
                                      The National City Police Department considers gang activity
                                      to be one of the root causes of violent crime problems in
                                      National City. There are four gangs and approximately 650
                                      known gang members in National City21.

                                      Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) is a
                                      multi-disciplinary approach to reducing crime and increasing
                                      perceived safety. It seeks to dissuade offenders from
                                      committing crimes by manipulating the physical environment

                                       in which those crimes occur.22 The three most common
                                       built environment strategies applied in CPTED are natural
                                       surveillance, natural access control, and natural territorial
                                       reinforcement. Natural surveillance increases the perceived
                                       threat of apprehension to a criminal, who believes he can be
                                       seen. Natural surveillance can be implemented by designing
                                       sites in such a way as to maximize visibility and foster social
                                       interaction among legitimate users of both private and
                                       public space. Natural access control attempts to limit the
                                       opportunity for crime by taking steps to clearly differentiate
                                       between public space and private space. It is accomplished
                                       through the conscientious placement of entrances and exits,
                                       fencing, lighting and landscaping, as to limit access or
                                       control flow of ingress and egress to an area. Finally,
                                       territorial reinforcement promotes social control through a
                                       heightened definition of space and ownership. An
                                       environment designed to clearly delineate private space
                                       creates a sense of ownership. “Owners” typically have a
                                       vested interest and are more likely to challenge intruders.
                                       This also creates an environment where "strangers" or
                                       "intruders" stand out and are more easily identified.
                                       Police Protection
                                       The National City Police Department employs 92 officers
                                       and 43 professional staff members. The police station is
                                       located at 1200 National City Boulevard. The Department’s
                                       actual average response times are divided into five
                                       categories (see Table S-2).                    The Department seeks to
                                       maintain a response time of less than six minutes for Priority
                                       1 calls. Presently, this response time is being met.

                    Note: Priority-5 usually occurs when an officer makes his own stop and it is called
                    into dispatch for accountability purposes; therefore, it has a fast response time.

                             Policy S-2.9: Prohibit the construction of flood barriers
                             within the 100-year flood zone which would divert flood
                             water or increase flooding in other areas.
                             Policy S-2.10: Consult with other responsible agencies to
                             construct creek improvements necessary to protect public

                             Policy S-2.11: Establish cooperative working relationships
                             among responsible agencies (e.g., U.S. Army Corps of
                             Engineers, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, California Deprtment
                             of Water Resources) and support existing efforts to mitigate

                             Approximately 3,600 homes, 380 businesses, and 50
                             critical facilities in National City are located within either the
                             100-year or 500-year floodplain and are; therefore, at risk
                             for flooding. An additional 500 residential buildings, 180

                                    are at risk for inundation due to dam failure.30 Regulating
                                    development in areas at risk for flooding and inundation
                                    reduces potential damage and loss of life and property.
                                    Tsunami risk exists primarily along the city’s waterfront,
                                    most of which is under Port or Navy jurisdiction.
                                    Approximately, 1,300 people, five commercial buildings and
                                    five critical facilities are located within an area subject to
                                    tsunami risk, as illustrated on Figure S-5. A tsunami could
                                    potentially have deleterious effects on the maritime
                                    industry, which is concentrated in this area.

                                    Policy S-3.3: Consult with the Sweetwater Authority to
                                    upgrade water mains and install fire hydrants as necessary.
                                    Policy S-3.4: Maintain and enforce standards for weed and

                                    Policy S-4.1: Participate in regional planning efforts to
                                    ensure that quality emergency and pre-hospital medical care
                                    is available to National City residents.
                                    Policy S-4.2: Work towards achieving a standard response
                                    time for the first-due unit of arriving within seven minutes
                                    90% of the time from the receipt of a 911 emergency call
                                    for medical patients and/or small fires, and work towards
                                    achieving at least 14 personnel arriving within 11 minutes
                                    90% of the time from the receipt of a 911 emergency call
                                    for a multi-unit response.
                                    Policy S-4.3: Expand and maintain the existing National City
                                    Fire Department Paramedic Program to have at least one
                                    paramedic on the two fire engines and fire truck every day.
                                    Why is this important?
                                    Approximately 15,750 homes, 880 businesses, and 125
                                    critical facilities are at moderate to high risk from wildfire in
                                    National City, as illustrated on Figure S-931. San Diego
                                    County has experienced serious losses due to wildfires in the
                                    past, especially in 2003 and 2007, when multiple wildfires
                                    simultaneously burned through the county and resulted in
                                    the destruction of thousands of residential and commercial
                                    buildings. Fires also contribute to respiratory ailments, as
                                    they generate and disperse fine particulate matter, carbon
                                    monoxide, and other irritants. Due to the large proportion
                                    of older buildings in National City, there is a higher risk for
                                    structure fires. Reducing fire hazards, maintaining
                                    appropriate fire services, and providing fire prevention
                                    information will help to reduce the risk of loss from fires.
                                    In addition, the sooner a seriously injured or sick person
                                    receives help, the more likely he or she is to survive.
                                    Emergency medical personnel can mean the difference
                                    between life and death by offering several immediate
                                    medical services, depending on a patient's condition.
                                    Paramedics also monitor and care for a patient in the
                                    ambulance while transporting him or her to the hospital.

                      In the event that a crisis occurs, a prompt and effective
                      response from emergency personnel can reduce trauma,
                      bring order to chaos, and can be the determining factor

                      Why is this important?
                      Proper design and effective use of the built environment can
                      lead to a reduction in the incidence and fear of crime. Safe,
                      clean, and attractive neighborhoods promote bustling public
                      spaces. When places are active with people and provide
                      clear visibility into and out of public spaces, potential
                      offenders are less likely to commit crimes because of all the
                      “eyes-on-the-street.” Bad behavior is deterred due to the
                      higher risk of getting caught.

   irritating,                       psychological effects. Extreme levels of noise can cause pain
   objectionable,                    and hearing loss. In addition, continuous exposure to noise
   and/or disruptive                 pollution is associated with hypertension, increased blood

                                     identify and assess noise generation in the community in
                                     order to minimize problems from intrusive sound and to
                                     ensure that new development does not expose people to
                                     unacceptable noise levels.
                                     This element is also intended to abate other common

   to the public.                    There are several noise measurement scales that are used
                                     to describe noise in a particular location. These are listed in
                                     Table NN-1. The most basic noise measurement is the
                                     decibel (dB), which is a unit of measurement indicating the
                                     relative amplitude of sound. The zero on the decibel scale is
                                     based on the lowest sound level that the healthy,
                                     unimpaired human ear can detect. Sound levels in decibels
                                     are calculated on a logarithmic basis. Each 10 decibel

Part Three General Plan Elements – Noise and Nuisance
                             increase in sound level is perceived as approximately a
                             doubling of loudness over a fairly wide range of intensities.
                             There are several methods of characterizing sound. The
                             most common in California is the A-weighted sound level
                             (dBA). All sound levels in this element are A-weighted,
                             unless reported otherwise. This scale gives greater weight
                             to the frequencies of sound to which the human ear is the
                             most sensitive.
                             Because sound levels can vary considerably over a short
                             period of time, a method for describing these variations
                             must be utilized. Most commonly, environmental sounds are
                             described in terms of an average level that has the same
                             acoustical energy as the summation of all the time-varying
                             events. This energy-equivalent sound/noise descriptor is
                             called Leq. The most common averaging period is hourly, but
                             it can be of any duration. Statistical measures such as the
                             maximum (Lmax), median (L50), and minimum (Lmin) levels
                             are also used to quantify the time varying noise levels in the
                             community.
                             Since the sensitivity to noise increases during the evening
                             and at night due to excessive noise interfering with the
                             ability to sleep, 24-hour descriptors have been developed
                             that incorporate artificial noise penalties added to quiet-
                             time noise events. The Day/Night Average Sound Level, Ldn,
                             is a measure of the cumulative noise exposure in a
                             community, with a 10dB addition to nocturnal noise levels.

                             There are also several noise-generating land uses west of I-5
                             including Naval Base San Diego, industrial manufacturing,
                             commercial, and institutional uses. Noise generating
                             activities throughout this portion of the city include heavy
                             flow of trucks, industrial equipment, and operations at the

                                 day/night average noise level (Ldn). Along local streets, the
                                 hourly average noise levels during the peak hour and
                                 throughout much of the morning and afternoon are about
                                 equal to the Ldn.

                                 for the short-term noise measurements. Short-term
                                 measurements were made in concurrent time intervals with
                                 data being collected at nearby long-term measurement sites
                                 to provide for a direct comparison of the noise data and to
                                 estimate daily noise levels at the short-term sites.
                                 Measurements were made for a period of 10 minutes at a
                                 height of five feet above the ground and at least 10 feet
                                 from structures or barriers. Of the 22 short-term
                                 measurements, eight locations represented noise levels along
                                 arterial roadways and twelve represented noise levels along
                                 collector roadways. One short-term measurement represented
                                 noise levels along a lightly traveled neighborhood street and
                                 one short-term measurement represented noise levels along I-
                                 805. The short-term noise measurements provided a
                                 representative cross-section of the varied noise environments
                                 in National City. The results of the measurements indicate
                                 that traffic noise varies substantially depending on the
                                 presence or absence of soundwalls, topography, and shielding
                                 provided by buildings.

Part Three General Plan Elements – Noise and Nuisance
                                     RAILROADS
                                     The San Diego and Imperial Valley Railroad (SDIV) roughly
                                     parallels 1-5 along the western side of National City. The
                                     SDIV is a short-line railroad that carried more than 6,500 cars
                                     over its tracks in 2008, and provides a link between the Class
                                     I Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway and the
                                     Carrizo Gorge Railway (CZRY) in Mexico. The railroad is
                                     located in the westernmost portion of the City in a heavy
                                     commercial/industrial area.                  Trains are a source of
                                     intermittent, high noise levels and groundborne vibration. The
                                     highest noise levels resulting from trains occur in areas near
                                     “at-grade” rail crossings where trains are required to sound
                                     their warning whistles. Train warning whistles can generate
                                     noise levels of approximately 100 to 105 dBA at a distance
                                     of 50 feet. Groundborne vibration levels may exceed the
                                     Federal Transportation Administration’s vibration impact
                                     criteria (72 to 80 VdB depending on the frequency of events)
                                     and may affect sensitive land uses within approximately 100
                                     to 200 feet of the tracks.
                                     AIRCRAFT
                                     Aircraft using San Diego International Airport intermittently
                                     contribute to ambient noise levels in the city. San Diego
                                     International Airport is located approximately five to six miles
                                     northwest of National City and west of I-5, along the
                                     northermost portion of San Diego Bay. Military aircraft are
                                     also sources of intermittent noise over National City as the
                                     Naval Air Station North Island is located approximately three
                                     miles to the northwest on Coronado Island.
                                     San Diego International Airport averages about 609 aircraft
                                     operations per day.2 Approximately 82 percent of aircraft
                                     operations are commercial, nine percent are transient general
                                     aviation, nine percent are jet air taxi operations, and less than
                                     one percent is military operations. The airport sets noise-
                                     based curfew hours from 11:30 PM to 6:30 AM. The noise-
                                     based curfew prohibits departures within curfew hours while
                                     arrivals are permitted 24 hours per day.
                                     Aircraft noise in California is described in terms of the CNEL,
                                     which is approximately equivalent to the day/night average
                                     noise level (Ldn) but includes a 5 dB weighting factor for the
                                     evening hours (7:00 pm to 10:00 am).                          Existing noise

                      San Diego International Airport does not extend into National
                      City.
                      Aircraft operations to and from San Diego International
                      Airport and the Naval Air Station North Island generate
                      intermittent noise when passing over National City. Noise
                      generated by these flights, although audible and noticeable in
                      quiet areas above other ambient noise sources, is a minor
                      contributor to daily average noise levels in the City.
                      Intermittent aircraft noise also may be associated with the
                      operation of helipads. One helipad is located within the
                      planning area at Paradise Valley Hospital, 2400 E. 4th Street.
                      The helipad is operational 24 hours/day seven days/week for
                      passenger transport.
                      GENERAL/AUTOMOTIVE COMMERCIAL AND LIGHT INDUSTRIAL USES
                      Noise sources associated with service commercial uses, such
                      as automotive repair facilities, wrecking yards, tire installation
                      centers, car washes, transfer yards, and loading docks, are
                      found at various locations throughout National City. The noise
                      emissions of these types of uses are dependent on many
                      factors and are; therefore, difficult to quantify precisely.
                      Noise generated by these uses contributes to the ambient
                      noise environment in their immediate vicinity and should be
                      considered where either new noise-sensitive uses are
                      proposed nearby or where similar uses are proposed in
                      existing residential areas.

                      that are sensitive to the noise. Most frequently, new housing
                      is proposed along roadways where noise levels would exceed
                      60 dBA CNEL. In this instance, noise levels in exterior outdoor
                      activity areas or inside the new residences may exceed those
                      considered normally acceptable for their use. Other noise
                      sensitive uses, particularly institutional uses, are frequently
                      located along major roadways and interior noise levels may be
                      excessive. In the future, mixed-use developments can also
                      result in intra-project impacts where noises from a commercial

                             residential development. Also, noise-generating sources, such
                             as large commercial businesses with loading dock or light
                             industrial users, can cause noises during the daytime or the
                             nighttime that affect nearby neighbors.
                             Noise contours were projected for 2030 traffic conditions
                             based on development of the General Plan using the
                             SoundPLAN v7.0 model (Refer to Figure NN-3).
                             Reduction Strategies
                             Reduction strategies normally fall into three categories: (1)
                             choose not to locate a noise sensitive use or noise-generating
                             use where it could be affected by community noise; (2)
                             implement noise barriers or site planning to reduce noise in
                             outdoor activity areas; and (3) incorporate special noise
                             attenuating elements into the design of the new noise
                             sensitive    or    noise-generating   building.     Policies    are
                             recommended in the General Plan to avoid the foreseeable
                             noise problems and implement the noise reduction strategies.
                             E.      Noise Standards and Compatibility
                             Guidelines
                             The State of California’s noise insulation standards are
                             codified in the California Code of Regulations, Title 24,
                             Building Standards Administrative Code, Part 2, California
                             Building Code (see Sections 310.3, 445.2, and 1207). These
                             noise standards are applied to new construction for the
                             purpose of providing suitable interior noise environments. The
                             regulations specify that acoustical studies must be prepared
                             when multi-family housing is proposed near major
                             transportation noise sources, and where such noise sources
                             create an exterior noise level of 60 dBA CNEL or higher.
                             Acoustical studies that accompany building plans must
                             demonstrate that hotels, motels, dormitories, apartment
                             houses and dwellings other than detached single-family
                             dwellings have been designed to limit interior noise in
                             habitable rooms to acceptable noise levels. The acceptable
                             interior noise limit for new construction in habitable rooms is
                             45 dBA CNEL.

Part Three General Plan Elements – Noise and Nuisance
                             Land uses that generate significant noise should be separated
                             from sensitive receptors. To establish the compatibility of
                             various land uses with exterior noise levels, the City uses
                             Community Noise Equivalent Level, or CNEL, in its planning
                             guidelines. CNEL takes into account the heightened sensitivity
                             of persons to noise during evening and nighttime periods.
                             The Noise Compatibility Guidelines shown on Table NN-6 are
                             used for evaluating land use noise compatibility when
                             reviewing proposed land use development projects. A
                             “compatible” land use indicates that standard construction
                             methods will attenuate exterior noise to an acceptable indoor
                             noise level and people can carry out outdoor activities with
                             minimal noise interference. Evaluation of land use that falls
                             into the “conditionally compatible” noise environment should
                             have an acoustical study.       For land uses indicated as
                             “conditionally compatible,” structures must be capable of
                             attenuating exterior noise to the indoor noise level as shown
                             on Table NN-6. For land uses indicated as “incompatible,” new
                             construction should generally not be undertaken.

                             Why is this important?
                             The regulation of transportation and stationary noise sources
                             is important for the well-being of people, communities and
                             animals. Reducing transportation noise to acceptable levels is
                             critical to the siting of housing near public transit. Noise also
                             can impact local habitat in a natural setting by driving away
                             species that are part of the broader local ecosystem. Noise
                             can affect human health as it can cause stress, disrupt sleep
                             and other important activities, and cause health problems and

                       with State-adopted guidelines for acceptable noise levels
                       ensures that people in the city are protected from unwanted
                       and excessive noise and have the opportunity to live, work,

                       Why is this important?
                       Nuisances can range from simply annoying, such as an
                       unpleasant odor, to outright dangerous, such as overgrown
                       weeds and brush that fuel fires across property lines.
                       Nuisances such as abandoned buildings or accumulated junk
                       can depress property values within a neighborhood, and
                       widespread nuisances can deplete the moral of a community

                                       Paradise Marsh is part of the San Diego Bay National Wildlife
                                       Refuge (SDBNWR - Sweetwater Marsh Unit), which is
                                       managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The SDBNWR
                                       protects a rich diversity of endangered, threatened,
                                       migratory, and native species and their habitats in the midst
                                       of a highly urbanized coastal environment2. Paradise Marsh
                                       supports salt marsh, freshwater marsh, salt-pan, and
                                       channel and mud flat habitats, which are valuable and
                                       sensitive biological resources.3
                                       Bannister Marsh is located between I-5 and Hoover Avenue,
                                       south of West 30th Street. This area, characterized by
                                       Southern Coastal Salt Marsh, and has no public access4.
                                       Lovett Marsh lies between I-5 and National City Boulevard
                                       and between West 35th Street and Sea Vale Street.
                                       Located along the historic channel of the Sweetwater River,
                                       Lovett Marsh was restored to compensate for bay coverage
                                       and filling of the bay associated with the permanent
                                       berthing of the USS Midway aircraft carrier in San Diego Bay
                                       as the San Diego Aircraft Carrier Museum. The restored
                                       marsh consists of open water habitat created by a main
                                       marsh channel running across the site and three permanent
                                       tidally flushed basins as well as low, middle, and high marsh
                                       habitat. Marshlands and open water tidal ponds were
                                       created by the excavation of disturbed uplands along the
                                       channel edge to expand existing wetlands and create more
                                       open water habitat. The Lovett Marsh mitigation site will be
                                       maintained in perpetuity.                  Long-term maintenance will
                                       consist of trash removal, signage, fence repair, and invasive
                                       species removal. The Spring Valley Sewer Outfall pipeline
                                       easement traverses across the southern half of the site.
                                       The South Bay Salt Lands are part of the SDBNWR (South
                                       San Diego Bay Unit) and lie within the Unified Port of San
                                       Diego Planning District 9.                 The South Bay Salt Lands
                                       comprise the land and water areas at the extreme southerly
                                       end of San Diego Bay. The lands are generally comprised of
                                       wetlands, estuary, and salt ponds5. The salt ponds are
                                       currently in active salt production by a commercial solar salt
                                       operation, which is permitted to operate within the refuge.

Part Three: General Plan Elements – Open Space
                             BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
                             Although most of the planning area is fully developed with
                             residential, commercial, industrial, and military uses, various
                             natural areas are found scattered throughout the planning
                             area. However, the majority of these have been altered from
                             their original state, including the channelization of many
                             watercourses. Natural and/or undeveloped areas present
                             within the planning area consist mainly of canyons,
                             undeveloped slopes, several drainages, a portion of the
                             Sweetwater River, Paradise Marsh, and Paradise Creek.
                             Habitat types that exist within the planning area are
                             described below.
                             Urban/Developed and Disturbed Habitat
                             Most of the planning area is fully developed with
                             infrastructure, residences, businesses, offices, hospitals,
                             schools, parks, industrial areas, landscaping, and other urban
                             uses. All of these areas qualify as Urban/Developed (U/D)
                             habitat. Also included in this general category is Disturbed
                             Habitat (DH), which is mostly found within the planning area
                             in the form of undeveloped/vacant lots and other upland
                             areas that are unvegetated or support weedy, ruderal
                             vegetation. Areas of U/D and DH offer little to no biological
                             resource value, although some of the flat, unvegetated
                             areas of the planning area have the potential to support
                             seasonal wetlands or vernal pools.
                             Southern Coastal Salt Marsh
                             The planning area supports several areas of Southern
                             Coastal Salt Marsh (SCSM), ranging in condition from very
                             disturbed/degraded to very high value. This habitat-type is
                             restricted to the western portion of the planning area, in
                             creeks and estuaries that are closely connected to the San
                             Diego Bay.
                             The largest, most significant area of SCSM within the
                             planning area is Paradise Marsh. The next largest area of
                             SCSM is found in the old course of the Sweetwater River,
                             which is located along the planning area’s southern
                             boundary, to the south of West 35th Street, west of
                             National City Boulevard, and east of I-5. This habitat type
                             also occurs within a slice of the Sweetwater River located
                             east of Edgemere Drive and west of the junction of the I-
                             805 and the SR-54 freeways.

                      Part Three: General Plan Elements – Open Space and Agriculture
                       The eastern portion of Paradise Creek, beginning at Kimball
                       Park and extending west to where the creek is channelized
                       under I-5 at 24th Street, also supports SCSM. Additional
                       SCSM is present within a tributary to Paradise Marsh that is
                       located south of West 30th Street, west of Hoover Avenue,
                       and east of I-5.
                       Diegan Coastal Sage Scrub
                       Diegan Coastal Sage Scrub (DCSS) is found in several
                       discrete patches throughout the planning area. Several of
                       these patches appear to be restoration projects associated
                       with adjoining development. The remaining patches all
                       exhibit at least a minor degree of disturbance from edge
                       effects caused by the surrounding urbanization.
                       The largest, highest value area of DCSS is located at the
                       planning area’s northeastern corner, south of the
                       intersection of East Plaza Boulevard and Paradise Valley
                       Road, in association with a canyon that continues east into
                       the City of San Diego.        Additional patches of DCSS are
                       located on slopes along Paradise Marsh, within the Paradise
                       Creek Educational Park, along the western edge of the
                       National City Golf Course, and within several urban canyon
                       areas along the eastern boundary of the planning area.
                       Maritime Succulent Scrub
                       The planning area supports several areas dominated by
                       native vegetation that qualify as Maritime Succulent Scrub
                       (MSS). These are all remnant patches found on slopes that
                       were never graded during the development of the City.
                       Southern Arroyo Willow Riparian Forest
                       The planning area supports two areas of mostly undisturbed
                       Southern Arroyo Willow Riparian Forest (SAWRF). The
                       largest and most significant of these areas is found in the
                       portion of the Sweetwater River located at the southeastern
                       corner of the City, immediately to the west and south of
                       Plaza Bonita. The other patch of SAWRF is located south of
                       Sweetwater Road, west of Calmoor Street, and north and
                       east of Fuentes Court, in the form of a revegetation area for
                       the surrounding Bonita Creek residential development.
                       Freshwater Marsh
                       Mostly intact Freshwater Marsh (FWM) vegetation is also
                       found in two areas of the planning area. The portion of the
                       Sweetwater River that supports SAWRF also supports
City of National City                 3-153

Part Three: General Plan Elements – Open Space
                             adjoining areas of FWM. The second area of FWM is present
                             within a wetland restoration area for the Bella Bonita
                             residential development, located north of Sweetwater Road
                             and south and east of Via Romaya.
                             Disturbed Freshwater Wetland
                             The planning area supports several small areas of Disturbed
                             Freshwater Wetland (DFWW). This habitat-type is classified
                             as “Disturbed” due to its strong non-native element and the
                             fact that the subject watercourses have undergone
                             extensive human manipulation.
                             Native Grassland
                             A single, disturbed, very small patch of Native Grassland
                             (NG) is found at the eastern boundary of the City on a
                             north-facing slope that is located north of Baker Place,
                             northwest of the northern terminus of Calle Abajo, and
                             southwest of Ridgeway Drive.
                             Non-native Grassland
                             Many of the undeveloped portions of the planning area
                             qualify as Non-native Grassland (NNG). This habitat-type is
                             found in several urban canyons and vacant lots throughout
                             the City.
                             Open Water
                             Many of the drainages in the planning area have been
                             channelized over the course of the development of the City.
                             Watercourses that have been channelized in concrete and
                             are unvegetated but that support running or standing water
                             year-round qualify as Open Water (OW). These areas may be
                             salt, brackish, or freshwater, depending on their proximity to
                             the San Diego Bay. Other larger areas of OW support aquatic
                             vegetation and wildlife. The most significant area of this
                             habitat-type is found within portions of the Sweetwater
                             River and the 7th Street Channel. All of the areas of SCSM
                             discussed above in the SCSM section also support OW
                             components.
                             Bay
                             The planning area extends into the San Diego Bay for
                             approximately 1,600 to 3,600 feet. This portion qualifies as
                             supporting Bay habitat, which consists of open salt water
                             habitat supporting marine species beneath the surface of
                             the bay.

                                   The Stein Family Farm, located at 1808 F Avenue, is
                                   operated by the National City Living History Farm Preserve,

                                   Current efforts on the property are designed with the view
                                   of continuing to interpret the Stein family’s life (1880s –
                                   1950s), but focusing on the rural period 1900 - 1920. In a

                                    Park, Sweetwater Heights Park, and Butterfly Park.
                                    Neighborhood Parks (five to 10 acres). Parks which should
                                    be accessible by biking or walking to surrounding residents.
                                    A neighborhood park permits all of the uses allowed in mini-

                                    larger in scale than neighborhood parks and serve a broader
                                    purpose. Community parks focus on community recreation,
                                    including multi-purpose sports fields, and preserving unique
                                    landscapes and open spaces. Community parks permit all of

                                    pools. Kimball, El Toyon, and Las Palmas Parks are
                                    considered to be community parks.

                                    The City has identified service-area radii for parks, based on

                                      Parks
                                      National City has six public parks, one public plaza, and a
                                      nine-hole public golf course, under its jurisdiction. Pepper
                                      Park and the adjacent boat launch/aquatic center, operated
                                      by the Unified Port District, along with a portion of the
                                      County’s Sweetwater Regional Park, also lie within the City
                                      limits, but are not under the City’s jurisdiction. In sum, there
                                      are approximately 119 acres of parkland (excluding the golf
                                      course) located within the city limits10. This equates to 1.9
                                      acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. One additional park,
                                      Lincoln Acres County Park, lies outside the city limits, but

BACK SIDE OF FIGUR
                                     Part Three: General Plan Elements – Open Space and Agriculture
                                       There are two California Recreational Trails that will run
                                       within close proximity to National City: the California Coastal
                                       Trail and the California Riding and Hiking Trail14,15.
                                       The California Riding and Hiking Trail (CRHT) will connect to
                                       National City via the Sweetwater Loop and River Trail. In
                                       1945, The California Riding and Hiking Trails Act was
                                       adopted by the State Legislature identifying a State Loop
                                       Trail that is to extend from Mexico to Oregon. The CRHT,
                                       which is still under construction, will serve as the backbone
                                       to the regional trails system in San Diego County16. It will
                                       connect National City to other state and regional trails, such
                                       as the Pacific Crest Trail.
                                       The California Coastal Trail runs adjacent to I-5, through
                                       National City and is accessible to its residents17.
                                       CREEK AND COASTAL ACCESS
                                       The majority of natural creeks that once flowed freely
                                       through National City were channelized during the
                                       urbanization and industrialization of the city18. Public access
                                       for creeks is now limited to an unchannelized section of Las
                                       Palmas Creek within the National City Golf Course and
                                       Paradise Creek Park, which contains an unchannelized
                                       section of Paradise Creek.
                                       Coastal access for the public is restricted in sections of the
                                       coastal zone that are controlled by the U.S. Navy, which
                                       encompasses approximately two-thirds of National City’s
                                       bayfront19. The remaining bayfront is controlled by the San
                                       Diego Unified Port District and mainly has large scale marine
                                       industrial land uses, which also limit public access20. Pepper
                                       Park (at the foot of Tidelands Avenue) and the Pier 32
                                       Marina (at the foot of Bay Marina Drive) are under the
                                       jurisdiction of the San Diego Unified Port District. Public
                                       access, both pedestrian and boating, to the San Diego Bay
                                       is provided at these locations.

Part Three: General Plan Elements – Open Space
                                      CULTURAL AND PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES
   Cultural Resources                 A record search conducted at the South Coast Information
   –Building, sites,
                                      Center (SCIC) at San Diego State University has identified
   structures, or
   objects that have                  30 cultural resources within National City, nine of which are
   historical,                        prehistoric and 21 of which are historical resources. Of the
   architectural,                     21 historical resources, 19 are standing structures including
   archaeological,                    17 on Naval Station San Diego and two railroads. The
   cultural, or
   scientific                         historic properties list from the SCIC listed 99 historic
   importance.                        structures including those already on the National Register
                                      and also 52 structures on Naval Station San Diego.
                                      However, most of the buildings on this list have not been
                                      evaluated for their potential eligibility to be listed on the
                                      California Register or the National Register.
                                      Archaeological Resources
                                      The archaeology of San Diego County was a topic of little
                                      investigation prior to the 1930s. Because most of National
                                      City was developed prior to this period, much of the
                                      information relating to the prehistoric past of National City
                                      has been destroyed or remains buried under current
                                      development. Therefore, the record search reflects a
                                      relatively low number of prehistoric sites, especially when
                                      considering the coastal location of National City. 21
                                      The earliest dates for human occupation within National City
                                      date to the Archaic Period (8,000 to 1,500 years ago).
                                      Almost all of the nine prehistoric sites that have been
                                      recorded in the planning area are shell midden sites. These
                                      sites are found along the watercourses such as Chollas
                                      Creek and Sweetwater River as they approach the coast.
                                      The largest site is an Archaic village site known as Las
                                      Choyas, originally recorded by Malcolm Rogers in the 1930s
                                      and known to have existed as late as AD 1790 on what is
                                      now the 32nd Street Naval Station at the mouth of Chollas
                                      Creek.
                                      Late Prehistoric Period (1,500 to 250 years ago) sites are
                                      also present in National City. During this time period,
                                      National City was part of the territory of the Kumeyaay.
                                      The Kumeyaay and their relatives’ territory extended from
                                      the coast just south of Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico to
                                      as far north as Agua Hedionda in present day Carlsbad,
                                      California. Their territory extended eastward to the south
                                      part of the Salton Sea and into the Sand Hills in Imperial
                                      County. Possible prehistoric site types that would have
                                      been present in National City include habitation sites,

                       Historical Resources
                       The historic period began in National City with the arrival of
                       the Spanish in 1769, although the Spanish were known to
                       the Native Americans living here prior to the establishment
                       of a permanent Spanish settlement. Father Junipero Serra
                       would have had to pass through what is now National City
                       on his journey to San Diego (though no specific mention is
                       made of the area in the records of his travels). Shortly after
                       the establishment of the San Diego Presidio and Mission San
                       Diego de Alcala in present day Old Town San Diego, National
                       City became part of the grazing land referred to by the
                       friars as “La Purisima Concepcion”. In 1796, the land was
                       appropriated from the mission for use by the soldiers of the
                       Presidio San Diego for use as pasture land for cattle and
                       horses and was renamed El Rancho del Rey. The land
                       continued in this status, even after Mexican independence
                       from Spain was achieved in 1821, until it was granted to
                       Don Juan (John) Forster in 1845 as part of the 26,631
                       Rancho de la Nación. The land was granted by Forster’s
                       brother-in-law Pío Pico who was governor of the state at the
                       time. Fortunately for Forster, the annexation of the area
                       after the U.S.-Mexico War of 1846-48 did not affect his title
                       to the land and he retained possession until 1856 when the
                       Rancho was sold to San Francisco bankers Francois Louis
                       Pioche and J.B. Bayerque.
                       In 1868, the Rancho was purchased by the Kimball Brothers,
                       Frank, Warren and Levi, who would change the rancho into
                       what we now call National City. The Kimball’s bought the
                       rancho for $30,000 and almost immediately began plans to
                       develop the land with the belief that National City could
                       exceed the growth and regional importance of San Diego. In
                       1881, the Santa Fe Railroad agreed to start a new line (the
                       California Southern) in National City, in exchange for 10,000
                       acres and additional land worth $100,000. The California
                       Southern would run north to Oceanside before turning east
                       and continuing through Riverside County before eventually
                       reaching Barstow in San Bernardino County in 1885. With
                       the development of the railroad, National City was on its
                       way and was incorporated in 1887.
                       Known historical resources in National City date from the
                       establishment of the town in 1868 although it is possible
                       that remnants from the rancho period may exist.

Part Three: General Plan Elements – Open Space
                                     There are four structures located within the City that have
                                     been placed on the National Register of Historic Places
                                     (NRHP) and are also considered significant by the State of
                                     California: the Granger Music Hall (ca. 1896), Brick Row (ca.
                                     1887 railroad housing), the Santa Fe Rail Depot (1882), and
                                     St. Matthew’s Episcopal Church (1872), as illustrated on
                                     Figure OS-5.
                                     Furthermore, two resources have been recognized by the
                                     State as historically significant. In addition to being on the
                                     NRHP, the Santa Fe Rail Depot is a California Historical
                                     Landmark (#1023). The State of California also recognizes
                                     the Paradise Valley Hospital House (1880s) as a California
                                     Point of Historical Interest. 22
                                     In addition to the resources identified by the nation and the
                                     state, the City has designated 27 homes as locally
                                     significant.         These locally significant resources were
                                     identified        through   a    Historic   Properties      survey,
                                     commissioned by the City in 1994. The survey identified 19
                                     structures potentially eligible for the National Register, 123
                                     locally significant resources, and another 32 that were
                                     deemed to be potentially locally significant. An additional
                                     1,183 were identified as historic based on their stylistic age
                                     only.
                                     The passage of time has only increased the potential
                                     eligibility for some of these resources. It is also possible
                                     that in the past fifteen years some of the resources
                                     identified in the survey have been redeveloped or
                                     demolished.
                                     C.        Open Space Plan
                                     In addition to the park and recreational facilities identified in
                                     the Existing Setting, the City plans to provide new
                                     recreational opportunities. The City has identified six
                                     potential street conversions that could result in the closure
                                     (or partial closure) of a redundant street for the purpose of
                                     creating a new mini park, plaza, or community garden. The
                                     City also plans to create new recreational trails along
                                     Paradise Creek, I-805, and the National City Golf Course that
                                     will serve as both a pedestrian connection and provide a
                                     new recreational opportunity for residents.                Another
                                     potential opportunity for increasing park space in National
                                     City is by converting the National City Golf Course into a
                                     public park.

                             Why is this Important?
                             Urban agriculture and community gardens can serve multiple
                             purposes within a community. First, community gardens can
                             contribute to better health within a community, as they can
                             increase access to healthy foods by lower-income residents,

                             community interaction by encouraging neighbors to
                             cooperate in the cultivation of fresh food and flowers and

                                    community stewardship and teaching the importance of
                                    environmental sustainability.
                                    Urban agriculture may assist in the revitalization of
                                    abandoned or underutilized land and development of
                                    community gardens may help reduce a community’s carbon-
                                    footprint. Locally produced food requires less packaging,
                                    preservation, and transportation than foods not grown in
                                    the community, thus reducing the consumption of natural
                                    resources, energy use, and the emission of greenhouse
                                    gases23. Additionally, community gardens can help reduce
                                    the urban heat island effect, lessen urban run-off, and
                                    improve air quality. Sustainable food systems, especially
                                    the incorporation of urban farming, can improve public

                                     and vehicular safety, while maintaining aesthetic value.
                                     ☼Policy      OS-4.6: Promote the importance and benefits of
                                     trees and of the urban forest through awareness,
                                     partnerships, and efforts that educate residents on the best
                                     methods of planting and maintaining trees.
                                     Why is this Important?
                                     Urban forests provide a number of social and environmental
                                     benefits, both tangible and intangible. A healthy urban
                                     forest can improve local air quality and human health, as
                                     trees absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants and
                                     replenish oxygen. Extensive tree canopies reduce the urban
                                     heat island effect, thereby (1) reducing the amount of heat
                                     absorbed and the need for air conditioning thus reducing
                                     energy use and the emission of greenhouse gases, and (2)
                                     making streets and sidewalks more pleasant places to walk
                                     and extending the life of street paving. Also, a healthy
                                     urban forest can reduce stormwater runoff and assist in
                                     improving water quality.
                                     Other benefits of urban forests to city residents include:
                                     increased traffic safety through the use of street trees;
                                     economic development through an improved aesthetic
                                     image of the city; increased property values; and improved
                                     overall quality of life25.

                             Parks and other recreational facilities can improve the
                             quality of life for residents of National City by providing an
                             outlet to strengthen the body and assist in maintaining
                             physical well-being. Additionally, parks provide mental and
                             social benefits, including visual relief from urban
                             development, passive recreational opportunities that refresh
                             the mind and provide opportunities for social interaction,
                             and healthy activities for youth. Park lands also benefit the
                             environment by providing space for urban runoff to
                             percolate into the soil, while also serving to decrease the
                             effects of urban heat islands.

                             Why is this Important?
                             Providing safe and convenient access to the city’s water
                             resources, including the bayfront and creeks, increases the
                             potential for passive and active recreation opportunities and
                             enjoyment of these resources by residents.

                       a focus on linking to existing pathways.
                       Why is this Important?
                       Recreational trails can provide additional recreational
                       opportunities within the community. The highly developed
                       nature of National City poses significant constraints on the
                       development of new park and recreational facilities.
                       Recreational trails due to their linear nature potentially could
                       be integrated into the urban fabric where park facilities are
                       unviable, i.e., utility corridors, watercourses, and via
                       easements through developed sites.

                             Why is this Important?
                             Cultural resources reflect the history of a community, from
                             descendants of the earliest Native Americans to later
                             explorers, settlers, and immigrants.         Identification and
                             protection of these resources by the City is important to
                             maintaining a strong connection to the community’s
                             heritage, thus enhancing a “sense of place” within
                             neighborhoods and the community as a whole.

                                       time of drafting this General Plan, current climate models do

                                       have to come at the local level. Since many of the major
                                       sources of GHG emissions are directly or indirectly controlled
                                       through local policies, local governments have a strong role
                                       to play in reducing GHG emissions within their boundaries.

                                       A number of recent California State legislative acts have
                                       significant implications for local government conservation
                                       and sustainability planning:
                                       Executive Order S-3-05 (2005) sets several GHG emission
                                       reduction targets, including reducing GHG emissions to
                                       1990 levels by 2020 and to 80% below 1990 levels by
                                       2050. The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32),

                                       officials from local jurisdictions. The statute calls on the Air
                                       Resources Board (ARB) to establish regional transportation-
                                       related GHG targets and requires the MPO to develop a

                                       of the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The RTP will

                                       will move the region towards its GHG target. The statute
                                       stipulates that transportation investments must be
                                       consistent with the SCS and provides CEQA streamlining for

                                       National City has taken the first step in reducing its carbon
                                       footprint by working with Local Governments for
                                       Sustainability (ICLEI) to inventory GHG emissions in the city.

                                       National City's per capita CO2e emissions, at 9.6 metric
                                       tons per year, are quite low compared to other communities
                                       in the state and country. Most communities in the state
                                       have per capita emissions ranging from 6 to 20 metric tons
                                       per year, and communities in other states tend to have even
                                       higher per capita emissions levels. National City's low per
                                       capita emissions can be attributed to the mild climate
                                       (which minimizes heating and air conditioning), proximity to
                                       downtown San Diego and other employment centers in the
                                       region (which minimizes trip making), and the relatively low
                                       household income of the city's residents (which minimizes

                                   multi-year        partnership        with      the    California Energy
                                   Commission. A major focus of the strategy is to identify
                                   policy measures that could help SANDAG GHG emissions
                                   from passenger cars and light-duty trucks and comply with
                                   SB 375 in the 2050 RTP update (to be adopted in 2011).
                                   The CAS also will identify available policy measures to help
                                   the region integrate climate change considerations into
                                   existing planning processes affecting our transportation
                                   system, land use patterns, building stock, and energy
                                   infrastructure.8
                                   As a result of the completion of the City’s GHG Emissions
                                   Inventory in 2009, the City has implemented several
                                   strategies to reduce its energy use and associated
                                   emissions and is planning to advance its efforts in the
                                   coming months. For example, the Public Works Department
                                   has instituted changes in managing both its fleet and its
                                   facilities that have reduced emissions.

                                   Demand
                                   National City receives its water from the Sweetwater
                                   Authority (SWA), a member agency of the San Diego
                                   County Water Authority. SWA, which is a publicly-owned
                                   water agency, provides water service to approximately
                                   186,907 people in National City, Bonita, and the western
                                   and central portions of Chula Vista9. In 2007, SWA updated
                                   its Master Plan. The Master Plan anticipates an increase in
                                   the projected 2020 water demand. SWA estimates that
                                   National City will grow at a faster rate in the coming years
                                   due to densification of land use within the plan area. The

                                   Supply
                                   Drought is a continual problem in the Southern California
                                   region, so a major focus for all water purveyors is supplying
                                   clean, fresh water. Unlike other purveyors in the region,
                                   70% of its potable water distributed by SWA comes from
                                   local supplies, including the Sweetwater River Watershed,
                                   Sweetwater River, the Sweetwater Alluvium and San Diego
                                   Groundwater Formation. SWA owns and operates Loveland
                                   Reservoir, Sweetwater Reservoir, deep freshwater wells, and
                                   brackish water wells. All of this water is treated at the
                                   Robert A. Perdue Water Treatment Plant in Spring Valley and
                                   the Richard A. Reynolds Groundwater Desalination Facility in
                                   Chula Vista prior to distribution to consumers.
                                   The remainder of the water supply from SWA, about 30%, is
                                   obtained from imported water sources, purchased from the
                                   San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA). It is
                                   transported by massive aqueduct systems from the
                                   Colorado River, 242 miles away, or the State Water Project,
                                   which carries water about 700 miles from the Sierra-Nevada
                                   Mountains through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta.
                                   In emergency conditions, SWA customers can receive 100
                                   percent of their water from this system. 11
                                   To meet future demand, SWA is pursuing the use of
                                   desalinization and, to a lesser extent, water recycling, as
                                   groundwater resources and imported sources become
                                   increasingly strained. The facilities which will provide the
                                   source of supply for National City through 2030 include the
                                   Perdue Plant, the Desalination Facility, and the National City
                                   Wells. The Perdue Plant has a maximum capacity is 30 mgd.
                                   SWA built the Desalination (Desal) Facility to produce 4 mgd
                                   with a future expansion to 8 mgd. The current plan is to
                                   expand the capacity to 10 mgd using newly available
                                   membrane technology with a higher output. Also, the
                                   capacity of the National City Wells increased to
                                   approximately 2 mgd from the previous 1.6 mgd. Overall,
                                   the water supply available in National City is projected to
                                   increase from the current 36 mgd (30-Perdue, 2-N.C. Wells,
                                   and 4-Desal) to 42 mgd, as a result of these projects (30-

                                         usage can be attributed to the mild climate as compared to

                                     The City wastewater division maintains approximately 97
                                     miles of sanitary sewer main, which consists mostly of six
                                     and eight inch lines and four pump stations19. The system is
                                     illustrated on Figure CS-2.
                                     Wastewater collected within National City is treated by the
                                     City of San Diego at the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment
                                     Plant (PLWTP) located at 1902 Gatchell Road. The PLWTP
                                     treats approximately 175 million gallons of wastewater per
                                     day generated in a 450 square mile area by more than 2.2
                                     million residents. Located on a 40 acre site on the bluffs of
                                     Point Loma, the plant has a treatment capacity of 240 mgd.
                                     Treated effluent is discharged to the ocean through the 4.5
                                     mile long Ocean Outfall off Point Loma20.
                                     On May 2, 2006, the State Water Resources Control Board
                                     (SWRCB) adopted Order No. 2006-0003, a General Waste
                                     Discharge Requirement (WDR) for all publicly owned sanitary
                                     sewer collection systems in California with more than one
                                     mile of sewer pipe. The goal of Order No. 2006-0003 is to
                                     provide a consistent statewide approach for reducing
                                     Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSOs). The Order requires all
                                     sewer system operators to develop a Sewer System
                                     Management Plan (SSMP).
                                     National City has prepared a SSMP (April 2009), which
                                     serves as a guide for improvements to and expansion of the
                                     City’s sewer system. It also establishes flow rates and
                                     identifies potential problem areas. The SSMP reported an
                                     Existing Average Dry Weather Flow of 4.22 million gallons
                                     per day, which is anticipated to increase by 56%, reaching
                                     6.57 mgd by 2029. Current pipes and infrastructure are
                                     not large enough to accommodate projected growth.

                                     The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has the
                                     sole authority to regulate privately-owned public utilities in

                                       The primary public utility in the region is San Diego Gas and
                                       Electric (SDG&E). SDG&E, operated by Sempra Energy, is an
                                       investor-owner public utility, which provides energy service
                                       to 3.3 million consumers through 1.3 million electric meters
                                       and more than 800,000 natural gas meters in San Diego and
                                       southern Orange counties21. SDG&E’s service area spans
                                       4,100 square miles. The utility delivers both natural gas
                                       and electricity throughout National City.
                                       Natural Gas
                                       Natural gas is delivered to customers in the city via a
                                       network of gas pipelines that runs throughout the county.
                                       Natural gas is considered a “cleaner” fuel, as it emits less

                                       energy generation by SDG&E is expected to increase at an
                                       annual average rate of 0.7 percent from 2008 to 203024.
                                       In the coming years, sources of electricity are expected to
                                       become more diverse as solar panels and wind farms begin
                                       to provide more household power.
                                       Renewable Energy/Energy Conservation
                                       In 2009, SDG&E provided 10.5% of their retail electricity
                                       sales from renewable power.25 National City has limited
                                       control over natural gas or electricity delivery in the city.
                                       However, the City can attempt to reduce energy
                                       consumption within City limits through implementing
                                       conservation education programs.
                                       DRAINAGE AND WATER QUALITY

  Drainage – The
  natural or artificial                National City lies within parts of two watersheds: the
  removal of surface
  or sub-surface                       Sweetwater and the Pueblo. These two watersheds, along
  water from an                        with the Otay watershed, combine to form the San Diego
  area.                                Bay Watershed Management Area (WMA)26. The San Diego
                                       Bay WMA encompasses a 415 square mile area that extends
                                       easterly from the San Diego Bay for more than 50 miles to
                                       the Laguna Mountains. National City comprises only 1.53%
                                       of the WMA27.
                                       A city-wide drainage study was completed in December
                                       1989.28 The study describes the hydrologic and hydraulic
                                       characteristics of the city and indicates areas within the city
                                       that require improved drainage facilities to better
                                       accommodate runoff. Figure CS-3 identifies the existing
                                       drainage infrastructure for National City.

Part Three: General Plan Elements – Conservation
                                     From a planning standpoint, the two most important
                                     considerations in regard to drainage infrastructure are: 1)
                                     ensuring adequate capacity to collect and carry stormwater
                                     and thereby avoid flooding, and 2) working to reduce
                                     pollutant loads in stormwater as part of regional efforts to
                                     improve water quality of surface waters. The flood
                                     protection aspects of stormwater control are addressed in
                                     the Safety Element of this General Plan. Water quality
                                     issues associated with stormwater are addressed below.
                                     Stormwater/Water Quality
                                     In urban areas, rain that falls on roofs or collects on paved
                                     areas and does not infiltrate the soil, is often referred to as
                                     “runoff.” Stormwater runoff consists of rainwater, plus
                                     anything the rain carries along with it. Stormwater runoff
                                     generally is carried through a system of gutters, pipes and
                                     culverts. As runoff flows down a gutter or culvert, trash,
                                     litter, silt, automotive chemicals (oils, grease, antifreeze and
                                     fine dust from tire wear), animal wastes, and many other
                                     contaminants it picks up are washed into the storm drain
                                     system, and ultimately into the San Diego Bay.
                                     The City wastewater division maintains approximately 45
                                     miles of closed stormwater collection systems.              Storm
                                     drains are designed to carry only stormwater and are not
                                     typically equipped with filters or cleaning systems.
                                     Therefore, polluted urban runoff moves directly into local
                                     flood control channels and eventually into the ocean. Many
                                     of the pollutants found in this runoff are toxic to fish,
                                     marine mammals, and other aquatic life.
                                     Urban water runoff is a significant issue for the San Diego
                                     Bay and the county at large. The City has adopted its own
                                     Standard Urban Stormwater Mitigation Plan (SUSMP) as
                                     required by the municipal storm water National Pollutant

   Diversion Rate –
   The percentage of                  Nearly every human activity leaves behind some kind of
   all waste materials                waste. Households create ordinary garbage, industrial and
   that is not                        manufacturing processes create solid and hazardous waste,
   processed in the
   traditional manner                 and construction activities leave behind large chunks of
   and is recycled,                   debris and inorganic materials. In 2006, U.S. residents,
   composted, or re-                  businesses, and institutions, produced more than 251 million

                                      pounds of waste per person per day. In addition, American
                                      industrial facilities generate and dispose of approximately
                                      7.6 billion tons of industrial solid waste each year.30
                                      Cities generally measure their progress on waste reduction
                                      and re-use with a measurement called the “diversion rate”.

                          the climate and strategies for adaptation.
                          Policy CS-2.4: Work with appropriate responsible and
                          regional agencies to track environmental indicators of
                          climate change, such as: sea level; minimum and maximum
                          temperature; precipitation; timing and volume of river flow;
                          river temperatures; sea surface temperatures; and diversity
                          and abundance of fish stocks and sea birds.
                          Why is this important?
                          Global warming is a significant threat world-wide that could
                          have potentially significant impacts at the local level
                          including increased flooding, reduced water supplies, greater
                          energy demands, and implications on human health and
                          natural resources. Many of the major sources of GHG
                          emissions are directly or indirectly controlled through local
                          policies; therefore, local governments have a strong role to
                          play in reducing GHG emissions within their boundaries.
                          WATER
                             ☼Goal   CS-3: Adequate water supplies to meet projected
                             demand with minimal reliance on imported water sources.

                             Why is this important?
                             Southern California has been experiencing unprecedented
                             drought over the past decade. As fresh water supplies
                             become increasingly scarce, partially as a result of
                             development within the jurisdiction, local communities need
                             to assist in conservation efforts and help preserve the
                             quality of local water sources in order to maintain a clean,
                             economical, and adequate water supply for city residents.
                             Also, inadequate water supplies and distribution systems
                             can serve as potential barriers to new development and
                             economic growth.

                          Development Proposals, through 2030.
                          Why is this important?
                          Wastewater collection and treatment capacity,                   if
                          inadequate, can serve as a substantial barrier to new
                          development and economic growth in the city.                 Also,
                          inadequate capacity can potentially result in system failures

Part Three: General Plan Elements – Health and Environmental Justice
                             Problems with environmental justice are often related to
                             procedural or geographic inequity. Procedural inequity
                             occurs when the planning process is not conducted in a
                             uniform way. An example of this would be conducting public
                             meetings at locations and/or times that make it difficult for
                             certain individuals or groups to participate in a worthwhile
                             fashion. Geographic inequity occurs when undesirable or
                             unhealthy land uses are concentrated within one part of a
                             city, creating a disproportionate burden on the residents in
                             that area. Geographic inequity also refers to a situation in
                             which desirable public amenities are not equitably
                             distributed, leaving portions of a city underserved.
                             The purpose of this Health and Environmental Justice
                             Element is to identify public health risks and environmental
                             justice concerns and improve living conditions to foster the
                             physical health and well-being of National City’s residents.
                             The hope is that the City’s commitment to preventative
                             health measures will become evident in decreases in the
                             occurrence of diabetes, asthma, heart disease, cancer, and
                             other physical and emotional ailments. Public health and
                             environmental justice are themes that are tied to all of the
                             General Plan elements, so it is important to cross-reference
                             other sections of this document for a complete picture of
                             National City’s efforts to improve health and equality.
                             The Health and Environmental Justice element is not a
                             state-mandated element. However, by including this element
                             in the General Plan, the City hopes to give prominence to
                             National City’s health and environmental justice priorities.
                             The authorization for this optional element is contained
                             within Section 65303 of the California Government Code,
                             which permits local jurisdictions to adopt additional
                             elements beyond the mandatory elements when they relate
                             to the physical development of the jurisdiction.

                             Most health statistics are not available at the planning area
                             level for this General Plan. The San Diego County Community
                             Health Statistics Unit mainly provides demographic and
                             health data at a regional level. National City is located within
                             the “South Region” of San Diego County, which also includes
                             the communities of Chula Vista, Coronado, South Bay, and
                             Sweetwater. Most of the health information within this
                             section applies to the South Region. However, where
                             available, statistics specific to National City’s 91950 zip

                                     Particulate matter (PM) is another pollutant of concern for
                                     San Diego County. Like ozone, PM is formed in the air by a

   dust particles.
                                     There are two categories of PM: PM10 particles, which are
                                     less than 10 micrometers in diameter and PM2.5 particles,
                                     which are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.
                                     Table HEJ-2 identifies data regarding PM measurements
                                     taken at the San Diego and Chula Vista monitoring stations
                                     from 2004 to 2008 for both PM10 and PM2.5. The highlighted
                                     cells identify the incidences in which standards were
                                     exceeded. According to CARB, most areas of California
                                     exceed the current state PM standards from a few to many
                                     times each year.
                                     Over the past two decades, air quality in San Diego County
                                     has improved significantly due to state and federal
                                     regulations controlling emissions from mobile sources of air
                                     pollution, such as vehicles, and local controls on emissions
                                     from industrial sources, such as factories and power plants,
                                     commercial sources, such as gas stations and dry cleaners,
                                     and residential sources, such as water heaters and furnaces.
                                     The APCD’s 2007 Air Quality Management Plan was
                                     designed to reduce ozone concentrations to below the level
                                     of the federal standard in 20099. The standard has not

                                    Regular physical activity is critically important for the health
                                    and well-being of people of all ages. Millions of Americans
                                    suffer from health problems that can be prevented or
                                    improved through regular exercise; these problems include:
                                    heart disease, obesity, diabetes, stress, and depression10.

                                     minutes at a time, can improve mood in the short term15.
                                     In addition to improving mental health, management of
                                     stress and depression is important to prevent serious
                                     physical health problems, such as heart disease. There are
                                     linkages between heart disease and the factors that often
                                     cause stress. There also are links between heart disease and
                                     depression. For instance, women who are depressed are
                                     twice as likely to develop heart disease as those who are
                                     not16.
                                     In 2007, the percentage of adults within the South Region
                                     who sought out professional help for a mental or emotional
                                     condition was lower than in San Diego County (14% in the
                                     South Region compared to 21% countywide)17. This does
                                     not necessarily indicate that there are fewer people in the
                                     South Region experiencing emotional distress. It is possible
                                     that people in the South Region are just less likely to obtain
                                     help from a counselor due to various economic, cultural, or
                                     access constraints.

                                     The availability of healthy food options, including fresh
                                     produce, at stores and farmers’ markets, may correlate with
                                     a higher consumption of fruits and vegetables, which in turn,
                                     can alleviate the prevalence of excess weight and obesity. A

                                     frequent those establishments18. Within National City, there
                                     are approximately twice as many fast food and convenience
                                     stores as there are general grocery and fruit and vegetable
                                     markets19.
                                     A major factor affecting access to healthy foods is an
                                     individual’s or family’s level of income. High calorie foods

Part Three: General Plan Elements – Health and Environmental Justice
                                      inflation, which partially explains why the highest rates of
                                     obesity continue to be observed in groups with the most
                                     limited economic means20. According to the US Census, in
                                     2000, 22% of National City’s population was living in
                                     poverty compared to 12% countywide.
                                     The county-administered Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
                                     Program (SNAP) seeks to provide assistance relative to food
                                     costs. According to the United States Department of
                                     Agriculture (USDA), the San Diego County participation rate
                                     in the SNAP ranks the lowest in the nation among urban
                                     centers. Of those eligible to receive SNAP benefits, only
                                     29% are doing so21. Although food stamp data are not
                                     available at the city level, based on County statistics, it is
                                     highly likely that there are far more people eligible to receive
                                     benefits in National City than who actually participate in the
                                     program. The San Diego County has attributed its low
                                     participation rates to a lack of awareness of food stamp
                                     eligibility rules and dissatisfaction with the eligibility process.
                                     Access to Health Care
                                     The availability of, and access to, health care facilities plays
                                     a large role in the preservation and maintenance of good
                                     public health and the prevention of morbidity and
                                     hospitalizations. National City contains six primary care
                                     facilities, five long term care facilities, and one hospital. All
                                     appear to be well served by vehicular routes and public
                                     transport (refer to Figure HEJ-3). Since having medical
                                     insurance influences whether or not one visits a medical
                                     professional, it is important to note the percentage of the
                                     population that is currently insured. In 2007, the percentage
                                     of currently insured adults aged 18-64 within the South
                                     Region was 83%, which mirrored that of the county15.
                                     Lead Based Paint
                                     Structures constructed prior to 1978 have the propensity
                                     to contain paint that has high levels of lead. Approximately
                                     85 percent of the residential dwelling units in the City were
                                                                          22
                                     constructed prior to 1980 . Lead-based paint is not a
                                     hazard when it is in good condition, but exposure to lead
                                     often occurs when paint is aging, peeling, or being removed.
                                     Lead exposure can cause nervous system and kidney

                                      children. Exposure to high levels of lead can lead to serious
                                      health problems such as seizures. Lead exposure also can be
                                      dangerous for adults, with impacts ranging from increased
                                      chances of illness during pregnancy to nerve disorders.
                                      Approximately 13,348 housing units were constructed prior
                                      to 1980 in National City. Approximately 589 of these units
                                      are at high risk for containing lead based paint hazards.
                                      Through grants and public/private participation a total of
                                      115 units have been mitigated from a lead based paint
                                      perspective as of 200823. As of the writing of this
                                      document, the City does not have a program to address
                                      residential lead paint issues. It is anticipated that a Housing
                                      Rehabilitation Program, slated to begin in 2010, will include
                                      a component to address residential lead based paint issues.

                                     Why is this important?
                                     Eating healthy foods reduces the risk of health problems
                                     such as diabetes, heart disease, excess weight, and obesity.
                                     In addition, a healthy diet is associated with better academic
                                     performance24. Despite these known benefits, as of 2003,
                                     only a quarter of the nation’s population followed the
                                     government recommended diet that calls for eating five
                                     servings of fruits and vegetables a day25. There are many
                                     factors that impede healthy eating such as a lack of grocery
                                     stores in the neighborhood, lack of transportation to get to
                                     a place that sells affordable, healthy foods, the expense of
                                     healthy foods compared to unhealthy foods, and limited
                                     time or knowledge to prepare healthy foods. The preceding
                                     goals and policies are aimed at encouraging healthy eating
                                     habits and eliminating the barriers that make it difficult for
                                     people to eat healthily.

                             Why is this important?
                             When residents have easy and safe access to a variety of
                             health care services, they have the opportunity to learn
                             about good health care practices, prevent illness, and lessen
                             the severity of illness.

                             the potential hazard, and request landlords/owners to make
                             the housing unit lead-safe.
                             Policy 7.3: Program the remediation of lead based paint in
                             city structures, prioritizing efforts in buildings where
                             children may be present.
                             Policy 7.4: Prioritize lead education         and    remediation
                             programs to benefit low-income families.
                             Why is this important?
                             As indicated in the Existing Setting section, approximately
                             13,348 housing units were constructed prior to 1980 in
                             National City and almost 600 of these units are at high risk
                             for containing lead based paint hazards. Although the City
                             has succeeded in mitigating 115 of these units as of 2008
                             through its Lead Hazard Control Program, there is still a long
                             way to go to rid National City of its lead based paint
                             hazards. Young children are at the highest risk of developing
                             health problems as a result of lead exposure, and low
                             income families often cannot afford to remove lead based
                             paint hazards from their homes. Therefore, directing

                             is an important step toward eliminating hazards.

                             Elementary School District. National City has aligned its
                             neighborhood boundaries with National School District’s
                             elementary school attendance boundaries so as to
                             emphasize schools as important focal points within
                             neighborhoods. These neighborhood boundaries are also

                             opportunities. The City’s Community Services Department is
                             a gateway for providing people of all ages with information
                             regarding a wide variety of topics such as family planning,

                             levels. All of these facilities offer convenient times that
                             tend to work around the schedule of the learner (i.e.
                             afternoon and night classes).
                             CHILD CARE
                             Quality child care and pre-school programs are extremely
                             important in shaping a child’s early development. In many
                             households with children, both parents are working, which
                             requires families to use before- and after-school care. For
                             families with children under five, daycare is provided through
                             private sector organizations or family day care facilities, or
                             public agencies, such as Head Start.
                             There are five Head Start centers in National City that serve
                             the role of a child care facility and of a pre-school,
                             depending on the age of the child. The Head Start centers
                             provide a computer in each classroom and allow time for the
                             children to use the computer. This activity helps introduce

                             WINGS is an after-school program for school-aged children
                             (until 6 pm) created through a partnership with the City and
                             the National School District. Over half of the District’s
                             children participate in academic and recreational activities in
                             this program.
                             The City’s Community Services Department offers two
                             programs: Kids Club and Tiny Tots. Kids Club is held at El
                             Toyon, Kimball, and Camacho Recreational Centers. This
                             after school service is free to children and allows children up
                             to 6th grade to participate. Under this program, 15 to 20
                             children participate in different sports throughout the school
                             year. Tiny Tots is held at El Toyon Recreational Center. This
                             program offers similar activities to preschoolers at an
                             affordable cost to National City residents. The two sessions
                             offered during the day provide service to approximately 40
                             children, ages four to five.
                             The National City Boy’s and Girl’s Club is another leader in
                             providing after school programs for children ages six
                             through 18. There are roughly 500 children that attend this
                             club during the school year. At the Boys & Girls Club,
                             children have access to games, activities, recreational uses,
                             academic help, and approximately 25 computers.
                             The YMCA Childcare Resource Service center is also available
                             to the entire community. It provides referrals to child care
                             service and information related to child care in both English
                             and Spanish.
                             In addition to these public child care programs, there are
                             approximately 25 private family dare care facilities within
                             National City.

                             Much of the information regarding what is occurring within
                             the City is provided through the City’s website. Although
                             children have access to computers at school, there can be
                             obstacles for children and adults to access computers at
                             home due to costs and a lack of computer literacy on behalf
                             of parents. For those who do not have a home computer or
                             internet access, there are several free wi-fi hotspots in
                             National City, including the National City Library and
                             Southwestern College. Several eateries also provide free or

                             Another way that information is disseminated to the
                             community is through Neighborhood Councils. As of the
                             writing of this General Plan, the seven neighborhood councils
                             are: Northside, Central, Granger, Eastside, Sweetwater
                             Heights, Old Town, and Olivewood. At the Neighborhood
                             Council meetings, community members can voice their
                             thoughts and discuss issues pertaining to their
                             neighborhood area. In addition, community members can ask
                             the City Council and City Departments (i.e. Police, Code
                             Enforcement,       and   Community     Services)     to   make
                             presentations about subjects of interest and relevance to
                             the group. Neighborhood Councils help to increase
                             community participation in community planning.
                             National City has also made an attempt to involve youth in
                             City decision-making processes. Two high school students
                             sit in on City Council meetings as youth representatives to
                             the community. At the meetings they can comment on
                             agenda and non-agenda items brought forth to City Council;
                             however, they cannot vote and are not allowed to attend
                             closed session meetings.          Sweetwater High School’s
                             principal selects the students from a pool of applicants after
                             having conducted a review of their academic merits and
                             leadership skills.
                             TELECOMMUNICATIONS
                             Planning for high-tech telecommunications infrastructure is a
                             relatively recent phenomenon. Providing and supporting
                             evolutions in electronic infrastructure including cellular
                             facilities, fiber optics systems, and wireless capability will
                             provide a vital framework for job and commercial growth,
                             educational opportunities, and quality of life issues in
                             National City. Cox Communications and AT&T provide cable,
                             phone, and cable internet to the residents of National City.

                                    Why is This Important?
                                    Schools are institutions that hold a community together,
                                    and the performance of an area's public schools is an
                                    important factor in successful economic development
                                    efforts. The quality of a community’s schools plays a
                                    significant role in one’s decision regarding whether or not to
                                    relocate or open a business in that community4.
                                    ACCESS TO HIGHER LEARNING
                                       Goal E-2: Greater opportunities for the City’s residents to
                                       attend colleges and universities.
                                    Policy E-2.1: Support the Compact for Success Program at
                                    San Diego State University that guarantees admission to
                                    qualifying Sweetwater Union High School District (SUHSD)
                                    seniors.
                                    Policy E-2.2: Assist the School District in disseminating
                                    information regarding financial aid, grants, and scholarship
                                    opportunities to high school students and the general public.
                                    Policy E-2.3: Encourage the School District to establish
                                    scholarships for National City students funded through
                                    charitable donations.
                                    Policy E-2.4: Encourage schools to raise community
                                    awareness that further education or vocational training
                                    beyond high school allows for a competitive advantage in
                                    the job market and can lead to higher salaries.
                                    Policy E-2.5: Encourage the School District to identify
                                    programs that urge at-risk children and youth to stay in
                                    school.
                                    Why is this Important?
                                    Educational training beyond a high school diploma opens up
                                    more job opportunities. However, too many individuals pass
                                    up the opportunity to attend college each year because
                                    they assume that they have neither the time nor the money

                             our society in general. Learning to use technology through
                             an electronic library catalog, practicing using various
                             software programs at libraries, or learning to search online
                             databases are of tremendous value, especially for those who
                             cannot afford computers or the connectivity costs
                             associated with the Internet.
                             CHILD CARE
                                Goal E-6: The availability of affordable, safe child care for
                                all segments of the community.
                             Policy E-6.1: Encourage child care centers near schools,
                             major transit hubs, and close to employment centers, to
                             reduce commute trips and improve air quality.
                             Policy E-6.2: Streamline application procedures for small and
                             large family day care centers.
                             Policy E-6.3: Assess child care demand created by new
                             development against available community resources to
                             determine child care facility needs.
                             Policy E-6.4: Encourage the use of public facilities for child
                             care services; including collaboration between schools and
                             parks, faith based institutions, community centers, and
                             senior centers.

                             of San Diego, and other relevant government and non-
                             governmental organizations to:
                                 • Encourage the expansion of child care options for
                                      low-income residents such as Head Start and Early
                                      Head Start.
                                 • Provide information to parents regarding how to
                                      choose quality care for their children.
                                 • Support adequate training for child caregivers.

Part Three: General Plan Elements – Education
                                     Why is this Important?
                                     Because many parents work or attend school, they rely on
                                     child care facilities to watch their children. High-quality child
                                     care and early education can build a strong foundation for
                                     the healthy development of young children. Ensuring high
                                     quality child care for low-income families is especially
                                     important because parents who are preoccupied with a daily
                                     struggle to ensure that their children have enough to eat
                                     and are safe from harm may not have the resources,
                                     information, or time they need to provide the stimulating
                                     experiences that foster optimal brain development5.
                                     COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION
                                        Goal E-7: A sense of community pride and investment
                                        fostered through civic participation, volunteerism, and
                                        communication that reaches all segments of the
                                        community.
                                     Policy E-7.1: Consult with faith-based and other non-profit
                                     organizations, schools, the business community, local media
                                     outlets, FRCs, and libraries to improve public outreach
                                     efforts.
                                     Policy E-7.2: Utilize diverse media, technology, and
                                     communication methods to convey information to the
                                     public.
                                     Policy E-7.3: Promote opportunities for public feedback
                                     that utilize new technologies (e-mail, websites) in addition
                                     to traditional forms of communication in order to better
                                     identify issues, submit comments, and exchange dialogue.
                                     Policy     E-7.4:       Organize          Community          Councils       and
                                     Neighborhood Organizing Workgroups (NOWs) for the
                                     purpose of involving community members in decision-making
                                     and implementation processes.
                                     Policy E-7.5: Encourage the involvement of community
                                     members in identifying priorities for General Plan and
                                     Neighborhood and District Action Plan implementation
                                     programs and capital improvement projects.

                                      meaningful involvement opportunities for low-income,
                                      minority, disabled, children and youth, and other traditionally
                                      underrepresented citizens in the public participation process
                                      and encourage non-traditional communication methods to
                                      convey complex ideas in an easily understandable manner.
                                      Policy E-7.7: Periodically review the effectiveness of the
                                      procedures and strategies used to solicit public input and
                                      develop outreach processes and methodologies tailored to
                                      the needs of the community.
                                      Policy E-7.8: Promote volunteerism and community service
                                      to engender a sense of pride in the community.
                                      Policy E-7.9: Initiate outreach efforts as early as possible in
                                      the decision-making process, before significant resources
                                      have been invested in a particular outcome and ensure that
                                      materials are distributed far enough in advance of meetings,
                                      workshops, and hearings to allow sufficient time for review
                                      and comment.

                                      Why is this Important?
                                      Educational attainment is a powerful predictor of civic
                                      engagement. The more education people have, the more
                                      likely it is that they will participate in civic affairs6.
                                      Democratic societies rely on the active and informed
                                      participation of their citizens in order to make good
                                      collective decisions and ensure that powerful minority
                                      interests do not take control.
                                      TELECOMMUNICATIONS
                                         Goal E-8: Universal and easy access to state-of-the-art
                                         internet services and modern telecommunications
                                         technology.
                                      Policy E-8.1: Encourage new development to be wired or
                                      provided with other necessary infrastructure for state-of-
                                      the-art telecommunications services.

                                          Part Four City-wide Implementation Measures
                                       PART
                                                         4
                                       IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
                      A.      Introduction
                      To help ensure that appropriate actions are taken to
                      implement the General Plan, Part 4 includes a series of
                      implementation measures. These implementation measures
                      are tools to guide elected officials, commissions and
                      committees, City staff, and the public in the overall effort to
                      put into practice adopted General Plan goals and policies.
                      The implementation measures are the specific steps or
                      actions to be taken by the City to implement the goals and
                      policies outlined in the General Plan Elements. They may
                      include revisions of current codes and ordinances, adoption
                      of new ordinances or Council policies, specific or master
                      plans and capital improvements, programs, financing, and
                      other measures that should be assigned to various City
                      departments after the General Plan is adopted. The
                      implementation measures in this Chapter may be adjusted
                      periodically to address new challenges facing the
                      community. As discussed in greater detail in Part 1
                      (Introduction) of the General Plan, updates to this section
                      will not be considered amendments to the General Plan.
                      B.      Categories of Implementation Actions
                      The City will implement the goals and policies of the General
                      Plan through many actions that can be grouped according to
                      the nine categories listed below. The identifiers (italicized
                      and in parentheses) are provided in the implementation
                      tables in this Chapter to indicate the appropriate mechanism
                      by which the General Plan policies will be implemented.
                      ZONING AND MUNICIPAL CODE (ZC)
                      Many General Plan policies are implemented through
                      regulations adopted by the City to protect the public health,
                      safety, and general welfare. These regulations are typically
                      adopted by Ordinance and codified in the City’s municipal
City of National City                 4-1

Part Four: Citywide Implementation Measures
                             code. The section of the municipal code that regulates the
                             manner in which land is developed and used is known as the
                             Land Use Code or Zoning Ordinance. The Land Use Code
                             contains specific development regulations that can be
                             applied at the parcel level to implement the land uses
                             identified in the General Plan. Other sections of the
                             municipal code regulate additional activities such as, but not
                             limited to, the subdivision of land, property maintenance,
                             stormwater management, water usage, noise control, food
                             handling, recycling, and construction. The City has the
                             authority to regulate these activities for the benefit of the
                             community under the police power.
                             PROJECT PROCESSING/DEVELOPMENT REVIEW (PP)
                             City ordinances establish a development review process that
                             allows the City to review individual project proposals and
                             authorizes the City to approve, deny, or condition projects
                             based on their consistency with the General Plan. The City
                             processes a variety of permits that facilitate development
                             such as conditional use permits, specific plans, subdivision
                             maps, site plans, planned development permits, variances,
                             and building permits. Through review of these discretionary
                             or ministerial projects, General Plan goals and policies can be
                             implemented.
                             CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (CIP)
                             A capital improvement program (CIP) is a short term plan
                             (generally four to six years) that sets a general schedule for

                             guides the construction of improvements to roads and
                             sidewalks, sewer and water facilities, storm gutters/swales,
                             parks, etc. Because a capital improvement program must be
                             consistent with the adopted General Plan, it provides a tool
                             for implementation of the goals and objectives of the
                             General Plan.
                             INCENTIVES (I)
                             Incentives come in a variety of forms. They may be found
                             within the zoning ordinance in the form of reduced or more
                             flexible development standards (e.g. density bonuses or
                             reduced parking requirements), as fee reductions or credits,
                             as expedited permit processing, or as programs which
                             provide recognition to projects which incorporate desirable
                             features such as low-impact development.

                      MONITORING AND EVALUATION (ME)
                      The City conducts studies and produces reports to collect
                      and evaluate information related to specific issues. These
                      studies and reports are undertaken at the direction of the
                      City Council as needed or are prepared annually to report on
                      the status and implementation of the General Plan. This
                      monitoring and evaluation helps the City to understand the
                      effectiveness of its policies and actions and make
                      adjustments as necessary.
                      OTHER PLANS, MANUALS, AND GUIDELINES (PMG)
                      A city may adopt many plans, master plans, manuals, and
                      other guidelines focusing on various types of city services
                      and facilities, types of development, or geographic areas.
                      These are prepared to provide more specific direction for
                      decision-makers, City staff, and the public on how the
                      General Plan will be implemented. They are not elements or
                      components of the General Plan. Manuals and guidelines in
                      most instances are not codified and, rather than regulate,
                      provide guidance and flexibility in implementing General Plan
                      goals and policies. Specific implementation programs in this
                      Chapter call for the annual or periodic review of many of
                      these plans, manuals and guidelines, in addition to adoption
                      of some new plans. Examples of other plans, manuals, and
                      guidelines include: Design Guidelines, Pedestrian Master
                      Plans, Bicycle Master Plans, Climate Action Plans, CEQA
                      Guidelines, Redevelopment Plans, Drainage Master Plans,
                      Stormwater Guidelines, etc.
                      PUBLIC OUTREACH (PO)
                      The City can use a wide range of tools to keep residents
                      informed of city services or other issues of current interest.
                      Public information can be distributed through media such as
                      brochures or pamphlets, the city’s website, workshops,
                      seminars, public access television, radio, newspapers, public
                      hearings, neighborhood and community meetings, and
                      customer service hotlines.
                      PROGRAMS AND TOOLS (PT)
                      Other programs and tools may include implementation
                      measures that do not fall into any of the other categories.
                      This may include specific programs or one-time actions
                      developed to address a policy objective.

                             CONSULTATION (C)
                             In some instances, the City may need to consult with
                             numerous local, regional, state, and federal agencies to
                             implement the General Plan. These agencies provide
                             services, facilities, or funding and administer regulations
                             that directly or indirectly affect many issues addressed in
                             the General Plan. The following is a partial list of responsible
                             agencies that may play a role in implementing this General
                             Plan: Neighboring jurisdictions; school districts; the U.S.
                             Navy; the San Diego Unified Port District; the County of San
                             Diego; regional agencies such as the San Diego Association
                             of Governments (SANDAG) and the San Diego Air Pollution
                             Control District (SDAPCD); state agencies such as Caltrans,
                             the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA)
                             and Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC); and
                             federal agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services
                             (USFWS), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Federal
                             Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
                             C.       Priorities for Implementation
                             The City has identified the following actions as the highest
                             priorities for implementing the General Plan:
                                  •   Update to the Land Use Code
                                  •   Development of a Climate Action Plan
                                  •   Creation of Neighborhood Action Plans (NAPs) and
                                      Neighborhood Organizing Workgroups (NOWs)
                                  •   Development of a Food Action Plan (FAP)
                                  •   Development of a Bikeways Master Plan
                                  •   Development of a Comprehensive Transportation Plan
                                  •   Development of a 5-year Capital Improvement
                                      Program
                             All actions identified in Part 4, have been assigned a level of
                             priority – high, medium or low. These priority assignments
                             take into consideration public input received during the
                             General Plan preparation process, the impact each action
                             may have in regards to implementation, whether the action
                             is likely to occur in the near-term or long-term, and funding
                             and human resources required for implementation. The level
                             of priority assigned to each implementation measure does
                             not necessarily indicate the order in which these actions will
                             occur as discussed in greater detail in Part 1 (Introduction)
                             of the General Plan. It is possible that a high priority item
                             may not be realized for many years due to funding or other
                             constraints. In contrast, some low priority actions could be

                      implementation tasks and they may be adjusted or revised
                      as funding and resources dictate.
                      E.      Funding
                      Implementation of the General Plan is dependent on funding.
                      Funding for City departments, plans, programs, and capital
                      improvement projects that implement the General Plan may
                      come from a number sources including:
                          •   Property tax revenue
                          •   Sales tax revenue
                          •   User fees
                          •   Development impact fees

                                                     INDICATORS
                      A.     The Purpose of Indicators
     
                      A series of indicators are identified in this Chapter that the
                      City can use to track its progress towards achieving its
                      vision for the future. An indicator is a measurement that
                      assists in demonstrating the level of progression in
                      achieving policy-driven goals.
                      An indicator must have a benchmark and a target. The
                      benchmark is the existing condition – the original
                      measurement      from     which    to    evaluate     all    later
                      measurements. The target is the goal – the point at which
                      success is achieved. Measuring how well a city currently is
                      performing on a specific issue and identifying changes that
                      have occurred as a result of implemented policies and
                      programs helps to reveal the effectiveness of a city’s
                      actions. The City in turn, can modify its actions as necessary
                      in order to meet certain targets. In this way, an indicator is
                      used to evaluate progress and guide policy decisions.
                      An effective indicator should meet the following criteria:
                      relevancy, ease in understanding, reliability, and accessibility
                      of relevant data. The indicators set forth in this Chapter
                      generally are measured by existing sources – including City
                      Departments, the County of San Diego or other responsible
                      agencies, various State offices, and the U.S. Census Bureau.
                      Other indicators rely on survey data that would need to be
                      periodically generated.
 
                      B.     Indicator Table
 
                      The following table identifies indicators for the General Plan
                      goals for which progress can be measured. The first column
                      in the table specifies the indicator. The second column
                      specifies how each indicator is measured and the source of
                      the measurement. The data source and measurement

Part Five: Indicators
                                     technique has been identified to ensure that these
                                     indicators can be measured again in the future using the
                                     same methodology. The existing conditions measurement is
                                     based on information available at the time this report was
                                     prepared1. The fourth column indicates recommended
                                     targets that specify the level of progress that should be
                                     achieved to meet the City’s goal. The fifth column identifies
                                     General Plan goals that pertain to each indicator. Finally, the
                                     Guiding Principle(s) to which each indicator relates is
                                     identified.

  The existing conditions measurement is based on the most recent data available; however, the year may differ among
indicators, depending on the source.

  American Forests recommends a tree canopy of 25% for the San Diego region; however, to better reflect the local conditions in National City, the target has been

measurement.

                                     processes associated with the shaping of their community.
                                     Public participation is one way cities are able to identify the
                                     needs of their community members and develop ways to
                                     meet those needs. It also often results in creating places
                                     that enrich lives by giving people a sense of pride and
                                     investment in their city.
                                     The California Government Code requires two public hearings
                                     before a city can adopt or amend a general plan: one by the
                                     planning commission and another by the city council1.
                                     However, this minimal number of hearings does not
                                     constitute what most planners and government officials
                                     would perceive as adequate public participation for adopting
                                     a general plan. Usually, there are several organized public
                                     participation activities which occur early on in the process
                                     and attempt to involve all affected stakeholders including
                                     community groups, utility and public service providers,
                                     educational institutions, industry and business leaders, non-
                                     governmental organizations, and religious communities.
                                     Who participates in the process varies depending upon a
                                     number of different factors. People are more likely to
                                     participate if they have an economic interest in the outcome
                                     of a particular decision, if they need to protect or increase
                                     access to the use of a facility or service, if they perceive an
                                     environmental health risk associated with a proposed action,
                                     or if an issue affects strongly held religious, personal, or
                                     political beliefs2. The degree of involvement also varies
                                     depending on technical skills, roles in the community, and
                                     the willingness and ability to commit time and energy.
                                     To maximize the amount of public input received, National
                                     City developed a fairly extensive public outreach and
                                     participation program for this General Plan Update process,
                                     which is summarized in this appendix.

                           B.       Strategic Plan Workshop
                           In 2007, National City adopted a Five Year Strategic Plan to
                           address community and economic development. As part of
                           the process, a series of three public workshops was held to
                           identify significant goals and objectives. The following input
                           was provided:
                               •    Focus on fiscal sustainability
                               •    Analyze the redevelopment area’s effect on the
                                    General Fund
                               •    Balance ideal and real
                               •    Strengthen code enforcement
                               •    Establish community gateways and focus areas
                               •    Implement plans (Westside/Old Town)
                               •    Establish a comprehensive plan for development
                               •    Don’t do things piecemeal
                               •    Willingness to be patient for the market to rebound
                               •    Generate ongoing and diverse revenue
                               •    Safety, health, and quality of life are important
                           As part of the process, five interlocking guiding principles
                           (development, quality of life, health and safety, and
                           education) were formed to promote collaboration, improve
                           public communication, and align city departments.
                           In March of 2009, the National City Council held a planning
                           and finance workshop for residents and businesses. The
                           “town hall” type program covered service level reports,
 Refer to Part II –        financial updates, and the upcoming General Plan Update. It

                           Information
                           A group of eight university students participated in a
                           fellowship program during the summer of 2009 and assisted
                           with research for the Background Report that served to
                           inform goal and policy development. At the conclusion of
                           the fellowship program, the students presented their work
                           to the City Council. The consultant team continued to work

                      regarding the findings to both the City Council and the
                      Planning Commission at a joint meeting in October of 2009.
                      D.      Stakeholder Meetings
                      Throughout the General Plan Update process, City staff and
                      the consultant team held meetings with and communicated
                      with stakeholders to ensure that National City’s plans would
                      benefit and/or not substantially impact military lands and
                      activities, the harbor, the business community, adjacent
                      jurisdictions, and service providers. In addition, active non-
                      profit organizations were consulted regarding policy
                      development. Meetings, phone conversations, and written
                      correspondence took place with the following stakeholders:

                           E.       SWOT Questionnaire
                           One of the first steps in preparing the General Plan Update
                           was to obtain an understanding of how community members
                           currently perceive the city and what they want to change
                           about it. In order to collect this information, a SWOT
                           (Strengths,        Weaknesses,    Opportunities,       Threats)
                           questionnaire was developed to identify what people
                           currently like and dislike about their neighborhood and the
                           city as well as their perceptions of future opportunities and
                           threats. A SWOT is a tool for developing a preferred future.
                           The goal is to build on existing strengths, recognize and
                           correct weaknesses, take advantage of opportunities, and
                           minimize threats to implementing positive changes. The
                           questionnaire was not a scientific survey. It was meant to
                           provide a general sense of the issues that the community
                           wanted to address within the General Plan.
                           In addition to asking a few demographic questions, the
                           SWOT contained eight core questions:
                           Strengths:
                           •   What do you like best about your neighborhood?
                           •   What do you like best about National City?
                           Weaknesses:
                           •   What do you like least about your neighborhood?
                           •   What do you like least about National City?
                           Opportunities:
                           •   How could your neighborhood be improved?
                           •   How could National City be improved?
                           Threats:
                           •   What could stand in the way of improving your
                               neighborhood?
                           •   What could stand in the way of improving National City?
                           The open-ended SWOT questionnaire was first released to
                           the public for input in November. A hard copy of the
Adopted June 2011                         A-4                     National City General Plan

                                            Appendix A: Summary of Public Participation
                      questionnaire was passed out at a Neighborhood Councils
                      Breakfast and an online version of the questionnaire was
                      posted on the City’s website at the same time. Availability
                      of the online questionnaire was announced at the Breakfast
                      and a press release was sent to local media outlets. In
                      addition, an advertisement about the questionnaire was
                      published in the San Diego Reader. The SWOT questionnaire
                      was also distributed to business organizations such as the
                      Port Tenants Association, the Mile of Cars Association, and
                      the Chamber of Commerce. An incentive for completing the
                      survey included being entered into a drawing to win
                      Repertory Theater tickets, movie tickets, Circus Vargas
                      tickets, or a $25 gift card to Westfield Shopping Center.
                      A total of 85 open-ended questionnaires were received (60
                      of these were completed at the NHC breakfast or delivered
                      to the City at a later date and 25 were completed online).
                      Based on the results from the first open-ended
                      questionnaire, a second SWOT questionnaire was developed
                      in a multiple choice format in an attempt to obtain more
                      responses. This questionnaire also allowed for open-ended
                      answers if the survey taker wished to provide additional
                      thoughts. It was released to the public at the February
                      community workshops and an online version of the
                      questionnaire was posted on the City’s website. Again, a
                      press release announcing the availability of the
                      questionnaire was sent to local media outlets.
                      A total of 53 multiple-choice questionnaires were received
                      (25 were completed at the workshops and 28 were
                      completed online).
                      The combined results of the open-ended and multiple choice
                      questionnaires revealed that there are similarities among
                      how people view the city as a whole and their neighborhood.
                      Although respondents were asked what neighborhood they
                      live in, not everyone responded to this question and not
                      enough responses were received to identify variations in the
                      perception of different neighborhoods. The following is a
                      summary of the most common responses to the eight core
                      questions.
                      Strengths:
                      The most common neighborhood strengths are:
                      • Convenient location/easy access to freeways;
                      • Neighbors;
                      • Diverse people, cultures, and interests;

                           The most common citywide strengths are:
                           • Convenient location/easy access to freeways;
                           • Quaintness/small town feel;
                           • A sense of community;

                      FIRST SET OF PUBLIC WORKSHOPS
                      In February of 2010, three public workshops were held at
                      the community parks: El Toyon (February 3rd), Las Palmas
                      (February 4th), and Kimball (February 6th). At these

                      elements, significant concepts being contemplated for
                      inclusion in the General Plan, and examples of how the
                      General Plan would be implemented such as through the
                      Capital Improvement Program, the Land Use Code, and
                      Neighborhood Action Plans. Draft concept sketches
                      identifying how the elementary schools could be better
                      integrated into neighborhoods and community park master
                      plan ideas were also presented at the workshops. In

                      proposed revisions to SANDAG’s Smart Growth Concept Map
                      were displayed. Comment cards were available for attendees
                      to provide input on these sketches and any other ideas that
                      were presented. The following input was received:

                           Ira Harbison:
                               •    Traffic- in/out very crowded & 8th St through
                                    Paradise Valley Rd is very busy at the time school
                                    traffic is also busy. Any re-routing possible?

                               •    If reducing 8th to 2 lanes will affect school drop off
                                    and pick up of students, need to make sure school
                                    can continue to function.
                               •    Crosswalks or traffic lights at the intersection of
                                    Plaza & E. I’m a student at Central and I have a
                                    concern people are really crazy and it’s hard to do all
                                    the work for one crossing guard.

                           Otis:
                               •    Post office access is essential.
                               •    Another Farmers Market? This would be most
                                    sensible by the farm, but don’t put our small
                                    businesses out of business. Who pays for the water
                                    on the Community Gardens & who regulated its use?
                               •    Better lighting on "D" Ave, I like the "F" Ave street
                                    closure and the farmers market.

                                    Friday night. Maybe limit the time on when noise
                                    (loud speakers) can start on Saturday morning.
                               •    Old Adult Education building, built in the 1930's,

                          •  Pedestrian access to Olivewood Garden is not
                             necessary - use the streets/sidewalks. It’s a long
                             way for most to walk.
                      Kimball:
                          •  Our non-profit organization would like to explore
                             putting a bathroom in Paradise Creek Educational
                             Park.
                          •  Locate trail from parking lot to Hoover as close to
                             school fence as possible. Restroom or restroom with
                             Interpretive Center as either added component or
                             FRC or a new building at Hoover Ave.
                          •  Where does Public Works go?
                          •  I'm all for Paradise Creek!
                          •  I love the plan, hopefully you guys can remove the
                             concrete in Paradise Creek especially when it runs
                             through Kimball park.
                          •  Prefer northeast corner for Farmers market/
                             gathering space.
                          •  Improved backstop for t-ball. New path northeast
                             corner (Kimball Bowl) to discourage park users from
                             walking on new lawn.
                          •  We need more green area in Old Town National City.
                          •  Restrooms at Hoover Ave street closure.
                          •  Open areas flood- please fix. If open to the public.
                             restrooms should be added.
                          •  Open area floods.
                          •  Area floods- not the best area for recreation.
                      El Toyon:
                          •  Dog park is a great idea. Parking is a necessity
                             (safety for kids). Lighting for night walking on the
                             football/soccer field.
                          •  The horseshoe parking lot should be open on the
                             weekends (until disk). People who are using the
                             sports recreation areas & picnicking are forced to
                             park along Euclid Ave & 1st and neighboring
                             residential streets. Walking in from the perimeter
                             parking is a hassle.
                          •  I love the dog run/dog park idea.
                          •  Relocate wall on tennis court away from house,
                             toward center of park- get noise away from 4th
                             Street.
                          •  Positively give home owners on 4th a buffer zone
                             beyond our house to stop the invasion of noise and
                             privacy issues inside our homes.
                          •  Provide police patrol on a regular basis.

                               •    Do away with parking inside the park (horseshoe), it
                                    gives you more green space & eliminates the
                                    possibility of a child getting hit running to the swings
                                    & gives the neighbors some noise relief from boom
                                    boxes.
                               •    Provide lighting for evening soccer games. Too many
                                    non-residents here. Get rid of horseshoe drive.
                           Las Palmas:
                               •    I am against closing the golf course.           It serves
                                    seniors, juniors, and low income golfers. It is a
                                    "resource" worthy protecting.
                               •    I love the "Community Gardens" idea!
                               •    Security between school and public?? Trail
                                    maintenance?

                               • I think Lincoln Acres & Granger needs more library

                                    Possibly expand or widen sidewalks to improve
                                    walkability, more space.
                               •    We need more grocery stores like Henry's.
                               •    Farmer's market - one just failed! We do have many
                                    small fruiterias- don’t put them out of business!
                               •    Another Farmer's market? Keep the library open 7
                                    days a week!!!
                               •    Improve "gateway" entrances off of Interstate 5-
                                    expecially the Civic Center Dr. exit (exiting from 5
                                    south).
                               •    More grocery stores/markets like Henry's (especially
                                    in the NW part of the City).
                               •    Improve Civic Center Dr. intersection near the 5
                                    freeway. Make it a gateway into the City. Entrance

                      SECOND SET OF PUBLIC WORKSHOPS
                      In May of 2010, three more public workshops were held at
                      the community parks: El Toyon (May 5th), Las Palmas (May
                      6th), and Kimball (May 8th). The major topics covered in
                      these workshops included the proposed street conversion
                      parks being contemplated as a way to increase parks and
                      open space within National City, community corridors, Safe
                      Routes to School, proposed mixed-use zoning regulations,
                      the Las Palmas Park expansion plan, and proposed
                      implementation measures. Although the workshops were
                      noticed citywide, additional noticing occurred for those
                      within 300 feet of a proposed street conversion park.
                      Almost all of the workshop attendees were individuals who
                      received a special notice that a street conversion park was
                      being contemplated in their neighborhood. As in previous
                      workshops, the draft Preferred Land Use Map, draft Zoning
                      Map, Community Corridor Plan, examples of mixed-use
                      developments, the Neighborhood and Districts map, and
                      proposed revisions to SANDAG’s Smart Growth Concept Map
                      were displayed. In addition, draft concept sketches were
                      prepared for each potential street conversion site to
                      generate dialogue and ideas. Comment cards were available
                      for attendees to provide input. The following input was
                      received regarding the potential street conversions:
                      V between 7th and 8th:
                          •  Street closure on 'V' Avenue, I strongly disagree. It
                             would become a form of gathering for NC gangs if it
                             becomes a park. We just don’t have enough Police
                             Officers to keep this corridor safe. Closing 'V' will
                             hinder fire truck access.
                          •  No park on 'V' Ave b/w 7th & 8th.
                          •  I oppose the proposed mini park at 'V' Ave. 7th &
                             8th St. parking will be a problem if it is a thru street.
                      K between 21st and 22nd:
                          •  'K" b/w 21st & 22nd - needs parking - needs thru
                             access.
                          •  Against street conversion on 21st & 22nd.
                          •  21st & 22nd Street is really a bad idea: gangs, noise,
                             leave the residential area alone that is clean, bike exit
                             on Sweetwater, leave Golf Course on 30th.

                               •    According to the info received, the street on Q St.
                                    will be converted. I live on 1703 Delta will the City
                                    provide a fence in my backyard for privacy? Are
                                    property taxes going to stay the same?
                               •    Street conversion on 'Q' Ave. Is there money to build
                                    a park? Who is going to use the park? I enjoy the
                                    privacy of this community. Having a park will invite
                                    outsiders to our community.
                               •    'Q' Ave b/w La Posada & Delta: I am supportive of
                                    the space being used as a community garden with a
                                    variety of fruits, vegetables and herbs. Also I along
                                    with a group of mentors and community volunteers
                                    look forward to working with the garden. It will
                                    provide a beautiful and functional way for all in the
                                    community to participate in agriculture. It will serve
                                    as an educational experience for children to learn how
                                    food is grown and the care it takes.
                               •    La Posada & Delta: I don't want added traffic and
                                    people on my street we have a nice quiet
                                    neighborhood with lots of kids that I would like to
                                    keep safe.
                           F South of 18th:
                               •    Oppose elimination of Las Palmas Golf Course and
                                    closing on 'F' St.
                               •    Opposed to 'F' St. closure, this area is needed for
                                    parking for events at Stein Farm, school and
                                    neighbors. We don't need people hanging out in
                                    front of residences & historic site. Farm already
                                    provides activity for schools, neighborhood &
                                    gardening.
                               •    No to proposed closure of 'F'. Where would my
                                    driveway be? Why is this important? Produce stand &
                                    gazebo or families picking & bringing the children to
                                    school?
                               •    'F' St. closure - not a usable plan - parking at the
                                    moment is limited and would be much worse. Golf
                                    Course elimination is very bad for NC residents…not
                                    only for school, residents, but also for surrounding
                                    businesses that benefit from the people who come
                                    from out of town. Also it gives NC a better image
                                    than we have now, giving away property to a
                                    commercial (strip mall) of a public park is
                                    unforgiveable.
                               •    No on closing 'F' St.

                          •  I do not support the closure of 'F' south of 18th. It
                             makes no sense.
                          •  I am opposed to the 'F' St. closure; supposed to be
                             using less water, it will become a nightly hangout,
                             Stein Farm is open space and we need parking, the
                             schools need and use this area all day for drop
                             off/pickup.
                          •  I oppose the 'F' Ave closing south of 18th.
                      6th East of National City Boulevard / 7th East of National
                      City Boulevard:
                          •  No closing by Napolean's
                          •  Please don't close 7th St. by National City Blvd.
                          •  The park @ 7th east of NC Blvd. would really help the
                             Charter school.     It would also help with traffic
                             accidents on 7th & NC Blvd.
                          •  No closure to our 5th & 6th St. with a playground
                             which will only be bring strangers into our community.
                          •  Move 7th east of NC Blvd to 6th east of NC Blvd in
                             b/w mortuary & chapel.
                          •  6th & 7th will not work- need bathroom, no one on
                             this street wants this- no one!
                      E North of 6th:
                          •  E. North of 6th: Strongly oppose to this closure; no
                             access to our properties, loss of privacy, increase in
                             noise and potential magnet to cominal elements
                             (prostitution/gangs/drug dealing- high crime in NC),
                             fire hazard, no direct access, fire codes don't allow
                             for this.
                          •  Incorporate 1 of the parkways into a community
                             garden. Convert street to one-way, and create
                             diagonal parking on one side. Currently 24 cars can
                             park on 'E' Ave, diagonal parking may create even
                             more. No park space desired.
                          •  Place community garden at intersection of 6th & 'E'.
                             This would result in a 4-way cul-de-sac, instant traffic
                             calming and no complete street closure.
                          •  No to street conversion on 'E' north of 6th.
                          •  Disagree with street conversion on 'E' St north of
                             6th. Negatives are- parks, picnic and parking lot is a
                             potential magnet for homeless, prostitution, gang
                             activity, these criminal elements need to be
                             addressed before you bring these into residential
                             areas. A community garden into the intersection-
                             calm traffic on 6th & 'E'.

                               •    Don’t think 'E' north of 6th is a good idea. It would
                                    create a place for the homeless also no parking for
                                    residences.
                               •    Not in favor of closing north of 6th St.
                           G North of 7th / 7th between F and G:
                               •    No on the 'G' north of 7th; too many problems with
                                    the homeless already, the police are constantly there.
                                    I find drug paraphanalia in the street in front of my
                                    house. The closing is not needed and I will loose my
                                    driveway.
                               •    'G' Ave north of 7th; this park would block two
                                    driveways on 'G' Ave; terrible plan. Get rid of this
                                    plan.
                               •    'G' north of 7th; bad idea altogether, area has big
                                    problems with homeless, park will be right on my
                                    front doorstep cant have that, the homeless already
                                    use the front area as their restroom, get rid of this
                                    plan.
                               •    'G' north of 7th & 7th b/w 'F'&'G': how is cleanup of
                                    this area going to be controlled? How is safety of
                                    neighborhood with gangs and homeless people going
                                    to be controlled? How will church on corner of 7th &
                                    'G' going to conduct services when park is open?
                               •    Two projects running next to each other, conversion
                                    'G' north of 7th, 7th b/w F &G?? Currently high
                                    homeless area, how will this park be able to control
                                    their messy use of this area by homeless? Young
                                    street gangs are currently using this area.
                               •    I believe the parks located near 6th/7th & 'G' would
                                    only be an invitation for criminal activity/ graffiti
                                    within our neighborhood.
                               •    Don't think 'G' north of 7th & 7th b/w 'F' & 'G" are a
                                    good idea. Another place for the homeless and gangs.
                           Kimball Way:

                           General Street Conversion Comments:
                               •    Against mini parks, not enough parking now as it is, it
                                    would bring more noise at night and more crime in
                                    our area and more homeless people.
                               •    Are small parks needed? The big parks are enough
                                    trouble.

                          •  Concerns with mini parks: parking space, property
                             taxes, fence accordingly, who is going to be able to
                             use the park, picnic tables first come first serve.
                          •  I am in favor of expanded City parks systems but
                             would like police patrol in these areas addressed.
                             Properties that will need to be bought from private

                          •  It seems that each of these concept projects should

                             24th &'I'.
                          •  I would like to see the lot on 20th-22nd Highland
                             made into a park. This would be great for the kids in
                             Essex Manor.
                          •  Consider E. 17th next to Rachael, the unicorporated
                             dirt alley as a street conversion site.
                          •  Open space by 30th behind Toys-R-Us- park
                             possibility?
                          •  Why is the City spending money on research to
                             create more parks when we have existing parks that
                             are being neglected and are in need of proper
                             improvement?
                          •  These parks will only attract more gang activity.
                          •  These parks will only bring more graffiti into our City.
                          •  Planning for the money to maintain existing parks.
                          •  Devalue property, more graffiti, more trash, more
                             violence, more drug dealing, more information from
                             City Depts.
                          •  I do not want this to happen we deal with a horrible
                             influx of homeless. They already use the bathroom
                             within 6ft of my home. We have just taken a stand
                             against a gang that was threatening us all. The
                             amount of trash they leave.
                          •  Dirt alley b/w 16th & 18th east, could it be
                             converted to open space?
                          •  Street conversion- absolutely not. We do not need
                             another place for gangs to hang out, more drug
                             deals, more graffiti that no one is able to control.
                          •  Do you think we want a good road changed into a
                             playground?
                      As a result of public comment and input from the National
                      City Fire Department, the following street conversions were
                      removed from the initial list of 15 potential street
                      conversion sites following the workshops:
                          •  V between 7th and 8th
                          •  K between 21st and 22nd

                           Several other street conversions were modified based on
                           community concerns and input received from the National
                           City Fire Department:
                               •    West Avenue between 16th and 18th (No longer
                                    considered for a park; however this conversion is part
                                    of the Westside Specific Plan and may be part of a
                                    future redevelopment project)
                               •    Hoover between 22nd and Mile of Cars (No longer
                                    being considered for a park, but may be part of a
                                    future redevelopment project)
                               •    Kimball Way between the 99¢ Store Driveway and F
                               •    12th east of Palm

                           Two street conversions, Q between La Posada and Delta and
                           Hoover south of 18th, remain unchanged from the original
                           proposals.
                           TurningPoint Questionnaire
                           After the street conversion discussions, workshop
                           attendees were invited to stay for the General Plan Update
                           presentation and participate in a TurningPoint survey
                           regarding other General Plan concepts. TurningPoint is a tool
                           that allows presenters to insert multiple choice questions in
                           a PowerPoint presentation that the audience can respond to
                           by pushing a button on a handheld clicker device that
                           corresponds to one of the answer choices on the screen.
                           Once the audience has responded to the question, the votes
                           are calculated instantly and the results are displayed on the
                           screen. This technology is beneficial in gaining input from
                           people who are uncomfortable expressing their opinions in
                           a public workshop setting.
                           The TurningPoint questionnaire was not a scientific survey.
                           It provided a general sense of the opinions of those who
                           were able to attend the workshops. A few people attended
                           more than one workshop and may have participated in the
                           TurningPoint questionnaire more than once. Approximately
                           47 people participated in the questionnaire at the El Toyon
Adopted June 2011                        A-16                      National City General Plan

                      Palmas, and 21 participated in the questionnaire at MLK.
                      The questionnaire was also posted online and the availability
                      of the online questionnaire was noticed, but only six people
                      took the online survey. There were a total of 86
                      respondents; however, not everyone responded to every
                      question. The following is a summary of the combined
                      results of the TurningPoint questionnaire from all three
                      workshops and the online survey.
                      Community Corridors
                      The community was provided with an overview of the
                      proposed community corridors and how these roads are
                      being contemplated for traffic calming, pedestrian and
                      bicycle improvements, and streetscape enhancements. The
                      first question was, “The creation of community corridors will
                      benefit both the residents and businesses of National City.”
                      Approximately 41% agreed or strongly agreed with this
                      statement, 19% were neutral, and 40% disagreed or
                      strongly disagreed.
                      The creation of community corridors will benefit both the
                      residents and businesses of National City.

                      When asked what they felt the most important component
                      of a community corridor is, 30% responded that it should
                      contain some combination of wider shaded sidewalks, bike
                      lanes, reduced travel lanes, improved parking, and improved
                      access to transit, 28% felt that nothing should be done to
                      the existing roads, and 18% thought that improving parking
                      is the most important.

                           was discussed, respondents were first asked what the most
                           common form of transportation is to and from school. 52%

                           The community was informed that the City is looking to
                           incorporate mixed-use land use designations into the
                           General Plan Update to replace existing commercial zones
                           where residential is permitted, but with a conditional use
                           permit. The mixed-use zones would allow mixed residential,
                           commercial, and office development by right. A couple of
                           images were chosen based on the permitted height and
                           scale being contemplated within the minor and major mixed-
                           use areas.
                           When asked whether a development of this nature would be
                           appropriate in the minor mixed-use areas in National City,
                           40% agreed or strongly agreed, 15% were neutral, and 45%
                           disagreed or strongly disagreed.

                           regulate them in such a way so that they do not impact the

                      Because National City lacks enough parks and open space to
                      support its growing population and is highly constrained by
                      existing development, one of the ideas explored to increase
                      parks and open space is the conversion of certain sections
                      of streets into mini parks. When asked whether they would
                      like to have a street conversion park in their neighborhood,

                      Map, SANDAG’s Smart Growth Concept Map, and examples
                      of mixed-use developments. In addition, workshop attendees
                      were able to read and scan through the draft General Plan,
                      EIR, Land Use Code, Climate Action Plan, and proposed
                      amendments to the Downtown Specific Plan. Comment
                      cards were available for attendees to provide input on the
                      documents. The following input was received:
                          •  Graffiti control. Especially on/around pay phones.
                             Property owners should take better responsibility of
                             pay      phones.      Pay     phones      should       be
                             regulated/removed by the City. Are they even
                             needed anymore?
                          •  Vacant properties should be cleared/cleaned in a

                               •    I like back-in angled parking. No median – too much
                                    traffic when maintaining.
                               •    Shrubs and trees should be able to feed our
                                    community.
                               •    The City should consider distances between uses
                                    such as hospitals, residences, schools, churches, and
                                    other sensitive uses and industrial uses. The distance
                                    between light industrial and sensitive uses should be
                                    500 feet and the distance between heavy industry
                                    and sensitive uses should be 1,000 feet.
                           G.       City Council/Town Hall Working Meetings
                           From March through June, a series of five City Council/Town
                           Hall style working meetings were held to review the working
                           draft of the General Plan. The following topics were
                           discussed during each meeting:
                           On March 9th, the roles and responsibilities of the members
                           of the consultant team were shared, the results from the
                           SWOT questionnaire were revealed, and the Introduction and
                           Vision and Guiding Principles were discussed with the
                           Council. The Vision and Guiding Principles contain the
                           concepts that guide policy development.
                           On March 30th, major concepts, proposed changes to the
                           existing land use map, draft land use and circulation maps,

                           Land Use and Circulation Elements were discussed. It was
                           explained that the Housing Element is on a separate
                           schedule from the rest of the General Plan and an update
                           was provided regarding when the next revision of the
                           Housing Element is due.
                           On April 27th, there was a joint City Council and National
                           School District Board meeting. The Education, Open Space

                           policies from each of these elements were presented and
                           the school and park sketches that were on display at the
                           February public workshops were shared with the school
                           board.

                           and Noise and Nuisance Elements were discussed. Again,
                           major concepts and example policies from these elements
                           were presented. In addition, the results of the TurningPoint
                           survey from the second set of public workshops were
                           revealed.

                      On June 22nd, the Implementation Measures and Indicators
                      were shared with the Council. Although there are several
                      citywide implementation measures, the ones that were
                      discussed in more detail with Council were the Neighborhood
                      Action Plans, the Land Use Code, the Climate Action Plan,
                      and the Capital Improvement Program. Indicators were
                      introduced as a way for the City to measure progress
                      towards achieving General Plan goals and policies. In
                      addition, an update on the status of the Environmental
                      Impact Report was provided.
                      The draft working documents were provided to Council for
                      review and also placed on the City’s website in an attempt
                      to solicit input early on in the process.
                      H.      Elementary School Assemblies and
                      Student Assignments
                      In March of 2010, assemblies were held at Lincoln Acres
                      Elementary (March 2nd), Ira Harbison Elementary (March 2nd),
                      and Kimball Elementary (March 18th). At these assemblies,
                      students were provided with an introduction to the US
                      Census and the importance of knowing how many people
                      live in the city in order to provide adequate public services.
                      A representative from EDCO discussed the three R’s –
                      reducing, reusing, and recycling. A nurse from the County
                      Health Department talked to the students about how they
                      can live healthier by exercising, eating right, and limiting
                      their TV and video game time. She also encouraged them to
                      make observations about their surroundings and tell

                      Teachers were also asked to complete an assignment with
                      their students in the classroom. Maps of the neighborhoods
                      were provided to the teachers along with a series of
                      questions. Students were asked to identify the routes they
                      take to school and what mode of travel they use (walking,
                      bicycling, vehicle, other). They were also asked to identify
                      the places that they like and don’t like and explain why they
                      like or do not like those places. Finally, they were asked to
                      identify one improvement that they thought would make the
                      biggest difference in their neighborhood and explain how
                      they could be involved making it happen.
                      The manner in which the teachers undertook this
                      assignment varied. In some cases, students drew their own
                      neighborhood maps rather than work on the ones that were
                      provided and not all students answered all of the questions.
                      The following is a summary of the results of the student
                      assignment.
                      A total of approximately 249 students answered how they
                      get to school. Of those, approximately 61% go by car, 24%
                      walk, 10% ride the bus, 4% sometimes walk and are
                      sometimes driven, and 0.8% ride their bike. A couple of
                      students indicated that their parents do not like them
                      walking by themselves and that is why they are driven to
                      school.
                      The most liked places are:
                      •   The community parks (Kimball, Las Palmas, and El
                          Toyon) because they are fun to go to with friends and
                          the parks are pretty;
                      •   The library because it’s safe and quiet;
                      •   Plaza Bonita Mall;
                      •   Big box stores such as Wal-Mart, Target, and Costco;
                      •   Specialty stores such as GameStop, the 99¢ Store, and

                               good;
                           •   School because the teachers are nice and they can play

                               dangerous at night, homeless people hang out there, and
                               people get drunk and leave empty beer cans there;
                           •   Auto body and paint shops because they are noisy,
