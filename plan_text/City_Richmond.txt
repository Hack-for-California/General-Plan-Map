10  Parks and Recreation
   Richmond General Plan 2030
Community Vision
Richmond, California in 2030
Richmond’s parks, public plazas and open spaces create a strong sense of community
identity, promote health and wellness, and protect historical and cultural amenities that
are part of the City’s legacy.
A variety of recreational programs and enrichment opportunities support the needs and
interests of community members of all ages, incomes and abilities. Programs are acces-
sible via public transit and pedestrian and bicycle routes that link schools and neighbor-
hoods to program destinations.
Richmond’s integrated system of parks provides public access to the San Pablo Peninsula,
large-scale open spaces, neighborhoods, schools, urban parks, recreational facilities and
other key destinations. Safe, park-like connections along restored creek channels, pedes-
trian-friendly green streets and multi-use trails encourage walking and bicycling.
Some parks, plazas and open spaces are located near civic and commercial areas. Each
park in the City features distinctive components such as rich landscape elements and pub-
lic art that respond to Richmond’s cultural values and history. Adults and children benefit
from contact with nature in the urban context through unstructured natural play settings
and walking paths.

  10 Parks and Recreation
Richmond Today
Richmond is one of the few Bay Area cities that
boast over 6,500 acres of parks and open space
including local, regional, state and national resources
(see Table 10.1: Parks and Open Space in Richmond
and Map 10.1: Parks, Trails and Open Space).
Approximately 5,718.5 acres of the parkland are
owned and operated by regional agencies and are
located along the shoreline and in the East Bay hills.
The City owns approximately 250 acres of compact,
neighborhood and community parks, and 510 acres
of open space clustered mostly in El Sobrante Valley,           Parks and playgrounds enhance quality of life for all residents and Sports facilities allow youth to remain engaged in their community

Placemaking through Parks
                          Placemaking3 is a means of deliberately designing parks to create social interaction, community identity,
                          beauty and livability. It is an approach to creating comfortable, stimulating parks that are not all alike.
                          Placemaking draws on unique cultural, historic or environmental qualities of an area to create high-
                          quality, distinctive parks where people of all ages and abilities can share experiences.
                          To create broad appeal, park facilities should be flexible to accommodate a wide range of experiences.
                          For example, a sports field can be designed as a complete activity setting rather than just as a place for
                          playing ball. In combination with elements such as picnic areas, a children’s play area, a gathering area,
                          restroom, drinking fountains and parking, a field can be designed as a place for the entire community.
                          To make the area distinctive, one or several of these elements can be designed to reflect something
                          unique about the community. Landmarks, art, water features, special facilities and park layout should
                          respond to Richmond’s culture, values and history. Park settings should be community places that are
                          equitable and usable by a wide variety of people. For example a children’s play area can be combined
                          with other uses such as a library or farmer’s market to create multiple reasons for the community to
                          gather.
                                                                              s h ap i n g     t h e   n e w   1 0 0   y ears         | 10.9

Park System Guidelines and Design
Criteria
Park system guidelines and design criteria work
hand-in-hand with park classifications to ensure that
parks provide expected benefits. They direct design
decisions to ensure that the parks and open space
system as a whole meets community needs.
Park system guidelines for developing Richmond’s
integrated system of parks and open space include:
•	 Ensuring safety;
•	 Geographically dispersing various types of parks
   throughout the City;
•	 Ensuring open space access within a comfortable
   walking distance of residences;
•	 Creating a clear and attractive signage system;
•	 Developing flexible, close-to-home facilities that
   include informal natural play areas, community

     The Need for Natural Settings
                                                    Research indicates that contact with nature is essential to emotional and physical well-being. Current
                                                    studies show that contact with nature points to broad public health benefits for both adults and chil-
                                                    dren. This is true of both larger-scale experiences in nature (such as visiting wilderness areas, forests
                                                    and rivers) and small-scale contact with nature (such as experiencing urban parks, gardens, creeks,
                                                    water features, tree-lined streets, birds and even views of trees and flowers).4 Broadly, evidence sug-
                                                    gests that contact with nature: reduces stress, anxiety and depression; restores attention; promotes
                                                    recovery from mental fatigue and physical ailments; and fosters environmental stewardship.5
                                                    In particular, studies show that natural settings promote physical and emotional developmental benefits
                                                    in children. Since children are more physically active in natural environments, benefits include reduc-
                                                    tions in incidences of diabetes, obesity, attention-deficit disorder and other maladies. Positive attributes
                                                    such as imagination, perception, creativity, self-esteem, sociability, motivation and stewardship have
                                                    also been associated with children’s experiences in nature.5 Play in unstructured, natural settings is
                                                    increasingly recognized as an essential component of wholesome child development. As such, public

Quality Parks Provide Economic Benefits
                                     In addition to environmental, aesthetic and recreation benefits, parks also provide many economic ben-
                                     efits to cities.7
                                     Parks increase home values. More than 100 years ago, Frederick Law Olmsted conducted a study of
                                     how New York’s Central Park affected adjacent property values. He found that over a 17-year period
                                     there was a $209 million increase in the value of the property impacted by the park. His study was not
                                     unique in finding that quality parks are often linked to increases in home and property values. In a more
                                     recent example, development of Atlanta’s Centennial Olympic Park spiked adjacent condominium prices
                                     from $115 to $250 per square foot.
                                     Parks increase municipal revenue. Increased property values also mean higher municipal revenue to
                                     cities from property taxes. Tax revenues from increased retail activity and tourism-related expenditures
                                     further increase city revenue. In Oakland, California, the presence of the East Bay Regional Park District
                                     is estimated to stimulate about $254 million annually in park-related purchases, of which $74 million is
                                     spent in the local East Bay economy.
                                     Parks attract businesses and workers. Parks and recreational amenities enhance quality of life and
                                     help attract both businesses and workers. Workers in what has been termed “the new economy” are
                                     selling knowledge as a main source of wealth creation and economic growth, as compared to physical
                                     labor. Since success and competitive advantage of knowledge-based businesses are increasingly tied to
                                     people rather than locations, people’s preferences for high-quality living environments are becoming
                                     important economic development considerations for cities and employers. A 1998 survey of 1,200 high-
                                     tech workers revealed that quality of life in a community increases job attractiveness by 33%.8

important community resources. Multimodal routes
will also provide connections to valuable water
access points provided by the Bay Water Trail and
the proposed Cultural Heritage Water Trail.
The Richmond Greenway, Cutting Boulevard and
Nevin and Solano avenues are envisioned as the pri-
mary east-west links through core neighborhoods.
The Greenway will ultimately link the Bay Trail
and the Ohlone Greenway. Creekside trails follow-
ing Brookside Drive and San Pablo Creek as well
as San Pablo and Rheem creeks will be explored as
potential east-west connections in North Richmond.                580
Marina/Giant Road and 23rd Street are major routes
connecting the north and south ends of the City, as
well as the San Francisco Bay Trail with segments
located on portions of the Richmond Parkway,

    Goals
    GOAL PR1: 	            An Integrated System of Parks, Green Streets and Trails
                           Develop strategies that will expand the system of large and small open spaces and community facilities linked together along natu-
                           ral creek channels, pedestrian-friendly green streets and multimodal corridors from the hills to the bay. Coordinate park develop-
                           ment and upgrades with pedestrian and bicycle improvements to safely and comfortably connect residents to valuable recreational
                           destinations. Create a system of parks that equitably serves diverse community needs, offers a range of park types, facilities and
                           activities and highlights natural features wherever possible. Provide more transit opportunities to improve access to parks and rec-
                           reation facilities.
    GOAL PR2: 	            Safe and High-Quality Parks and Recreational Facilities
                           Provide safe, high-quality, distinctive parks that support secure places for social interaction, community identity, beauty and liv-
                           ability. Base park designs on the unique cultural, historic and environmental setting of an area so that each park is distinctive.
                           Promote safety and activate parks by programming for broad appeal, encouraging flexible spaces to accommodate a wide range of
                           experiences and utilizing natural and technological surveillance measures.
    GOAL PR3: 	            Sustainable Design and Maintenance Practices
                           Use efficient and sustainable design and maintenance practices to conserve natural resources and support environmental steward-
                           ship. Where possible, highlight natural features, retrofit streets as green streets, expand urban greenery, daylight creeks, utilize nat-
                           ural systems to manage stormwater, and improve pedestrian and bicycle connections to encourage non-vehicular modes of transit.
                           Reliable, long-term maintenance practices are critical to maintaining area parks as community assets. Promote maintenance prac-
                           tices that are efficient, sustainable and equitable.
    GOAL PR4: 	            Stewardship of the Natural Environment
                           Improve access to natural environments as appropriate to varying levels of habitat sensitivity. Doing this will: contribute to
                           Richmond’s overall system of parks; enhance public enjoyment; provide public health benefits; offer convenient opportunities for
                           hands-on experiences in nature; and potentially strengthen stewardship and ongoing support for open space preservation. Increase
                           opportunities for contact with nature on a smaller scale by designing urban parks and play areas to incorporate natural features
                           such as unstructured natural settings or creeks. Contribute to raising public awareness of natural and cultural resources and the
                           value of connecting people to nature by encouraging interpretive features in the landscape and public education.

            Develop and expand recreational services and enrichment opportunities to best serve people of all incomes, cultural backgrounds,
            ages and levels of physical capability. Provide a range of conveniently accessible, stimulating programs and services that meet the

    Policies and Implementing Actions
    A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
    to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
    and resources should be focused.
    Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
    of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
    lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.

Goal PR1
An Integrated System of Parks, Green Streets and Trails
Policy PR1.1	   Diverse Range of Park Types and Functions
                Continue to provide a diverse range of park types, functions and recreational opportunities to meet the physical and social needs
                of the community. Regularly review the design and programming of all City parks to expand and diversify uses.
                See also: HW1.2
Policy PR1.2	   Multimodal Connections to Parks, Open Space and Recreational Facilities
                Improve connections to parks, open space and recreational facilities through an interconnected network of pedestrian-friendly
                green streets, multimodal corridors and trails. Enhance trails and greenways to provide recreational opportunities for residents,
                connect neighborhoods and community uses, improve access to natural resources and the shoreline and promote walking and
                bicycling. On-street connections should be pedestrian and bicycle-friendly and incorporate green infrastructure where pos-
                sible. Transit links along key corridors will allow residents and visitors to access parks, recreation facilities and open space areas.
                Developing open space and recreational resources hand-in-hand with pedestrian, bicycle and transit improvements will better link
                neighborhoods together physically, connecting the community to open space resources, community facilities and key destinations
                throughout the City.
Policy PR1.3	   Equitable Distribution of Park and Recreation Facilities
                Expand park and recreation opportunities in all neighborhoods and ensure that they are offered within comfortable walking
                distance of homes, schools and businesses in order to encourage more physically and socially active lifestyles. Continue to imple-
                ment the parkland development standard of three acres of community or neighborhood parkland per 1,000 population in each
                neighborhood planning area. This represents a minimum provision which should be exceeded whenever possible. In established
                neighborhoods where land availability for new large parks is limited, prioritize improvement and maintenance of compact parks,
                play lots and plazas to increase access to recreation opportunities for residents. Encourage developers to meet the City’s park devel-
                opment standard within their proposed development projects.

                           Promote access to non-City operated parks and recreational facilities. Existing resources operated by the East Bay Regional Parks
                           District, school district, community groups or others may support residents’ interim needs for convenient access to parks and
                           community centers. Joint-use opportunities serve to more efficiently utilize existing facilities and amenities, host programs in con-
                           venient neighborhood locations, better activate community areas so that they are in use during the day and in the evenings and
                           enable the City and partners to share the cost of maintenance, upgrades and improvements for the benefit of the entire commu-
                           nity.

Action PR1.A	   Community Access and Mobility Criteria
                Develop access and mobility criteria for capital improvement projects and new development to enhance physical access to com-
                munity facilities, schools, parks, shoreline open spaces, historical destinations, commercial and employment centers and transit
                hubs. The criteria should address access by walking, bicycling and public transit as well as vehicular access.
                The community access and mobility criteria should:
                •	 Ensure safe connections to large and small open spaces, community facilities such as schools, community centers, recreational
                    facilities, cultural and enrichment centers, historical destinations, transit hubs and commercial and employment centers;
                •	 Address travel routes, infrastructure improvement needs and barriers such as roads, railroad lines, freeways, fences and natural
                    features; and
                •	 Provide bicycle and pedestrian-friendly routes including completion of major trails and pathways like the San Francisco Bay
                    Trail and Richmond Greenway.

    Action PR1.B	          Park Performance Standards
                           Refine and utilize park performance standards within the Parks Master Plan including a classification system, park system guide-
                           lines and design criteria to guide development and management of parks and open spaces and ensure a high-quality, equitable
                           range of park types and functions distributed throughout the City.
                           Richmond’s park classification system identifies five major park types (with suggested acreages and service area radii) and a num-
                           ber of functions to serve a wide range of recreation and leisure activities appropriate to their surrounding context. The City’s
                           service goal specifies a minimum of three acres of community or neighborhood parkland per 1,000 residents. Parkland access
                           standards specify a need for neighborhood or community parks within a quarter to a half-mile radius of neighborhoods, ensuring
                           equitable and convenient access. These standards represent minimum provisions which the City should strive to exceed whenever
                           possible. A comprehensive parks master planning process will provide an opportunity to further tailor Richmond’s parkland types,
                           and a citywide community needs assessment will pinpoint areas where facilities and services will benefit most from improvement.
                           Park system guidelines and design criteria should be developed to direct design decisions and ensure high-quality parks. In addi-
                           tion to these overarching system guidelines, more specific design criteria should be developed to ensure that each park fits its
                           context and functions effectively in connecting community members to one another and their environment. Design criteria will
                           specify that parks: utilize high-quality, sustainable building materials; provide a variety of landscape elements; include art and
                           placemaking features to reflect the culture, values and history of the community; separate incompatible uses; connect open space
                           areas where feasible; include adequate signage and information describing codes of conduct and City regulations; and incorporate
                           facility maintenance standards and requirements as part of the design review process; among others. These design criteria are fur-
                           ther developed as part of the parks master planning process.

                    and expanding or initiating new programs and services;
                •	 Present a long-range plan for physical park and community facility improvements;
                •	 Refine performance standards and further develop park design guidelines and criteria;
                •	 Develop a long-term strategy for the Richmond Greenway;
                •	 Prioritize projects in areas that are underserved, deficient in parks and in need of facility improvements; and
                •	 Outline funding mechanisms and strategies for managing the City’s commitments so that new requests and initiatives are con-
                    sidered in light of existing commitments.

    Action PR1.D	          Parkland Acquisition Plan
                           Support the efforts of the East Bay Regional Parks District to retain and acquire land for the expansion of existing parks such as
                           the Point Isabel Regional Shoreline. Based upon the findings of the Parks Master Plan, develop a parkland acquisition plan for
                           achieving better distribution of parks in all neighborhood planning areas of the City and accomplishing an integrated system of
                           parks. Identify areas that may need more parklands including: densely populated neighborhoods with limited open space; areas
                           that are more than ½-mile from a neighborhood or community park; areas where substantial new housing growth is expected
                           based on this General Plan; and areas where the existing recreational facilities need enhancement.
                           Prioritize park development along corridors where pedestrian and bicycle improvements are planned and target underserved areas
                           and potential infill areas with space for new parks. Consider innovative and alternative strategies to provide park recreation space
                           such as soccer fields and gardens over parking structures. Include policies that promote community ownership and use of left-over
                           spaces in the City that may be blighted or unsafe. Support residents in their efforts to develop community gardens which will help
                           promote a local food program. Identify potential funding sources.
                           Confirm a range of acquisition strategies including easements, donations, land purchases and park set-asides, parkland dedication
                           or in-lieu fees for new or redevelopment projects. Bolster these strategies by applicable agency agreements, development agree-
                           ments, conditions of approval, CC&R’s and dedicated deposits, among others. Include considerations for trail and greenway
                           expansion. New trails and greenways may be developed to connect parks, community facilities and other City destinations such as
                           commercial centers and neighborhoods. Additional preliminary strategies include:
                           •	 Building an inventory of underutilized or unfavorable commercial sites and focus efforts on acquiring these parcels as oppor-
                                tunities arise;
                           •	 Collaborating with developers, landowners and business owners to integrate small transit-oriented pocket parks or plazas into
                                redevelopment projects on commercial corridors; and
                           •	   Prioritizing park development along corridors where pedestrian and bicycle improvements are planned and acquiring parcels in
                                residential areas as land becomes available to develop neighborhood or compact parks.

Action PR1.E	   Shoreline Parks Plan
                Within the framework of the Parks Master Plan, coordinate with other agencies and community groups to explore the potential
                for creating new parks and facilities particularly along the San Pablo Peninsula. Trails and greenways along the scenic shoreline
                should be enhanced to provide recreational opportunities and circulation access and to develop the shoreline as a visitor destina-
                tion. Whenever possible, expand shoreline access and the development of both land and water sports and recreation activities
                along Richmond’s waterfront and shoreline (including creating a shoreline visitor water shuttle in partnership with the National
                Park Service) while respecting natural resources and considering impacts on the environment.
                Coordinate efforts with community groups, property owners, and the BCDC to analyze gaps and identify opportunity sites for
                completing the Bay Trail; identification of routes and improvements needed to connect the shoreline with core urban areas of the
                City; bicycle and pedestrian trails to provide local connections between the waterfront and surrounding neighborhoods; and provi-
                sions to complete planned regional trails including the San Francisco Bay Trail, Richmond Greenway and Wildcat Creek Regional
                Trail. The Shoreline Parks Plan will be developed in coordination with specific plans for the waterfront. The Plan will also con-

Safe and High-Quality Parks and Recreational Services
Policy PR2.1	  High-Quality, Distinctive Parks
               Provide safe, high-quality and distinctive community gathering places with broad appeal. Designing parks with attention to place-
               making will foster social interaction, community identity, beauty and livability. Each park in the City should try to draw on the
               unique cultural, historic or environmental qualities of an area to create high-quality, distinctive parks where people of all ages and
               abilities can share experiences.
Policy PR2.2	  Safe Public Spaces and Facilities
               Protect visitors of parks and recreational facilities from exposure to structural and safety hazards, wildland fires, crime and other natural
               or human-induced incidents and promote park and facility design that discourages vandalism, deters crime, provides natural surveillance
               and creates a safe and comfortable environment. Improving public safety can be accomplished by appropriately designing parks, trails
               and recreation facilities, and by providing safe outdoor play structures and equipment in City-owned and operated facilities. Ensure fire
               safety in areas adjacent to open spaces prone to wild fires.
               See also: HW1.6
Policy PR2.3	  Active Use and Natural Surveillance
               Provide a comprehensive range of programs to aid in natural surveillance. A robust schedule of programs, activities and services
               that serve community needs will encourage active use of facilities throughout the day, providing natural surveillance. Likewise,
               creating safe environments will encourage social gatherings and interaction in community facilities. Provide oversight by trained
               park stewards and law enforcement officers.

Action PR3.A	   Sustainability Guidelines for Parks and Recreation Facilities
                Promote sustainability principles in the City’s park performance standards. The guidelines could be developed as part of the Parks
                Master Plan. Key components of Richmond’s parks and open space system should include developing green buildings and infra-
                structure, using green streets and multi-use trails to link open spaces, expanding urban greenery and utilizing natural systems to
                manage stormwater. Sustainability guidelines for parks should further guide the City in supporting environmental stewardship by:
                •	 Reducing impacts on the natural environment;
                •	 Promoting green infrastructure and building to protect and enhance the natural environment while reducing ongoing costs
                    for maintenance;
                •	 Integrating City activities with educational programs to raise awareness in schools and the community;
                •	 Integrating daylighted creeks into green street design where possible, along with porous paving and vegetation to improve
                    water quality and reduce demand on the City’s stormwater drainage system;
                •	 Expanding urban greenery and highlighting natural features (both along the City’s streets and in public parks and urban spac-
                    es) to support and connect species habitat and create more park-like conditions in neighborhoods; and
                •	 Redesigning streets to be bicycle and pedestrian-friendly and developing multi-use trails to encourage non-vehicular modes of
                    transit.

    Action PR5.F	          Richmond Shuttle Service Feasibility Study
                           Explore the potential for a City-operated shuttle service to complement transit and paratransit services in Richmond. The shuttle
                           service could link key destinations throughout the City including schools, community facilities, parks, major employment centers,
                           commercial centers, health facilities, transit centers and neighborhoods. In addition, the service should provide convenient week-
                           end access between neighborhoods and cultural, recreational and commercial destinations such as regional open space, national
                           park sites, museums, cultural events and the Downtown. Based on feasibility study outcomes, develop follow-up steps such as a
                           plan for service delivery and funding.

Bay Trail Plan
The plan for the Bay Trail proposes development
of a regional hiking and bicycling trail around the
perimeter of San Francisco and San Pablo Bays.
The Plan was prepared by the Association of Bay
Area Governments (ABAG) pursuant to Senate
Bill 100, which mandated that the Bay Trail pro-
vide connections to existing park and recreation
facilities, create links to existing and proposed
transportation facilities, and be planned in such a
way as to avoid adverse effects on environmentally
sensitive areas.
City of Richmond Municipal Code
Chapter 10.08 of the City of Richmond Municipal
Code empowers the Parks and Landscaping
Superintendent to decide on and direct all selec-
tions, trimming, pruning, care, plantings and
removals of trees and other vegetation in the public
realm.

1 Economic Development
   Richmond General Plan 2030
Community Vision
Richmond, California in 2030
Richmond is home to a variety of employers in key industries including green businesses,
high-technology, manufacturing, distribution, petroleum refining, retail/entertainment and
shipping. Richmond’s skilled workforce enjoys a variety of jobs that offer opportunities for
building equity — contributing to overall community health and individual achievement.
Transformed waterfront areas including the Southern Shoreline and San Pablo Peninsula
provide recreational opportunities for residents and visitors and attract new residential
and commercial development. A range of housing options are available to meet the needs
of all segments of the population, and well-maintained streets and properties contribute to
a sense of neighborhood pride.
The City has unique mixed-use corridors that offer a range of local-serving commercial
establishments, attractive streetscapes, higher-density housing and convenient and effi-
cient circulation. Macdonald Avenue, Hilltop Mall and the Ferry Terminal in Marina Bay are
major activity centers, offering attractive retail and office space and a rich offering of arts,
music and dining.

Citywide Goals
The Economic Development Element goals are organized into two topic areas: goals that pertain to the City as a whole and goals that relate to specific
geographic areas. Citywide goals that Richmond seeks to achieve through the Economic Development Element are presented below and area specific goals
are presented starting on page 1.24.
Goal ED1: 	               An Appealing Place to Live and Work
                          Foster neighborhoods, commercial and industrial areas and public spaces that are safe and welcoming environments to live, work
                          and visit. Effective public safety services, neighborhood revitalization efforts, opportunities for cultural and recreational activities,
                          affordable housing, socially and environmentally responsible businesses and a diverse and expanded tax base will contribute to this
                          environment.
Goal ED2: 	               Quality Jobs and Revenue
                          Create an attractive business environment that will support business recruitment, expansion and retention. Attract a variety of
                          small and large firms, national and local establishments, and up-and-coming industries and employers across a variety of economic
                          sectors. Offer a broad range of quality employment opportunities for current and future residents with varying degrees of experi-
                          ence, education and training.
Goal ED3: 	               An Educated and Skilled Workforce
                          Develop a skilled and educated workforce to support existing businesses and emerging industries. Equip residents with the skills
                          and education necessary to participate in local and regional economies across a variety of sectors, and be fully engaged in the
                          workforce. Encourage existing employers to expand and new employers to move their operations into they City by providing a
                          strong local labor pool.
                                                                                                              shap i n g      th e    n e w    1 0 0  y e ars       | 1.11
   1 Economic Development
     Citywide Policies and Implementing Actions
     A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
     to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
     and resources should be focused.
     Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
     of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
     lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.

Goal ed1
An Appealing Place to Live and Work
Policy ED1.1	  Safe, Well-Maintained Neighborhoods and Public Spaces
               Reduce crime and violence and maintain safe and clean neighborhoods and public spaces. Poorly maintained and underutilized
               streets and property can detract from Richmond’s image as a viable place to live and do business. Assertive code enforcement by
               the City will help ensure that Richmond’s neighborhoods are safe and retain their value.
Policy ED1.2	  High Quality Infrastructure and Public Services
               Provide a range of high quality infrastructure and public services for residents and visitors. Adequate and well-maintained infra-
               structure such as streets, freeways and utilities are essential for improving the quality of life for residents and attracting businesses
               to locate in Richmond. Public amenities such as schools, libraries, parks, emergency and public safety services and public transit
               add to the attractiveness of a community.
Policy ED1.3	  Toxic and Contaminated Sites
               Continue to work with the appropriate local, state, and federal agencies to promote the clean-up and reuse of contaminated sites
               to protect human and environmental health. Work with property owners and regional agencies to prevent, reduce or eliminate
               soil and water contamination from industrial operations, the Port and other activities that use, produce or dispose of hazardous or
               toxic substances. Implement appropriate mitigation measures and clean-up of sites that are known to contain toxic materials as a
               condition of reuse. Support the remediation and reuse of large, disturbed sites, such as the Winehaven complex at Point Molate
               and the Terminal 4 site at Point San Pablo, into mixed-use centers that provide the maximum benefit to the community without
               compromising the integrity of the surrounding natural areas.

     Policy ED1.4	        Air Quality
                          Support regional policies and efforts that improve air quality to protect human and environmental health and minimize dispro-
                          portionate impacts on sensitive population groups. Work with businesses and industry, residents and regulatory agencies to reduce
                          the impact of direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of stationary and non-stationary sources of pollution such as industry, the
                          Port, railroads, diesel trucks and busy roadways. Fully utilize Richmond’s police power to regulate industrial and commercial
                          emissions. Ensure that sensitive uses such as schools, childcare centers, parks and playgrounds, housing and community gathering
                          places are protected from adverse impacts of emissions.
                          Continue to work with stakeholders to reduce impacts associated with air quality on disadvantaged neighborhoods and continue
                          to participate in regional planning efforts with nearby jurisdictions and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to meet or
                          exceed air quality standards. Support regional, state and federal efforts to enforce existing pollution control laws and strengthen
                          regulations.

     Policy ED1.5	        A Range of Housing Types
                          Continue to require developers to provide a range of housing types and residential densities to meet the needs of all age groups,
                          income levels, and household sizes. In the Bay Area’s high-priced housing market, employers often look to relatively affordable
                          housing as factors in location decisions. The local housing stock should continue to include condominiums, single-family homes,
                          apartments, townhouses, lofts and other products to provide a range of options.
     Policy ED1.6	        Leveraging Richmond’s Diversity
                          Leverage Richmond’s diversity into local economic development by promoting cultural tourism and establishing a unique, market-
                          able identity for Richmond. Support the expansion of arts, food, festivals, museums and music. Events associated with arts and
                          culture can serve as major attractions for new businesses and residents that support the Bay Area’s knowledge-based economy. The
                          City can also attract culturally-based retail establishments and eateries that reflect Richmond’s diversity.

                riers to employment such as youth, seniors, the formerly incarcerated, and residents with limited English proficiency. Richmond’s
                economy should offer a broad range of quality employment opportunities for current and future residents with varying degrees of
                experience, education and training. By expanding and diversifying the local employment base, Richmond can establish itself as a
                major employment center in Contra Costa County and along the Interstate 80 and 580 corridors.
                Encourage businesses and industries that provide a safe work environment, living wages and benefits, and opportunities for skill
                development and advancement. Allow a range of industries and business types including a variety of small and large firms, estab-
                lished and up-and-coming industries, national and local establishments and employers across a variety of economic sectors includ-
                ing publicly owned and private port facilities.

                space along commercial corridors and office and light industrial space close to regional transportation infrastructure. Provide

                         will strengthen the local employment base. The City’s central location, transit and freeway access are strengths that will be lever-
                         aged. These strengths particularly benefit companies that require a mix of traditional office and industrial space for manufactur-
                         ing, research and development, assembly, and distribution. The Port of Richmond with its bay access provides an advantage in

                         local hiring ordinances. Encourage businesses and industries to participate in civic life and play a positive role in the community.

     Area-Specific Goals
     In addition to the citywide goals presented in the previous section, the City has identified goals that relate to some of its specific geographic areas. These
     are target areas or “change areas” that are slated for more significant change in land uses and development character under the General Plan. The following
     goals and the policies described in the next section link land use and economic development in key areas of the City.
     Goal ED4: 	                A Revitalized Downtown
                                Promote Downtown and Macdonald Avenue as the heart of Richmond’s cultural and civic life by encouraging a blend of retail,
                                office space and personal service establishments. Contribute to the Downtown’s vitality by providing safe, clean streets with signa-
                                ture urban design elements that announce entry into Central Richmond and higher density housing that is well served by transit.
     Goal ED5: 	                Mixed-Uses along Key Commercial Corridors
                                Transform Richmond’s key corridors into diverse, mixed-use streets that serve residents with a variety of retail options and services.
                                Create a distinct identity and role for each corridor and offer a unique set of local-serving commercial establishments, attractive
                                streetscapes, higher-density housing and convenient and efficient circulation.
     Goal ED6: 	                A Regional Destination at Hilltop Mall
                                Expand the Hilltop area’s role as a regional destination for retail and employment blended with a mix of higher-density residential
                                development. Continue to support the Hilltop area so that it remains a major source of sales tax for the City.
     Goal ED7: 	                Mixed-Uses along the Richmond Parkway
                                Transform the Richmond Parkway into an attractive thoroughfare that provides access to clean and well-maintained industrial
                                zones, economically well-served residential neighborhoods and open space areas. Support the Parkway’s emergence as a new dis-
                                trict of Richmond that is characterized by improved landscaping, streetscape and building design.

Goal ED8: 	 A Thriving Mixed-Use Neighborhood along the Southern Shoreline
            Transform the Southern Shoreline into a model mixed-use neighborhood characterized by green development, parks and open
            space, a fully developed university research and development campus, new employment centers, attractive residential communities,
            a connection to regional ferry services, an accessible shoreline and a modern port. Incorporate a range of commercial uses includ-
            ing industrial activities, high-technology and professional firms and a local-serving retail, as well as medium to higher-density
            housing outside of the Harbour Way-Marina Way South Industrial Buffer Zone (referred to in the Land Use and Urban Design
            Element as the Transitional Zone Overlay District) and other designated buffers. Expand public improvements along the Southern
            Shoreline to offer access to the Richmond waterfront for recreational activities which take advantage of impressive Bay views.
Goal ED9: 	 A Regional Recreational Destination on the San Pablo Peninsula
            Transform the San Pablo Peninsula into a major regional open space, parks and recreation resource, offering public access to the
            shoreline, regional entertainment, retail, lodging and dining opportunities. Contribute to this mix by encouraging residential
            development which takes advantage of the areas’ spectacular Bay views.
                                                                                             shap i n g       th e    n e w   1 0 0  y e ars  | 1.27

     Area-Specific Policies and Implementing Actions
     A range of policies and actions are outlined in this section in relation to specific areas where the greatest level of change is anticipated through the initia-
     tion of the General Plan. As reviewed in the citywide policy discussion, policies mandate, encourage our permit certain actions to be pursued throughout
     the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time and resources should be
     focused.
     Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
     of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
     lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.

Goal ed4
a Revitalized Downtown
Policy ED4.1	   Higher-Density and Mixed-Use Infill Development
                Provide higher-density and infill mixed-use development affordable to all incomes on vacant and underutilized parcels in the
                Downtown and along Macdonald Avenue. Ensure efficient use of land and existing circulation infrastructure by:
                •	 Promoting higher-density, transit-oriented and pedestrian-friendly development along key commercial corridors, at key inter-
                     sections (community nodes and gateways); and
                •	 Supporting local-serving commercial activities in residential areas to provide needed services and amenities close to where
                     people live and work.
Policy ED4.2	   Safe and Walkable Streets
                Provide a safe and comfortable walking environment in the Downtown and along Macdonald Avenue. Encourage land uses,
                design guidelines, landscaping and infrastructure that supports active use of public areas. Higher level of use will contribute to
                more “eyes-on-the-street” that deters crime and supports economic activity.
Policy ED4.3	   Well-Maintained Properties
                Encourage owners to maintain their property in the Downtown and along the Macdonald Avenue and its surrounding residential
                neighborhoods. Improving the physical appearance of properties is a critical step towards attracting new residents, employers and
                visitors to Richmond.
Policy ED4.4	   Arts and Cultural Resources
                Support arts resources in the Downtown and along Macdonald Avenue. The Richmond Art Center and East Bay Center for
                Performing Arts are prime assets for enhancing Richmond’s identity and image, and can help attract visitors and community
                members to Downtown Richmond.
                                                                                               shap i n g      th e     n e w    1 0 0  y e ars    | 1.29

     Goal ed4
     a Revitalized Downtown
     Action ED4.A	       Macdonald Avenue Economic Revitalization Plan
                         Continue to update and implement the Macdonald Avenue Economic Revitalization Plan. The Plan calls for new development
                         along Macdonald Avenue’s eastern end to concentrate activity around the rebuilt Macdonald Avenue/Interstate 80 Regional
                         Shopping Center by taking advantage of the site’s access to Interstate 80. The central part of Macdonald Avenue is envisioned as
                         a higher-density activity node, focused around the BART/Amtrak station with new multi-family housing and more local-serving
                         retail in a mixed-use format.
                         See also: LU1.C
     Action ED4.B	       Richmond Main Street Initiative
                         Regularly review and update the Main Street Initiative program. Successful Main Street programs require a pro-active, hands-on
                         approach to working with merchants, improving communications between stakeholders, marketing the neighborhood, leveraging
                         resources for physical improvements and services and building a sense of community among tenants and property owners. As the
                         Macdonald Avenue Economic Revitalization Plan gains momentum and the Civic Center Master Plan is completed, the Main
                         Street Initiative will further extend these revitalization efforts.
     Action ED4.C	       Cultural District Designation
                         Explore the potential for defining focal areas or districts in the Downtown and along Macdonald Avenue as cultural, historic and/
                         or arts-related activity hubs. Promoting areas of the City where there is a concentration of arts, historic and culture-related activi-
                         ties, sites, installations and/or institutions can provide benefits such as: increasing visibility of revitalization efforts by concentrat-
                         ing energy into catalytic nodes; promoting historic and cultural awareness and preservation; and serving as a marketing tool for
                         increasing cultural tourism, business activity, visitors and residents to Richmond. In the case of arts districts, designating focal
                         areas could also serve as a spring board for enticing people to live and work in the area. Ideally, districts or zones should be walk-
                         able areas that may include galleries; live-work studios; arts-related retail; and entertainment and performance facilities; and/or
                         historic features.

Goal ed5
Mixed Uses along Key Corridors
Policy ED5.1	  Higher-Density and Mixed-Use Infill Development
               Provide higher-density and infill mixed-use development affordable to all incomes on vacant and underutilized parcels along
               Richmond’s key commercial corridors including Macdonald Avenue, San Pablo Avenue, 23rd Street, Cutting Boulevard, Carlson
               Boulevard, Harbour Way and Marina Way. Ensure efficient use of land and existing circulation infrastructure by:
               •	 Promoting higher-density, transit-oriented and pedestrian-friendly development along key commercial corridors, at key inter-
                   sections (community nodes and gateways); and
               •	 Supporting local-serving commercial activities in residential areas to provide needed services and amenities close to where
                   people live and work.
Policy ED5.2	  Safe and Walkable Streets
               Promote a safe and comfortable walking environment along key commercial corridors and neighborhood streets. Encourage land
               uses, design guidelines, landscaping and infrastructure that supports active use of public areas. Higher level of use will contribute
               to more “eyes-on-the-street” that deters crime and supports economic activity.
Policy ED5.3	  Inter-Jurisdictional Collaboration
               Collaborate with neighboring jurisdictions to plan improvements along key corridors. Engage the jurisdictions in establishing
               development regulations to maintain a consistent and attractive streetscape along the 23rd Street Corridor and San Pablo Avenue
               which extend into the Cities of Richmond, San Pablo and El Cerrito.
                                                                                               shap i n g        th e   n e w    1 0 0   y e ars     | 1. 31

     Goal ed5
     Mixed Uses along Key Corridors
     Action ED5.A	       San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan
                         Collaborate with the City of El Cerrito to adopt and implement the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan, which includes the corridor
                         between Macdonald Avenue and El Cerrito Plaza. The San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan will help revitalize a neighborhood that
                         remains largely isolated from the rest of Richmond. New residential and commercial development along this stretch of San Pablo
                         Avenue will set various density levels in identified segments of the corridor as well as urban design and land use standards that can
                         be replicated along the rest of the corridor as it continues north into Richmond.
     Action ED5.B	       23rd Street Specific Plan
                         Collaborate with the City of San Pablo to extend the 23rd Street Specific Plan area into Richmond. As one of the City’s main
                         commercial corridors serving the Latino and other immigrant communities, the 23rd Street Corridor represents an opportunity to
                         leverage the City’s cultural diversity into an economic development resource. Include design and infrastructure features in the 23rd
                         Street Specific Plan that support higher-density and mixed-use development, pedestrian and bicycle uses, public safety and active
                         use and public transit service.
     Action ED5.C	       Gateway Improvement Plans
                         Consider developing an improvement plan for major intersections that serve as gateways into the community. Primary gateways
                         along key corridors including Harbour Way, Cutting Boulevard and Macdonald Avenue should incorporate signage, landscaping,
                         public art and other urban design features. This is particularly important given the City’s interwoven boundaries with neighboring
                         cities.

Goal ed6
A Regional Destination at Hilltop Mall
Policy ED6.1	   Higher-Density and Mixed Use Infill Development
                Provide higher-density and infill mixed-use development affordable to all incomes on vacant and underutilized parcels in the
                Hilltop area. Ensure efficient use of land and existing circulation infrastructure by:
                •	 Promoting higher-density, transit-oriented and pedestrian-friendly development along key commercial corridors, at key inter-
                    sections (community nodes and gateways); and
                •	 Supporting local-serving commercial activities in residential areas to provide needed services and amenities close to where
                    people live and work.
Policy ED6.2	   Regional Retail
                Encourage expansion of regional commercial uses to capture retail revenue and provide amenities to Richmond residents. Position
                the Hilltop area as a region-serving retail area with an emphasis on destination shopping. The Hilltop area should complement
                rather than compete with the community-oriented services available on Macdonald Avenue in Downtown Richmond.
Policy ED6.3	   Neighborhood Retail
                Promote local-serving retail and public amenities at key locations within residential neighborhoods along key corridors. Support
                development of small-scale neighborhood nodes that provide a range of neighborhood-serving retail, public amenities and ser-
                vices to residents within walking distance of their homes. Revitalizing Richmond’s neighborhoods can reduce dependence on cars,
                improve access to daily goods and services, promote small business development and increase opportunities for social interaction
                and reduce crime by increasing street use and natural surveillance.

     Goal ed6
     A Regional Destination at Hilltop Mall
     Action ED6.A	       Hilltop Area Specific Plan
                         Develop a specific plan for the Hilltop Area to guide development of a mixed-use neighborhood and a regional retail destination.
                         As an older indoor shopping center, the Hilltop Mall must compete with newer region-serving power and lifestyle retail centers in
                         Pinole and Emeryville. A reinvigorated center would allow the mall to draw shoppers from other communities along the Interstate
                         80 corridor. Hilltop’s surplus surface parking represents an opportunity for creative consideration of more contemporary shopping
                         center formats.
                         Include signage to provide clear directions from the Richmond Parkway, Interstate 80 and surrounding residential areas to and
                         between the Hilltop Mall, the Hilltop Auto Mall and Hilltop plaza. Include recommendations for streetscape, circulation and
                         infrastructure improvements that will enhance this area’s ability to attract new residential, office and retail development. Identify
                         strategies to promote local-serving retail in mixed-use projects at major intersections and along commercial corridors.

Mixed Uses along the Richmond Parkway
Policy ED7.1	  A Mix of Land Uses
               Promote a range and mix of uses to create a balanced community along the Richmond Parkway. Maintain the area’s primary role
               as an industrial district while allowing for commercial and residential uses in strategic locations along the corridor.
Policy ED7.2	  Land Use Compatibility
               Minimize conflicts between land uses to protect wetlands, marshlands, and creeks, human and environmental health and safety,
               preserve community character and retain job generating activities that have long-term viability. Types, intensities and ranges of
               use and development should be compatible with existing uses and should minimize or eliminate conflicts that adversely impact
               wetlands, marshlands, creeks, mudflats, public safety, human or environmental health or generate nuisances. All new development
               must avoid or mitigate to the greatest extent feasible potential negative impacts such as noise, odors, and pollution.
               Consistent with the City’s Industrial Buffer Zone Ordinance, prohibit the location of residential uses in the area between Harbour
               Way South and Marina Way South and between Interstate 580 and Hall Avenue.
               Encourage existing larger industries that have surplus land to develop modern industrial parks that could attract new and existing
               industries and facilitate a reduction of existing and future land use conflicts.
               New development should complement the character and scale of existing neighborhoods, cultural resources, historic structures
               and landscapes. In particular, existing industrial and residential uses can successfully coexist through well-conceived circulation
               and urban design strategies including buffers (which may be in the form of sound walls and/or enclosed buildings and appropriate
               transitional habitat zones between wetlands, marshlands, creeks, and mudflats) and transitional uses, rerouting of truck traffic and
               design components that mark transitions in land use. Similar to other cities that host mixed uses, consider requiring land use cov-
               enants for new development in areas where new uses may generate a perception of conflict with existing uses. Require sufficient
               visual open space and/or landscaped screening between industrial operations and adjacent residential or recreational activities in
               order to create adequate buffers.

     Policy ED7.3	       Open Space, Natural Habitat and Recreation
                         Encourage open space, natural habitat and recreational opportunities along the shoreline. Work with the East Bay Regional Park
                         District to improve facilities, highlight the shoreline’s presence and develop complementary businesses to serve visitors and protect
                         the natural habitat along the shoreline. Open space along the Richmond Parkway, particularly Point Pinole Regional Shoreline,
                         represents an underutilized resource for the community.
     Policy ED7.4	       Neighborhood-Serving Retail
                         Promote local-serving retail and public amenities at key locations within residential neighborhoods along the Richmond Parkway.
                         Support development of small-scale neighborhood nodes that provide a range of neighborhood-serving retail, public amenities and
                         services to residents within walking distance of their homes. Revitalizing Richmond’s neighborhoods can reduce dependence on
                         cars, improve access to daily goods and services, promote small business development and increase opportunities for social interac-
                         tion and reduce crime by increasing street use and natural surveillance.
     Policy ED7.5	       Point Richmond Neighborhood
                         Celebrate and promote Point Richmond and its neighborhood attractions within the City and to the region. As Richmond’s
                         Downtown area until the early 1900s, Point Richmond maintains its small-town character and enjoys a tight-knit and well-
                         organized community of residents and business owners. Attractions in the neighborhood include restaurants, shops, the Point
                         Richmond Music Festival and Masquers Playhouse.

               Develop strategies to improve the Richmond Parkway’s visual appeal. Work with major employers and other stakeholders in the
               area to plan for and fund landscaping, signage, lighting, regular maintenance, design guidelines and other elements. Identify street
               and intersection improvements that better link the Richmond Parkway with major destinations in the City.
Action ED7.B	  Industrial Use Buffers - Expanded Definition
               New industrial uses established adjacent to existing residential or commercial uses shall incorporate measures to minimize impacts
               to residential uses such as enclosure of industrial activities in buildings, use of screening for visually unattractive uses, site design,
               soundproofing and landscaping. New residential and commercial uses established adjacent to existing industrial uses shall incorpo-
               rate measures to minimize impacts to residents from noise, exposure to toxic substance emissions, vibration, odors and truck traf-
               fic. Industrial sites may incorporate supporting office and commercial space if protected to commercial standards.

                         Promote a balanced mix of office, retail, light industrial, and open space uses in the Southern Gateway Change Area to encour-
                         age green businesses and other high-technology and research and development firms to locate in Richmond. Partner with the UC
                         Berkeley Field Station to attract and expand new technology firms in the area. The UC Berkeley Field Station is an underutilized
                         resource with regard to local economic development. Encourage the university to identify opportunities to integrate UC Berkeley
                         Field Station research activity with private sector firms in Richmond.
     Policy ED8.2	       Land Use Compatibility
                         Minimize conflicts between land uses to protect wetlands, marshlands, and creeks, human and environmental health and safety,
                         preserve community character and retain job generating activities that have long-term viability. Types, intensities and ranges of

Policy ED8.3	   Ferry Terminal at the Ford Peninsula in Marina Bay
                Support and promote the location of the ferry terminal at the Ford Peninsula in Marina Bay. Work closely with the Water
                Emergency Transportation Authority in its efforts to implement the proposed ferry terminal project. Providing fast and efficient
                transit to San Francisco via a ferry terminal would further enhance the Southern Shoreline’s appeal to residents and businesses.
                The terminal could also provide a focus for transit-oriented development and can aid in disaster relief.
                See also: LU1.6
Policy ED8.4	   Public Access to the Shoreline
                Improve public access to the shoreline. Support the expansion of trails, viewpoints and supporting infrastructure to fully capitalize
                on the shoreline’s prime access to the Bay, while protecting natural resource areas such as marshlands and wetlands. Promote recre-
                ational activities, such as hiking, biking, kayaking, bird watching, and fishing, that respect the Bay and enhance the shoreline as a
                valuable resource for the community.
Policy ED8.5	   Connections and Linkages
                Enhance connections and linkages between activity centers and major destinations in the City and the region. Work with local
                transit agencies to enhance transit service to the Southern Shoreline. Improved connections and linkages will be critical to attract
                new residential and commercial development proposed within Marina Bay and to support the proposed ferry terminal.
                Improve connections within the Downtown and Civic Center area and to adjacent neighborhoods. Support increased connectivity
                between the Richmond BART/Amtrak Station, Civic Center, Kaiser Hospital and the historic areas of Downtown, the proposed
                ferry terminal, regional recreation areas, the shoreline, and other Bay Area communities.

                         Encourage growth and modernization of private port businesses and the Port of Richmond. Develop the Ford Peninsula area
                         in Marina Bay as a working waterfront that supports the Port’s operations and provides opportunities for recreation, housing,
                         retail and job-generating uses; promote modern and sustainable operations; and preserve historic and cultural assets related to
                         Richmond’s World War II home front history. Continue to work with state and federal agencies to establish programs that will
                         reduce or eliminate emissions from ocean going vessels and encourage Port industries to reduce health and environmental impacts
                         from related rail and truck traffic.

                         in the City. The City supports property owners in their efforts to implement improvements such as landscaping, signage, light-
                         ing and other urban design elements. These steps will help promote these areas as models for mixed-use development and attract
                         the co-location of residential and industrial uses in areas where they do not currently exist. Develop urban design guidelines and
                         require these to be incorporated into new development and encourage their application by existing uses.

     Policy ED9.1	       A Mix of Land Uses
                         Promote a mix of uses to create a complete community in the San Pablo Peninsula area. Develop lodging and visitor-serving con-
                         cessions (such as cafes, bike and kayak rental kiosks) to elevate the San Pablo Peninsula as a local and regional destination and
                         complement its potential development as a resort and entertainment center. Residential uses should also be explored for the area
                         to add to its 24-hour vitality and to capitalize on Bay views.
     Policy ED9.2	       Public Access to the Shoreline
                         Improve public access to the Bay. Expand trails, viewpoints, parking, interpretive signs, restrooms and other supporting infrastruc-
                         ture to allow visitors easy access to green space, the shoreline and Winehaven. The San Pablo Peninsula should also offer indoor/
                         outdoor recreation opportunities including active and passive open space (such as sports fields, trails, picnic areas and campsites)
                         as well as family-oriented museums and interactive visitor centers. Fully improved, this area has the potential to become a valuable
                         amenity for the community as well as a regional destination.

Community Vision
Richmond, California in 2030
Richmond is recognized as a healthy, environmentally sustainable city that actively pur-
sues strategies to improve and sustain air and water quality, and control and remediate
environmental contaminants. Residents are stewards in caring for their local community
and the greater environment. The City’s commitment to preventative health measures is
evident in the steady decrease in the occurrence of diabetes, asthma, heart disease, can-
cer and other physical and emotional ailments.
Pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods contain an array of neighborhood services, schools,
medical facilities and recreational destinations that can be comfortably reached by walk-
ing, bicycling or public transit. The community enjoys a broad spectrum of healthy food
choices provided by nearby produce markets, full-service grocery stores, urban produce
stands and farmers’ markets. High-quality, clean and well-utilized parks and community
facilities support residents’ active lifestyles and provide safe places for social interaction.
Richmond’s neighborhood schools are thriving centers that educate children and parents
about healthy eating. The schools promote physical fitness as a strategy for improving
learning and health. The number of residents pursuing higher education is growing and
expanded local employment opportunities increasingly exceed living wage rates. Richmond
offers a wide range of affordable housing options that improve the quality of life for com-
munity members. Overall, residents enjoy healthy lifestyles and are committed to teaching
their children how to make healthy food and behavior choices.

Richmond Today
Richmond is the largest of five cities located in
western Contra Costa County. It is a transportation
hub with diverse auto, rail and local transporta-
tion options and an active deep water sea port.
Richmond’s rich cultural and industrial history
dating back to the early 19th century was shaped
dramatically by its role as home to major World War
II shipyards and industries. Although Richmond’s

Parks and Recreational Facilities
Convenient access to parks, open space, quality rec-
reational facilities, and programs result in an increase
of physical activity.5 The many health benefits of
physical activity include: reduced risks of coronary
heart disease, hypertension, stroke, some cancers,
diabetes, and a reduced risk of premature mortality.6
Regular participation in physical activity can also
provide social and emotional benefits by reducing
depression, stress and anxiety, improving mood and
enhancing the ability to perform daily tasks.7

                                                                         A food system refers to all of the events that bring food to our table and how it is disposed.

      Policies and Implementing Actions
      A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
      to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
      and resources should be focused.
      Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
      of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
      lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.

Goal HW1
Improved Access to Parks and Open Space
Policy HW1.1	  An Integrated System of Parks, Plazas, Playgrounds and Open Space
               Provide a comprehensive and integrated system of parks, plazas, playgrounds, trails and open space. The community’s current and
               future needs for quality outdoor space can be met by improving existing parks, creating linear greenways in established neighborhoods,
               and creating new parks, plazas and open space in new developments. A comprehensive, integrated system should include parks, play-
               grounds, community greens, greenways and trails. Ensure adequate maintenance of these facilities to encourage safe and active use.
Policy HW1.2	  Diverse Range of Park Types and Functions
               Continue to provide a diverse range of park types, functions and recreational opportunities to meet the physical and social needs of
               the community. Regularly review the design and programming of all City parks to expand and diversify uses.
               See also: PR1.1
Policy HW1.3	  Recreation Programs and Services
               Expand and tailor recreational programs and services to meet evolving community needs. Programs and services should remain acces-
               sible and relevant to today’s residents, responding to unique cultural, historic and social needs as well as changing demographics.
               See also: PR5.1
Policy HW1.4	  Quality Recreational Facilities
               Provide a range of quality recreational facilities that are well maintained, have adequate lighting, signage, hours of operation and rep-
               resent the multi-ethnic and multicultural needs of the community. Providing facility upgrades may increase capacity to attract people
               from neighborhoods that are currently underserved.
Policy HW1.5	  Joint-Use Opportunities	
               Promote access to non-City operated parks and recreational facilities. Existing resources operated by the East Bay Regional Parks
               District, school district, community groups or others may support residents’ interim needs for convenient access to parks and com-
               munity centers. Joint-use opportunities serve to more efficiently utilize existing facilities and amenities, host programs in convenient
               neighborhood locations, better activate community areas so that they are in use during the day and in the evenings and enable the
               City and partners to share the cost of maintenance, upgrades and improvements for the benefit of the entire community.

     Policy HW1.6	        Safe Public Spaces and Facilities
                          Protect visitors of parks and recreational facilities from exposure to structural and safety hazards, wildland fires, crime and other natural
                          or human-induced incidents and promote park and facility design that discourages vandalism, deters crime, provides natural surveillance
                          and creates a safe and comfortable environment. Improving public safety can be accomplished by appropriately designing parks, trails
                          and recreation facilities, and by providing safe outdoor play structures and equipment in City-owned and operated facilities. Ensure fire
                          safety in areas adjacent to open spaces prone to wild fires.
                          See also: PR2.2
     Policy HW1.7	        Access to Large-Scale Natural Areas	
                          Improve access to large-scale natural areas located in the City including regional parks along the shoreline and in the hills. These
                          areas should be open for controlled access to improve public enjoyment and interpretation. Access should be limited where natural
                          habitat is extremely sensitive. Work with transit agencies to improve connections and access to open space and recreation facilities
                          from all Richmond neighborhoods.
                          See also: CN2.5; PR4.1
     Policy HW1.8	        Shoreline Access and Development
                          Enhance public access to and encourage development of water-dependent sports and recreation activities, such as kayaking, sail-
                          ing, sail and kite boarding, swimming and fishing along the Richmond’s shoreline to encourage environmental awareness and
                          improve public health and fitness.

Improved Access to Parks and Open Space
Policy HW1.9	  Equitable Distribution of Park and Recreation Facilities
               Expand park and recreation opportunities in all neighborhoods and ensure that they are offered within comfortable walking
               distance of homes, schools and businesses in order to encourage more physically and socially active lifestyles. Continue to imple-
               ment the parkland development standard of three acres of community or neighborhood parkland per 1,000 population in each
               neighborhood planning area. This represents a minimum provision which should be exceeded whenever possible. In established
               neighborhoods where land availability for new large parks is limited, prioritize improvement and maintenance of compact parks,
               play lots and plazas to increase access to recreation opportunities for residents. Encourage developers to meet the City’s park devel-
               opment standard within their proposed development projects.

                          needs and priorities. The Parks Master Plan should:
                          •	 Include a community needs assessment that looks at all types of park and recreation programs offered in the community
                              including those that relate to arts and culture, education enrichment and human services;
                          •	 Identify long-term goals for the Recreation Department and the community;
                          •	 Describe current and future needs, interests and community preferences for improving new parks and community facilities,
                              and expanding or initiating new programs and services;
                          •	 Present a long-range plan for physical park and community facility improvements;
                          •	 Refine performance standards and further develop park design guidelines and criteria;
                          •	 Develop a long-term strategy for the Richmond Greenway;
                          •	 Prioritize projects in areas that are underserved, deficient in parks and in need of facility improvements; and
                          •	 Outline funding mechanisms and strategies for managing the City’s commitments so that new requests and initiatives are con-
                              sidered in light of existing commitments.

Goal HW1
Improved Access to Parks and Open Space
Action HW1.B	  Parkland Dedication Ordinance
               Update the parkland dedication ordinance that requires new development and redevelopment projects to provide adequate park
               and recreation opportunities to maintain the 3.0 acres per 1,000 population standard in applicable planning areas through a com-
               bination of park types as defined in the Parks and Recreation Element (to be updated and refined in the parks master plan).
               Update the park impact fee ordinance that requires new development and redevelopment projects to pay a fair share to cover
               the cost of parkland acquisition and improvement if the development is unable to provide adequate parkland within the project.
               Prioritize park dedication over impact fees. Perform a nexus study periodically to update the criteria and fees.
               Include provisions that prevent a net loss of parklands in the City. Require at least a 1:1 replacement if there is any loss of public
               open space or parkland due to redevelopment.
               See also: PR1.G; CN2.C
Action HW1.C	  Park Dedication Incentives Program
               Develop an incentives program that encourages private development and public agencies to provide park and recreation facilities
               beyond the minimum requirements. Define priority needs where additional parks and recreational facilities may fill gaps in ser-
               vice.

Action HW1.D	  Parks Maintenance Plan
               Regularly update the maintenance plan for all City-owned and operated parks, trails, landscapes and greenways. Include funding
               mechanisms to support ongoing operations and life-cycle replacements. Consider the Hilltop Landscape Maintenance District
               and the Marina Bay Neighborhood Landscape Management Plan as models. The parks maintenance plan may be included in the
               Parks Master Plan. Work with the school district and other public agencies to develop community service credits for students.

                          programs or develop new programs to serve people of all incomes, cultural backgrounds, ages and levels of physical capability; and
                          encourage more intensive use of facilities throughout the day. Target programs for school-age youth during after-school hours,
                          summer recess and weekends; and program areas related to arts and culture. Refining the recreation program may occur as part of

                          Promote the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables and quality foods, especially in low-income and underserved neighborhoods.
                          Continue to attract a wide range of healthy food sources such as full-service grocery stores, ethnic food markets, farm stands, com-
                          munity gardens, edible school yards and farmers’ markets. Partner with Contra Costa Health Services to encourage stores to accept
                          Federal Food Assistance Program dollars such as WIC and SNAP in order to increase access to healthy food for all Richmond
                          residents. Encourage convenience stores, supermarkets, liquor stores and neighborhood and ethnic markets to carry fresh produce,
                          meats and dairy, 100% juices and whole-grain products especially in low-income and underserved neighborhoods.
     Policy HW2.2	        Local Food System (Urban Agriculture)
                          Collaborate with local urban agriculture advocates to identify sites with urban agriculture potential. Support local agriculture on
                          vacant land identified for urban agriculture development. Production and processing of food locally can reduce overall energy
                          consumption, improve access to fresh fruits and vegetables in the community, especially in existing food deserts, and support the
                          local economy by keeping jobs and revenue in Richmond. Support farmers’ markets, fresh food stands and community gardens to
                          supplement the availability of healthy food in the City.

                          for residents and visitors. Public transit provides an environmentally-friendly, cost-effective and equitable mode of travel for resi-
                          dents and visitors. Encouraging transit-supportive development patterns can further maximize the efficiency of these systems and
                          help reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions within Richmond.
                          Public transit service should connect major destinations in Richmond including education institutions, community facilities,
                          regional open space areas and major commercial corridors to serve a greater number of riders and reduce commuter vehicle miles.
                          All housing units and employment centers in Richmond should have access to a local and regional public transit stop. Ensure that
                          all transit stations and routes to and from these stations are safe. As many residents and visitors rely on regional passenger rail and
                          air travel, support efforts to create efficient public transit connections to train stations and regional airports.
                          Support efforts to expand service at night and on weekends and to make transit affordable and accessible to people of all abilities,

     Action HW4.A	        Community Access and Mobility Criteria
                          Develop access and mobility criteria for capital improvement projects and new development to enhance physical access to com-
                          munity facilities, schools, parks, shoreline open spaces, historical destinations, commercial and employment centers and transit
                          hubs. The criteria should address access by walking, bicycling and public transit as well as vehicular access.
                          The community access and mobility criteria should:
                          •	 Ensure safe connections to large and small open spaces, community facilities such as schools, community centers, recreational
                               facilities, cultural and enrichment centers, historical destinations, transit hubs and commercial and employment centers;
                          •	 Address travel routes, infrastructure improvement needs and barriers such as roads, railroad lines, freeways, fences and natural
                               features; and
                          •	 Provide bicycle and pedestrian-friendly routes including completion of major trails and pathways like the San Francisco Bay
                               Trail and Richmond Greenway.

                          special needs. Also explore the potential to enhance Richmond’s paratransit service. Collaborate with major employers to pro-
                          vide employer-based “open-door” shuttles to BART, the planned ferry terminal and other transit hubs. Collaborate with regional
                          and Contra Costa County transportation agencies to restore service levels and to maintain and enhance service within the City
                          and region. Prioritize strategies and improvements that address affordability, access and safety. Also prioritize transit and street
                          improvements that increase mobility for low-income, youth, seniors, disabled, and other vulnerable residents to ensure equitable
                          access. Expand outreach and information programs to promote transit use.

               Develop a community-based self-evaluation and transition plan to work toward access for all and Americans with Disabilities Act
               (ADA) compliance. With involvement from the community and specifically people with disabilities, the plan should assess the
               City’s ability to serve the needs of all Richmond residents and visitors. Specifically, the plan should assess policies, programs, ser-
               vices and facilities that are available to the public and provide recommendations for adapting service delivery methods and making
               physical improvements to ensure access for all. The plan should also include a timeline, priorities, implementation and financing

Goal HW10
Green and Sustainable Development Practices
Action HW10.A	 Climate Action Plan
               Develop a climate action plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to meet or exceed state reduction targets. Components of
               the plan should include: a comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions inventory and forecast; emissions reduction target(s); assess-
               ment of the City’s vulnerability to climate change; climate change resiliency goals; broader sustainability assessment; sustainability
               targets; strategies and measures to address climate change mitigation, sustainability and adaptation; financing and implementation
               approaches; a public education and information program; and a program for monitoring and reporting results.
               Richmond’s baseline greenhouse gas emissions inventory and forecast will provide a benchmark for planning and monitoring
               progress in achieving mandated targets. Incorporate public education programs to raise community awareness.
               The climate action plan should include mitigation strategies for addressing the sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the commu-
               nity. Adaptation strategies will focus on potential local impacts of climate change such as sea level rise, increased risk of flooding,
               diminished water supplies and public health. Broader sustainability measures may include the preservation of local water quality,
               air quality, open space and biodiversity.
               The climate action plan should also include information on the financing and implementation of each strategy or measure to
               ensure timely and well- informed action. The plan will be subject to the monitoring and reporting program to ensure the City
               achieves its greenhouse gas reduction, protection and adaptation targets.
               Update the plan periodically in accordance with evolving state and federal policy and regulatory frameworks, as well as advance-
               ments in scientific research and data on climate change.

    Richmond General Plan 2030
Community Vision
Richmond, California in 2030
Richmond is a safe place to live and work. The City maintains efficient and well-equipped police
and fire departments that encourage community partnerships to improve neighborhood conditions.
Crime rates are down because local job and entrepreneurial opportunities have increased, schools
have improved and attractive housing is readily available. Additionally, anti-violence campaigns,
community education programs and improved services for ex-offenders are effectively addressing
the underlying causes of conflict.
The City is prepared to respond to disasters and emergencies and has taken steps to provide assis-
tance and shelter, limit risks and minimize losses. Health and safety hazards are carefully consid-
ered in all land use decisions. Richmond works with Federal and State authorities to regulate the
safe production, transportation, treatment and disposal of substances that may pose contamination
risks. Throughout the City, clear noise standards protect the quality of life and insulate residents
from excessive noise levels.

            Normally Acceptable
            Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal conventional construction, without any special noise insulation requirements.
            Conditionally Acceptable
            New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements is made and needed noise insulation features included in the design.
            Conventional constructions, but with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning will normally suffice.
            Normally Unacceptable
            New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new construction or development does proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements must be made and need-

     Goal SN2	            High Levels of Police and Fire Service
                          Provide a high level of security in the community to prevent and reduce crime, and minimize risks to people, property and the
                          environment from fire.
     Goal SN3 	           Emergency Preparedness
                          Develop effective mechanisms for a coordinated response to emergencies and natural disasters to best protect residents, businesses
                          and the environment.
     Goal SN4 	           Acceptable Noise Levels
                          Achieve noise levels consistent with acceptable standards and reduce or eliminate objectionable noise sources. Prevent where pos-

Policies and Implementing Actions
A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
and resources should be focused.
Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.
                                                                                                          sha p i n g      th e   n e w    1 0 0  y e ars      |  12.13

                          preserve community character and retain job generating activities that have long-term viability. Types, intensities and ranges of
                          use and development should be compatible with existing uses and should minimize or eliminate conflicts that adversely impact
                          wetlands, marshlands, creeks, mudflats, public safety, human or environmental health or generate nuisances. All new development
                          must avoid or mitigate to the greatest extent feasible potential negative impacts such as noise, odors, and pollution.
                          Consistent with the City’s Industrial Buffer Zone Ordinance, prohibit the location of residential uses in the area between Harbour
                          Way South and Marina Way South and between Interstate 580 and Hall Avenue.
                          Encourage existing larger industries that have surplus land to develop modern industrial parks that could attract new and existing
                          industries and facilitate a reduction of existing and future land use conflicts.
                          New development should complement the character and scale of existing neighborhoods, cultural resources, historic structures
                          and landscapes. In particular, existing industrial and residential uses can successfully coexist through well-conceived circulation
                          and urban design strategies including buffers (which may be in the form of sound walls and/or enclosed buildings and appropriate
                          transitional habitat zones between wetlands, marshlands, creeks, and mudflats) and transitional uses, rerouting of truck traffic and
                          design components that mark transitions in land use. Similar to other cities that host mixed uses, consider requiring land use cov-
                          enants for new development in areas where new uses may generate a perception of conflict with existing uses. Require sufficient

               materials, technology and construction standards to minimize noise.
               Reduce noise levels generated by roadways, railroads and other facilities by: encouraging the California department of transporta-
               tion (Caltrans) to institute noise reduction measures on existing and future freeways to lessen noise impacts on areas immediately
               adjacent to the freeway; encouraging public agencies to ensure that their programs are consistent with those of the City as they
               relate to noise control; and urging strict enforcement of current federal railroad noise emission standards by the U.S. Department
               of Transportation.

               require construction traffic plans for all developments of ten or more homes or commercial projects larger than five acres in size to
               regulate vehicle speeds, dust and noise mitigation, hours of operation, phased fencing plans and safety standards. The plan should
               ensure the safety of the public and employees during construction of major projects.

   13 Arts and Culture
Richmond Today
Arts and cultural activities have a direct effect on the
daily lives of Richmond residents. The arts engage
people of all ages, revitalize the community and
celebrate Richmond’s cultural diversity. On an inter-
personal level, artistic endeavors develop essential
skills such as creativity, perception and imagination,
which fuel technology, entertainment and commu-
nications industries. The arts provide resources for
youth, improve self-esteem and motivation, reduce
absenteeism and promote tolerance and teamwork.
The arts bring people together to celebrate, learn         Public art adds character to public places. Various forms of public art such as murals and sculptures can be found throughout the City.

Arts Education and Program
Partnerships
Arts are a vital part of the educational experience.
Not only do the arts nurture creative thinking and
self-expression, but they can also cater to a broad
range of learning styles. Fine arts and music pro-
grams often inspire students who do not respond
readily to more academic curriculum or who are at
risk of dropping out of school. Arts enrichment pro-
grams for children and adults have several positive
benefits such as developing artistic talents, enhanc-
ing self-esteem, building critical thinking and social
skills and increasing overall motivation to learn.

     Goals
     GOAL AC1: 	            A Community Strengthened by the Arts
                            Celebrate diversity and raise social and cultural awareness of Richmond’s citizens and visitors through a variety of artistic programs
                            and forms of expression. Arts can serve as a powerful medium to reflect the unique character, social history and cultural diversity
                            of a place. In addition, arts and culture provide valuable contributions to the lives of Richmond residents. Build on the prestige of
                            successful arts institutions, maximize program participation and arts exposure and enhance projects and programs that offer broad
                            benefits to community members of all ages, cultural backgrounds and abilities.
     GOAL AC2: 	            Enhanced Economic Development Opportunities
                            Harness arts and culture as a key component of community revitalization. Arts and culture can contribute to both community
                            character and economic well-being. The local economy can benefit from employment opportunities, an expanded tax base and
                            increased property values. Weave arts and culture into all aspects of community life to build civic pride and identity, improve
                            quality of life for residents and visitors, raise community perception and cultivate economic development opportunities.

Policies and Implementing Actions
A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
and resources should be focused.
Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.
                                                                                                          s h a p i n g    t h e   n e w   1 0 0  y e ars      |  13.13

     GOAL AC1
     A Community Strengthened by the Arts
     Policy AC1.1	         Widespread Exposure to Arts
                           Promote arts to Richmond residents by incorporating art in widely-utilized public places, reducing barriers to program participa-
                           tion and creating effective outreach for community programs and celebrations. Integrating the arts physically and socially into
                           City life will ensure its continued relevance to and support from the community and establish it as an integral part of Richmond’s
                           identify.
     Policy AC1.2	         Well-Balanced and Equitably Distributed Programs and Services
                           Nurture creativity and artistic talent in local youth and adults through a rich offering of well-balanced and equitably distributed
                           arts and cultural educational programs and services. A comprehensive understanding of existing resources and community needs
                           will provide a solid foundation for elevating arts and culture in enrichment programs. Conducting research and developing deci-
                           sion-making tools such as citywide needs assessment for recreational facilities, parks, programs and an updated Arts and Culture
                           Master Plan, will help ensure a rich and equitable offering of arts programs, services and facilities. Joint-use agreements, public-
                           private partnerships and dedicated City funds will provide resources to further expand programs and services in target areas.
     Policy AC1.3	         Community-Based Arts Institutions
                           Support community-based arts institutions that make significant contributions to the Richmond community and expand partner-
                           ships and support for arts organizations where feasible to ensure their long-term vitality and continued benefits to the community.

GOAL AC1
A Community Strengthened by the Arts
Action AC1.A	 Arts and Culture Master Plan
              Regularly update Richmond’s Arts and Culture Master Plan. The content and level of detail of the Plan should be expanded to:
              •	 Define public art and describe a comprehensive vision for arts and culture in the community;
              •	 Identify and prioritize locations for public art;
              •	 Develop guidelines to prioritize support for artists, institutions, programs or projects that increase awareness and visibility of
                  culturally diverse, socially relevant and historic arts in Richmond, and involve citizens in art form expressions related to social
                  and cultural themes;
              •	 Identify priority projects to determine where time, resources and funding should be focused; and
              •	 Develop criteria and a clear process for implementing arts-related improvement projects throughout the City.
Action AC1.B	 Art in Public Places Program
              Amend the Art in Public Places Program to ensure that public art projects occur efficiently and in a way that meets citywide
              objectives. The Art in Public Places Program should be amended to:
              •	 Include private development projects and utilize a percentage of their budgets;
              •	 Include parameters in relation to allocation of in-lieu developer fees;
              •	 Expand the definition of “public art” to include literary arts;
              •	 Extend into neighborhoods and areas outside of Downtown;
              •	 Outline specific criteria and selection processes for integrating public works of art;
              •	 Describe a mandated process for project implementation that includes coordinating with key City departments and stakehold-
                  ers, providing a method for appointing representatives to the Public Art Selection Committee and specifying a method of
                  selecting and contracting with artists for the design, execution and siting of public art;
              •	 Outline a dedication and disbursement process for the Public Art Projects Account; and
              •	 Clarify responsibilities for maintenance of public art.
                                                                                             s h a p i n g    t h e    n e w   1 0 0   y e ars     |  13.15

                            public agencies, private entities and nonprofit organizations that own and operate facilities within the City. In addition to provid-

     Action AC1.E	          Strategic Plan for Arts Organizations
                            Update the Arts Strategic Plan to address the City’s needs in promoting the role of arts and culture in Richmond. The Plan should
                            outline a solid framework of roles, responsibilities and operating procedures to assist in decision-making. More specifically, the
                            Plan should:
                            •	 Clearly define the role of City government and leaders in promoting and supporting arts and culture;
                            •	 List operating procedures and protocols for communicating between City staff and community arts groups;
                            •	 Refine arts committee roles and streamline the organizational framework of arts committees;
                            •	 Identify staff resources to conduct arts coordination and programming, and to build partnerships and funding in support of
                                arts and culture; and
                            •	 Identify venues for collaborative programming and information exchange, joint-funding exploration, increased potential for
                                joint-projects and synergy between City departments regarding arts-related interests.

GOAL AC2
Enhanced Economic Development Opportunities
Policy AC2.1	 Community Revitalization
              Promote arts and culture as a key component of community revitalization. Building a foundation and context for arts and culture
              is an important aspect of growing arts-related activity in the area. The following types of uses may help to achieve this: a greater
              mix of building and public space uses; new higher density housing; live/work artists’ studios; expanded entertainment opportuni-
              ties Downtown and throughout the City; a diversity of venues to showcase the arts; expanded regional shopping and restaurants;
              and ethnically diverse eateries and marketplaces.
Policy AC2.2	 Arts and Culture Identity
              Build on the arts and cultural assets of Richmond to establish a positive image and business environment. To strengthen its arts
              and cultural identity, the City encourages inclusion of multicultural and diversity-themed artistic offerings in new commercial and
              mixed-use developments; incentives such as affordable studio workspace for local artists and arts organizations; and sponsoring
              festivals and events to provide opportunities to draw the community together and welcome visitors to share in Richmond’s unique
              celebrations. Richmond’s unique heritage and strong diversity can be portrayed through theatrical performances, festivals, music,
              art shows and foods that reflect Richmond’s diverse population.
                                                                                              s h a p i n g   t h e  n e w    1 0 0  y e ars       | 13.17

                           Encourage culturally-based retail establishments and eateries that reflect Richmond’s diversity. Leveraging Richmond’s diversity
                           can establish a unique, marketable identity for the City and promote cultural tourism.

     Action AC2.B	         Artists’ Incentives Program
                           Consider developing an incentives program to grow the capacity of local artists and arts organizations. Encourage developers and
                           property owners to provide affordable, strategically-located studio workspace and performance and exhibit space in underutilized
                           buildings. Encourage professional exhibitions and art sales. Support local artists as entrepreneurs by connecting them with grant
                           applications and resources to secure support for their work. A web-accessible arts resource directory could provide key information
                           for artists and those interested in arts services. The directory could include information such as lists and contact information for
                           local artists, links to arts grants or grant libraries, grant applications, guidelines for applying for nonprofit and City funding and
                           announcements for upcoming arts-related events.
     Action AC2.C	         Public Art Guidelines
                           Regularly update public art guidelines and selection criteria to prioritize public art themes that relate to social and cultural themes
                           such as social justice, anti-violence, cultural diversity, history and others. Strengthening and expressing ethnic and cultural identi-
                           ties throughout Richmond is an important source of community pride. Multicultural and diversity-themed arts will help develop
                           diversity as a niche of Richmond’s artistic offerings.
     Action: AC2.D	        Public-Private Partnerships
                           Initiate conversations to expand existing partnerships and forge new innovative public-private partnerships to foster and promote
                           art opportunities for maximizing funding, maintaining long-term viability of arts programs and creating new opportunities for
                           enhancing arts education and arts programming in the community.

parameters, initiating the artist selection process and
coordinating the artist’s work with the work of other
professionals involved in potential projects.

14     Historic Resources
   Richmond General Plan 2030
Community Vision
Richmond, California in 2030
Richmond showcases its abundant, well-preserved historic and cultural resources. The
City’s history and social development is evident through its many interpretive features,
historically-themed public art and surviving structures and landscapes. These character-
defining resources contribute to the overall beauty and economic vitality of the City.
Downtown, Point Richmond and the National Historical Park are a source of creativity and
cultural reference. These areas, as well as other culturally significant activity hubs, have
catalyzed further development and increased business activity and cultural tourism in
Richmond.
Rehabilitation and adaptive reuse projects enhance historic character while still meeting
the contemporary needs of the community. New development responds to the character
of historic surroundings with compatible site design, massing and complementary design
details.
Public outreach among residents and visitors has heightened awareness of Richmond’s
pivotal role in involving women in the home front workforce, major contributions to the
war effort and other important local history. Residents and visitors of all ages enjoy fes-
tivals, community events and performances that trace the fascinating people who have
helped shape Richmond today.

     Goals
     GOAL HR1: 	           Historic Resource Preservation
                           Richmond has a rich history that is woven throughout the fabric of the community. Preserve historic resources and leverage them
                           to enhance and build upon Richmond’s historic character.
     GOAL HR2: 	           Expanded Economic Opportunities Based on Historic Resources
                           In addition to serving as a source of community pride, historic resources play a role in attracting visitors to the area and strength-
                           ening the economic position of the City. Take advantage of these historic and cultural resources by promoting them as visitor des-
                           tinations. Draw on the City’s heritage as a tool for economic revitalization and enhancement of community identity.
     GOAL HR3: 	           Increased Public Awareness of Richmond’s History
                           The value of historic resources relies on an adequate level of community awareness. Raise public awareness by educating the pub-
                           lic about the City’s past, how it has shaped modern-day Richmond and how residents can identify and preserve historically signifi-
                           cant properties. With a better understanding of these resources, it is likely that residents will play a stronger role in caring for the
                           City’s historic resources.

Policies and Implementing Actions
A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
and resources should be focused.
Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.
                                                                                                          S H A P I N G    T H E  N E W    1 0 0  Y E A R S    |  14.17

     GOAL HR1
     Historic Resource Preservation
     Policy HR1.1	         Preservation of Diverse Resources
                           Protect, preserve and enhance the diverse range of historic, cultural and archaeological sites and resources in the City for the ben-
                           efit of current and future residents and visitors.
     Policy HR1.2	         Adaptive Reuse of Resources
                           Promote adaptive reuse, rehabilitation and retrofitting of historic buildings that are no longer in their original use and explore
                           approaches to integrate preservation with economic revitalization objectives.
     Policy HR1.3	         Compatibility of New Development
                           Promote context-sensitive design that respects and celebrates the history and historical character of sites and resources while
                           meeting contemporary needs of the community. Encourage compatibility between new development, adaptive reuse, retrofitting
                           and rehabilitating of historic properties and areas in the City within the historical context of the resource. Maintain consistency
                           with the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s “Main Street” principles and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the
                           Treatment of Historic Properties, which include guidance for buildings and cultural landscapes. Ensure that commercial facili-
                           ties such as those in the Point Richmond Historic District are developed in a way that complements and preserves the historic,
                           “village-like” appearance and character of the district.
     Policy HR1.4	         A Sustainable Approach
                           Encourage the reuse and retrofitting of existing structures to support an environment-friendly approach to redevelopment and
                           revitalization of existing areas of the City.

GOAL HR1
Historic Resource Preservation
Action HR1.A	   Certified Local Government Status
                Retain Certified Local Government (CLG) status by encouraging adaptive reuse of significant historical resources in the City and
                meeting all requirements to retain CLG status.
Action HR1.B	   Historic Preservation Incentives Program
                Develop an incentives program to encourage and support preservation of sites and resources of historic significance in the City
                that are not covered by the Historic Preservation Ordinance, but have community value. Define criteria for selecting historically
                significant community resources to qualify for proposed incentives. Incentives may include technical assistance, support for access-
                ing grants and funding and waiving of City fees, among others.
                Include a financing strategy to support property owners of historic properties for seismic retrofitting. Use the Mills Act to support
                the continued preservation of historic structures and establish new guidelines for distributing Community Development Block
                Grants that are consistent and aligned with the City’s historic preservation objectives.
Action HR1.C	   Historic Resource Inventory and Survey
                Continue updating the comprehensive citywide inventory of historic resources and develop a citywide survey to identify structures
                that may be eligible for local, state and national historic resource designation.
Action HR1.D	   Archival Program
                Work with the City library and the Richmond Museum of History to establish a uniform archival program for documents, maps
                and photographs of historic resources in the City. Consider the archival system used by the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley as a
                model.
Action HR1.E	   Strategic Partnerships
                Identify and leverage strategic partnerships with local and state historic preservation groups to strengthen historic preservation
                efforts in the City.
                Coordinate with state and federal agencies to obtain grants and funding including Community Development Block Grants.
                Access funds for historic preservation and education through programs and agencies such as Preserve America and the National
                Park Service. Review state statutes for financing the retrofitting of historic structures.
                                                                                                  S H A P I N G T H E   N E W    1 0 0  Y E A R S  | 14.19

    Policy HR2.1	          Cultural Heritage Tourism
                           Build on Richmond’s unique and nationally recognized historic resources to draw visitors to the City while supporting preserva-
                           tion and community development goals. Resources such as the Rose the Riveter/WW II Home Front National Historical Park,
                           Point Molate and the San Pablo Peninsula and Point Richmond have the potential to draw visitors from the local area, the region
                           and beyond. Integrate historic preservation with economic development objectives to generate additional revenue for the City
                           while providing the investment needed to preserve resources.

GOAL HR2
Expanded Economic Opportunities Based on Historic Resources
Action HR2.A	 Cultural Heritage Tourism Program
              Develop a program to promote the cultural and historic resources in Richmond, especially the Rosie the Riveter/WWII
              Home Front National Historical Park, Point Richmond and the Downtown. Collaborate with local businesses, the Richmond
              Convention and Visitors Bureau, organizations and Chamber of Commerce, the National Parks Service, community organizations
              and other partners, where appropriate, to develop and implement the program. Consider visitor-serving uses, transportation, mar-
              keting and branding.
              See also: LU3.C; NP1.E
Action HR2.B	 Cultural District Designation
              Explore the potential for defining focal areas or districts in the Downtown and along Macdonald Avenue as cultural, historic and/
              or arts-related activity hubs. Promoting areas of the City where there is a concentration of arts, historic and culture-related activi-
              ties, sites, installations and/or institutions can provide benefits such as: increasing visibility of revitalization efforts by concentrat-
              ing energy into catalytic nodes; promoting historic and cultural awareness and preservation; and serving as a marketing tool for
              increasing cultural tourism, business activity, visitors and residents to Richmond. In the case of arts districts, designating focal
              areas could also serve as a spring board for enticing people to live and work in the area. Ideally, districts or zones should be walk-
              able areas that may include galleries; live-work studios; arts-related retail; and entertainment and performance facilities; and/or
              historic features.

                           the City’s historic resources.
    Policy HR3.2	          Information on Funding and Resources
                           Improve the community’s access to information on available programs and resources for historic preservation in Richmond. There

GOAL HR3
Increased Public Awareness of Richmond’s History
Action HR3.A	   Public Outreach and Information Program
                Consider development of an outreach program to communicate information on programs, services, requirements and incentives
                related to the protection and preservation of historic resources. Provide information for homeowners, contractors and City staff
                regarding the California Historic Building Code, Mills Act contracts, historic preservation tax credits, available grants and other
                preservation incentives.
                Print materials may include information brochures, maps and posters. Online resources may include a website, internet-based
                survey and inventory. Include information and updates in neighborhood newsletters. Highlight key successes and projects to build
                support in the community.
                Coordinate with the West Contra Costa Unified School District to promote a local history curriculum and a restoration curricu-
                lum for vocational classes. Consider expanding the Historic Preservation Awards Program for outstanding historic preservation
                efforts.
Action HR3.B	   Marketing Campaign
                Collaborate with community members, businesses and major employers to highlight Richmond’s arts and cultural resources.
                Target markets should include new residents, recreational visitors, and potential new businesses. The campaign should also adver-
                tise development opportunities throughout the City to bring new housing and commercial development to Richmond.

    Richmond General Plan 2030
Community Vision
Richmond, California in 2030
The popular Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park celebrates
Richmond’s diverse and unique history and role in the World War II home front effort. The
City continues to support and partner with the National Park Service in maintaining this
world-class destination in Richmond that is a source of pride in the community.
The City’s living heritage draws visitors from around the Bay Area and across the country.
Wayfinding and interpretive signage encourages visitors to explore and experience a num-
ber of places throughout Richmond that convey home front stories and themes. Safe and
convenient connections are provided between the resources in Central Richmond and the
shoreline. A range of transportation options including pedestrian-friendly streets, multi-
modal trails and the Cultural Heritage Water Trail provide convenient connections between
nationally-significant points of interest, a new Marina Bay ferry terminal and other cultural
and historical sites along the southern waterfront.
The National Historical Park successfully highlights and preserves Richmond’s cultural and
historical heritage for current and future generations while supporting community and
economic development opportunities. Richmond citizens embrace their history, celebrate
their contribution to victory in World War II and continue to share their amazing stories
with the rest of the country.

Home Front Era2
If there is a place in America that could be called the
quintessential World War II home front boomtown,
it is Richmond, California. Between 1940 and 1945,
tens-of-thousands of workers streamed into the City
to support wartime industries while public and pri-
vate entities expanded to keep the City’s burgeoning
population housed, healthy, schooled and highly
productive.

     The Economic Benefits of National Parks4
                                                National parks have significant impacts on their surrounding local and regional economies. Trails, open
                                                spaces and historic sites are key amenities to local residents and provide attractive destinations for
                                                visitors and heritage tourists travelling from afar. Across the United States national parks are powerful
                                                drivers of local and regional economies. They provide national and international spotlights on their sur-
                                                rounding areas and support a broad spectrum of tourism-related businesses.
                                                The economic impacts of national parks are generally measured as direct and secondary impacts. Direct
                                                economic impacts are those attributable to the park itself, through visitor spending and park employee
                                                payrolls. Secondary economic impacts refer to the multiplied effect of park spending on goods and
                                                services provided by local firms. Secondary impacts often include spending on park construction and
                                                maintenance services; lodging, restaurants and tourism-related retail; and other retail and commercial
                                                activity generated by visitors. The economic development effects of secondary impacts attributable to
                                                national parks are substantial and often play a critical role in local economic development. In 2006, the
                                                total economic impact of national park visitor spending (excluding local visitors) to local economies was
                                                over $21 billion in direct and secondary impacts.
                                                As a regional example, the Bay Area’s Golden Gate National Recreation Area attracted 13.5 million visi-
                                                tors in 2006 with total spending exceeding $231.7 million; non-local visitors accounted for $96 million of
                                                total spending (41%) and added approximately $70 million of value to the local economy. These figures
                                                reinforce the importance of national parks to local economies and illustrate the tremendous economic
                                                development benefit the park could represent.

Policies and Implementing Actions
A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
and resources should be focused.
Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.

               resources.
Action NP1.D	  Catalytic Projects Program
               Coordinate with the National Park Service to identify catalytic projects that may advance the development of the National
               Historical Park in the City. Criteria for catalytic projects should satisfy multiple objectives including economic and commu-
               nity development potential, consistency with redevelopment and revitalization goals and significance to the National Historical
               Park. Existing catalytic projects in the City include the Ford Assembly Building adaptive reuse, Shipyard #3 redevelopment and

                       Support the National Park Service in its efforts to develop and implement an interpretive signage and wayfinding plan for the
                       National Historical Park sites in the City. Coordinate with related efforts such as citywide signage guidelines, citywide interpretive
                       trail guidelines and San Francisco Bay Trail planning efforts to ensure appropriate branding and consistency.
     Action NP1.G	     Visitor Services and Facilities

                       quate and quality support services and facilities for current and future visitors. Services and facilities may include accommodation,
                       food, recreation and access. The City’s living heritage and historic sites could attract thousands of visitors from around the Bay
                       Area and across the country to experience a 1940s-era home front setting. A coordinated, Richmond-based partnership with the
                       National Park Service could market and grow the heritage tourism component of the City’s economy.
     Action NP1.H	     Cultural Heritage Shoreline Plan
                       Support the National Park Service in developing a heritage shoreline plan that identifies, designates and promotes the Southern
                       Shoreline Area of the City as a cultural heritage zone. The heritage shoreline extends from the East Brother Lighthouse to the Ford
                       Building in the Marina Bay area. The southern shoreline has a concentration of historical and cultural sites in the City, including
                       many National Historical Park sites and pre-World War II resources related to Native American, railroad, shrimping, whaling and
                       winemaking history. Include recreation and visitor-serving uses along the shoreline. Provide access to these sites from land and
                       water. Explore the potential for creating the Cultural Heritage Water Trail, a water-based transit system envisioned to connect cul-
                       tural and historical sites along the southern waterfront with the proposed ferry terminal in the Marina Bay area.

Goals
Goal EH1	A Comprehensive and Accessible Education System
          Collaborate and partner with educational providers to expand educational opportunities and lifelong learning in support of
          Richmond resident’s diverse needs. A comprehensive educational system will address learning from infancy to old age and include
          affordable daycare, strong K-12 education, engaging out-of-school offerings, stimulating senior activities and other age-specific
          enrichment opportunities. A widely accessible system will rely on appropriate programing, language needs, cost, scheduling, facil-
          ity location, capacity and physical access.
Goal EH2	An Educated and Skilled Workforce
          Work with educational program providers to nurture the growth of a strong local workforce. Up-to-date workforce and job skills
          training, apprenticeships and other educational opportunities are fundamental to economic improvement. Improve the caliber of
          Richmond’s workforce by expanding these resources so that they are relevant to today’s job market and widely accessible to all resi-
          dents.
Goal EH3	 Equitable and High-Quality Human Services
          Collaborate with human service providers in the nonprofit, private and public sectors in their efforts to provide a robust network
          of human services tailored to the needs of the Richmond community. High-quality and equitable programs for the elderly, chil-
          dren and at-risk populations are integral to enhancing neighborhood stability and helping to shape quality of life for residents.

     Policies and Implementing Actions
     A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
     to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
     and resources should be focused.
     Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
     of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
     lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.

Policy EH1.3	 Preschool and Childcare
              Collaborate with service providers to create places for high-quality and affordable pre-school and childcare centers, especially for
              young children up to five years of age. Build awareness of subsidized childcare opportunities to address low participation among eli-
              gible populations.
Policy EH1.4	 Literacy, Enrichment and Lifelong Learning
              Support the inclusion of arts, local history, physical exercise and other forms of enrichment in and out of school. Enrichment
              programs can complement primary and secondary education, which is increasingly focused on reading and mathematics. Provide
              a range of formal and informal literacy programs for young children, school-aged youth and adults to serve unique learning styles
              and needs. Develop a comprehensive network of formal and informal educational opportunities that serve Richmond residents
              from infancy through adulthood.
Policy EH1.4	 Retention of School District Sites
              Encourage the West County Unified School District to retain all open and closed school facilities in public ownership in order to
              ensure that future school facility needs are addressed. If school district land such as the Alvarado School site is sold for redevelop-
              ment, strongly encourage the school district to require the dedication of a percentage of land for use as parks or public open space
              as a condition of sale.

                           •	 Locate elementary schools near the center of their attendance areas;
                           •	 Locate middle school, junior high, and high school facilities centrally within their service areas and ensure that a socioeco-

                           •	 Develop school sites of sufficient size to accommodate all school and recreational facilities without interference with adjoining
                                residential uses.

              public agencies, private entities and nonprofit organizations that own and operate facilities within the City. In addition to provid-
              ing more space for recreational and enrichment programming, strategic partnerships can provide the benefit of shared renovation,

       Richmond General Plan 2030
Community Vision
Richmond, California in 2030
richmond is a thriving city with a vibrant downtown, regional activity centers and walkable
neighborhoods. land use and development patterns provide a high-quality built environment
with well-connected streets, parks and private development. new developments are
compatible with existing uses and the scale and character of new buildings complement their
immediate surroundings and historic fabric.
residents and visitors enjoy activity centers located in every district. these centers draw
people from throughout the region for employment, recreation, shopping and connections
to the ferry terminal. activity hubs and mixed-use corridors are defined by attractive, well-
articulated building facades, welcoming building entries facing the street, public art, improved
pathways, pocket parks and plazas. a network of bicycle and pedestrian-friendly connections
and safe, multimodal green streets link key destinations throughout the city and to the
shoreline. all residents enjoy convenient, walkable access to local services and amenities such
as neighborhood-serving retail, community facilities, urban parks or small public gathering
areas.
commercial and industrial uses provide diverse economic development opportunities.
the city’s heavy industrial and manufacturing businesses apply the latest technology in
the ongoing modernization of their operations. high-quality, environmentally-sustainable
development standards and practices guide development in richmond.

    •	 Parks, schools, civic buildings, and commercial establishments located within driving distance of homes
    •	 Residences with large front setbacks and attached garages which dominate the streetscape
    •	 Network of streets and paths suitable for automobiles and not pedestrians or bicyclists
    •	 Wider streets with fewer crosswalks, minimal streetscaping, and fewer traffic-calming measures
    •	 Buildings that are not oriented to the street with parking in the front

Traditional rural-to-urban development patterns result in vibrant mixed-use neighborhoods with higher densities
and a range of complementary uses. They are characterized by compact, pedestrian-oriented projects that pro-
vide a variety of uses, diverse housing types, and are anchored by a central public space and civic activity. This
development pattern is based on the principle that neighborhoods should be walkable, affordable, accessible, dis-
tinctive, and true to the significant historic context of each community. Benefits include:
•	 Parks, schools, civic buildings, and commercial establishments located within walking distance of homes
•	 Residences with narrow front setbacks, front porches, and detached rear garages or alley-loaded parking
•	 Network of streets and paths suitable for pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles
•	 Narrower streets with crosswalks, streetscaping, and other traffic-calming measures
•	 In-scale development that fits the local context
•	 Buildings oriented to the street with parking behind

   3 Land Use and Urban Design
Land Use Classifications
Land use classification is an important means of
shaping future development patterns and character
of urban environments. A classification system helps
distinguish between different areas of the City based
on predominant use, such as with hubs of shops and
restaurants or neighborhoods.
Place-Based Land Use Classification System
This General Plan utilizes a “place-based” approach
to land use and zoning inspired by a return to tra-
ditional rural-to-urban development patterns. This
approach works in concert with Richmond’s place-
based street classification system set forth in the
Circulation Element to promote high-quality street
design and influence the character and connectivity
of public and private spaces throughout the City.
The General Plan land use classifications and cor-
responding land use map establish principal types,
locations and distribution of activities or uses
throughout the City and also establish the levels of
density and intensity allowed within each classifica-
tion. Residential density ranges, floor-to-area ratios,

Development Strategy                                     Figure 3.7: Map of Richmond’s Change Areas
Land uses in the City fall into the following cat-
egories: Change areas; stable areas; and recreation,
agriculture and open space areas. Although change
areas make up only a small portion of the City, they
provide the basis for Richmond’s development strat-                                                 80
egy. Changes in land use and development character
are expected in these areas and the General Plan
provides guidance to shape the anticipated change.
These areas are largely underutilized, have incompat-
ible land uses or high potential for redevelopment.
Each of these areas have specific geographic and land
use characteristics requiring a focused approach to
land use regulation and infrastructure investment
The General Plan organizes Richmond’s change
areas into the following urban design components:
•	 Major activity centers;
•	 Community nodes and gateways;                                    580
•	 Key corridors;
•	 Neighborhood nodes; and
•	 Districts.
Richmond’s development strategy for specific change
areas is described in the next section and draw on
these components to guide physical and economic
revitalization. The following section presents the
community’s vision for each of Richmond’s change
areas. These visions provide context-appropriate
guidance for site organization, building massing, ori-
entation, setbacks and landscaping.

Major activity centers are the primary urban centers
that provide a wide mix of retail, office, housing
and entertainment-related uses serving the City and
region overall. Richmond’s major activity centers                                                                         80

munity hubs that generate revenue and jobs, and
serve as the focal point of cultural, commercial and                                                          B
social activities. Richmond’s major activity centers
are also envisioned as pedestrian and transit-friendly,
with higher-density development that provides ser-
vices and amenities to residents and visitors. Major
activity centers should define Richmond’s distinct
identity and reflect the character of surrounding
neighborhoods.

provide the foundation for developing a stronger
City identity. Clear design standards, strong con-
nections and a greater sense of place can enhance
the legibility of Richmond as one City and help
create a pleasant, enjoyable urban environment. An
understandable, comprehensive and community-
supported framework is needed to support cohesive
land use development and quality design. The City
will take the following measures in order to enhance
Richmond’s identity and character:
•	 Encouraging mixed-use, higher-density, transit-
   oriented development that promotes walkability;
•	 Supporting the development of balanced, mixed-
   use streets that include amenities for pedestrians,
   bicycles and transit users;
•	 Adhering to a place-based approach to the design
   of public places that responds to social, cultural
   and environmental contexts;
•	 Promoting development standards and land use
   patterns that encourage long-term sustainability;
•	 Requiring flexible, high-quality development
   and design standards for new development and
   infrastructure projects that will contribute to
   Richmond’s distinct character and identity;
•	 Supporting the on-going restoration of houses
   and apartments in Richmond’s heritage neighbor-
   hoods; and
•	 Supporting efforts by existing heavy industrial
   operators to modernize their facilities and reduce
   environmental impacts.

Goals
GOAL LU1	  An Improved Urban Environment
           Improve the urban fabric by crafting development strategies that emphasize high-density, mixed-use infill development and a
           safe, vibrant, economically-sustainable environment that takes advantage of existing infrastructure and public facilities. Provide
           improvements that strengthen connections between neighborhoods and amenities such as retail, community facilities, parks and
           open space areas.
           Focus area-specific revitalization endeavors on:
           •	 Improving the Downtown/Macdonald Avenue and Civic Center area as a social, cultural and civic destination;
           •	 Developing the Southern Shoreline, Ford Peninsula in Marina Bay and San Pablo Peninsula as regional and recreational
                destinations;
           •	 Developing the Hilltop Area as a thriving, mixed-use regional destination;
           •	 Promoting the Richmond Parkway as a new employment center and key mixed-use corridor;
           •	 Revitalizing key commercial corridors as vibrant, mixed-use streets; and
           •	 Strengthening central residential areas with neighborhood nodes and improved connectivity.
GOAL LU2 	 Healthy and Viable Neighborhoods
           Creating healthy and viable neighborhoods that provide safe places for people of all ages, ethnicities and abilities to live, work and
           play. Equitably distribute community facilities, urban parks and small public gathering areas to provide all residents with oppor-
           tunities to enjoy the benefits of a rich social and physical environment. Further support residents’ daily needs requiring small-scale
           local retail and other neighborhood-supporting uses within walking distance of homes. Encourage development of neighborhood
           nodes that increase convenient access to local services and amenities.
                                                                                          s h a p i n g   t h e    n e w   1 0 0    y e a r s   | 3.45

     GOAL LU3	              Expanded Economic Opportunities
                            Expand economic opportunities in existing commercial and industrial areas and develop new opportunities to diversify the
                            local economy. Create an attractive and socially-responsible business environment that will support business recruitment,
                            expansion and retention. Encourage innovative, high-growth and green business, and further support businesses and indus-
                            tries in providing a range of job and entrepreneurial opportunities while minimizing environmental and health impacts.
                            In building a thriving local economy, develop a skilled and educated workforce that can strengthen existing businesses and
                            emerging industries. Establish Richmond as a major employment center in Contra Costa County and along the Interstate
                            80 and 580 corridors by expanding and diversifying the local employment base.
                            Capitalize on Richmond’s amenities and convenient location in order to attract new businesses to the Southern Shoreline,
                            Hilltop, Downtown, the Port and surrounding industrial areas. Transform the Hilltop Area, the Southern Shoreline and the
                            Richmond Parkway as mixed-use regional destinations and employment centers. Leverage Richmond’s rich cultural, histori-
                            cal and natural amenities to ignite a vibrant cultural-heritage and tourism industry.
     GOAL LU4	              Enhanced Environmental Quality
                            Protect and preserve natural resources to nurture environmental and human health. Work with local and regional regulating
                            bodies to protect water quality in creeks and bays, and to reduce or mitigate air, water and soil pollution and contamina-
                            tion. Encourages the sensitive integration of built and natural environments to develop a high-quality urban experience.
     GOAL LU5 	             Balanced and Compatible Uses
                            Achieve a mix of land uses that is ecologically, economically and socially equitable and sustainable. Encourages a mix of
                            uses in major activity centers, community nodes and gateways, in neighborhood nodes and along key corridors as well as in
                            some industrial areas. Using this pattern and range of land uses, activate focal areas of the City throughout the day and eve-
                            ning, and provide convenient access to goods, services and community amenities.

           Provide new development near transit and in areas with existing transportation infrastructure. Activate public areas and reduce
           the need for residents and employees to travel by automobile to access daily goods by promoting the location of housing, jobs
           and recreation uses close to transit lines, bicycle routes and pedestrian improvements. In support of a walkable and vibrant

    Policies and Implementing Actions
    A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
    to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
    and resources should be focused.
    Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
    of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-

Policy LU1.2 	 Downtown and Civic Center
               Promote the Downtown and Civic Center as a social, cultural and civic destination. Encourage the location and expansion of new
               and existing entertainment and cultural facilities in the Downtown area. Support improvements to cultural facilities, such as the
               Civic Auditorium, as catalytic projects for neighborhood revitalization.
               Support the revitalization of the Civic Center area as a mixed-use district with a range of uses including public facilities, commu-
               nity gathering areas, retail, housing, entertainment and offices. Promote active use of the area at all times of the day and enhance
               connections to Macdonald Avenue, the Richmond BART Station and surrounding neighborhoods.
               Celebrate Richmond’s history through the preservation and reuse of historic and cultural properties, and by integrating artistic
               and historic features into public and private development. The City supports historic preservation efforts in Downtown and
               investment in historic buildings as well as public art projects and interpretive displays throughout the Downtown area to commu-
               nicate the unique history, diversity and culture of Richmond.

    Policy LU1.4 	         Active Streets and Safe Public Spaces
                           Promote active use of public spaces in neighborhoods and commercial areas at all times of day to provide “eyes-on-the-street.”
                           Provide an appropriate mix of uses, high-quality design and appropriate programming of uses to facilitate natural surveillance in
                           public spaces. Improve the sense of safety for potential users by providing and maintaining amenities and services such as rest-
                           rooms, street furniture, bus shelters, street lighting, trees for shade, public art and secure bicycle parking and by restricting or
                           prohibiting uses that are incompatible with community needs and priorities including, but not limited to liquor stores and smoke
                           shops.

                           transit agencies to enhance transit service to the Southern Shoreline. Improved connections and linkages will be critical to attract
                           new residential and commercial development proposed within Marina Bay and to support the proposed ferry terminal.
                           Improve connections within the Downtown and Civic Center area and to adjacent neighborhoods. Support increased connectivity
                           between the Richmond BART/Amtrak Station, Civic Center, Kaiser Hospital and the historic areas of Downtown, the proposed
                           ferry terminal, regional recreation areas, the shoreline, and other Bay Area communities.

                            Continue to update and implement the Macdonald Avenue Economic Revitalization Plan. The Plan calls for new development
                            along Macdonald Avenue’s eastern end to concentrate activity around the rebuilt Macdonald Avenue/Interstate 80 Regional
                            Shopping Center by taking advantage of the site’s access to Interstate 80. The central part of Macdonald Avenue is envisioned as
                            a higher-density activity node, focused around the BART/Amtrak station with new multi-family housing and more local-serving
                            retail in a mixed-use format.

               facilities and associated programs and services. Recommend improvements and identify funding mechanisms and partners in
               implementation to restore the public library system to its full capacity. Promote best practices in joint-use, universal access, sus-
               tainability, green design and safety. Standardize the use of design guidelines at all public facilities and incentivize their application
               at nonprofit and private facilities. Create, maintain, and make available to the public a property and facilities database that identi-
               fies the size, location, physical quality and other attributes of all public facilities, as well as nonprofit and private facilities. Utilize
               the database, in conjunction with other studies, to prioritize facility maintenance and improvement projects.

    Policy LU2.2 	         Compact Walkable Neighborhoods and Livable Streets
                           Promote safe and walkable neighborhoods and inter-connected streets through the design of streetscapes, public gathering places
                           and all types of physical development. Provide pedestrian amenities such as sidewalks and street trees, transit and bike improve-
                           ments, lighting and landscaping and appropriate traffic calming measures to ensure a safe pedestrian environment.
                           Support uses and public space improvements that generate street-level activity, create eyes-on-the-street, provide opportunities for
                           community interaction and encourage a sense of collective ownership of common areas. Encourage mixed-use development that
                           attracts people and facilitates activity throughout the day. Prohibit isolated or gated communities in order to improve physical
                           connectivity throughout the City, and create incentives to remove barriers in existing gated areas. Maintain streets to ensure that
                           neighborhoods and streets are safe and well used.

                           Promote local-serving retail and public amenities at key locations within residential neighborhoods. Support development of
                           small-scale neighborhood nodes that provide a range of neighborhood-serving retail, public amenities and services to residents
                           within walking distance of their homes. Revitalizing Richmond’s neighborhoods can reduce dependence on cars, improve access to
                           daily goods and services, promote small business development and increase opportunities for social interaction and reduce crime
                           by increasing street use and natural surveillance.

Policy LU2.4 	 Equitable Distribution and Access
               Continue to promote equitable distribution of community facilities and infrastructure. Community facilities should continue to
               be located near residents in order to serve as neighborhood centers and maximize use. As Richmond grows, facilities will be sited
               to accommodate current and future residents. Prioritize the development of new, upgraded or revitalized parks; community facili-
               ties such as libraries, medical centers and schools; circulation and safety improvements; and infrastructure in neighborhoods that
               are currently underserved, have a high proportion of low-income households, and are impacted due to high crime and physical
               blight. Tailor improvements to the specific needs of residents in these neighborhoods.

Policy LU3.1 	 Environmentally Progressive Businesses and Industries
               Encourage existing businesses and industries to become increasingly environmentally progressive and continue making positive
               contributions to the community. Encourage businesses and industries to hire locally and to demonstrate reasons for not hiring
               local employees. Seek reciprocity in the hiring of Richmond residents in Contra Costa County and other nearby jurisdictions with
               local hiring ordinances. Encourage businesses and industries to participate in civic life and play a positive role in the community.
               Together with regulatory agencies, actively work with local industries to ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regu-
               lations to limit pollution, decrease harmful impacts from emissions and protect the community from environmental hazards.
               Promote and encourage new clean and green industries that provide well-paying jobs, revenue and other community and envi-
               ronmental benefits; support efforts to require existing industries to decrease harmful emissions and impacts; and promote a mix
               of uses and a range of activities on industrial land to create jobs and revenue while avoiding conflict between industrial and non-
               industrial uses.

    Policy LU3.2	          Local Employment Base
                           Expand and diversify the local employment base to provide quality jobs for all Richmond residents, especially those that face bar-
                           riers to employment such as youth, seniors, the formerly incarcerated, and residents with limited English proficiency. Richmond’s
                           economy should offer a broad range of quality employment opportunities for current and future residents with varying degrees of

                           Promote a balanced mix of uses in major activity centers, community nodes and gateways, in neighborhood nodes (corner com-
                           mercial clusters), and along key corridors as well as in industrial areas. Uses may include diverse housing options, office, civic,
                           commercial, retail and parks and open space.
                           In residential areas, the re-establishment of neighborhood nodes allow walkable access to neighborhood retail, services, public
                           parks and other neighborhood amenities that support the daily needs of residents.
                           A mix of uses such as business, residential, light industrial, waterfront commercial, and open space will enhance economic vital-
                           ity and provide the flexibility needed to adapt to changing economic conditions. Along Richmond’s shoreline, diverse uses should
                           balance community needs for recreation, interpretation, conservation, historic and cultural preservation with economic develop-
                           ment opportunities.

Policy LU5.2	  A Mixed-Use Waterfront
               Continue to create a dynamic mixed-use waterfront that includes amenities and attractions for residents and visitors. There are a
               number of different uses, features and assets along Richmond’s shoreline that can be enhanced to create a series of distinct places
               along the waterfront.
               The San Pablo Peninsula is characterized by large natural open spaces, shoreline parks and beaches, sweeping views of the San
               Francisco Bay Area and historic structures. The City will support development on the Peninsula as a regional recreation destina-
               tion that is well connected to rest of the City and accessible to the greater community. Disturbed sites such as the Winehaven
               complex at Point Molate and the Terminal 4 site at Point San Pablo will be remediated and redeveloped into mixed-use activity
               centers to serve a broad range of visitors and provide long-term revenue to the City.
               The Richmond Port (public and private) is recognized as a productive and important component of the community’s economy
               and identity. Many of the adjacent industries embrace high standards and provide high-wage, local jobs. Creative transitions
               should be developed between port related activities and potential mixed-used neighborhoods along the waterfront to provide
               strong connections, design cohesion and effective buffers where necessary.
               The Ford Peninsula in Marina Bay is a gateway to Richmond and an integral part of the City where people work, live and recre-
               ate. The Peninsula’s historic Ford Assembly Plant, open space, connection to the Bay Trail and convenient freeway access present
               great potential for developing the eastern portion of the area as an active mixed-use neighborhood that will attract visitors from
               around the Bay. In February 2006 the City Council passed Resolution No. 15-06 to support and promote the location of the pro-
               posed ferry terminal. Ferry transit to San Francisco will enhance the Southern Shoreline’s appeal to residents and businesses.
                                                                                               s h a p i n g  t h e   n e w    1 0 0  y e a r s   | 3.69

     Policy LU5.3	         Land Use Compatibility
                           Minimize conflicts between land uses to protect wetlands, marshlands, and creeks, human and environmental health and safety,
                           preserve community character and retain job generating activities that have long-term viability. Types, intensities and ranges of
                           use and development should be compatible with existing uses and should minimize or eliminate conflicts that adversely impact
                           wetlands, marshlands, creeks, mudflats, public safety, human or environmental health or generate nuisances. All new development
                           must avoid or mitigate to the greatest extent feasible potential negative impacts such as noise, odors, and pollution.
                           Consistent with the City’s Industrial Buffer Zone Ordinance, prohibit the location of residential uses in the area between Harbour
                           Way South and Marina Way South and between Interstate 580 and Hall Avenue.
                           Encourage existing larger industries that have surplus land to develop modern industrial parks that could attract new and existing
                           industries and facilitate a reduction of existing and future land use conflicts.
                           New development should complement the character and scale of existing neighborhoods, cultural resources, historic structures
                           and landscapes. In particular, existing industrial and residential uses can successfully coexist through well-conceived circulation
                           and urban design strategies including buffers (which may be in the form of sound walls and/or enclosed buildings and appropriate
                           transitional habitat zones between wetlands, marshlands, creeks, and mudflats) and transitional uses, rerouting of truck traffic and
                           design components that mark transitions in land use. Similar to other cities that host mixed uses, consider requiring land use cov-
                           enants for new development in areas where new uses may generate a perception of conflict with existing uses. Require sufficient
                           visual open space and/or landscaped screening between industrial operations and adjacent residential or recreational activities in
                           order to create adequate buffers.

Policy LU5.4	  North Richmond Shoreline Development
               Consistent with the adopted North Richmond Shoreline Specific Plan (NRSSP), guide development in Change Area 12
               (Northshore) in a manner that improves the area’s overall image, benefits community residents, and allows for a reasonable inten-
               sity of development within a framework of conservation and public access to the Bay. Support development that creates jobs for
               Richmond residents. Protect and enhance the natural resources in the area by ensuring that development minimizes its impact on
               adjacent sensitive shoreline, wetlands, and habitat areas. Ensure public access to the shoreline.
               Ensure that no buildings are constructed within 100 feet of the shoreline found along Change Area 12 (Northshore). For the pur-
               poses of this policy, “shoreline” shall be conterminous with mean high tide line. In marshes, the shoreline shall begin at a contour
               line that is five feet above sea level.
Policy LU5.5	  Point Isabel Land Use Restriction
               Consistent with its “Business/Light Industrial” land use designation, continue to accommodate special industrial, educational, and
               some commercial and recreational uses, but prohibit any residential development in the Point Isabel area. Prevent any use from
               adversely affecting reasonable public access to the shoreline. The reference to “special industrial” is to indicate that there is a par-
               ticular concern relative to appearance and land use compatibility of the industrial uses due to the high visibility of the area and the
               nature of the adjacent land uses including marshlands.
                                                                                                s h a p i n g    t h e    n e w    1 0 0  y e a r s     | 3.7 1

     Action LU5.A	         Zoning Ordinance Update
                           Update the Zoning Ordinance to establish development standards and guidelines for all land uses in accordance with the land use
                           classification system described in this Land Use and Urban Design Element. Promote a place-based approach to encourage mixed-
                           use, pedestrian and transit-oriented development and interface between the public and private realm.
                           Incorporate reasonable building height and siting adjustments into the comprehensive update of the Zoning Ordinance in order
                           to protect existing view corridors of the Bay and other features of the regional landscape. Require new development to preserve
                           the unique opportunities of the shoreline and ridgelines in order to maximize their availability to the public.
     Action LU5.B	         Design Guidelines
                           Develop design guidelines and standards for all land uses and development prototypes. The guidelines will build on zoning codes
                           to promote high-quality design. Guidelines should also address compatibility between new and existing historic structures and dis-
                           tricts, residential and adjacent non-residential uses and urban and natural areas.
     Action LU5.C	         Industrial Use Buffers - Expanded Definition
                           New industrial uses established adjacent to existing residential or commercial uses shall incorporate measures to minimize impacts
                           to residential uses such as enclosure of industrial activities in buildings, use of screening for visually unattractive uses, site design,
                           soundproofing and landscaping. New residential and commercial uses established adjacent to existing industrial uses shall incorpo-
                           rate measures to minimize impacts to residents from noise, exposure to toxic substance emissions, vibration, odors and truck traf-
                           fic. Industrial sites may incorporate supporting office and commercial space if protected to commercial standards.

     Action LU5.D	         Design Guidelines for North Richmond Shoreline Development
                           Develop design guidelines and standards for Change Area 12 (Northshore) that address site planning, building mass, view cor-
                           ridors, lighting, landscaping, motorized and non-motorized public access to the Bay, and the setting within a regionally significant
                           resource conservation and recreation area. Design guidelines should encourage varied building heights to address surrounding
                           uses and ecological resources, with emphasis on reduced building heights near the shoreline.

High-Quality and Sustainable Development
Policy LU6.1	   Pedestrian and Transit-Oriented Urban Environment
                Promote walkability and public transit by encouraging mixed-use, higher-density development close to community amenities.
                Promote multifamily and mixed-use infill and brownfield redevelopment close to the Richmond BART/Amtrak Station, Hilltop
                Area and Marina Bay.
                Support increased residential density, commercial intensity and reduced parking requirements in areas well served by transit while
                protecting and increasing land dedicated to parks and open space.
                Support complete and balanced streets and an expanded multimodal circulation system. Locate medium and high-density housing
                and mixed-use development along corridors where improvements to multimodal systems are planned. Require new development
                and improvements to include amenities for pedestrians, bicycles and transit users.
                Encourage location of new public facilities near primary user groups and existing public transit infrastructure. Encourage new resi-
                dential uses near existing schools and community facilities.

Policy LU6.2	   Complete Streets
                Promote mixed-use urban streets that balance public transit, walking and bicycling with other modes of travel. Support pedestrian
                and bicycle connectivity by restoring and reinforcing Richmond’s grid-based network of streets with landscaping and amenities
                for transit, bicycles, pedestrians, and people with disabilities. Establish a process for modifying streets to support various modes of
                travel. Prohibit future construction of projects with long block lengths, cul-de-sacs and gated streets.

     Policy LU6.3	         A Place-Based Land Use Approach
                           Utilize a place-based approach to land use. Richmond aims to create distinct places for people that promote community identity,
                           pride and ownership. All parts of the City should respond to the social, cultural and environmental context of the area and pro-
                           vide a safe and comfortable environment. This General Plan’s place-based approach to land use works in tandem with Richmond’s
                           Zoning Ordinance to ensure context-appropriate activities and design character in both public and private realms.
                           The place-based land use approach aligns with the General Plan’s place-based system for streets and trails that tailors street types
                           to priority modes of travel, surrounding land use, street function and desired character. In addition, the approach works with the
                           system of parks concept and other General Plan elements to promote high-quality street and park design and influence the overall
                           character and connectivity of public and private spaces throughout the City.
     Policy LU6.4	         Long-Term Environmental Sustainability
                           Promote development standards and land use patterns that encourage long-term sustainability. Support the restoration of natural
                           features such as creeks and wetlands in urban areas and existing neighborhoods as a means of connecting residents with nature and
                           reversing damage to natural systems. Promote landscaping that incorporates native, drought-tolerant plants and sustainable main-
                           tenance practices and standards. Provide trees on residential and mixed-use streets and green infrastructure to reduce stormwater
                           runoff. Encourage compact development close to amenities and green buildings to reduce energy use.
     Policy LU6.5	         High-Quality Design, Planning and Construction
                           Promote high-quality design, planning, construction and maintenance of development and infrastructure projects. Require higher
                           standards for affordable housing, streetscape improvements and development proximate to local and regional transit, the shoreline
                           and industrial uses. Provide guidance regarding green building standards, seismic requirements, and pedestrian friendly design by
                           implementing the Green Building Ordinance. Promote best practices for crime prevention.

  Richmond General Plan 2030
Community Vision
Richmond, California in 2030
Richmond is served by a modern, interconnected, multimodal transportation system. The
City builds on its role as a regional transportation hub, connecting people to destinations
throughout the Bay Area and maintaining efficient movement of goods through port and
rail operations. Richmond’s circulation system links key regional destinations via con-
venient freeway access, a trail system, public transportation services including bus (AC
Transit), Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and train (Amtrak). A bustling ferry terminal pro-
vides means for all Richmond residents to travel to and from San Francisco and other Bay
Area destinations.
Richmond’s grid-based network of streets balances modes of travel, supports pedestrian
and bicycle connectivity, transit accessibility and a smooth flow of vehicular traffic. The
City is easily navigable with clear directional signage and barrier-free links connecting all
neighborhoods. Many residents rely on walking, bicycling and transit. These travel options
are supported by attractive streetscapes, pedestrian amenities, connected hubs and reli-
able bus service. Crosswalks, sidewalks, traffic calming features, multimodal trails and des-
ignated bike routes further provide safe and comfortable conditions for pedestrians and
cyclists.

    The San Francisco Bay Trail
                                                   The San Francisco Bay Trail is a multi-use recreational corridor planned to encircle the San Francisco
                                                   and San Pablo Bays, ultimately providing 500 miles of bicycling and walking trails. The regional trail will
                                                   connect nine Bay Area counties and 47 cities that are situated along the shoreline. To date, over 300
                                                   miles of the Bay Trail have been completed with 30 miles located in Richmond and an additional 11 miles
                                                   planned.
                                                   The route passes through a variety of environments, from highly urbanized areas like Downtown San
                                                   Francisco, to inland trails such as the Ridge Trail, and remote natural areas like the San Francisco Bay
                                                   National Wildlife Refuge. Depending on location, the path itself is composed of paved multi-use paths,
                                                   compact gravel trails, sidewalks, bike lanes and designated routes on city streets.
                                                   The Bay Trail provides an attractive route for bicyclists and pedestrians, and supports a range of rec-

                                                   facilities; residential neighborhoods; commercial and industrial areas; historic, natural and cultural land-

Challenges for Pedestrians and Bicyclists
Many of Richmond’s areas face significant challenges
for pedestrians and bicyclists. Richmond experi-
ences a higher rate of pedestrian and bicycle injuries
than other cities of comparable size.3 Historically,
Richmond’s Triangle neighborhood in particular
has been subject to high rates of accidents involving
pedestrians. A disproportionate number of collisions
involving bicyclists and pedestrians have occurred at
the intersection of Harbour Way and Pennsylvania
as compared to other intersections in the area.4

Common street characteristics may include wide, tree-lined sidewalks, plazas supporting a high level of
pedestrian activity, wider rights-of-way and medians and more travel lanes to enhance traffic flows for autos,
delivery trucks and transit vehicles. In addition, parking lanes, wide sidewalks, large street trees and traffic
signals may buffer pedestrians and bicyclists from automobiles, trucks and transit vehicles. Traffic typically
moves slowly due to high volumes.

Policies and Implementing Actions
A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
and resources should be focused.
Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.
                                                                                                          s h a p i n g    t h e   n e w   1 0 0  y e ars      |  4.23

    Policy CR1.1	          Balanced Modes of Travel and Equitable Access
                           Encourage multiple circulation options in the City and work with transit operators to ensure equitable access for all members
                           of the community. Create streets and corridors that support a variety of travel modes including transit, pedestrians, bicycles and
                           goods movement as well as automobiles. Provide affordable circulation options which meet the needs of low-income populations,
                           seniors, youth and persons with disabilities to ensure equitable access.
    Policy CR1.2	          An Interconnected Street System
                           Promote an interconnected system of streets that adequately serves current and future travel needs. By promoting an intercon-
                           nected system for streets along with pedestrian, bicycle and transit facilities, the City can support streets that are compatible with
                           surrounding land uses, street function and community character.
    Policy CR1.3	          Local and Regional Transportation Linkages
                           Enhance circulation linkages within the City and region. The City will work with regional transportation agencies such as AC
                           Transit, BART, West Contra Costa Transit Agency, and Amtrak to provide or improve connections to Richmond’s key transporta-
                           tion hubs such as the proposed ferry terminal in Marina Bay, the Downtown Intermodal Transit Station, Hilltop Mall, the shore-
                           line and commercial and mixed-use streets. Collaborate with regional, state and federal transportation agencies and neighboring
                           jurisdictions to support a high level of service for all users including pedestrians, bicyclists, and automobile drivers.

Policy CR1.4	 Expanded and Affordable Public Transit
              Coordinate with regional transportation agencies and support enhanced and expanded public transit to improve mobility options
              for residents and visitors. Public transit provides an environmentally-friendly, cost-effective and equitable mode of travel for resi-
              dents and visitors. Encouraging transit-supportive development patterns can further maximize the efficiency of these systems and
              help reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions within Richmond.
              Public transit service should connect major destinations in Richmond including education institutions, community facilities,
              regional open space areas and major commercial corridors to serve a greater number of riders and reduce commuter vehicle miles.
              All housing units and employment centers in Richmond should have access to a local and regional public transit stop. Ensure that
              all transit stations and routes to and from these stations are safe. As many residents and visitors rely on regional passenger rail and
              air travel, support efforts to create efficient public transit connections to train stations and regional airports.
              Support efforts to expand service at night and on weekends and to make transit affordable and accessible to people of all abilities,
              seniors, youth and low-income households.

Policy CR1.5	 Safe and Convenient Walking and Bicycling
              Promote walking and bicycling as a safe and convenient mode of transportation. Improve pedestrian and bicycle amenities to serve
              the recreation and travel needs of residents and visitors in all parts of Richmond. Where feasible, the City will: connect major
              destinations such as parks, open spaces, civic facilities, employment centers, retail and recreation areas with pedestrian and bicycle
              infrastructure; promote shared roadways in residential streets; require new development and redevelopment projects to provide
              pedestrian and bicycle amenities, streetscape improvements and linkages to planned and completed City and regional multi-use
              trails; and develop safe routes to schools and out-of-school programs that allow access by bicycle and pedestrian paths or reliable
              and safe transit.
              Explore innovative solutions such as bicycle-sharing programs and encourage businesses, schools and residential developments
              to provide secure bicycle parking to ensure that these ecologically-friendly, low-impact transportation modes are available to all
              community members, thereby reducing emissions from vehicles within the City, improving environmental quality and enhancing
              mobility and connectivity.

    Action CR5.A	         Transportation Demand Management Program
                          Develop a transportation demand management (TDM) program that encourages use of public transit, bicycling and walking.
                          TDM programs may include transit subsidies, car-share service, parking cash-out programs, bicycle-share programs, bicycle ame-
                          nities and facility enhancements, among others.
                          Include an incentive program to promote TDM in the City. Program elements may include reduction in transportation impact
                          fees for new or redevelopment projects that demonstrate commitment to TDM strategies and reductions in parking requirements
                          for mixed-use development and for projects that provide TDM programs and/or shared parking. Explore the feasibility of devel-
                          oping citywide TDM program that would be funded by annual fees or assessment on new development.

Community Facilities and Infrastructure
               Richmond General Plan 2030
Community Vision
Richmond, California in 2030
Richmond is supported by a modern infrastructure that keeps the City functioning smoothly
and efficiently. Well-maintained roads, dependable utilities, efficient waste removal and inter-
net access are available for all neighborhoods, along with regular maintenance. Green energy
provides an increasing portion of the City’s power. Residents and businesses have reduced
their garbage output and recycling and composting programs have increased dramatically.
Lush, green streets create an attractive and ecologically-sensitive stormwater system and
provide multimodal connections between open spaces, community facilities and key destina-
tions throughout the City. Daylighted creeks, vegetation and porous paving are incorporated
into the public right-of-way to manage stormwater and improve drainage and recharge. Water
quality has improved and stormwater runoff flowing to creeks and surrounding bays has been
significantly reduced. In addition, green streets have reduced demand on the City’s stormwater
drainage system and have created park-like conditions in neighborhoods throughout the City.
Residents gather at well maintained community facilities constructed with sustainable materi-
als and powered by clean energy sources. These facilities not only provide residents with qual-
ity community gathering spaces, but also raise the bar for neighboring jurisdictions. New and
improved facilities help revitalize neighborhoods by increasing street activity and attracting
other community-serving development.

  6 Community Facilities and Infrastructure
Richmond Today
Richmond’s neighborhoods are served by a variety
of community facilities that are managed by public,
private and nonprofit entities. This Element focuses
on city, county, regional and state facilities that are
dispersed throughout the City and provide an assort-
ment of services, from traditional K-12 education
to fitness programs and family counseling (see Map
6.1: Community Facilities). The City owns and oper-
ates its civic buildings and community centers. The
West Contra Costa Unified School District oper-
ates the majority of education facilities. The City of        Community facilities such as libraries, community centers and schools provide essential programs to Richmond residents.

     Goals
     GOAL CF1 	         Facilities that Serve a Diverse Range of Community Needs
                        Richmond seeks to provide a broad range of high-quality facilities and infrastructure to serve a diverse range of community needs.
                        Facilities should be universally accessible and appropriately programmed to meet community needs. Infrastructure should be
                        maintained and expanded to meet current and future needs and to provide effective, equitable and consistent levels of service to
                        all neighborhoods.
     GOAL CF2	          Efficient Use and Adequate Maintenance of Facilities and Infrastructure
                        As a developed urban area, the City seeks to use creative and innovative approaches to meet the needs of current and future resi-
                        dents and businesses. Richmond can maximize the use of existing facilities and infrastructure by sharing limited resources with
                        other public and private entities that serve the community, while dedicating resources for ongoing maintenance and upgrade of
                        streets, sidewalks, parks, libraries, community centers, fire stations and sewers.
     GOAL CF3	          Green and Sustainable Standards and Practices
                        Regularly upgrade existing community facilities and infrastructure and set standards for new improvements that support long-
                        term sustainability and environmental protection.
     GOAL CF4	          Neighborhood Revitalization
                        Richmond’s Civic Center and other community gathering places will become catalysts for revitalizing and re-energizing the City.
                        Improving and developing community facilities as safe, accessible places will enrich the quality of life for residents, activate neigh-
                        borhood centers and encourage growth and positive change in adjacent areas.

Policies and Implementing Actions
A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
and resources should be focused.
Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.
                                                                                                            s h a p ing     t h e   n e w   1 0 0   y e a r s    | 6 .11

     Policy CF1.1	      A Range of High-Quality Community Facilities and Infrastructure
                        Maintain high-quality facilities and infrastructure to serve diverse community needs. Upgrade, maintain and expand infrastructure
                        to meet current and future needs and provide an effective and consistent level of services and utilities in all neighborhoods. Retain
                        existing public facilities and uses in the Downtown, and actively work to attract new public facilities, especially within walking
                        distance of the Richmond BART/Amtrak Station. Facilities and infrastructure may include community and recreation centers,
                        parks and playgrounds, libraries and senior centers, schools, multi-use trails, pedestrian-scale lighting, and police and fire stations.

     Policy CF1.2	      Equitable Distribution and Access
                        Continue to promote equitable distribution of community facilities and infrastructure. Community facilities should continue to
                        be located near residents in order to serve as neighborhood centers and maximize use. As Richmond grows, facilities will be sited
                        to accommodate current and future residents. Prioritize the development of new, upgraded or revitalized parks; community facili-
                        ties such as libraries, medical centers and schools; circulation and safety improvements; and infrastructure in neighborhoods that
                        are currently underserved, have a high proportion of low-income households, and are impacted due to high crime and physical
                        blight. Tailor improvements to the specific needs of residents in these neighborhoods.

     Policy CF1.3	      Impacts on Neighborhoods
                        Protect the quality of life for residents, businesses and visitors. Consider health, safety and aesthetic impacts of siting new or exist-
                        ing infrastructure and utilities and ensure that impacts and benefits are not disproportionately distributed to any parts of the City.
     Policy CF1.4	      Concurrent Infrastructure Development
                        Require new development to provide proportionate facilities and infrastructure improvements as it occurs. New developments
                        must mitigate impacts or contribute adequate infrastructure to meet additional demand for roads, parks, schools and utilities.

Action CF3.C	  Urban Forestry Management Plan
               Continue to implement the urban forest management plan to guide landscaping practices in urban areas of the City, reduce the
               heat-island effect and contribute to carbon mitigation. Continue the adopt-a-tree program. Coordinate the plan with the “City
               of Richmond urban Forest Management/Master Plan Reforestation supplement (1997)” and related documents for this purpose.
               Update the plan to establish the following measures:
               •	 Create guidelines to establish minimum planting standards and require appropriate tree species and planting densities within
                   newly landscaped areas;
               •	 Update the list of trees to be used as a guideline for all tree planting and focus on local native species;
               •	 Identify maintenance and planting standards for street trees, ensuring that the best practices in urban forestry are being uti-
                   lized including best practices for pruning around above-ground utility lines to ensure the best health and form of street trees;
               •	 Update zoning requirements for street trees in new developments and in parking lots;
               •	 Outline coordination efforts with EBMUD to offer programs or other resources to provide property owners with information
                   on proper tree selection, proper location to reduce heat transfer effects, planting and maintenance; and
               •	 Establish guidelines that require all native tree habitats to be protected and when avoidance is not possible, require mitigation
                   efforts as required by the Public and Private Tree Preservation Ordinance.

                        use.
    Policy CF4.2	       Neighborhood Centers
                        Promote the use of community facilities as neighborhood centers. A number of public and private entities provide a range of pro-
                        grams and services in Richmond’s neighborhoods. Through joint use the City can transform parks, schools, libraries and commu-
                        nity centers into safe and convenient gathering places that foster social interaction and community cohesion.

Conservation and Natural Resources
             Richmond General Plan 2030
Community Vision
Richmond, California in 2030
Richmond values and protects its abundant natural resources—open spaces, wetlands, bay-
lands, creeks and riparian systems and plant and wildlife communities. Restoration efforts
have enriched native plant communities and wildlife habitats, and improved water and soil
quality. Restored creeks collect and filter stormwater, provide urban refuge and link open
space from the hills to the Bay along creekside trails. Richmond’s open space supports a
range of passive and active recreation for all. The surrounding hills and San Francisco Bay
remain prominent character-defining resources, contributing to the community’s image
and identity with beautiful scenic backdrops, environmental sanctuaries and recreational
opportunities.
Richmond promotes sustainability as a core value and operating principle. Critical natural
resources are protected, conserved and improved through development standards and
best management practices involving smart land use, innovative design and collaborative
planning. Strong City leadership, environmental education and community stewardship
ensure preservation and sustainability of open space and vital natural resources.

Richmond Today
Richmond is located along the northeast portion
of San Francisco Bay and the southeast side of
San Pablo Bay. The City has more than 32 miles
of shoreline that serves as the City’s border to the
north, west and south. Marshes, mudflats and wet-
lands are located throughout the shoreline.
To the north and northeast, Richmond is bounded
by the Berkeley Hills, San Pablo Ridge and Sobrante
Ridge as well as unincorporated communities. This

Key Findings and
Recommendations
There are numerous opportunities for Richmond
to improve environmental quality, sustain a healthy
network of open spaces and balance community
resource needs with conservation efforts. The City
contains wetlands, baylands, marshes, creeks and
riparian habitat, hillsides and forested areas that are
biologically diverse with many special status native
plant and wildlife species.
Richmond supports a network of trails, greenways
and parklands with thousands of acres of regional
and state parklands located along the shoreline and
in the East Bay hills and more than 250 acres of
City-owned urban parks integrated throughout the
City. A critical priority is to preserve and maintain
these valuable open spaces and natural resources,
working closely with regional stakeholders and the
East Bay Regional Park District.

Goals
GOAL CN1: 	 Preserved and Restored Natural Habitat and Biodiversity
            Continue to preserve and restore natural habitat and associated plants and wildlife including wetlands, baylands, riparian areas,
            oak woodlands and other sensitive biological resources. Take restoration efforts such as controlling invasive species, re-establishing
            natives, daylighting creeks and reclaiming priority conservation areas in order to maintaining critical habitat and biodiversity.
            Carefully balance natural lands, habitat and protection of multiple species with the need to accommodate development.
GOAL CN2: 	 Conserved Open Space
            Conserve open space to ensure that Richmond’s expansive shoreline, network of parklands, trails, hillsides and undeveloped natu-
            ral areas remain viable in supporting biological communities and providing sanctuary for future generations. Conserve open space,
            expand public access to open space, where appropriate, and acquire additional lands where feasible. Continue to protect surround-
            ing hills and viewsheds as character-defining features that provide scenic backdrops, as well as publicly accessible trails and vistas.
GOAL CN3: 	 Improved Water Quality
            Pursue a multi-jurisdictional approach to protecting, maintaining and improving water quality and the overall health of the water-
            shed. A comprehensive, integrated approach will ensure compliance with federal and state standards, and address a range of inter-
            connected priorities including: water quality and runoff; stormwater capture, storage and flood management techniques that focus
            on natural drainage; natural filtration and groundwater recharge through green infrastructure and habitat restoration; and water
            recycling and conservation.
GOAL CN4: 	 Improved Air Quality
            Take steps to improve and maintain air quality for the benefit the health and vitality of residents and the local economy. In align-
            ment with state emission reduction goals and in cooperation with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, pursue regional
            collaboration to reduce emissions from all sources.

     GOAL CN6: 	           A Healthy Urban Environment
                           Elevate the quality of urban areas to support human development and provide residents with a healthy urban environment.
                           Remediate contaminated soil and brownfield sites and properly manage mineral resource sites in order to contribute to improved

Policies and Implementing Actions
A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
and resources should be focused.
Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.

                    ation uses and access for channel maintenance and flood control.
               •	 In areas of creek restoration, implement design specifications and modeled flow conditions to ensure that creek channel
                    configuration and vegetation would withstand storm flows, that conveyance capacity is not impeded, and that the system is
                    stabilized following construction. Design shall be conducted by a certified professional in stream restoration and fluvial geo-
                    morphology processes.
               •	 Implement construction best management practices to reduce erosion potential including, but not limited to, construction
                    scheduled for dry season work; high flow bypass until the system is stabilized; temporary and permanent erosion and sedi-
                    ment controls; prevention of run-off during construction.

               diminished water supplies and public health. Broader sustainability measures may include the preservation of local water quality,
               air quality, open space and biodiversity.
               The climate action plan should also include information on the financing and implementation of each strategy or measure to
               ensure timely and well- informed action. The plan will be subject to the monitoring and reporting program to ensure the City
               achieves its greenhouse gas reduction, protection and adaptation targets.
               Update the plan periodically in accordance with evolving state and federal policy and regulatory frameworks, as well as advance-
               ments in scientific research and data on climate change.

Policy CN6.1	  Toxic and Contaminated Sites
               Continue to work with the appropriate local, state, and federal agencies to promote the clean-up and reuse of contaminated sites
               to protect human and environmental health. Work with property owners and regional agencies to prevent, reduce or eliminate
               soil and water contamination from industrial operations, the Port and other activities that use, produce or dispose of hazardous or
               toxic substances. Implement appropriate mitigation measures and clean-up of sites that are known to contain toxic materials as a
               condition of reuse. Support the remediation and reuse of large, disturbed sites, such as the Winehaven complex at Point Molate
               and the Terminal 4 site at Point San Pablo, into mixed-use centers that provide the maximum benefit to the community without
               compromising the integrity of the surrounding natural areas.

Policy CN6.2	  Protection and Expansion of Tree Resources
               Protect and expand tree resources within Richmond. Protect native trees, heritage trees and oak woodlands; expand and maintain
               street tree planning; use zoning and building requirements to ensure that trees are included in new developments; and engage the
               community to undertake planting campaigns. Furthermore, promote trees as economic and environmental resources for the use,
               education and enjoyment of current and future generations.

                           ing redevelopment on contaminated sites. In collaboration with other government agencies, utilize the Department of Toxic
                           Substance Control (DTSC) Cortese List to prioritize the remediation of city and non-city-owned property to protect human and
                           environmental health. Seek state and federal funds to implement the necessary level of clean-up.

                           Department and the Department of Toxic Substance Control. The standards should require soil testing at development sites where
                           contamination is suspected, address safe household hazardous and universal waste disposal and ensure compli- ance with hazard-
                           ous substance regulations and safe transport of hazardous materials. Use of the latest technologies available should be considered
                           when conducting remediation in order to expedite the cleansing process and do the least harm to the environment.

8 Energy and Climate Change
       Richmond General Plan 2030
Community Vision
Richmond, California in 2030
The City of Richmond plays a pivotal role in developing climate policy at a local level that,
in turn, influences regional, state and national objectives. The City relies on clean energy
sources, waste reduction practices, sustainable buildings and innovative land use planning
to reduce energy and climate impacts. These progressive measures have resulted in broad
community benefits including dramatic reductions in fossil fuel use, cost savings, emission
reductions, water conservation and an improved quality of life. City officials and communi-
ty members value and protect natural resources and continue to work together to reduce
the impacts of a changing climate. A renewed focus on education and local and regional
partnerships further supports sustainable practices that will nurture human health and
environmental quality for future generations.

It is increasingly evident that there are dramatic
relationships between greenhouse gas emissions
and local transportation and land use patterns.

                                                   most notably the burning of fossil fuels for transportation and electricity generation, introduces large
                                                   amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere. Reductions in the planet’s forested
                                                   regions where greenhouse gases are stored is also a major contributor to the increasing greenhouse
                                                   effect. Collectively, these gases intensify the natural greenhouse effect, causing global average surface
                                                   temperature to rise, which in turn affects global climate patterns.
                                                   In response to the threat of climate change, communities worldwide are voluntarily reducing green-
                                                   house gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol, an international effort to coordinate mandated reductions
                                                   went into effect in February 2005 with 161 countries participating. While there are a growing number of
                                                   nations committed to the Kyoto Protocol, as of 2010, the United States is the only major industrialized
                                                   country that has not signed the Protocol.

Policies and Implementing Actions
A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
and resources should be focused.
Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.

Leadership in Managing Climate Change
Action EC1.A	   Climate Action Plan
                Develop a climate action plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to meet or exceed state reduction targets. Components of
                the plan should include: a comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions inventory and forecast; emissions reduction target(s); assess-
                ment of the City’s vulnerability to climate change; climate change resiliency goals; broader sustainability assessment; sustainability
                targets; strategies and measures to address climate change mitigation, sustainability and adaptation; financing and implementation
                approaches; a public education and information program; and a program for monitoring and reporting results.
                Richmond’s baseline greenhouse gas emissions inventory and forecast will provide a benchmark for planning and monitoring
                progress in achieving mandated targets. Incorporate public education programs to raise community awareness.
                The climate action plan should include mitigation strategies for addressing the sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the commu-
                nity. Adaptation strategies will focus on potential local impacts of climate change such as sea level rise, increased risk of flooding,
                diminished water supplies and public health. Broader sustainability measures may include the preservation of local water quality,
                air quality, open space and biodiversity.
                The climate action plan should also include information on the financing and implementation of each strategy or measure to
                ensure timely and well-informed action. The plan will be subject to the monitoring and reporting program to ensure the City
                achieves its greenhouse gas reduction, protection and adaptation targets.
                Update the plan periodically in accordance with evolving state and federal policy and regulatory frameworks, as well as advance-
                ments in scientific research and data on climate change.

                able energy generation. Utilize a range of tools including fact sheets, website newsletters, advertising and workshops to reach
                potential audiences. The program should be reviewed and evaluated periodically for effectiveness. The public awareness and edu-
                cation program should be incorporated into the climate action plan.

Clean and Efficient Transportation Options
Policy EC2.1	    Climate-Friendly Vehicles and Equipment
                 Encourage the use of available climate-friendlier vehicles and equipment to reduce energy use and carbon emissions and support
                 the use of low-emission or renewable fuel vehicles by residents and businesses, public agencies and City government.

                 Support production and distribution of climate-friendlier fuels (when and if any are identified) and identify appropriate locations
                 for fuel storage and distribution.
Policy EC2.3	    Expanded and Affordable Public Transit
                 Coordinate with regional transportation agencies and support enhanced and expanded public transit to improve mobility options
                 for residents and visitors. Public transit provides an environmentally-friendly, cost-effective and equitable mode of travel for resi-
                 dents and visitors. Encouraging transit-supportive development patterns can further maximize the efficiency of these systems and
                 help reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions within Richmond.
                 Public transit service should connect major destinations in Richmond including education institutions, community facilities,
                 regional open space areas and major commercial corridors to serve a greater number of riders and reduce commuter vehicle miles.
                 All housing units and employment centers in Richmond should have access to a local and regional public transit stop. Ensure that
                 all transit stations and routes to and from these stations are safe. As many residents and visitors rely on regional passenger rail and
                 air travel, support efforts to create efficient public transit connections to train stations and regional airports.
                 Support efforts to expand service at night and on weekends and to make transit affordable and accessible to people of all abilities,

Policy EC6.3	   Adapting to Climate Change
                Prepare for and adapt to future impacts of changing weather patterns and sea level fluctuations. Protect neighborhoods, infrastruc-
                ture and facilities, the shoreline and natural resources from the impacts of climate change. Require new developments to include
                an evaluation of climate change impacts in the project review process. Shoreline and public access improvements shall be designed
                to allow future increases in elevation along the shoreline edge to keep up with higher sea level values, when they occur. Design ele-
                ments shall include providing adequate setbacks to allow for future elevation increases of at least three feet from the existing eleva-
                tion along the shoreline.

                          Work with other jurisdictions, public and private property owners to restore sensitive habitat that has been degraded, but has
                          potential for rehabilitation including brownfield and contaminated sites. Seek funding opportunities from state and federal agen-
                          cies and from nonprofit foundations for restoration and remediation work.

    Action EC6.C	         Urban Creek Restoration
                          Where feasible, restore creek corridors in urban areas. Creeks currently diverted in culverts or hardened channels should be
                          restored to their natural state. Adopt regional guidelines for channel creation or modification to ensure that channels meander,
                          have a naturalized side slope and a varied channel bottom elevation. Include improvement standards for soft bottom channels.

                          Provide storm drainage in accordance with best management practices and guidelines. Assess the system’s ability to accommodate
                          current and future users, sea level rises, and include all necessary improvements in development plans. Reduce runoff into creeks
                          and the Bay, and address groundwater recharge through the use of pervious materials, retention basins, bio-swales and other meth-
                          ods.

Action EC6.E	   Urban Forestry Management Plan
                Continue to implement the urban forest management plan to guide landscaping practices in urban areas of the City, reduce the
                heat-island effect and contribute to carbon mitigation. Continue the adopt-a-tree program. Coordinate the plan with the “City
                of Richmond urban Forest Management/Master Plan Reforestation supplement (1997)” and related documents for this purpose.
                Update the plan to establish the following measures:
                •	 Create guidelines to establish minimum planting standards and require appropriate tree species and planting densities within
                    newly landscaped areas;
                •	 Update the list of trees to be used as a guideline for all tree planting and focus on local native species;
                •	 Identify maintenance and planting standards for street trees, ensuring that the best practices in urban forestry are being uti-
                    lized including best practices for pruning around above-ground utility lines to ensure the best health and form of street trees;
                •	 Update zoning requirements for street trees in new developments and in parking lots;
                •	 Outline coordination efforts with EBMUD to offer programs or other resources to provide property owners with information
                    on proper tree selection, proper location to reduce heat transfer effects, planting and maintenance; and
                •	 Establish guidelines that require all native tree habitats to be protected and when avoidance is not possible, require mitigation
                    efforts as required by the Public and Private Tree Preservation Ordinance.

Community Vision
Richmond, California in 2030
The City of Richmond is an inclusive, efficient and livable city that provides its residents
with an exceptional quality of life, community facilities and amenities and access to parks
and open space. Richmond promotes efficient growth and the protection of open space by
directing new residential and commercial development into existing urban areas.
Revenue generated by new development supports the construction and modernization of
community facilities. Richmond participates in ongoing, collaborative land use and trans-
portation planning with nearby cities, Contra Costa County and regional transit agencies.
Richmond’s traditional layout, a grid-based block development pattern, supports efficient
and ongoing growth within the core districts.

Policies and Implementing Actions
A range of policies and implementing actions are outlined below in relation to each of the goals. These policies mandate, encourage or allow certain actions
to be pursued throughout the duration of the General Plan. Together they serve as strategic directions for City staff and partners, highlighting where time
and resources should be focused.
Each policy may either be correlated with a number of actions, or simply a single key implementing action. Conversely, some actions may support a range
of policies. The policies and implementing actions are organized in two parts. First, all goal-related policies are described and each policy description is fol-
lowed by a list of its associated implementing actions. Then, implementing actions are described in greater detail in the following section.

               nities and facility enhancements, among others.
               Include an incentive program to promote TDM in the City. Program elements may include reduction in transportation impact
               fees for new or redevelopment projects that demonstrate commitment to TDM strategies and reductions in parking requirements
               for mixed-use development and for projects that provide TDM programs and/or shared parking. Explore the feasibility of devel-
               oping citywide TDM program that would be funded by annual fees or assessment on new development.

Introduction
The State of California has declared that “the availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the
early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family is a priority
of the highest order.” (State Government Code §65580) Accommodating the housing needs of the State of
California is an important goal for the City of Richmond, regional agencies and State agencies. As California’s
population continues to grow and pressure on resources increases, Richmond continues to be concerned with
providing adequate housing opportunities while maintaining a high standard of living for all residents in the
community.
The ethnic and cultural diversity of Richmond residents is a major asset. The City continues to be one of
Contra Costa County’s most diverse communities, with 39.5 percent of 2010 residents Latino, 25.9 percent
African American, and 13.3 percent Asian. Almost one-third of the community is foreign born.
With the adoption of the Richmond General Plan 2030, the City has established a well-defined long-term
plan to address the physical, economic, cultural and social needs of people of all physical abilities, social strata
and income levels. Richmond aims to be an inclusive city where the built environment is functional and
accessible to all residents, development impacts are shared equitably, and new development is sensitive to a
diverse array of social, cultural and environmental contexts. The City values safe housing and neighborhoods
with a range of housing types and price levels to accommodate diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and
lifestyle choices, and promotes policies to restore its traditional compact neighborhoods.
Role of the Housing Element
The State of California recognizes the vital role local governments play in the availability, adequacy and
affordability of housing. As such, State law requires every jurisdiction in California to adopt a comprehensive,
long-term General Plan to guide its physical development; the Housing Element is one of the seven
mandated elements of the General Plan. Housing Element law mandates that local governments adequately
plan to meet the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community. The law
recognizes that in order for the private market to adequately address housing needs and demand, local
governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory systems that provide opportunities for, and do not
unduly constrain, housing development. As a result, State housing policy rests largely upon the effective
implementation of local General Plans and in particular, local Housing Elements. State law also requires the
California State Department of Housing and Community Development (State HCD) to review local housing
elements for compliance and to report its findings to the local government.
Further, California’s Housing Element law requires that each city and county develop local housing programs
to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all income groups. The Association of Bay
Area Governments (ABAG) is responsible for developing and assigning these regional needs, or “RHNA,” to
Bay Area jurisdictions. Consistent with the current RHNA planning period, the Richmond Housing Element
is an eight-year plan extending from January 31, 2015 to January 31, 2023. Further, State of California
Government Code §65583(a)(7) requires “An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and
constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs.” The Housing Element must include the following:
      An analysis of population and employment trends;
      An analysis of the City’s fair share of the regional housing needs;
      An analysis of household characteristics;
                                            City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015    1

        An inventory of suitable land for residential development;
        An analysis of governmental and non-governmental constraints on the improvement, maintenance
         and development of housing;
        An analysis of special housing needs;
        An analysis of opportunities for energy conservation; and
        An analysis of publicly assisted housing developments that may convert to non-assisted housing
         developments (at-risk housing).
The purpose of these requirements is to develop an understanding of the existing and projected housing
needs within the community and to set forth policies that promote preservation, improvement and
development of diverse types and costs of housing throughout Richmond.
This Housing Element Update covers the ABAG’s RHNA projection period for 2014-2022, or the 2014-
2022 RHNA, and was prepared in compliance with State General Plan law pertaining to Housing Elements.
It is necessary to clarify that the 2014-2022 RHNA covers the ABAG planning period from January 31, 2015
to January 31, 2023. Per the State HCD, this document is therefore identified as the 2015-2023 Housing
Element while the 2014-2022 RHNA is consistent with ABAG’s terminology.
Public Participation
According to State of California Government Code §65583(c), local jurisdictions must “make a diligent effort
to achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community in the development of the
housing element, and the program shall describe this effort.” Active community participation throughout the
update process contributes to a Housing Element that is a more thorough and accurate representation of the
City’s needs and desired actions. Public input has played an important role in the formulation of this Housing
Element.
As the Housing Element is an update to the previous Housing Element adopted in 2013, outreach conducted
through the Richmond General Plan 2030 planning process formed the basis for many of the Goals, Policies
and Programs that remain in the updated Housing Element. A new outreach effort was conducted to review
the City’s progress in meeting the objectives of the previous Housing Element, and to identify and address
areas for improvement. Outreach from two community workshops, one stakeholder luncheon, and two
public hearings have provided input on the previous Housing Element and housing issues in general, and has
been incorporated into the 2015-2023 Housing Element Update, as described below.
Outreach through Preparation of the Richmond General Plan 2030
The 2007-2014 Housing Element was developed in tandem with the comprehensive update to Richmond’s
General Plan. Outreach was conducted through the overall General Plan Update process to identify key
housing needs, challenges and successes and to craft a vision for the role of housing access and affordability
in the coming years. Based on input from HCD, additional outreach specific to the 2007-2014 Housing
Element was conducted, with final adoption occurring in January of 2013. The following events and forums
were conducted for the development of the Housing Element as part of the preparation of the Richmond
General Plan 2030. All meetings included robust noticing through mailings, local neighborhood
announcements, leaflets and newspaper advertisements, as well as postings on the City’s website. Bilingual
services were also made available at the meetings.

       Focus Groups comprised of advocates, experts and leaders appropriate to a series of focus areas, one
        of which centered on affordable housing and real estate development, and provided information and
        direction on how to address housing issues in Richmond.
       The “Plan Van,” or a “rolling workshop” aimed at broadening interest and participation in the
        General Plan Update process, which took General Plan Update to Richmond’s residents and
        neighborhoods, either alongside special events or on weekend afternoons in prominent public
        locations, where participants engaged in a map exercise, identifying locations where they desired
        specific changes
       The General Plan project website (www.cityofrichmondgeneralplan.org), which served as a one-stop
        clearinghouse for information about the update. The website included a document library with up-to-
        date General Plan Update documents and resources as well as a comment form that generated over
        100 questions and suggestions.
       Written input, via several emails and letters which were reviewed, recorded, and taken into account
        when developing the Housing Element.
       A Planning Commission Meeting, which provided an opportunity to receive initial public feedback
        and preliminary comments from the Planning Commission on the draft Housing Element.
Additional Housing Element Outreach after Adoption of the Richmond General Plan 2030
In December 2010, the City submitted the Draft Housing Element for review by the State HCD, and in
February 2011, the State HCD submitted comments on the document. After the City adopted the General
Plan 2030 on April 24, 2012, the City began making further revisions to the Housing Element, incorporating
State HCD feedback and soliciting further public participation. The City and its consultant team held
stakeholder interviews and conducted two public workshops in order to continue to gather input for the
Revised Draft Housing Element. These meetings and interviews are discussed below.
Stakeholder Interviews
The City invited more than 60 key stakeholders to participate in interview sessions. On May 30, 2012, the City
conducted 15 stakeholder interviews with 18 people. These sessions provided an opportunity for stakeholders
to provide input on a one-on-one basis. Interviews were conducted in person or on the telephone.
The following ideas and opportunities were identified and discussed during the interviews:
     Increase housing rehabilitation and maintenance
     Revisit inclusionary housing ordinance/in-lieu fees
     Streamline permitting process
     Conduct outreach to improve public awareness and deflect unrealistic expectations
     Develop limited equity housing cooperatives
     Establish a Community Land Trust
     Consider rent control
     Discuss underutilized opportunity sites and different housing types in mixed-use and transit-oriented
        settings

        Address environmental issues
      Address foreclosed properties
The following obstacles were identified and discussed during the interviews:
        Lack of funding and resources
        Issues with the permitting process and procedures
        Perception that City leadership is resistant to change
        Negative public perception that City deters new development
Public Workshops
The City conducted two additional public workshops to solicit input for the 2007-2014 Housing Element
Update. The meetings included discussion regarding Housing Element requirements, the update process, and
areas requiring further attention. All meetings were open to the public and provided opportunity for
questions and comments. Translation services were provided for Spanish-speaking participants.
Notification for the two public workshops was advertised in the West County Times newspaper. Project
information and links were published on the City’s Housing Element webpage and the workshop dates were
listed on the Planning Division’s Event Calendar online. In addition, the workshops were advertised twice in
the City Manager’s Weekly Report, during programming breaks on KCRT Cable Television, and through
weekly e-mail event invites. Event invites were e-mailed three weeks prior to the first workshop and followed
up with reminder emails.
Public Workshop II – June 28, 2012
The workshop was designed to solicit input from community members through coordinated participation in
group activities. It also included a presentation on the status of the Housing Element, as well as an overview
of current data and information on demographic trends, a preliminary sites analysis, and a review of existing
housing programs and initiatives. Seventeen stakeholders participated in the session, including representatives
of Contra Costa County Mental Health Commission, North & East Neighborhood Council, Community
Housing Development Corporation (CHDC), the City’s Design Review Board, Urban Habitat, Richmond
Equitable Development Initiative (REDI), California Apartment Association, Alliance of Californians for
Community Empowerment (ACCE), Richmond Police Department, Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA),
and Richmond Annex Neighborhood Council (RANC).
The workshop discussion focused on the following:
      Establishment of a Community Land Trust, including properties with collective ownership.
        Requirement for the development of on-site affordable units through the inclusionary housing
         ordinance (and discouraged use of in-lieu fee option).
        Identification of solutions for homelessness beyond shelters, renter protection, and tenant-landlord
         conflict resolution through the establishment of a rent board.
        Regulation of foreclosures by State Attorney General and/or district attorney.
        Status of AB 2447, establishing the California Neighborhood Revitalization Partnership of 2012.
        Expansion of the rental properties inspection program, which currently applies to multifamily
         housing with more than three units.
Foreclosures were also identified as a cause for concern, particularly the number of outside investors
purchasing foreclosed properties.
                                            City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 4

In addition to presentations and open community discussion, two exercises were developed to understand
community goals and perceptions of potential opportunity sites to accommodate housing needs. The first
exercise—the desired outcomes exercise—asked participants to write down an ideal outcome of the Housing
Element, either relating to specific Housing Element programs or related to community improvements in a
broader sense. The majority of the responses fell into the following categories:
        Provide adequate affordable housing for all income levels and for both rental and ownership
         residences
        Establish a Community Land Trust
        Support housing rehabilitation
        Expand the rental properties inspection program
Other suggestions included provision of disabled housing, access to healthy food and daily services, walkable
and complete neighborhoods, and adequate use of in-lieu fees.
The second exercise was a mapping exercise that asked participants to identify areas within the community
that could accommodate Richmond’s housing needs, or that required attention in the Housing Element.
Maps labeled with housing inventory sites were placed throughout the room. The participants were asked to
point out sites not already identified on the maps and that were:
      Vacant sites, appropriate for new housing development
      Opportunity sites, appropriate for redevelopment
      Rehabilitation sites, areas with housing in need of rehabilitation
Public Workshop III – August 9, 2012
The third and final public workshop was designed as an in-depth round table discussion on seven recurring
issue areas. Eight stakeholders participated in the session, including representatives of Lao Family
Community, Contra Costa Health Commission, California Apartment Association, ACCE, Virtual
Development Company and BWOPA. The seven issue areas discussed were as follows:
      Foreclosed properties
      Community Land Trust
      Just Cause
      Fair Rent/Rent Control
      Inclusionary Ordinance and In-Lieu Fee
      Affordable Housing Incentives
      Rental Rehabilitation
The discussion for each of these topics included potential recommendations for Housing Element actions.
Outreach for the 2015-2023 Housing Element Update
Outreach for the 5th Cycle, 2015-2023 Housing Element Update provided a constructive assessment of the
near-term progress of the Housing Element and its implementation since adoption in January 2013. Outreach
came in multiple forms, including two public workshops, a stakeholder luncheon, public hearings, as well as
input via comment cards and digital communication with City staff. The City hosted a webpage devoted to
the Housing Element update (www.ci.richmond.ca.us/housingupdate), which contained links to relevant
documents and resources, including input from previous events, information on upcoming events, and
project contacts.

Outreach for all meetings built upon well-established outreach channels recently established during the 2007-
2014 Housing Element, which aimed to solicit participation at all segments of Richmond’s population,
including any and all interested citizens, housing advocates, non-profit affordable housing developers and the
residential development community, organizations representing special needs groups such as the elderly,
homeless, and disabled. Noticing was conducted through well-established outreach channels via email, flyer
postings, city listserv and the City’s website, as well as targeted outreach to stakeholder groups and
community representatives. Project information and links were published on the City’s Housing Element
webpage. In addition, the workshops were advertised twice in the City Manager’s Weekly Report, during
programming breaks on KCRT Cable Television, and through weekly e-mail event invites.
Noticing and outreach materials for the meetings were sent to directors and staff at organizations
representing a cross section of needs and interests in the community, including:
        Contra Costa Health Services
        Community Energy Services Corp.
        Contra Costa County Department of Conservation and Development
        Contra Costa Health Services
        Richmond Neighborhood Coordinating Council

Stakeholder Luncheon
A stakeholder luncheon was held on April 2, 2015 to review the Housing Element Update, and receive
targeted feedback from a balanced mix of residents, including homeowners and renters, and business owners
and developers. The meeting also included a focused discussion on the potential for amendments to the
City’s Just-Cause for Eviction Ordinance, and covered other tenant protections such as rent control.
Approximately 60 persons were in attendance, representing property owners and managers, developers,
tenants, as well as representatives from the HAAS institute, Contra Costa Senior Legal Services, Richmond
Community Foundation, Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, Richmond Progressive
Alliance, Richmond Safe Return Project, California Apartment Association, Community Housing
Development Corporation of North Richmond (CHDC), and Bay Area Rescue Mission. As evidenced by the
input from the meeting described below, a variety of perspectives provided a balanced view on a host of
housing issues in the City.
Specific topics covered at the Stakeholder Luncheon included the Housing Element’s programs, needs,
obstacles, development examples, as concerns with and potential revisions to the City’s Just Cause for
Eviction Ordinance. Input on the Housing Element from the Luncheon and comment cards included:
        More education and outreach and better communication to residents of current housing programs is
         needed
        Additional resources are needed for tenants seeking affordable housing, including:
              o Access and development of more housing
              o Rent control
              o Rent assistance
              o Removal of barriers (see below)
        There should be prohibition of discriminating against renters, particular for low-income and
         criminally convicted residents
        There are differing opinions regarding Just Cause, reflecting the need for clear policy. Some opinions
         include:
              o Better and clearer information regarding the drivers of evictions and displacement is needed
                  to inform Just Cause policy
              o Just Cause would require extra steps to prove unlawful use and may deter investments in
                  housing in Richmond
              o Just Cause is a valid and necessary, and requires a valid reason for eviction that protects
                  tenants from landlords
Community Workshops
Two Community Workshops were held in succession on April 9th and April 14th of 2015 to obtain public
feedback on the Housing Element Update. All meetings were open to the public and facilitated informed
discussion and provided for City staff and consultants to answer questions from participants. Translation
services were provided for Spanish-speaking participants. Approximately 40 people attended the April 9th
workshop, and approximately 50 people attended the workshop on April 14th. Many participated in both
meetings, and attendees included a cross section of ages and ethnicities, representing tenants, neighborhood
groups, property owners, landlords, community residents, and other interested parties. Digital versions of the
workshop presentations and summaries of the input received were provided on the City’s Housing Element
webpage, and allowed for additional input to, and clarification from City staff.

Community Workshop I and Feedback – April 9, 2015
A Community Workshop was held on April 9, 2015 to introduce and review the Housing Element
Update process to the community, and obtain input on the current Housing Element goals, policies and
programs. The workshop included a breakout session centered on each of the 4 goals in the Housing
Element, with group discussion on how well the programs are addressing the community’s needs. The
meeting also included a presentation and discussion on the potential for amendments to the City’s Just-
Cause for Eviction Ordinance. The input received included:
        Provide balanced neighborhoods and de-concentrate poverty
        Ensure housing access for all groups
             o Determine if discrimination is occurring
        Use development/impact fees to develop affordable housing
        Proactively seek funding for improvement programs
        Preserve & enhance Richmond’s unique neighborhoods
        Provide more information and resources for residents & property owners/managers
        Improve blighted conditions through enforcement & incentives
        Transitional housing and re-entry support is a critical need
        Provide special assistance and outreach for elderly and disabled to ensure fair treatment
        Eviction protection is needed for both tenants and property owners
        Rent control is needed, especially for those with special needs
        Increased education, outreach, and transparency is needed for all groups
Community Workshop II and Feedback – April 14, 2015
A follow up Community Workshop was held on April 14, 2015 to build on the previous workshop,
present more detailed information on the Housing Element and housing needs in the City, and confirm
input received to date and suggested refinements and additions to programs for the 2014-22 Update.
The workshop included a presentation on the Housing Element Update Process, including a review of
the updated housing needs assessment and the City’s Zoning Ordinance amendments to comply with SB
2 (a program in the previous Housing Element). The presentation was followed by a discussion to
provide feedback on revisions to specific programs and other issues to address in the Update. The
meeting also included a follow-up presentation and discussion on the potential for amendments to the
City’s Just-Cause for Eviction Ordinance.

Generally, participants confirmed input from the previous workshop on April 9th, and supported
suggested revisions to the Housing Element’s goals, policies and programs. Input received at the second
workshop included:
       The City needs to address concern over the concentration of certain housing, specifically transitional
        and supportive housing and emergency shelters while maintaining compliance with State law
       Clarify the economic factors contributing to the development of housing and specifically, affordable
        housing
       Consider the appropriateness for City-provided funding for affordable housing given current
        economic conditions
       Consider incentives for developers paying prevailing wages, as well as local- or Richmond Corridor-
        based contractors
       More information and review is needed as the City reviews it’s Just Cause for Eviction policy, and
        programs in the Housing Element should accommodate the concerns of both tenants and landlords.
            o Other tenant protections should be considered in conjunction with Just Cause, particularly
                 rent control
Comment Cards
Comment cards were distributed at each meeting and made available via the City’s website. Overall
approximately 16 comment cards were received. Input from comment cards covered a variety of topics, and
included:
      consideration by the city to grant a ‘super density’ bonus to developers that agree to pay prevailing
        wages and use local apprentices for construction workers;
      concern about escalating rents and potential for displacement of existing residents;
      consideration of teachers as a special needs groups;
      concerns about expanding just-cause on housing production, vacancy rates;
      concern about the condition of housing in Richmond; and,
      need to address re-entry population in housing policies
Public Hearings
The Housing Element Update was presented and action taken at two public hearings of the Planning
Commission and City Council. The Public Review Draft Housing Element Update was an agenda item and
open for public comment. Input received at the public meetings are presented in Appendix G.

Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
State of California Government Code §65300.5 requires that “...the general plan and elements and parts
thereof comprise an integrated, internally consistent, and compatible statement of policies...” The purpose of
requiring internal consistency is to avoid policy conflict and provide a clear policy guide for the future
maintenance, improvement and development of housing within the City.
As part of the update of the Housing Element, the other Elements of the Richmond General Plan 2030 were
reviewed to ensure consistency with the policies set forth in those elements. The City will maintain
consistency between the Housing Element and the other General Plan elements so that policies introduced in
one element are consistent with other elements. Whenever any element of the General Plan is amended in the
future, the Housing Element will be reviewed and modified, if necessary, to ensure continued consistency
among elements.
Organization
The Housing Element is organized into the following sections:
     Community Profile presents the current population, employment, household and housing trends in
         the City.
     Housing Needs details the existing housing needs of the City including special needs groups and
         their housing needs and the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) Regional Housing
         Needs Determination (RHND) for the City.
     Housing Constraints includes an assessment of the various government and non-government
         constraints that may serve as a potential constraint to housing development and improvement in
         Richmond. It discusses potential city constraints to housing for persons with disabilities and reviews
         City efforts to remove constraints.
     Housing Resources and Opportunities presents an inventory of residential sites, and evaluates the
         availability of land resources for future housing development. It includes an analysis of potential
         development constraints of the sites identified for availability for residential development and
         examines opportunities for energy conservation.
     Review of Previous Housing Element Performance presents an analysis of the previous housing
         element and its effectiveness.
     Housing Goals, Policies and Actions represents the commitment of the City of Richmond to
         address the housing needs of the community, comply with state and federal housing requirements,
         and to implement the vision of the Richmond General Plan 2030.
                                             City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 10

Community Profile
This section of the Housing Element presents demographic and socioeconomic data such as population,
household characteristics, housing stock conditions, and employment. Analysis of these demographic,
housing and employment characteristics provides the background to adequately determine Richmond’s
present and future housing needs.
Population
Demographic changes such as population growth or changes in age can affect the type and amount of
housing that is needed in a community. This section addresses population, age, race and ethnicity, educational
attainment, and employment of Richmond residents.
Population Growth
Table 5.1 compares population growth between Richmond and Contra Costa County. Although Richmond
has grown at a slower rate than the County as a whole over the last decade, Richmond is expected grow at a
faster pace than the County over the next two decades. In 2000, Richmond’s population was 99,216.
Between 2000 and 2010, Richmond grew at an average annual rate of 0.4 percent while the County grew at an
average annual rate of 1.0 percent. As of 2010, Richmond’s population was 103,701. Between 2010 and 2030,
Richmond is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 1.2 percent compared to an annual growth rate of
1.0 percent for the County. By 2030, Richmond’s total population is expected to reach 132,600.
Age Distribution
Housing need is often affected by the age characteristics of residents in the community. Different age groups
have different lifestyles, income levels, and family types that influence housing needs. These housing choices
evolve over time, and it is important to examine the changes in the age distribution of Richmond residents in
order to identify potential impacts on housing needs.
Table 5.2 compares Richmond’s age distribution between 2000 and 2010 compared to Contra Costa County
in 2010. Richmond’s population is steadily aging. Between 2000 and 2010 Richmond’s median age increased
from 32.8 to 34.8. Adults age 45 to 64 experienced the greatest change of all age groups, increasing from
21.2 percent of Richmond’s population in 2000 to 25.2 percent in 2010, a 24 percent increase. In contrast,
children age 5 to 17 decreased from 20 percent of Richmond’s population to 17.5 percent during the same
period. However, compared to Contra Costa County, Richmond’s population in general is younger.
Approximately 40 percent of Contra Costa County’s population is over 45 years old, compared to only
35 percent of Richmond’s population.
Racial and Ethnic Composition
Table 5.3 compares Richmond’s racial and ethnic makeup in 2000 and 2010. Richmond continues to be one
of Contra Costa County’s most diverse communities with increasingly large Latino and Asian populations.
In 2000, African Americans accounted for 35.6 percent of Richmond residents while Latinos, Non-Hispanic
Whites and Asians accounted for 26.5, 21.2 and 12.2 percent respectively. In 2010, 39.5 percent of
Richmond’s residents were Latino, 25.9 percent were African American, 17.1 percent were Non-Hispanic
White and 13.3 percent were Asian.
Table 5.4 compares Richmond’s foreign-born population in 2000 and 2013 estimates. Between 2000 and
2013, Richmond’s foreign-born population grew by 33.5 percent to 32,388 (32.7 percent of Richmond’s total
population). Table 5.4 also identifies the number of households in Richmond that are linguistically isolated.
The U.S. Census Bureau defines linguistically isolated households as households where no member over
                                            City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 11

14 years of age speaks English “very well.” In 2000, 9.2 percent of Richmond’s households were linguistically
isolated. Recent immigrants and linguistically isolated households may face greater difficulties in gaining
meaningful employment and acquiring adequate housing as they adjust to their new surroundings. As a result,
household problems such as overcrowding and overpayment may be more likely.

Education and Employment
A person’s level of education greatly influences her or his future income and in turn affects the type of
housing that person can afford. Evaluation of the types of jobs held by community residents provides insight
into potential earning power and the segment of the housing market into which they fall. Information on how
a community’s employment base is growing and changing can help identify potential housing demand
changes in the future.
Educational Attainment
Table 5.5 compares the level of educational attainment for Richmond residents. Current estimates suggest
that a considerable percentage of Richmond residents continue to have less than a high school level of
education. It is estimated that between 2000 and 2013, the percentage of Richmond residents 25 years and
older with less than a high school diploma decreased slightly from 24.7 to 22.6 percent. Although the
decrease suggests some improvement, the percentage of Richmond residents 25 years and older with less than
a high school level of education is estimated to be 11.4 percent points higher than Contra Costa County.
Employment
Table 5.6 compares employment for Richmond residents in 2000 and 2013. Estimates indicate most
Richmond residents continue to be employed in lower wage sectors such as the service, and production and
transportation sectors. The proportion of Richmond residents employed in these sectors between 2000 and
2013 is estimated to have increased from 31.5 to 36.5 percent. During the same period, Richmond residents
employed in the higher wage managerial and professional sector decreased from 33 to 30.6 percent.
Table 5.7 identifies the principal employers in Richmond by number of employees. The principal employers
in Richmond are Chevron Refinery, West Contra Costa Unified School District, Social Security
Administration, U.S. Postal Service, and Contra Costa County.
Unemployment
Table 5.8 compares the unemployment rates for Richmond and the County between 2000 and November
2014. Although unemployment rates have remained high at both the local and national level since the start of
the economic recession in 2007, Richmond’s unemployment rate has been historically higher than the County
rate. Between 2007 and 2014, Richmond’s unemployment rate rose to 14.5 percent before dropping 9.4
percent. During the same time frame, the County’s unemployment rate increased from 4.7 to 5.7 percent.
Richmond’s unemployment rate has ranged between 2.5 and 6.7 percent higher than the County’s rate of
unemployment for over a decade.

Job Growth
Table 5.9 compares job growth in Richmond and the County. Prior to the economic recession of 2007,
the number of jobs in Richmond was growing at a faster pace than in the County overall. Between 2000 and
2005, Richmond is estimated to have added 1,800 jobs. This accounts for 23.3 percent of the estimated
7,720 total jobs added by the County during the same period. This trend is projected to reemerge as the local
and national economy recovers. Between 2010 and 2030, Richmond is projected to add 23,460 jobs, which
will represent 16.7 percent of total jobs projected to be added by the County as a whole. The jobs projected
to be added countywide are expected to be primarily in health and educational services (25.4 percent),
professional and managerial services (14.8 percent) and retail (12.0 percent).

Households
Household characteristics are important factors when analyzing housing demand and supply, as well as future
housing needs. Household type and size, age, composition, and income level all affect the type of housing
needed in a community. This section details the various household characteristics affecting housing needs in
Richmond.
Household Growth
Table 5.10 compares household growth in Richmond and the County. Prior to the economic recession of
2007, the number of households in Richmond was growing at a slower pace than in the County overall. This
trend is expected to reverse as the local and national economy recovers. Richmond added 1,085 households
between 2000 and 2005. This accounted for just 4.5 percent of the 24,181 total households added by the
County overall during the same time frame. Between 2010 and 2030, Richmond is projected to add 10,380
households. This would represent an estimated gain of 519 households per year over the next 20 years.
Household Tenure
Housing tenure refers to whether a housing unit is owned, rented or vacant. Tenure is an important indicator
of the housing climate of a community, reflecting the relative cost of housing opportunities, and the ability of
residents to afford housing. Tenure also influences residential mobility, with owner units generally evidencing
lower turnover rates than rental housing. Table 5.11 compares household tenure in Richmond between 2000
and 2010. Between 2000 and 2010, Richmond added 1,468 households. During the same period the rate of
homeownership declined by 1.6 percent compared the rate of renters. The rate of homeownership in
Richmond is also much lower compared to Contra Costa County. In 2010, 67.1 percent of households in
Contra Costa County were homeowners compared to 51.7 percent in Richmond.
Household Composition and Size
Table 5.12 compares household composition and household size in Richmond between 2000 and 2010.
The proportions of Richmond’s family and non-family households are estimated to have remained stable
between 2000 and 2010, with the proportion of family households continuing to be substantially higher than
non-family households. In 2010, it is estimated that 66.5 percent of households were composed of families.
Of those households, relatively equal proportions consisted of families married with children and married
without children. Similar to Richmond’s household composition, average household size is also estimated to
have remained relatively unchanged from 2.82 persons per household in 2000 to 2.83 in 2010.
Overcrowding
Overcrowding is defined as a situation where there is more than one person per room in an occupied housing
unit. Severely overcrowding is defined as more than one and one-half persons per room in an occupied
housing unit. Overcrowding can result from a low supply of affordable and adequate housing. Households
that are unable to afford larger housing units may be forced to rent or purchase housing that is too small to
meet their needs. Table 5.13 compares overcrowding in Richmond between 2000 and 2013. The percentage
of overcrowded households in Richmond is estimated to have declined from 15.3 percent in 2000 to
9.1 percent in 2013. Overcrowding continues to be higher among renter households, which represented
76.6 percent of overcrowded households in 2013.
Household Income
Table 5.14 compares household income levels in Richmond between 2000 and 2013, and presents County
estimates. Richmond’s median household income is estimated to have continued to lag behind the County
overall. In 2000, Richmond’s median household income ($44,210) was 69.4 percent of the County’s median
of $63,674. More recently in 2013, Richmond’s median income ($54,589) was estimated to have been
69.3 percent of the County’s median income ($78,756).

Table 5.15 lists Richmond’s median household income in 2013 by race and as a percentage of City and
County median household incomes. Estimates show that Richmond’s median household income continues to
vary significantly by race. Specifically, household median incomes are estimated to be significantly lower
among African American, Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, and Latino households as a percentage of the City’s
and the County’s median household income. In contrast, Asians and Whites are estimated to have median
household incomes significantly higher than the City’s overall median household income and slightly lower
than the County’s.
Table 5.16 shows the level of poverty in Richmond between 2000 and 2013. The number of persons living in
poverty is estimated to have increased from 16 percent in 2000 to 186.53 percent in 2013. Both adults ages 18
and over and children ages 18 and under experienced a decrease in poverty, while all other groups may have
experienced an increase in poverty.

Housing Stock
This section describes the City’s housing stock, including tenure, age, condition, vacancy, and at-risk housing.
Housing Type and Growth
Table 5.17 compares Richmond’s housing stock between 2000 and 2013. Detached single-family homes
continue to make up the majority of residential units in Richmond, comprising 56.7 percent of the total
estimated housing stock in 2013. Multifamily structures with three to four units were the next most common
type, comprising 9.3 percent of Richmond’s housing stock in 2013.
Table 5.17 also compares Richmond’s housing growth between 2000 and 2013. The total number of housing
units in Richmond is estimated to have increased by 11.4 percent from 36,044 in 2000 to 40,169 in 2013.
This represents an overall increase of 4,125 housing units during the 13-year period and on average, 317 units
constructed per year. The largest numerical increase in housing units was in detached single-family homes,
which increased by 2,307 units.
Housing Age and Condition
Age is an important factor in the condition of a housing unit. Typically, after 30 years most housing units
show signs of deterioration and need reinvestment to maintain its condition. Without proper maintenance,
housing that is over 50 years old requires major reinvestment to maintain its quality and appearance.
                                           City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 19

Homeowners with older units may require assistance to upgrade conditions or such units will become
substandard for use by homeowners or renters and many eventually become unsuitable for occupancy.
Table 5.18 lists Richmond’s housing stock by year built. It is estimated that as of 2013, 70.4 percent of
Richmond’s housing units were over 30 years old and that 47.6 percent were over 50 years old, which
indicates an older housing stock.
The most recent survey and analysis of conditions in the City’s former Redevelopment Areas was conducted
in 2008, and found a wide variety of building types, ages and conditions. A substantial number of buildings in
the Redevelopment Areas were found to suffer from very extensive or extensive building deficiencies. While
these findings are approximately 7 years old, conditions are less likely to have changed significantly due to the
economic recession that followed. Buildings in these areas exhibited major adverse conditions that would
likely be costly to remedy, including dilapidation, dry rot or termite damage, poor alignment or subsidence,
structurally unsound foundations, informal or substandard construction, and fire damage. The field survey
indicated that buildings exhibiting major adverse conditions were found throughout the Redevelopment
Areas. Appendix A includes a map of buildings with major adverse (114 buildings) and multiple adverse (269
buildings) physical conditions identified during the 2008 survey.
Serious building-related code violations are further evidence of unsafe and unhealthy buildings.
Building-related code violations provide a snapshot of the interior, as well as exterior, building conditions.
Within Richmond, approximately 543 cases were found to be open as of April, 2015. Cases that were deemed
abated or unfounded were not included in the analysis. Of the open cases, approximately 510 cases or 61
percent were in the Redevelopment Areas. Of these cases, 45 complaints were related to building health and
safety issues (compared to 96 for the entire City).
Vacancy Rates
A vacancy rate measures the overall housing availability in a community and is often a good indicator of how
efficiently for-sale and rental housing units are meeting the current demand for housing. A vacancy rate of
five percent for rental housing and two percent for ownership housing is generally considered healthy and
suggests a balance between the demand and supply of housing. A lower vacancy rate may indicate that
households are having difficulty in finding housing that is affordable, leading to overcrowding or households
having to pay more than they can afford. A low vacancy rate or a particularly ‘tight’ housing market may also
lead to high competition for units, raising rental and housing prices substantially.
Vacancy trends in housing are analyzed using a vacancy rate that establishes the relationship between housing
supply and demand. If the demand for housing is greater than the available supply, then the vacancy rate is
probably low and the price of housing will most likely remain stable.
Table 5.19 compares vacancy rates in Richmond and the County between 2000 and 2013. It is estimated that
Richmond continues to have higher vacancy rates than the County overall. Richmond’s vacancy rate is
estimated to have increased from 3.9 percent in 2000 to 9.9 percent in 2013 while the County’s increased
from 2.9 to 6.5 percent during the same period. The vacancy rate of rental units in Richmond was 3.8 times
the vacancy rate of owner occupied units in 2013 compared to the County rate of 2.7 times. Given the
housing crisis and economic recession that began in 2007, vacancy rates in Richmond and the County have
increased.

At-Risk Housing
California Housing Element law requires all jurisdictions to include a study of all low-income housing units
that may at some future time be lost to the affordable inventory by the expiration of some type of
affordability restrictions. The law requires that the analysis and study cover a 10-year period, and be divided
into two periods, coinciding with updates of the Housing Element. Three general cases that can result in the
conversion of public assisted units:
        Prepayment of HUD mortgages: Section 221(d)(3), Section 202 and Section 236 – A Section 221
         (d)(3) is a privately owned project where the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
         (HUD) provides either below market interest rate loans or market rate loans with a subsidy to the
         tenants. With Section 236 assistance, HUD provides financing to the owner to reduce the costs for
         tenants by paying most of the interest on a market rate mortgage. Additional rental subsidy may be
         provided to the tenant. Section 202 assistance provides a direct loan to nonprofit organizations for
         project development and rent subsidy for low-income elderly tenants. Section 202 also provides
         assistance for the development of units for physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, and
         chronically mentally ill residents.
        Opt-outs and expirations of project-based Section 8 contracts – Section 8 is a federally funded
         program that provides for subsidies to the owner of a pre-qualified project for the difference
         between the tenant’s ability to pay and the contract rent. Opt-outs occur when the owner of the
         project decides to opt-out of the contract with HUD by pre-paying the remainder of the mortgage.
         Usually, the likelihood of opt-outs increases as the market rents exceed the contract rents.
        Other – Expiration of the low-income use period of various financing sources, such as Low Income
         Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), bond financing, density bonuses, California Housing Finance Agency
         (CHFA), Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME programs and redevelopment
         funds. Generally, bond financing properties expire according to a qualified project period or when
         the bonds mature.
The City of Richmond contains a variety of assisted rental units and complexes, which utilize a range of
funding mechanisms. Table 5.20 presents rental housing units identified by the California Housing
Partnership Corporation (CHPC) as at risk of conversion. Excluding units for which expiration dates are
unknown, a total of 199 of Richmond’s rental housing units are currently considered at a moderate-risk of
converting. The CHPC identified an additional 2,416 units that are considered at low-risk of conversion.
Many of these units are federally-assisted through the Section 8 Program. Staff is currently trying to make
contact with a HUD staff person to confirm that these contracts are intended to be renewed. It is possible
that any of these complexes may opt out of Section 8 subsidy and return to market rate rent at the time of
annual contract expiration. Such conversion could occur during the lifetime of this Housing Element.
The surest way to ensure that no units convert to market rate within the planning period is to acquire and
preserve all at-risk units or construct new housing to replace those units. Either of these methods will ensure
affordable controls and price restrictions are extended to at-risk households under current federal, state, and
local programs. In Richmond, the cost of preserving assisted units is estimated to be less than that required to
replace the units through new construction. Preservation of assisted units generally requires subsidizing the
difference between market-rate and assisted rents. Since land prices and land availability are generally the
limiting factors to development of new affordable housing, it is estimated that subsidizing rents to preserve
assisted housing is more feasible and economical than construction.
Cost of Replacement or Preservation
The cost of replacing the very high-risk units identified in Table 5.20, based on a market survey of the costs
of land and construction, would be approximately $239,000 for a two-bedroom 720 square-foot unit in 2012,
                                             City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 21

including financing and permit fees. This assumes no profit and sales or marketing fees, since the City would
be developing these projects itself and would not need to profit from them. To replace all 199 federally
assisted multifamily units at moderate-risk within the current planning period would cost approximately
$47.6 million. If on the other hand, the City were to acquire all 199 units at market rate and rehabilitate them,
the cost would be approximately $32.2 million assuming a total estimated $161,990 cost of preserving a unit.
Based on these estimates, the cost of replacement far outweighs the costs associated with acquiring and
rehabilitating all at-risk units. A more important factor to consider is that not all units identified as being
at-risk are in need of rehabilitation, but may simply require acquisition in order to be preserved as affordable
units. This would reduce the amount of money required for preservation. Nonetheless, the cost of acquisition
alone is significant enough to discourage plans to acquire all units. The most economical option is to continue
the status-quo by providing subsidies to households and helping property owners keep assisted housing
affordable for lower income households, while at the same time, acquiring and rehabilitating units when
necessary.
Entities Qualified to Preserve At-Risk Units
The State HCD maintains a current list of all qualified entities across the state. A qualified entity is a
nonprofit or for-profit organization or individual that agrees to maintain the long-term affordability of
affordable housing developments. The qualified entities that the State HCD lists for Contra Costa County are
shown in Table 5.21.

Housing Needs
This section of the Housing Element includes data that assists in the determination of the future housing
needs for current and future residents of Richmond. It analyzes housing costs, affordability and overpayment;
presents information on special needs populations; and describes the region’s housing needs and Richmond’s
Regional “Fair share” allocation.
Housing Cost, Affordability and Overpayment
The affordability of housing in Richmond can be assessed by comparing market rents and sales prices with
the amount that households of different income levels can afford to pay for housing. Compared together, this
information reveals which households can afford what size and type of housing as well as indicates the type
of households that would most likely experience overcrowding or overpayment. According to HUD,
the generally accepted definition of housing affordability is for a household to pay no more than 30 percent
of its annual income on housing. Households that pay over 30 percent of their income for housing are
considered cost burdened and may have difficulty affording other basic necessities.
Cost and Affordability of Ownership Housing
Table 5.22 lists the median sales prices of single-family homes in Richmond in 2000, 2005 and 2014. Prior to
the start of the economic downturn in 2007, the residential real estate market experienced a substantial
increase in prices resulting from historically low mortgage rates, low inventory of homes available for sale,
a steadily growing labor market, and an increasing population. However, as a result of the subsequent
mortgage and foreclosure crisis, median home sales prices decreased dramatically throughout the country.
In Richmond, the median home sales price is estimated to have decreased 24.8 percent, from $430,000 in
2005 to approximately $323,500 in 2014.
Table 5.23 shows the maximum sales prices that were considered to be affordable to extremely low, very
low, low, and moderate-income households based on income limits published by the State HCD in 2014.
The maximum sales price affordable to a very low-income four-person household in 2014 was $178,861.
As shown in Table 5.22, the median sales price of a single-family home as of 2014 was estimated at $323,500.
This data suggests that the average single-family home in Richmond is becoming increasingly less affordable
to very low, low and moderate income households capable of qualifying for mortgages under the stricter
lending requirements that have emerged since the mortgage crisis began in 2007.
Cost and Affordability of Rental Housing
Table 5.24 lists the median gross rents in Richmond in 2000, 2010 and 2015. The median gross rent is
estimated to have increased by 53.4 percent from $764 in 2000 to $1,172 in 2015. This increase coincides with
the considerable increase in median sales prices for single-family homes prior to the recession. However,
unlike home prices, rents have not decreased during the recession.
Table 5.25 shows the maximum monthly rents that were considered to be affordable to extremely low, very
low, low, and moderate-income households. The maximum affordable rent for a very low-income four-
person household in 2014 was $1,169. As shown in Table 5.26, 4.7 percent of all two bedroom rental units
rented for less than $1,000 in 2013. This suggests that Richmond’s rental housing stock has become less
affordable to very low, low and moderate income households.

Overpaying Households
Table 5.27 compares the proportion of Richmond and County households that were estimated to have been
overpaying for housing in 2013. A larger percentage of Richmond residents (46.8 percent) were overpaying
compared to residents in the County as a whole (43.5 percent). Of all Richmond residents estimated to have
been overpaying for housing, 19.5 percent consisted of owner households and 27.3 percent of renter
households.
Table 5.28 summarizes the number of low-income households, by tenure, paying more than 30 percent of
their income on housing. In 2013, an estimated 82.1 percent of low-income renter households and
60.6 percent of low-income owner households paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing.
Extremely Low-income Housing Needs
Extremely low-income households earn 30 percent or less of median household income. In 2013, the median
household income in Richmond was $54,589. This results in a household income of $16,377 or less for an
extremely low households. According to 2011 estimates, 19.9 percent of households (7,135 of 35,885) in
Richmond had extremely low incomes. Most extremely low-income households (76.8 percent) were renters
and experienced a high incidence of housing problems. A household is said to have a housing problem if one
or more of the following conditions exist: (1) lack of complete kitchen facilities; (2) lack of complete
plumbing facilities; (3) overcrowding; and/or (4) cost burdened. A household is cost burdened if monthly
housing costs, including utilities, exceed 30 percent of monthly income.
Table 5.29 indicates the number of extremely low-income households that experienced housing problems,
or had cost burdens greater than 30 and 50 percent of household income. An estimated 81.8 percent (4,480)
of extremely low-income renter households and 69.2 percent (1,145) of extremely low-income owner
households experienced housing problems. Moreover, 64.1 percent (4,575) of extremely low-income
households paid more than 50 percent of their household income toward housing costs, compared to
23.8 percent for all Richmond households.
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) for Richmond estimates that 438 very low-income units
are needed between 2014 and 2022. The City estimates that 50 percent (allowed per State law methodology)
of its very low-income housing allocation is needed for housing affordable to extremely low-income
households. Therefore, the City projects that 219 extremely low-income units are needed during this RHNA
period.

Special Needs Populations
Certain households have more difficulty in finding decent and affordable housing due to special
circumstances such as economic status, age, disability, household size and household type. As a result, these
households may experience a higher prevalence of overpaying, overcrowding, and other housing problems.
Special needs populations in Richmond include seniors, large family households, female-headed households,
persons with disabilities, and homeless persons and families.
Senior Persons and Households
Seniors have special needs primarily resulting from physical disabilities and limitations, income, and health
care costs. Additionally, senior households also have other needs to preserve their independence including
supportive services to maintain their health and safety, in-home support services to perform activities of daily
living, conservators to assist with personal care and financial affairs, public administration assistance to
manage and resolve estate issues, and networks of care to provide a wide variety of services and daily
assistance.
Table 5.30 shows the growth in Richmond’s senior population from 1990 to 2010. Richmond’s senior
population is estimated to have increased by 6.8 percent between 1990 and 2010. During that same period
however, it is estimated that the proportion of seniors to the rest of Richmond’s population hovered at
around ten percent. Table 5.31 lists Richmond’s 2010 senior population by age and gender. The majority of
Richmond seniors (58.2 percent) are female. Seniors over the age of 80, who may require additional care due
to their advanced age, represented 25.4 percent of all seniors in 2010. Table 5.32 compares Richmond’s
senior households in 2010 by tenure. Senior households are estimated to have represented 10.2 percent of the
total population in 2010. Of those senior households, 73.3 percent were owner occupied. Table 5.33
describes the services that are available for the elderly or disabled in Richmond.

Large Family Households
Large family households are defined as households of five or more persons. Large family households are
considered a special needs group due to the limited availability of affordable and adequately sized housing to
accommodate their needs. The more persons in a household, the more rooms are needed to accommodate
that household. Specifically, a five-person household would require three or four bedrooms, a six-person
household would require four bedrooms, and a seven-person household would require four to six bedrooms.
Table 5.34 compares the number of large households to the type and number of occupied housing units in
2013. Richmond continues to have a sufficient amount of housing units to accommodate the needs of large
households. It is estimated that 4,915 households (13.6 percent of all households) had five or more persons
and 17,715 occupied housing units had three or more bedrooms.

Single Parent-Headed Households
Finding affordable, decent, and safe housing is often more difficult for single parent-headed households.
Single parent-headed households tend to have special needs involving access to daycare or childcare, health
care, and other supportive services. In addition, single parent-headed households with children in particular
tend to have lower incomes, which limits their housing options and access to supportive services.
Table 5.35 lists the estimated number of single parent-headed households in Richmond as well as the
proportion of those households that were considered to be under the poverty level as of 2013. An estimated
20.3 percent of households (7,361) were headed by females, with a relatively equal proportion with children
and without children. A smaller percentage (6.3 percent) of single parent-households were headed by males,
with a relatively equal proportion with children and without children. Of the 1,096 families under the poverty
level in Richmond, 2,173 (57.7 percent) were female-headed.

Persons with Disabilities
A disability is defined as a long lasting condition that impairs individual’s mobility, ability to work, or ability to
care for his or herself. Persons with disabilities include persons having work or employment disabilities,
physical disabilities, self-care limitations, sensory disabilities and mental disabilities. Disabled persons have
special housing needs because of their fixed income, shortage of affordable and accessible housing, and
higher health costs associated with their disability.
Tables 5.36 list the number of Richmond residents with disabilities by employment status in 2013. Residents
with disabilities accounted for 8.1 percent of all Richmond residents between the ages of 18 and 64 in 2013. A
total of 1,790 working age persons with disabilities were employed in the City, or 2.6% of the working age
population. By comparison, significantly more persons with disabilities were not in the labor force, totaling
5.5% of all working age residents in the City.
Tables 5.37 list the number of Richmond residents with disabilities by disability type in 2013. A total of
11,001 persons with disabilities are reported in Richmond. Hearing and vision difficulty are reported for ages
5 and under (cognitive and other disabilities may be present but not diagnosed), with vision difficulties
reported for all in that age group. Disabilities for persons ranging from ages 5-64 vary, but cognitive and
independent living difficulties are most prevalent. The majority of seniors with disabilities ages 65 and over
experience ambulatory and independent living difficulty.

Developmentally Disabled Persons
According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code a "developmental disability" is defined as a
disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue,
indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which includes mental retardation,
cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes disabling conditions found to be closely related to
mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but
does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional housing
environment; however, more severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where
supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment
where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before
adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the
person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based services to
approximately 256,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide system
of regional centers, developmental centers and community-based facilities. The Regional Center of the
East Bay provides point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. The center is a
private, nonprofit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to
individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.
Table 5.38 provides a summary of persons with developmental disabilities in Richmond. Persons with
developmental disabilities represent less than one percent of the City’s population.
There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living with a development disability: rent
subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, inclusionary housing, Section 8 vouchers,

special programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The design of housing-accessibility
modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities
represent some of the types of considerations that are important in serving this need group. Incorporating
‘barrier-free’ design in all, new multifamily housing (as required by State and Federal Fair Housing laws) is
especially important to provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents. Special consideration
should also be given to the affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed
income.
In order to assist in the housing needs for persons with developmental disabilities, the City will implement
programs to provide incentives for residential developments that make 15 percent or more of their total units
accessible to persons with disabilities, pursue funding sources for persons with special needs and disabilities,
inventory single-room occupancy units (SROs) which provide an important opportunity for housing for
persons with disabilities, and continue the City’s Home Improvement Loan Program, which will give special
consideration for seniors and persons with disabilities.

Homeless Persons and Families
Homeless individuals and families have perhaps the most immediate housing need of any group. They also
have one of the most difficult sets of housing needs to meet, due to both the diversity and complexity of the
factors that lead to homelessness, and to potential community opposition to the sitting of facilities that serve
homeless clients. California State law requires that Housing Elements estimate the need for emergency shelter
for homeless people.
The Contra Costa County Homeless Continuum Care Annual Report provides program and demographic
data for homeless persons. According to the most recent report, between July 2013 and June 2014,
approximately 8,409 people used homeless services in Contra Costa County. Of these consumers, about half
(48 percent) were between the ages of 25 and 54. Almost a quarter (24 percent) were under 17 years of age.
The remaining percentage was comprised of consumers between the ages of 18 and 24 (10 percent) and
above the age of 55 (18 percent). Additionally, the 2014 Point in Time Count estimated that at a given point
in time there are 2,263 sheltered homeless individuals throughout Contra Coast County. The Contra Costa
Inter-Jurisdictional Council on Homelessness provided a homeless count for unsheltered individuals in the
City of Richmond of 142. While portions of the homeless community are visible, a segment of the
population may not be seen on a street corner or receive services from a shelter or other community
organization. Some persons and families may live in a car, a motel, or stay on a friend or relative’s couch.

Three factors are indicated in the 2004 Ending Homelessness in Ten Years: A County-wide Plan for the
Communities of Contra Costa County as the root causes of homelessness:
      low incomes and high housing costs;
        failure to identify at-risk households and link them with preventative services; and
        lack of housing or linkages to support services for those discharged from public institutions.
Table 5.39 lists a variety of resources in and/or available to the homeless in the City of Richmond.
These resources provide housing options ranging from emergency shelter to transitional housing and also
offer services including meals, jobs training, housing assistance, supportive services, basic life skills, and a
variety of services for homeless persons.
Bay Area Rescue Mission (maximum stay of four to six weeks), Brookside Shelter, Richmond House
(overnight stay), and Richmond Endeavor (overnight stay) each operate a permanent facility that provides
services to the homeless community, including year-round beds, meals, case management, housing and job
assistance and other general services. Emergency motel vouchers are available through the Contra Costa
Crisis Center while Greater Richmond Interfaith provides a winter shelter program. Deliverance House
operates a transitional housing facility with maximum stays from 12 to 18 months and supportive services,
including meals, and job, life and basic skills training. Lodging and meals are also offered by several local
churches.

Agricultural Workers
Agricultural workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through seasonal
agricultural work. They have special housing needs because they earn lower incomes than many other workers
and move throughout the season from one harvest to the next. The 2008-2010 American Community Survey
indicates that of the estimated employed persons in the City of Richmond (46,233 persons), 0.2 percent, or
90 persons, were estimated to have been employed in the farming, fishing, and forestry sector. Because
Richmond is not agricultural area, the number of agricultural workers in the City is not expected to increase in
the near or long-term future. Therefore, given the extremely limited presence of agricultural workers in the
community, the city has no specialized housing programs targeted to this group beyond overall programs for
housing affordability and no additional housing is or would be needed for agricultural workers in Richmond.
                                                     City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015            37
Regional Housing Needs Allocation
California’s Housing Element law (Government Code §65584) requires that each city and county develop
local housing programs to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all income groups, as
determined by the jurisdiction’s Council of Governments. This “fair share” allocation concept seeks to ensure
that each jurisdiction accepts responsibility for the housing needs of not only its resident population, but also
for the jurisdiction’s projected share of regional housing growth across all income categories. Regional growth
needs are defined as the number of units that would have to be added in each jurisdiction to accommodate
the forecasted number of households, as well as the number of units that would have to be added to
compensate for anticipated demolitions and changes to achieve an “ideal” vacancy rate.
A Regional Housing Needs Plan is mandated by the State of California for regions to address housing issues
and needs based on future growth projections for the area. In the nine-county Bay Area, in which Richmond
is located, the plan is developed by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), and is called the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the San Francisco Bay Area: 2014-2022, or the 2014-2022 RHNA
The plan allocates to cities and the unincorporated county their “fair share” or Regional Housing Needs
Allocation of the region’s projected housing needs. The Regional Housing Needs Plan allocates the RHNA
based on household income groupings over a seven-year projection period for each specific jurisdiction’s
Housing Element. As discussed in the Introduction, the 2014-2022 RHNA covers the planning period from
January 31, 2015 to January 31, 2023.
In allocating the region’s future housing needs to jurisdictions, ABAG is required to take the following
factors into consideration:
      Market demand for housing
      Employment opportunities
      Availability of suitable sites and public facilities
      Commuting patterns
      Type and tenure of housing
        Loss of units in assisted housing developments
        Over-concentration of lower income households
        Geological and topographical constraints
The intent of the RHNA is to ensure that local jurisdictions address not only the needs of their immediate
areas, but also fill the housing needs for the entire region. Additionally, a major goal of the RHNA is to
assure that every community provides an opportunity for a mix of affordable housing to all economic
segments of its population. The RHNA jurisdictional allocations are made to ensure that adequate sites and
zoning are provided to address existing and anticipated housing demands during the planning period and that
market forces are not inhibited in addressing the housing needs for all facets of a particular community.
Table 5.40 provides the RHNA target for the planning period 2015 to 2023 (also referred to as “basic
construction needs”) for each of the four household income groups for the City of Richmond. Also
presented in Table 5.40 is a summary of units constructed or approved in the City during the planning period
and the remaining RHNA need.
ABAG’s 2014-2022 RHNA for the City of Richmond is 2,435 new housing units. The City of Richmond
needs to provide adequate sites for 743 housing units affordable to very low and low-income households, or
30.5 percent of all new housing units. In addition, sites accommodating 1,692 housing units available to
moderate and above moderate income households will need to be provided.

Since January 1, 2014 a total of 892 housing units have been approved, permitted and/or completed in the
City of Richmond. Of those units, 601 were for very low and low-income households, and 291 for moderate
and above moderate-income households. Table 5.56, included the housing Opportunities Section, identifies
the housing funding source and units by income level for projects approved, permitted and/or completed
since 2014, which count towards meeting the RHNA for the current cycle. All of the funding sources ensure
affordability.
The City will continue to provide sites for a mix of single-family, multifamily and mixed-use housing,
supported by a variety of programs to enhance affordability, to accommodate its RHNA and contribute
towards addressing the growing demand for housing in the Bay Area.

Housing Constraints
The provision of adequate and affordable housing can be constrained by a number of factors. This section
discusses and analyzes the various governmental and non-governmental constraints that may serve as
potential impediments to housing development and improvement in Richmond.
The production of housing is a complicated process affected by a number of economic, and private and
government influences. Among these influences are the availability and cost of land, zoning and other
development standards, availability and cost of providing infrastructure and services, the cost and availability
of credit, the number of potential consumers with adequate incomes to purchase or rent housing, and the
cost and availability of labor and materials. In addition to these measurable influences are subtler, but often
less quantifiable factors, such as community attitudes, environmental mitigation requirements and even
builder perceptions of the market.
The purpose of this section is to identify those measurable factors that have the greatest impact on the cost
and availability of housing.
Governmental Constraints
Actions or policies of numerous governmental agencies, whether involved directly or indirectly in the housing
market, can impact the ability of the private sector to provide adequate housing to meet consumer demands.
State agencies and local government compliance with state statutes can complicate the development of
housing. Statutes such as the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and sections of the Government
Code relating to rezoning and general plan amendment procedures can also act to prolong local government
review and approval of development proposals. In many instances, compliance with these requirements
establishes time constraints that cannot be altered by local governments.
Local governments exercise a number of regulatory and approval powers that directly impact residential
development within their respective jurisdictional boundaries. These powers establish the location, intensity
and type of units that may or may not be developed. The City’s General Plan, zoning regulations, project
review and approval procedures, development and processing fees, utility infrastructure, public service
capabilities, and development attitudes all play important roles in determining the cost and availability of
housing opportunities in Richmond.
Land Use Controls
The City of Richmond determines the number of housing units that can be built per acre through its General
Plan and Zoning Ordinance. The General Plan establishes the location and amount of land allocated to
residential development and the intensity of development permitted. The Zoning Ordinance establishes
specific site development standards consistent with the General Plan including, but not limited to open space,
building orientation, massing, setbacks, and parking requirements.
General Plan Land Use Designations
The City adopted a comprehensive update to its General Plan in April 2012. The Richmond General Plan
2030 promotes mixed-use, high-density, infill development in Richmond’s Downtown and along its major
commercial and transit corridors. This sustainable land use policy will facilitate increased housing production
by allowing for lower development costs and expedited environmental review. It will also improve quality of
life for residents because new housing will be located closer to jobs, transportation and amenities such as
parks, schools, restaurants, and entertainment. Residential development is permitted in 11 of the
                                            City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 40

18 General Plan’s land use designations. Table 5.41 describes each of the General Plan’s residential land use
designations and Table 5.42 lists the permitted housing densities, development intensities and height
restrictions for each designation.
Zoning Districts
The City’s current residential zoning districts and associated development standards are shown in
Tables 5.43 and 5.44. A comprehensive update of the City’s Zoning Ordinance is currently underway to
make it consistent with the recently adopted Richmond General Plan 2030. A primary objective of the
Update is to replace the suburban and auto-oriented development standards currently in the Zoning
Ordinance with those that promote and facilitate mixed-use, higher-density and transit-oriented
developments consistent with the Richmond General Plan 2030.
As part of the first phase of the update, the City is near adoption of the Richmond Livable Corridors (RLC)
Form-Based Code (FBC) for three of the City’s major commercial corridors—Macdonald Avenue, 23rd
Street and portions of San Pablo Avenue and the surrounding areas. These areas are also identified as Priority
Development Areas by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) and ABAG. The FBC includes
area-specific architectural standards and development standards that reflect the vision of the Richmond
General Plan 2030. Information on the Richmond Livable Corridors project can be reviewed and
downloaded at www.ci.richmond.ca.us/livablecorridors.
The Zoning Ordinance Update and how it intends to remove constraints to housing development is
described further below.
Parking Requirements
The City’s residential parking requirements are based upon unit type and size. As shown in Table 5.45, the
City typically requires two spaces per residential unit, however, the requirement is reduced for second
dwelling units, multifamily units of two bedrooms or less, and uses that serve tenants with low vehicle
ownership rates such as senior housing and nursing homes.
Parking located in the front half of a lot or within 25 feet of the side street for corner lots must be covered
with a garage, carport, or other roofed structure, except parking spaces for second dwelling units, which may
be provided on a parking pad or driveway. Tandem parking may be used to meet residential parking
requirements upon approval from the Zoning Administrator or Design Review Board if site conditions make
side-by-side parking difficult or infeasible.
The City recognizes that off-street parking requirements add to the cost of housing development. To address
this, the Richmond General Plan 2030, includes an implementation action (Land Use Action LU6.A –
Parking Requirements) requiring the City to reduce or eliminate parking requirements in the City’s Priority
Development Areas (PDAs). As shown on the map in Appendix B, Richmond has four PDAs – North
Richmond, Central Richmond, San Pablo Avenue, and South Richmond. These PDAs have enormous infill
development potential and can accommodate higher-density mixed-use developments that are less car-
dependent due to existing or planned transportation infrastructure. Parking requirements will be reduced or
eliminated as part of the comprehensive update to the City’s Zoning Ordinance that is currently underway.
                                             City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 41

Emergency Shelters and Transitional and Supportive Housing Facilities
Currently, homeless shelters and transitional housing facilities are permitted in the City’s residential and
commercial zoning districts. Concurrent with this Housing Element Update, the City is amending the Zoning
Ordinance to ensure compliance with Senate Bill 2 (SB-2) and SB 745, which requires zoning to facilitate
emergency shelters and limits a city’s ability to deny emergency shelters and transitional and supportive
housing under the Housing Accountability Act. As part of the SB-2 Zoning Amendment, the Ordinance’s
definitions for Transitional and Supportive Housing and Emergency Shelters will be revised to reflect the
appropriate Government Code definitions and eliminate extraneous definitions. Per SB-2, Transitional
Housing and Supportive Housing will be listed as a permitted residential use in all zones where residential
uses are allowed. Consistent with previous regulations for homeless shelters, Emergency Shelters will be
permitted uses with a 10 person bed limit in all residential zoning districts, and a 50 person bed limit in the
Central Business zoning district (CB). Additional criteria applied to Emergency Shelters (siting, parking etc.)
are in compliance with the statute. Tables 5.46, 5.47 and 5.48 reflect the amended Zoning Ordinance in
compliance with SB-21.
The information on homeless persons and families and resources for that segment of the population in
housing needs section and the analysis of existing requirements related to the development of homeless and
transitional shelters above informs the related proposed Housing Element Programs and Objectives. The City
has included Action H-3.6.2 (Funding for Emergency, Transitional and Supportive Housing) to support the
pursuit of funding for facilities and programs that serve the homeless.
Manufactured and Factory-Built Housing
The City allows manufactured housing in any residential district where single-family detached units are
permitted. Manufactured housing is subject to the same development standards and design review process as
conventional or stick-built structures. While the City permits manufactured housing in residential districts
consistent with State requirements, the City’s Zoning Ordinance currently does not explicitly identify
manufactured housing as an allowed use. As part of the comprehensive update to the City’s Zoning
Ordinance that is currently underway, the City will explicitly list manufactured housing as an allowed use in all
of its single-family and multifamily residential zoning districts. No other changes affecting manufactured or
factory-built housing are anticipated as part of the comprehensive update to the City’s Zoning Ordinance that
is currently underway.
Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Units
Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) units, referred to as “rooming and boarding houses” in the City’s Zoning
Ordinance, are one-room units usually 100-250 square feet in area occupied by a single individual. Generally
SRO units have shared kitchen and bathroom facilities and are rented on a weekly or monthly basis. Because
SROs typically have unusual site development features or operating characteristics that require special
consideration, they are not allowed as a matter of right. As shown in Tables 5.46 and 5.47, SROs are
conditionally permitted in the MFR-2, MFR-3, MFR-4, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-B, and C-C zoning districts. No
other changes related to SRO units are anticipated as part of the comprehensive update to the City’s Zoning
Ordinance that is currently underway.
Subdivision Standards
The City’s subdivision standards are set forth in Chapter 15.08 of the Richmond Municipal Code. These
include standards for lots and blocks, public and private streets, storm drains, sanitary sewers, landscaping,
signage, street lighting, and requirements for dedications. The City’s subdivision standards are very typical and
do not unduly constrain housing production. However, these standards will need to be revised in order to
implement the Land Use and Circulation Elements of the recently adopted Richmond General Plan 2030.
1 The Zoning Ordinance Amendment to achieve compliance with SB-2 was adopted by City Council on May 19, 2015.
                                            City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 42

The City’s subdivision ordinance, Chapter 15.08 will be updated as part of the City’s comprehensive Zoning
update. The current standards were meant to re-enforce suburban and auto-oriented development patterns.
New standards will be developed to ensure that future infrastructure improvements complement mixed-use,
high-density, infill development and support alternative modes of transportation such as walking and
bicycling. The new standards will promote more pedestrian and bike-friendly streets by requiring fewer car
lanes, wider sidewalks, mid-block crossings, bulb-outs, dedicated bike lanes, and street furniture for use by
pedestrians and bicyclists. The new standards will also increase street connectivity by requiring multiple direct
connections between local amenities.
Inclusionary Housing Ordinance
Zoning Ordinance Section 15.04.810.060 sets forth requirements for the inclusion of affordable housing in all
new housing developments of 10 or more units. Developers can meet the City’s inclusionary housing
requirement by:
      Making 17 percent or more of housing units available to moderate-income households; or
      Making 15 percent or more of housing units available to low-income households; or
      Making 10 percent or more of housing units available to very low-income households; or
      Making 12.5 percent or more of housing units available to a combination of very low and low-
         income households; or
      Making 25 percent or more of housing units available to very low or low-income senior households;
         or
      Paying the in-lieu fee towards the City’s very low and low-income affordable housing fund.
Inclusionary housing requirements may increase development costs. However, the City offers developers the
following incentives and concessions to offset such costs:
      A density bonus as provided by California Government Code §65915(b) and Chapter 15.04.810.050
         of the Richmond Municipal Code.
      Flexibility in development standards.
      Assistance in obtaining available federal and state subsidies.
      Waiver of building permit and other City fees.
      Expedited entitlement review and permit processing.
All units provided through the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, rental or for-sale, are required to have a 30-
year term of affordability. The affordability term is memorialized in an Inclusionary Housing Agreement
recorded at the County for the property. However, for-sale inclusionary units may be resold during the
affordability term if the seller deposits the difference between the market-rate and inclusionary price into the
City’s affordable housing fund. The 30-year of affordability does not transfer to the market-rate unit buyer.
Processing and Permit Procedures
Richmond’s Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 15.04 of the Richmond Municipal Code, lists the types of residential
land uses that are permitted and conditionally permitted in each of the City’s zoning districts. Permitted land
uses are allowed as-of-right without discretionary review as long as the proposed land use complies with the
development and performance standards set forth in Zoning Ordinance Sections 15.04.830 and 15.04.840.
Conditionally permitted land uses require a public hearing and issuance of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP).
The Planning Commission may grant approval of a CUP if the following findings can be made:
     1. The location of the proposed conditional use is in accordance with the General Plan of the City of
         Richmond;
     2. The location, size, design and operating characteristics of the proposed use will be compatible with
                                             City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 43

         and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare of persons residing or working on
         or adjacent to the proposed conditional use and the surrounding neighborhood;
     3. The proposed use complies with all applicable provisions of this chapter; and
     4. The site of the proposed use is adequately served by highways, streets and other public service
         facilities.
The CUP application review fee for residential land uses is currently $4,500. The Planning Commission’s
decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a requested CUP can be appealed to the City Council.
The appeal fee is currently $150. Tables 5.44, 5.45 and 5.46 summarize the types of residential land uses that
are allowed and conditionally allowed in Richmond’s residential, commercial and other zoning districts. The
City currently does not have an administrative use permit process for residential land uses. However, the City
will consider establishing such a process as part of the Zoning Ordinance Update.
Design review with a public hearing is required for residential building projects over 500 square feet. The
Zoning Administrator approves design review permits for single-story residential additions, single-family
homes, and duplexes not exceeding 1,200 square feet in size. The City’s Design Review Board approves
design review permits for larger single-family and multifamily residential structures. The Design Review
Board may grant approval of a Design Review Permit if the following findings can be made:
     1. The proposed design is suitable for its purpose, is harmonious with and relates properly to the
         surrounding neighborhood, contiguous parcels, and the site itself;
     2. The location, size, design, and characteristics of the proposed project will be compatible with and will
         not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare of persons residing in or working in or
         adjacent to the proposed project;
     3. The overall design will be of a quality that will preserve the integrity of and upgrade the existing
         neighborhood; and
     4. The design of the proposed project is in accordance with the General Plan of the City of Richmond
         and all applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
The Design Review Board can impose reasonable conditions of approval to ensure projects are compatible
with the surrounding neighborhood and are not detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare. Design
review fees for residential projects range from $2,500 for a single-story single-family residence (1,200 sq. ft. or
less) and $10,500 for a multifamily apartment or condominium project of 11 or more units. The City currently
offers a pre-application process for developers wanting to obtain early project design input and expedite the
review of large development projects. The pre-application fee is $5,900 and was widely popular during the
development boom. As part of the Zoning Ordinance Update, the City will expand the types of residential
building projects eligible for over-the-counter and administrative design review.
Development Review Time Frames
The time required to process a project varies greatly from one project to another and is directly related to the
size and complexity of the project, and the number of actions or approvals needed to complete the process.
Table 5.49 identifies the processing timeframes for different types of residential project review. It should be
noted that each project does not necessarily require each type of review. For example, small projects that are
consistent with the General Plan and zoning designations do not generally require Environmental Impact
Reports, General Plan Amendments, Rezones, or Variances. Also, certain review and approval procedures
may run concurrently. The City encourages the joint processing of related applications for a single project. As
an example, a rezone request may be reviewed in conjunction with the required site plan, a tentative parcel
map and any necessary variances. Such procedures save time, money and effort for both the public and
private sector and could substantially decrease the costs for the developer.
                                            City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015  44

Required application materials for single family, second dwelling units, subdivisions/condominiums, and
multifamily projects are identified in Table 5.50. Upon submittal, City staff reviews the application to
determine whether it is complete based on submittal requirements established in the City’s Zoning Ordinance
and application submittal checklists. Once the application is deemed complete, the project is reviewed by the
various City departments to ensure compliance with applicable City codes. The Design Review Board then
reviews the project and an environmental review is completed for the project. After the Design Review Board
approves the project, the project has completed the environmental review process and the applicant has paid
proper fees to the City, building permits are issued and the project can proceed.
Table 5.51 identifies the typical processing procedures and timeframes for residential projects. Depending on
the complexity of the project, a single-family project is typically approved in 5 to 8 weeks from date of plan
submission. Multifamily projects take between 1 to 6 months depending on the size of the project. For larger
multifamily projects, the additional time and public hearing requirements can pose as a constraint to the
multifamily development.
Local Permit Processing Fees
Two aspects of local government have been criticized as placing undue burdens on the private sector’s ability
to build affordable housing: (1) the fees or other exactions required of developers to obtain project approval
and (2) the time delays caused by the review and approval process. Critics contend that lengthy review periods
increase financial and carrying costs and that fees and exactions increase expenses. These costs are in part
passed onto the prospective homebuyer in the form of higher purchase prices or rents.
Fees, land dedications, or improvements are also required in most instances in order to provide an adequate
supply of public parkland and to provide necessary public works such as streets, sewers, and storm drains to
support the new development. While such costs are charged to the developer, most, if not all additional costs
are passed to homebuyers and tenants in the form of higher sales prices or rents. The significance of the
necessary public works improvements in determining final costs varies greatly from project to project. The
improvements are dependent on the amount of existing improvements and nature of the project.
State law requires that local permit processing fees charged by local governments must not exceed the
estimated actual cost of processing the permits. Table 5.52 shows many of the development fees that would
apply to various types of new projects in the City. These are application and permit fees that the City of
Richmond Planning and Building Services Department charges for various types of development approvals
or reviews.
Table 5.53 estimates city fees and development costs to be collected for a single-family house and a 50-unit
multifamily development. City fees include all planning, building, impact, and new utility (water and sewer
connection) fees that would be assessed for new construction. The city fees represent about 14.2 percent of
total development cost for a single-family unit and 10.1 percent for a multifamily unit, which are similar to
other nearby communities. Planning and building fees appear to have a minimal impact on housing costs,
while impact and utility fees appear to have a greater impact. Planning and building fees represent 17 percent
of all fees charged for a single-family unit and 5 percent for a multifamily unit. Impact fees represent 44
percent of all fees charged for a single-family unit and 59 percent for a multifamily unit. Utility fees represent
39 percent of all fees charged for a single-family unit and 35 percent for a multifamily unit.
Building Codes and Code Enforcement
The City of Richmond, in accordance with the State housing law, establishes certain minimum requirements
for residential construction. The City’s Planning and Building Services Department administers building
codes under the 2010 California Building Code. The City has made several amendments to the City’s building
code based on the 2010 California Building Code. These amendments are not considered a constraint to
                                             City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 45

housing production, and amendments to the code have been made in order to comply with the minimum
building standards of the State of California. The Police Department’s Code Enforcement Division works
closely with the Planning and Building Services Department, the City of Richmond as Successor Agency to
the Redevelopment Agency, the City Manager’s Office, and Police Department to keep the city attractive and
safe. These efforts include the removal of unsightly and unhealthy nuisances including substandard structures,
weeds, junked or abandoned vehicles, and trash. The Code Enforcement Division accomplishes these tasks
through both pro-active and complaint driven enforcement. The following describes the City’s standard code
enforcement procedure:
     1. Residents or City staff submit a complaint to Code Enforcement via telephone or email;
     2. A code enforcement officer is assigned and investigates the complaint;
     3. A notice of abatement is prepared and filed with the Contra Costa County Recorder’s Office;
     4. If the property is vacant, an invoice or work order is prepared and the property is abated;
     5. If the property is occupied, the City Attorney’s Office obtains a forcible entry warrant prior to
         abatement;
     6. The property is re-inspected to determine compliance and need for further action; and
     7. If the property owner files an appeal, all abatement activity are ceased until Board of Appeals renders
         a decision.
Code enforcement in the City continues to have an increasingly positive impact on the maintenance and
preservation of affordable and other housing in the City. The City doesn’t anticipate future changes that will
further constrain housing development.

Possible City Constraints to Housing for Disabled Persons
Senate Bill 520 requires all jurisdictions, as a part of the Housing Element update process, to examine and
identify any city policies or procedures that may constrain the development, maintenance or improvement of
housing for disabled persons. This examination includes an evaluation of existing land use controls, permit
and processing procedures, fees and exactions, and building codes.
The City of Richmond continues to incorporate the Federal Fair Housing Act, the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act of 1964, and the 1997 Uniform Building Code and ADA requirements as a
part of its building requirements. These three laws address the fair housing practices adhered to by the City,
which include practices against housing discrimination towards persons with disabilities.
Congregate care homes are identified in the City’s Zoning Ordinance. Congregate care homes of six or fewer
persons are allowed by right, in compliance with state regulations, in all current residential zones. Further, the
City does not have any established conditions or use restrictions established for group homes of greater than
six persons, however a conditional use permit (CUP) is required for these homes. Any project within the City,
which requires a CUP for approval, must be approved by the Planning Commission. This requirement could
be considered a constraint to housing development for disabled persons, however, the CUP process is not
implemented to constrain housing development of this type, but to ensure that proper staffing and care is
provided at these types of facilities. The City does not have any specific guidelines for a congregate care home
conditional use permit, other than general conditions of approval required of all projects requiring a CUP.
Individual conditions may require specific design features to meet the special ADA needs of its occupants
and may be based on the structure such as the installation of emergency and fire alarms and exits, roof
shingles meeting or exceeding 30-year performance standards, and roof water drainage. No restrictions are
placed on the siting of this type of housing.
The City does not have occupancy standards for unrelated adults. The City does not regulate the siting of
special needs housing in the Land Use Element or the Zoning Code. The City continues to have no specific
processes to make reasonable accommodation to persons with disabilities in the Planning and Building
Services Department, however the City will accommodate any reasonable request for assistance.
A minor retrofit of a home to allow for accessibility is an over-the-counter permit process, and any major
retrofits may require review by the Building Division. The City continues to have no policies or programs to
reduce parking standards for facilities designed for disabled persons.

City Efforts to Remove Housing Constraints
Richmond continues to have no locally imposed restrictions such as “no growth” limitations, growth
management plans or annual development quotas on the supply of new housing. Over 33 percent of the land
in Richmond continues to be designated for residential land use.
The City continues to take an aggressive role in alleviating governmental constraints to the construction of
affordable housing. City building, planning and subdivision fees and fees required by other public entities
such as the West Contra Costa Unified School District, East Bay Municipal Utilities District, and BART
remain an impediment to the development of affordable housing. In the past, the Planning and Building
Services Department has introduced legislation to the City in order to waive fees for affordable housing
projects, however, because of the City’s present budget problems, the measure has not been implemented.
Land write-down and other types of subsidies have been used to develop recent projects and will continue to
be considered for use in order to increase affordability.
In 2001, the City of Richmond adopted an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance that requires from 10 to 25
percent of units in new developments of 10 or more units to be affordable, or that the developer pay an in-
lieu fee. The City continues to monitor recent court rulings that may impact the effectiveness of the
Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, and the Housing Element contains programs to continue to implement the
ordinance and analyze any necessary modifications (see Programs H-1.3.1 & H-1.3.2).
The previous Housing Element indicated that much of the City’s target area neighborhoods are currently
zoned at higher densities than existing development reflects. These areas continue to have the capability to
accommodate much more intensive uses. While the Zoning Ordinance does regulate the development of
housing in Richmond, it in no way deters or poses significant constraints on such development in the City.
Infill Housing Initiative Strategy (IHI)
In 2004, the City developed the Infill Housing Initiative Strategy (IHI) to develop 400-500 housing units on
vacant lots and abandoned properties in developed Richmond neighborhoods and make them available for
sale to low and moderate-income households. As part of the strategy, the City developed a selection of
architectural plans for sub-standard 25-foot wide infill lots. The plans, which adhered to City development
standards, were made available to applicants, thus expediting the permitting process for those lots. To further
facilitate development of the infill lots, the Richmond City Council approved a $500,000 community
investment agreement with Wells Fargo to assist in acquiring and developing the in-fill units for low-and
moderate-income ownership. The investment provided revolving acquisition pre-development funds to allow
the City to develop housing on in-fill lots. The City continues to implement the IHI Strategy and ensure
compliance with the latest California Building Code.
Rehabilitation and Relocation Assistance
The enforcement of building codes, while resolving code violations, may have a negative impact on
preserving a city’s existing affordable housing stock by requiring the relocation of lower income tenants. The
City continues to alleviate some of the relocation anxieties initiated by code enforcement and abatement by
offering relocation services to tenants and rehabilitation loan assistance to absentee landlords Housing
Element programs H-2.5.11: Rental Rehabilitation Loan Program).
Cost Reductions
The City provides cost reductions to developers through the Density Bonus Ordinance when very low and
low-income family and senior units are proposed. The Ordinance was recently amended to parallel the State’s
most recent requirements. Further cost reductions occur in the form of increased densities and in incentives
such as flexibility in site development standards and zoning code requirements.

Reductions in development fees and dedication requirements, public financing, and/or accelerated plan
checks may also be used to provide incentives to developers for the construction of affordable housing.
Further cost reductions occur through the more efficient use of land in a Planned Area district. For example,
the Planned Area district of the zoning code allows design flexibility through, but not limited to, small lots,
cluster developments and mixed unit types.
The City provides cost savings through financing options to lower income households. Activities include, but
are not limited to homebuyer assistance, the Home Improvement Loan Program, owner rehabilitation loans
and emergency loans, the REAL (Richmond Effort to Abate Lead) Program, and rental rehabilitation loans.
Zoning Ordinance Update
The adoption of the 2030 Richmond General Plan in 2012 has prompted the City to initiate a comprehensive
Zoning Ordinance Update, intended to incorporate the Richmond Livable Corridors (RLC) Form-based
Code and modernize and streamline the development review and permitting process while implementing the
goals of the General Plan. The form-based zones contained within the RLC allow for a variety of housing
types and intensities, and introduces more flexibility towards residential uses and associated development
standards. The FBC along with the comprehensive Zoning Code Update will provide a clearer, more certain
entitlement process for developers to produce quality housing in Richmond.
Non-governmental Constraints
Cost of Land
The cost of land is one of the most significant contributing factors towards the high cost of housing in the
region. Over the last twenty years, a growing population has ensured a continuing demand for land, which in
turn, has led to increasing costs.
A search on the internet for land-for-sale records in March 2015 found few vacant residential properties for
sale in Richmond (Source: Trulia). The survey showed that the cost of land fluctuates widely depending on
location, with residential land averaging around $28 per square foot. Preliminary findings from a Residential
Nexus Study currently being prepared by the City indicate land acquisition costs for multifamily
developments, such as townhomes, can be as much as $40 per square foot.
The high cost of land in Richmond is a constraint to the development of lower income housing. Given the
situation, developers will have to construct multifamily housing at higher densities and smaller unit sizes to
generate economies of scale for the development to be profitable, or obtain public or private subsidies to
offset high costs of land.
Cost of Construction
Construction costs include material costs, equipment, as well as labor costs. The high cost of labor in the
Bay Area is a major factor for why construction costs are higher in the San Francisco Bay Area than in other
parts of the country.
According to the U.S. Census, for building permits issued in 2012, the average estimated construction cost of
single-family housing in Richmond was $215,041 per unit. Preliminary findings from the City’s Residential
Nexus Study estimates a higher cost of construction, claiming direct construction costs for a three bedroom
townhouse of 1,500 square feet may reach $270,000 per unit. Construction costs can vary depending on the
quality of finishes and amenities. It is important to note that these estimates do not include land costs,
financing, permits/fees, developer profit or marketing costs.
Construction costs for multifamily residential units can vary more than those for single-family homes due to
the greater range in which they can be built. For example, a high-end senior complex with senior-friendly
                                            City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 60

amenities will cost much more than an affordable multifamily complex. RS Means Quick Estimator
(www.rsmeans.com) estimates construction costs for a low-rise, 7,200 square foot multifamily residential
building to be in the range of $260 and $362 per square foot. Amenities such as elevators, common open
space and landscaped areas can also add to the overall cost.
To reduce construction costs, developers may build at higher densities to increase the economies of scale. In
most cases, reduced parking requirements can also make construction more affordable. Developers can also
reduce costs by using better, newer construction methodology such as modular construction, off-site
manufacturing, and prefabrication. Many of these techniques can help save time, control quality, and
eliminate waste and labor costs, thereby keeping costs to a minimum.
Availability of Financing
Given the high cost of ownership in the Bay Area, the availability of financing is an important factor in
determining whether a potential homeowner can afford to purchase a home. The availability of financing in a
community depends on a number of factors, including the type of lending institutions active in the
community and the lending practices of those institutions. Through analysis of Home Mortgage Disclosure
Act (HMDA) data on the disposition of residential loan applications, an assessment can be made of the
availability of residential financing within a community.
In general, credit-worthy buyers in Richmond have not had difficulty obtaining loans. Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act data for 2013 indicates that the majority of Richmond residents’ loans (53 percent) were
approved or approved but not accepted. Only 17 percent of loan applications were denied. The remaining 30
percent were withdrawn by applicant, filed as incomplete, or purchased by the financial institution. As long as
buyers are able to provide the necessary down payment and have middle- or high-incomes, banks and
financial institutions have provided credit.
Lower income households and buyers without capital or equity, however, still face difficulty obtaining quality
financing. Until 2006, prospective buyers had been able to purchase homes with small down payments, or
even no money down, borrowing more than the house was worth. After the 2007 housing crisis, sub-prime
lending is no longer available. Few lower income households are able to afford a 20 percent down payment
for a home.

Housing Resources and Opportunities
This section contains an inventory of adequate sites in Richmond that can be developed to meet the City’s
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). It also contains an analysis of potential development
constraints for those sites and examines opportunities for energy conservation.
Adequate Sites: Available Sites for Housing
Under State law, the City is required to demonstrate that its land inventory can adequately accommodate its
share of the region’s projected growth. This is accomplished through an evaluation of vacant and
underutilized residential and mixed-use properties with potential for residential development within the
timeframe of the Housing Element. Appendix C contains a list of vacant parcels zoned for residential
development, as well as city maps identifying the location of each vacant parcel.
In June 2012 the City conducted a comprehensive review of all vacant sites designated for residential and
mixed-use development in Richmond to assess future residential production potential. Parcels that did not
meet the minimum lot area requirements outlined in the City’s Zoning Ordinance (generally less than 5,000
square feet) and parcels above 400 feet in elevation were excluded. In 2015, the City updated the vacant site
inventory to reflect current conditions, removing projects constructed in the last cycle ore experiencing a
change in the status of its entitlements.
The maximum unit capacity for each vacant parcel was calculated based on the allowable density permitted by
each parcel’s zoning designation. Realistic unit capacity for residential zones was determined based on an 80
percent buildout factor, which assumes that development standards combined with unique physical and
environmental site features may not always lead to 100 percent buildout. Realistic unit capacity for
commercial zones was determined based on a 60 percent buildout factor. Although typical mixed-use
developments in Richmond have achieved densities of 50 units per acre, the reduced buildout factor accounts
for non-residential uses that may occur on mixed-use sites. Recent development interest in the City,
continued vacancy and underutilization of commercial sites, and the strong Bay Area and Contra Costa
County housing markets suggest greater demand for residential uses in City. In addition, the housing element
only identified sites determined to have the greatest viability for residential development within the planning
period given the size of sites and location, which is smaller than actual development potential in Richmond.
Table 5.54 summarizes vacant land by zoning designation, including acreage, number of parcels, allowable
density, maximum unit capacity, and realistic unit capacity. Richmond currently has approximately 228 acres
of developable vacant land zoned for residential and mixed-use development within the City limits that can
accommodate 1,912 residential units. Of the 1,192 potential residential units, 1,254 units could be developed
in single-family and multifamily zoning districts. An additional 658 units could be developed in commercial
zoning districts. Multifamily development is allowed by-right in C-1, C-2, C-3, and CB zoning districts, and by
conditional use permit in the CC district. Commercial zones permit densities equal to that of the MFR-2 zone
or up to 34.8 units per acre. Generally, MFR-2 development standards for parking, setbacks and open space
apply, with the addition of certain performance and setback standards where abutting residential zones/uses
exist. Where residential is a component of a mixed use project in the C-3 zone, the maximum allowed FAR is
increased from 1.5 to 2 (equaling the maximum FAR in C-2 zones). Several large commercial sites suitable
for higher density residential development exist in various areas of the City. There are 5 sites between 2.95
and 3.96 acres in size located in the C2 and C3 zones, which do not restrict development that is entirely
comprised of residential uses.

In addition to the vacant residential land identified in Table 5.54, Table 5.55 lists recently constructed
projects that have produced new residential units since January 1, 2014 or are currently permitted and
expected to result in new single family and multifamily construction during the 2015-2023 planning period.
Of the 892 units approved, permitted or constructed since 2014, 601 were affordable to very low and low-
income households. As shown in Table 5.55, the RHNA allocation for low income households of 305 has
already been exceeded with project approvals for 437 units, and 164 approved units for very low income
result in a remaining need of 274 units.
The MFR-2, MFR-3 and commercial zoning districts have historically been developed at higher densities and
with units affordable to lower income households, and thus are areas most likely to accommodate a
substantial amount of Richmond’s share of the regional housing need for lower income households. As
shown in Table 5.56, approximately 31.7 vacant acres are located in high density (greater than 30 du/acre)
MFR-3 and commercial zones with a potential unit capacity of 668 units, exceeding the remaining need of
314 units for low and very low income housing. Approximately 196 acres of vacant land with allowed
densities below 30 du/acre are available to accommodate up to 1,243 housing units suitable for moderate and
above moderate income levels. While this total falls 158 units short of the remaining need of 1,401 units,
some of this remaining need may be met by excess capacity in higher density residential land, as well as
through planning efforts underway that will increase available land and unit capacity for both market rate and
affordable housing, as described below.
Planning Efforts Underway to Increase Housing Capacity in Richmond
The City recently adopted a comprehensive update to its General Plan in April 2012. The Richmond General
Plan 2030 promotes mixed-use, high-density, infill development in Richmond’s Downtown and along its
major commercial and transit corridors. This sustainable land use policy will facilitate increased housing
production by allowing for higher densities, lower development costs and expedited environmental review,
and significantly expand the City’s ability to meet its RHNA in current and future housing element cycles.
Richmond Livable Corridors Plan Form-Based Code
The majority of the vacant sites appropriate for housing development are located within the planning area of
the Richmond Livable Corridors Plan Form-Based Code (FBC). See Appendix D for a map of the Livable
Corridors planning area. The FBC, scheduled for adoption in May of 2015, will implement the General Plan
vision, policies and objectives for major commercial corridors including Macdonald Avenue, San Pablo
Avenue and 23rd Street.
The FBC will regulate development characteristics and standards including building placement, form, height,
frontage, and land use. FBCs seek to foster predictable built results and a high-quality public realm. As an
alternative to conventional zoning, they focus on the creation, revitalization, and preservation of vibrant,
walkable urban places. They utilize physical form, rather than use, as their primary organizing principle, and
provide standards for both private and public realms.
The Richmond Livable Corridors Plan is expected to have 10 zones that will allow for a variety of housing
types including single-family homes, second units, multifamily housing, group housing, and residential care
facilities, transitional/supportive housing, live/work, and work/live. Multifamily housing will be allowed
(by-right or with a Minor Use Permit) throughout the planning area.
While the FBC does not regulate density through minimum or maximum units per acre, the FBC will exceed
densities allowed under the current zoning and accommodate General Plan densities of up to 125 units per
acre. In addition, the FBC will incentive infill residential development through larger buildable areas,
increased building heights, mixed-use sites, relaxed parking standards, and streamlined permit review.
Specifically, the draft FBC provides for significant increases to maximum building heights for buildings with
                                             City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 63

25 percent or more affordable or senior units in T6 Core, T5 Main Street, and T4 Main Street zones and the
elimination of parking requirements for affordable or senior units in the T4 Neighborhood and T4 Main
Street zones. The FBC will also introduce new opportunities for multifamily housing on sites that were
formerly reserved for commercial uses.
A number of opportunity sites fall within the FBC areas. The FBC areas encourage a mix of uses,
emphasizing commercial activity at select nodes, while remaining more flexible towards other uses in
between. Of the larger opportunity sites (greater than one-half acre in size), one is within the FBC area in the
T4MS-O Zone. The T4MS-O Zone allows 100 percent multi-family development by right (no commercial
component required).
Richmond Bay Specific Plan
The City will also considerably increase land available for residential development within a 220 acre Priority
Development Area (PDA) along its south shoreline of the San Francisco Bay. The Richmond Bay Specific
Plan is nearly complete, and is intended to complement and capitalize on the proposed Berkeley Global
Campus at Richmond Bay, which is anticipated to become a global, high tech research hub comprised of a
mix of institutional, commercial, and residential uses. The Richmond Bay Specific Plan’s guiding land use
plan and development standards includes the conversion of a significant area of industrial land into a mix of
uses, including a variety of housing types and intensities that will provide a balance of jobs and housing.
Overall, the Plan provides for over 4,000 units of housing estimated at complete build out.

Units Approved in Current Housing Element Cycle
A number of projects, including those constructing a significant number of low and very low housing units
have been approved and may be applied towards the 2015-2023 planning period. Table 5.55 below presents
the projects holding permit approvals and expected to begin construction in the near future. Specifically,
affordable projects will provide 437 units of affordable housing, covering the RHNA for the low income
category completely. The Central Ave. and Nevin Ave. projects are deed-restricted projects being developed
by AMG & Associates, based out of Santa Clarita, and successfully utilized the City’s density bonus. In
addition, the Miraflores Senior Housing Project is being developed by the Community Housing Development
Corporation (CHDC) of North Richmond with East-Bay non-profit developer Eden Housing, and will
provide 80 units for seniors with very low incomes. The Westridge project is a major renovation/addition to
an existing housing development, adding 79 units affordable to low and very low income households while
renovating existing affordable units and improving site conditions.

Potential Development Constraints
Sites identified for residential development in the City were analyzed to determine their relationship to public
facilities, services and existing or potential physical and environmental constraints to potential development.
As part of the Environmental Impact Report for the Richmond General Plan 2030, the City has adopted
program-level mitigation measures to address environmental constraints for future development.
Public Facilities and Services
The short- and long-term development viability of the vacant and underutilized sites in the land inventory is
directly linked to the availability and capacity of public facilities and services. The City’s Community Facilities
and Infrastructure Element, adopted as part of the Richmond’s General Plan 2030, addresses the current and
future needs for educational and human service facilities in Richmond such as schools, libraries and
community centers, as well as infrastructure and public utilities such as streets, water, sewer, waste,
communications and electricity. The goals and policies of the Community Facilities and Infrastructure
Element seek to improve these facilities and services to meet community needs as the City grows. As an
urbanized community, infrastructure is available for virtually all vacant residential and commercial parcels in
the City. All of the sites have utilities available or nearby, and only interior distribution services would need to
be provided. Infill sites are already fully provided with utilities.
The City maintains about half of the sewer lines within the City’s boundaries. The Richmond Municipal
Sewer District services an area that encompasses 13.5 square miles, generally described as being bounded by
Tulare Street to the north, the City of El Cerrito to the east, Richmond Inner Harbor to the south and Castro
Street to the west. The wastewater treatment plant located in Point Richmond at 601 Canal Boulevard treats
the wastewater collected by the District. Residents living in the northern half of Richmond are served by
West County Wastewater District (WCWD). Residents in the southern section of the Richmond Annex are
serviced by Stege Sanitary District (SSD). The City has adequate sewer capacity to serve existing development
as well as new residential development needed to serve projected increases in population.
The City’s drinking water supply is provided by the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD), which
provides water for 1.3 million customers in Alameda and Contra Costa County. The water supply originates
from Mokelumne River watershed in the Sierra Nevada and extends 90 miles to the East Bay. The current
system, which includes a recently upgraded treatment facility, has enough capacity to serve more than the
City’s planned growth.
                                                 City of Richmond | Housing Element 2015-2023 | Adopted May 19, 2015 66

While all land designated for residential use is served by sewer and water lines, streets, storm drains,
telephone, electrical, and gas lines, as an older community, much of the Richmond’s infrastructure is aging
and will require improvements or replacement over time.
SB 1087, effective January 2006, requires water and sewer providers to grant priority for service allocations to
proposed developments that include units affordable to lower income households. Pursuant to these statutes,
upon adoption of its Housing Element, Richmond will immediately deliver the Housing Element Update to
local water and sewer providers, along with a summary of its regional housing needs allocation.
Flooding, Sea Level Rise and Tsunami Inundation
Globally, scientists expect changing temperatures to result in disruption of ecosystems, more frequent and
damaging storms accompanied by flooding and landslides, increases in the number and severity of heat
waves, extended water shortages as a result of reduced snow pack, increased likelihood of wildfires, and
disturbance of wildlife habitats and agricultural activities. Local impacts are not definitive, but Richmond
could experience changes to local and regional weather patterns, rising bay water level, changes in salinity and
tidal patterns of San Francisco and San Pablo bays, coastal erosion, water restrictions, vegetation changes, and
disrupted species migration patterns and extinctions. However, nearly all of the sites included in the vacant
land inventory are not subject to significant flood, sea level rise or tsunami inundation related impacts.
Appendix E includes maps from the Richmond General Plan 2030 identifying areas vulnerable to flooding,
potential sea level rise and tsunami inundation.
Geology and Seismic Vulnerability
The 400-foot crest of the Sobrante Ridge serves as the elevation transition between the City core’s low-lying
areas and the San Pablo-Potrero Hills Range. The vegetation and topography of parcels above 400 feet leaves
development vulnerable to wildland fires and soil hazards such as landslides. For these reasons, developers
are encouraged to concentrate residential development below the 400-foot elevation.
The 1997 Uniform Building Code locates Richmond and the entire Bay Area in Seismic Risk Zone 4, an area
expected to experience maximum magnitudes and damage in the event of an earthquake. According to the
April 2008 U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet, the probability of at least one major 6.7 magnitude or greater
earthquake capable of causing widespread damage striking somewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area before
2037 is 63 percent.
A portion of the North Hayward Fault runs through the eastern portion of Richmond. The State Mining and
Geology Board has established a Special Studies Zone in Richmond per the Alquist-Priolo Special Study
Zones Act that was created to delineate zones encompassing all active fault traces. Two major earthquakes
have occurred along the fault, in 1836 and 1868, with magnitudes greater than 7.0. This fault is the most
hazardous system in the Bay Area, with a likelihood of 31 percent for a magnitude 6.7 or higher earthquake in
the next 30 years. Major activity along the fault is likely to cause extensive structural damage in the region.
The San Andreas Fault, California’s longest and most active fault, is located approximately 15 miles west of
Richmond. A significant earthquake along this fault could result in severe damage in Richmond. The 1906
and 1989 earthquakes were produced by the San Andreas Fault, which has a 21 percent probability of
generating another earthquake with a magnitude 6.7 or higher in the next 30 years.
Appendix F includes maps that show areas subject to landslides, known earthquake faults located near
Richmond and indicate earthquake probabilities.

Environmental Contamination
Brownfield sites are abandoned or underutilized industrial and commercial sites that may be complicated by
the presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. As an older industrial city, Richmond has a
higher incidence of these sites, which often require environmental clean-up prior to development. This is
particularly true for affordable housing development projects, where the economics of land costs often result
in these developments being sited in areas that have historically been more likely to be environmentally
contaminated due to their closer proximity to industrial areas. Environmental mitigation adds to the cost of
development. State mandated regulations call for detailed documentation, analyses and public participation
requirements in the determination of environmental impacts and their mitigation. As shown in Appendix C,
the vacant land inventory includes 6 environmental brownfield sites. There are recent successful examples of
remediation of Brownfield sites, such as the Miraflores development identified in Table 5.55 above.
Excluding the vacant brownfield parcels from the opportunity sites analysis only reduces the capacity for very
low and low-income housing by 13 units, which still exceeds the remaining need for those income categories.
Noise
The City’s Public Safety and Noise Element, adopted as part of the Richmond General Plan 2030, identifies
and evaluates public health and safety concerns, and aims to reduce noise levels to acceptable standards and
reduce, eliminate or mitigate objectionable noise sources in Richmond. The Noise Element identifies motor
vehicles, airports, railroads and BART as primary noise sources in Richmond. Potential mitigation measures
include establishment of noise compatible land use standards, development of guidelines to manage noise
impacts, enforcement of noise standards, better construction techniques, changes in building orientation and
site design layout, and promotion of innovative solutions to create buffers that mitigate noise impacts.
Opportunities for Energy Conservation
State law requires that housing elements discuss opportunities to encourage more energy saving features and
materials, and energy efficient systems and design in residential development. This section discusses
Richmond’s efforts to expand energy conservation practices in residential development.
Energy and Climate Change Element
The Richmond General Plan 2030 includes one of the first energy and climate change elements in the
Country. Many of the goals, policies and actions in Richmond’s Energy and Climate Change Element relate to
energy conservation in residential development. Specifically, Goal EC4 on Sustainable Development aims to
reduce energy consumption by promoting sustainable infill development and encouraging the construction of
higher-density, mixed-use projects around existing public transit, schools, parks, and neighborhood-serving
retail. Richmond has begun a comprehensive update to its Zoning Code in order to make it consistent with
the Richmond General Plan 2030.
State Green Building Standards Code
In January 2010, the State Building Standards Commission unanimously adopted the first-in-the-nation
mandatory Green Building Standard Code. Referred to as “CALGREEN,” the new code became effective on
January 1, 2011 and requires all new buildings in the state to be more energy efficient and environmentally
responsible. Specifically, every new building constructed in California will need to reduce its water
consumption by 20 percent, divert 50 percent of its construction waste from landfills, and install low
pollutant-emitting materials. The City’s Planning and Building Services staff has been trained in the
administration and enforcement of the CALGREEN code. The City is considering establishing incentives
such as fee deferrals, fee reductions, expedited reviews, and other incentives for projects achieving LEED
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating levels that exceed CALGREEN requirements.

Residential Energy Efficiency Programs
A variety of local programs summarized in Table 5.57 are available to Richmond residents seeking to
improve the energy efficiency of their existing homes. The City of Richmond continues to promote these
programs and services through its website and participation at monthly neighborhood group meetings.

Review of Previous Element
To develop appropriate programs to address the housing issues and needs identified in the 2015-2023
Housing Element, the City of Richmond has reviewed the housing programs set forth in the 2007-2014
Housing Element and evaluated the effectiveness of these programs in delivering housing services and
assistance. The City has also evaluated its progress in implementing the Housing Element.
Appropriateness
The State’s housing goals are attained in part by ensuring that each region of the state meets its designated
housing unit goals, which are allocated to local counties and cities in the Bay Area by the Association of Bay
Area Governments (ABAG). The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) is one measure of the
appropriateness of the City’s Housing Element, and is a key benchmark in monitoring its success.
In the 2007-2014 Housing Element, the City set a quantified objective of 2,200 new units. This quantified
objective was slightly below the ABAG RHNA goals established for the City for that period of time, however
it reflected the realistic economic conditions of the Great Recession and the gradual recovery of the housing
market in subsequent years. In the seven-year period encompassed by the previous housing element, new
construction in the City of Richmond resulted in over 1,123 residential units built, or slightly greater than
one-half of its quantified objective total. Specific goals and units built for each household income level are
presented in Table 5.58.

Progress and Effectiveness
The effectiveness of Richmond’s Housing Program in meeting regional housing needs can be measured by a
level of achievement, including the actual unit construction towards meeting the RHNA goal. As was the case
in Bay Area cities and the Country, the City of Richmond faced significant economic hardship and
consequent difficulty in developing new housing, largely due to the Great Recession. Despite the economic
downturn, including a drastic rise in home foreclosures, 99 units of very low and 195 units of low income
housing were developed in the previous Housing Element cycle, or approximately 40% of the RHNA total
for those income categories. For the moderate and above moderate income households, 829 units were
constructed, also achieving approximately 40% of the RHNA for those income levels. As evidenced by a
resurgent housing market in the Bay Area and the Richmond, the City expects growth in housing
development to continue.

Housing Goals, Policies and Programs
This section sets forth the City of Richmond’s Housing Element goals, policies and programs intended to
facilitate construction, preservation and conservation of affordable housing. These goals, policies and
programs have been designed in collaboration with the community, including residents, community groups,
developers, and other stakeholders.
The policies establish the strategies to achieve the goal. The programs under each policy identify the
responsible agencies for program implementation, including the City’s role in implementation; the
implementation timeframe; regulatory, financing and subsidy tools anticipated; and specific quantified
objectives to be achieved upon accomplishment of the programs.
Over the Housing Element planning period, approximately 2,643 housing units are anticipated to be
constructed, rehabilitated and conserved in Richmond. Table 5.60 shows these units by type of unit
produced and by the affordability level of the unit.

                 feasible to establish a shared-equity program in Richmond as a way of providing
                 more affordable housing. Under a shared-equity program, the City would provide
                 funding to assist families with home purchases. In return for its investment, the City
                 would share the benefits of any appreciation in home price. The City’s share of the
                 home’s appreciation could be returned to the City in the form of a cash payment
                 that could be used to help another family with a home purchase. The City’s share

                 for Additions to Heritage Homes. The Guidelines were developed in 2008 and they
                 set forth massing type and architectural style standards for additions to homes built
                 before 1940. The architectural styles covered by the Guidelines are the Richmond
                 Spanish Revival, Richmond Bungalow, Richmond Tudor, and Richmond Minimal
                 Traditional. Additions to homes with these architectural styles must meet the design

                 throughout Richmond have replaced a substantial portion of their front yards with
                 impervious concrete surfaces because the current landscaping requirements are not
                 stringent enough. Front yards with a high concrete-to-landscaping ratio are visually
                 unappealing and cumulatively degrade environmental quality by increasing the
                 amount of stormwater run-off pollution.

Input from Public Hearings
Summary of Input from Public Hearings
The following summarizes public comments received on the Housing Element presented to the Planning
Commission and City Council at public hearings held on May 7th and May 19th, 2015, respectively.
Planning Commission Hearing Comments
Several public comments were received at the May 7th Planning Commission hearing, and are summarized as
follows:
        Several community members voiced support for expansion of the City’s Just-Cause for Eviction
         ordinance, currently being studied by the City. Commenters also expressed support for a Rent
         Stabilization or Rent Control Ordinance, specifically to protect against unfair practices by landlords
         and drastic increases in rent. Generally, several commenters believed affordable housing is a long
         term necessity for the City and rent control is major part of the solution.
        Displacement and the effects of gentrification are being experienced by lower income community
         members, and the City should address these issues in the Housing Element.
        With regards to mixed use and the development of residential uses in commercial lands, one
         commenter requested the City ensure sufficient parking, while still supporting the Housing Element’s
         promotion of a balance of housing and jobs.
        Additional services are needed for the homeless population, and services such as education and job
         training are essential.
A letter from the California Apartment Association (CAA) Contra Costa, Napa, Solano Division,
addressed to the City Manager was received prior to the Planning Commission hearing. The letter
discussed concerns with programs in the Housing Element for Tenant Protections, specifically Just
Cause for Eviction and Rent Stabilization. The letter is included in this Appendix on the following
pages.
City Council Hearing Comments
One public comment was received at the City Council hearing held on May 19th, 2015:
        One community member voiced support for the Housing Element, specifically as it attempts to
         address the need for affordable housing in the City.
