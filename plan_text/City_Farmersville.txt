PART I: General Plan                                         Farmersville General Plan • 2002 - 2025
                                                                             Chapter 1: Introduction
CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Farmersville
Farmersville is located in Tulare County in the central-
southern portion of the San Joaquin Valley. It is located
on the south side of State Route 198, a major east/west
highway that serves central California. The City is
bisected by Farmersville Boulevard, a north/south
roadway, and Visalia Road, a major Tulare County
east/west roadway.
Farmersville is five miles east of Visalia, the county seat
of Tulare County, and two and one-half miles west of
Exeter and ten miles northwest of Lindsay (see Map 1-1).
The General Plan
In an effort to insure that land and resources within the
State of California are properly managed and developed
and that the health, safety and welfare of its citizens are
protected, each California city and county is required to
prepare a long-term, comprehensive planning that details              The California State
how the city will physically develop. This document - the             Legislature first
General Plan - contains seven mandated elements - land                required California
use, circulation, housing, open space, conservation, safety           cities and counties to
and noise.
                                                                      prepare a general plan
Farmersville’s first general plan was prepared by the                 in 1927
County of Tulare in 1964. Subsequently, the County,
which provided planning services to the city, updated the
general plan in 1986. The County also prepared and
adopted the Urban Boundaries Element for the city of
Farmersville in 1974. This document established 20-year
and ultimate growth lines around the city.
This document will serve to update four of Farmersville’s     Farmersville’s first general
general plan elements:                                        plan was prepared by the

General Plan Objectives
The objectives of the Farmersville General Plan are to:
•    project Farmersville’s future growth and make
     provisions for this growth through the General Plan;
•    create a unique and attractive city by investing in
     projects that will enhance Farmersville’s appearance
     and marketability;
•    provide a safe and pleasant environment and enhance
     property values throughout the community by
     avoiding and eliminating land use conflicts;
•    promote increased sales tax revenue in Farmersville
     by providing sufficient land for a wide range of
     commercial uses.
•    Protect and preserve natural resources, such as
     farmland, air and water quality and native vegetation,
     while facilitating growth of the community.             Farmersville’s economy is supported by agriculture. The

     shopping opportunities;
•    ensure that there are adequate public facilities to
     serve Farmersville in the future;
•    ensure that Farmersville’s infrastructure system can
     effectively serve the land use framework;

•    enhance the character of Farmersville by creating an
     improved and revitalized downtown area;
•    promote economic development and enhanced
     employment opportunities in Farmersville by
     designating sufficient land for industrial uses, retail
     stores, and office parks;
•    recognize the changing conditions and trends in the
     planning area and market place and make appropriate
     amendments to the General Plan;
•    recognize past land use approval actions and adopted
     land use policies;

Planners and decision-makers have likened the General
Plan to the U.S. Constitution in that decisions regarding
land use, circulation, housing and capital improvements
must be consistent with the goals, objectives and policies
of this document. In City of Santa Ana v. City of Garden           The General Plan has

     cities."
All Actions of a City Must be Consistent with the
General Plan
City decisions that are not consistent with the General
Plan place that community in a legally tenuous position
and subject to legal challenge. In Friends of "B" Street .
et. al. v. City of Hayward, et. al., 106 Cal. App. 3d 988
(1980), the court concluded that construction of public
improvements (e.g. street projects, sewer lines, etc.) must
be consistent with the General Plan. Further, the court
stated that the General Plan essentially is the constitution
for all future development within the city.

A General Plan, which is internally inconsistent, lacks one
or more of the mandatory elements, or is lacking required
information, can potentially prevent a city from issuing       The courts have enacted a

changes, and subdivisions, if the Court finds that any one     building moratorium in
of the aforementioned conditions exist (Sierra Club v.         cities that have violated

For example, the Farmersville Housing Element may
include a policy that states that the city provide adequate
sites for a range of housing types, including multi-family
residential uses. The Land Use Element would have to be
consistent with this policy by designating sufficient land
area for this type of development.
Another example of inter-element consistency involves
the use of population projections, which is the basis for
future land needs for housing units and other types of land
uses. The Land Use and Housing Elements should use
the same population projections in their needs analysis to
avoid inter-element inconsistencies.

How Much Land Will Farmersville Need to
Accommodate Expected Growth?
This section provides projections of land that will be
needed to accommodate expected growth of
Farmersville through the year 2025. These land use
projections are based on the previously discussed
population projections and land use statistics.
Additional data factored into the land use projections
include persons per dwelling unit, acres of parkland per
1,000 persons, residential densities, size of school sites,
etc.

Urban Reserve (Agriculture)
This designation is applied to lands that are being, or
have the capacity to be, actively farmed but are within
the planning area and proposed to be eventually
developed.
Further, this designation could also be applied to lands
that contain agriculturally-related uses, such as packing
houses, cold storage operations or agriculturally-related
businesses. The purpose of this designation is to protect
agriculture from urban encroachment, maintain land in
agriculture until the time is appropriate for conversion to
urban uses, and to ensure that conflicts do not arise
between agriculture and urban uses.

beneficial from a fiscal, environmental and social                          Growth
perspective.                                                                Management
A community that is well-planned will be more attractive
to potential residents, developers, companies and
investors than one that is poorly planned, has numerous
land use conflicts, urban sprawl, a non-viable downtown,
poor ciculation patterns and disenfranchised sections of
town. Furthermore, a community that is compact and is
not sprawling has more efficient, cost effective
infrastructure and service delivery systems than a
community without these attributes.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
Protecting Farmersville’s Boundaries
I.   Maintain Farmersville as an agriculturally-
     oriented city surrounded by farmland.
                                                                             BACKGROUND
     1.  To the extent possible, ensure that Farmersville
         is surrounded by agricultural land that is zoned     When agricultural lands around a city are split
                                                              into small parcels (such as 1/2- 2- and 5-acre
         for large parcel agriculture (e.g. AE-20 [20 acre
                                                              “ranchettes”, it erodes the viability of the land

         a.   The City shall notify the County of Tulare      urban development. Rural residential residents
              that all land that surrounds Farmersville that  frequently resist city efforts to grow in their
              is not zoned Rural Residential, Commercial      direction. For these reasons, it is most
              or Industrial, should be zoned to the AE-20     advantageous for lands immediately around the
              (or larger acreage) zone. Further the City      city to remain in large agricultural parcels.
              shall discourage proposals for parcelization
              to sizes smaller than 20 acres.                 •    •    •    •    •    •    •    •   •    •    •
         b.   Tulare County shall continue to refer
              applicants      for     urban   development
              (subdivisions, commercial or industrial
              development) on lands within the
              Farmersville Urban Development Boundary
              (UDB) and Urban Area Boundary (UAB) to
              the City for comment and review. All
              development occuring within these areas
              must be consistent with the Farmersville
              General Plan.

II. Keep Farmersville from physically merging with
     the cities of Visalia and Exeter.                                       BACKGROUND
     1.  The City shall meet with officials from Visalia         The need to keep Farmersville from
         and Exeter to explore the concept of forming a          growing together with Visalia in particular,
                                                                 and to a lesser extent Exeter, was voiced
         greenbelt to keep the cities from growing
                                                                 frequently during General Plan Committee
         together                                                meetings. The idea of a greenbelt to
                                                                 provide a buffer between the cities was

         leverage additional outside grant funds.
         a.    The City should work with a farmland
               conservation organization such as American
               Farmland Trust, to establish an easement
               program.

III. Promote Smart Growth planning principals in
     order to discourage urban sprawl and the
     premature urbanization of agricultural land, and                        BACKGROUND
     to create more livable neighborhoods. This issue
     is addressed in more detail in Appendix A: “A               The concept of Smart Growth was explored
     Smart Growth Primer”.                                       extensively by the General Plan Committee.
                                                                 Appendix A contains additional information
     1.  The City shall amend its Zoning Ordinance to            on this topic. Some of these concepts have
         add a Smart Development District.                       already been embraced by area developers.
         a.    The Smart Development District shall              •    •    •   •    •   •    •   •    •   •
               incorporate planning principals that promote      •
               moderate increases in residential densities,
               narrower streets, better connectivity in and
               between neighborhoods and site and
               architectural design that emphasizes a
               humanized evnironment, as opposed to an
               automobile-oriented environment.
         b.    Smart Growth design techniques should be
               incorporated into Farmersville’s residential
               and commercial zone district standards, as     See Appendix A: “A Smart Growth
               appropriate (see Appendix A: “A Smart          Primer”
               Growth Primer”).
     2.  New urban development should occur in an
         orderly manner with initial development

                                                                              Chapter 2: Land Use Element
        occurring on available undeveloped properties
        which are closer to the existing built-up area.
        a.  The City should promote in-fill development
            and development of lands immediately
            adjacent to existing urbanized areas, before
            allowing development of outlying lands.
        b.  The General Plan maps designates lands
            further away from existing development
            with a “Reserve” status. Development of
            these lands should be delayed until land
            closer to the city is developed.
    3.  The     City    should      promote     mixed-use
        development where appropriate.                                       BACKGROUND
        a.  The City shall amend its Zoning Ordinance        Up until the mid 1940s mixed use buildings were
            to provide for a Mixed-Use Zone District.        common in American cities. Typically, shops
                                                             occupied the ground floor, and residential units were
        b.  The City should identify sites in the            situated above. The concept of separate use zones
            downtown         core     where     mixed-use    came about as a response to deplorable conditions in
                                                             eastern industrial cities where people lived next to
            development would be appropriate.
                                                             smoke-belching factories
    4.  The City shall amend its Zoning Ordinance to         Single use zoning has set up patterns of urban sprawl
        permit residential development in the downtown.      where residents must drive to make any meaningful
                                                             connections in their community. This has been taken
        a.  The City shall amend the Zoning Ordinance        to extemes in suburban areas of California, like
            to permit housing development in the             Orange County. Succesful mixed use development
            downtown with a conditional use permit.          can address this situation by providing living and
                                                             working places in close proximity to one another.
        b.  Housing units should be permitted in the
            upper stories of downtown buildings with a       •    •   •    •   •     •   •   •   •     •   •
            Conditional Use Permit.

ISSUE THREE: Residential Neighborhoods
The “neighborhood” is the fundamental building block of
                                                                 3
a community. The health and quality of life of a
community is best measured at the neighborhood level. If
                                                                           Residential
a city’s neighborhoods are noisy, contain excessive                        Neighborhoods
traffic, unkempt, include incompatible land uses or are
depreciating in value, then the community as a whole is
most likely spiraling towards a condition of blight. In
terms of community priorities, preservation of the
neighborhood ranks as one of the its most important
goals.
The ideal neighborhood should be inviting, quiet, cool in
the summer, children-friendly, pedestrian oriented,
achitecturally interesting and it should maintain its value
over time. The neighborhood should also provide for a
wide range of housing types, styles and prices.
Multi-family development (also known as apartments) is
necessary in all communities. It provides housing
opportunities for persons or families who do not wish to
own a single family dwelling or who can not afford to
rent or own one.
Improperly located, designed or maintained, multi-family
development can have an adverse impact on the
neighborhood and the community as a whole. To protect
the health, safety and welfare of persons living adjacent to
multi-family development as well as persons living in
these types of units, the location, design and long-term
maintenance of this type of housing must be carefully
considered.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
Neighborhood Maintenance and Revitalization
I.   Take actions to keep existing neighborhoods
     strong and healthy.
     1.   Remove substandard homes from residential
          neighborhoods.
          a.  The City shall abate or rehabilitate
              substandard residential dwellings through
              the process established in the State Housing
              Code.

                                                                          Chapter 2: Land Use Element
        b.   The Redevelopment Agency should consider
             the purchase of substandard housing in order
             to clear the property for new, low to
             moderate income housing.
    2.  Rehabilitate homes that have deteriorated.
        a.   The City should continue to apply for
             Community Development Block Grant                      During the past ten
             (CDBG) funds to rehabilitate homes that                years, Farmersville has
             have deteriorated.
                                                                    rehabilitated an average
    3.  Upgrade public improvements in blighted
        neighborhoods, including sidewalks, alleys,                 of 8 homes per year,
        street trees, roadways, parkways and street lights.         working with Self-Help
        a.   Establish an annual objective for repairing            Enterprises.
             or replacing broken curbs, gutters and
             sidewalks.
        b.   Replant vacant parkways with street trees.
        c.   Identify alleys that can be abandoned and
             initiate the process consistent with the
             Streets and Highways Code.
        d.   Upgrade alleys with pavement, where
             possible.
    4.  Encourage residential infill development in
        neighborhoods that are blighted.
        a.   Consider the reduction of development
             impact fees on residential infill projects.
        b.   Consider      increasing     the     allowable
             underlying density on land that will support
             a residential infill project.         Increased
             density can help make projects “pencil-out”.
    5.  Continue to enforce         the   city’s    property
        maintenance ordinance.
II.     The planning and building department will work
        together to ensure that building and zoning code
        violations are corrected and/or eliminated.

         b.   The city on a monthly basis will send out
              correction letters to persons who are in
              violation of planning or building code
              regulations.
     6.  The city will annually seek state and federal
         grant funds that can assist in the elimination of
         blight in residential neighborhoods.
         a.   The City should contract with a grant writer
              to obtain funding.
     7.  The Farmersville Redevelopment Agency will
         use its tax increment funds and low to moderate
         housing income funds to eliminate conditions of
         blight in residential neighborhoods.

II. Promote neighborhoods that are quiet, visually
     pleasing, and cool.
     1.  The City should discourage land uses that are
         incompatible with residential neighborhoods.
         a.   Adoption of the Land Use Element and
              Land Use Map will implement this policy.
III. Promote attractive, well-maintained and designed
     residential neighborhoods.
     1.  The City should develop a Smart Development
         Overlay Zone which promotes:
         -    Narrow, tree-lined residential streets.
         -    Neighborhood parks.
         -    Dwellings that are architecturally reflective
              of historic and traditional styles used in
              Farmersville and the San Joaquin Valley.
         -    Common areas that are maintained by
              Landscaping and Lighting Districts.
         a.   Appendix A: “A Smart Growth Primer”,
              includes recommendations for the creation
              of a Smart Growth development code.

     2.   Encourage residential developments and adjacent
          land uses to be pedestrian-oriented.
          a.   All residential developments with walls
               should provide openings for pedestrian and
               bike traffic.
          b.   Land   uses    adjacent   to    residential
               developments should provide for pedestrian

ISSUE FOUR: Commercial Development
The term “Commercial” Development generally refers to
                                                                       4
several types of land uses that feature businesses
providing goods and services. These types of uses
                                                                                Commercial

Retail commercial - businesses whose primary activity
is selling goods to the public.
Office - businesses whose primary activity is financial,
insurance, real estate, information processing etc.
Service - businesses that provide a variety of physical
services, such as auto repair, appliance repair, etc. These
types of uses approach light industrial activities in nature
and are typically encouraged to locate away from retail
and office commercial activities.
Office development is almost as important to the                See also Issue 11: Economic Development
economic well-being of a community as industrial
development. Offices support both small and large
businesses, which on average, have a higher wage scale
than most of the agricultural economy and some of the
manufacturing/warehousing economy.
The Farmersville General Plan provides for four types of
commercial land use designations:
•    Central (downtown),
•    General
•    Service, and
•    Highway
Each of these types of commercial uses is necessary if the
community wishes to provide services and shopping
opportunities for its citizens. Further, if a city is going to
maintain its sales tax base, it is imperative that it not only
retain its own shoppers but that it also attact shoppers
from surrounding cities and outlying rural areas.
For each type of commercial development to be
successful, it must be properly located, it must have
adequate access and it should be designed so that it will
attract patrons. For example, a parcel of land that is
designated for general commercial uses should front onto
a major roadway (with high traffic volumes), it should be
designed so that it is attractive and visible from the

roadway and it should incorporate ample off-street
parking.
Commercial developers also have a responsibility to the
community to create projects that are pleasing in
appearance, are well-maintained, and which are not
disruptive to surrounding properties. Indeed, it is these
types of uses that will form the community’s image.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans:
I.   Ensure that different types of commercial
     development are provided for in Farmersville.
     1.   The General Plan Land Use map designates
          sufficient land to accommodate projected
          commercial development through the planning
          period.
     2.   Continue to monitor commercial land demand
          and accommodate requests to redesignate land
          for commercial development as demand
          warrants, subject to the following guidelines:
          a.   The site has direct access to a major street,
               such as Farmersville Boulevard, Visalia
               Road, Walnut Avenue or the Highway 198
               frontage roads.
          b.   Development of the site for commercial use                        Map 2-1
               would not negatively impact adjacent                      Central Commercial Area
               residential uses.
                                                                                                        State Highway 198
     2.   Allow service commercial uses to be located in
          Farmersville’s industrial areas.                                            Blvd.
                                                                  156
          a.   Amend Farmersville’s Zoning Ordinance to
               provide for service commercial uses in             Road                                 168
               Farmersville’s industrial zone district.
                                                                                                       Road
                                                                                                              Walnut Ave.
     3.   Establish a “Central Commercial” zone, for lands
                                                                                      Farmersville
          in the downtown area (see Map 2-1).
                                                                                                                 S.J.V.R.R.
          a.   The Zoning Ordinance should be amended
               to create a Central Commercial Zone. The
               zone should facilitate the development of a
               pedestrian-oriented shopping atmosphere.                                                         Visalia Road
               Buildings should be built to the back of the                                          Central

             sidewalk with parking located to the rear or
             side of structures. Shops should feature
             large storefront windows and pedestrian-
             scaled signs. Buildings should employ
             historic-theme architecture that reflects
             design traditions of Farmersville and the San
             Joaquin Valley. The Design Guidelines that
             will be established for the Redevelopment
             Agency’s facade-rehab program can address
             this issue.
II. Promote commercial           development      that   is
    aesthetically attractive.                                General Plan Committee members agreed that
                                                             some of Farmersville’s commercial buildings

        through the city’s site plan review process (or      of place that is uniquely Farmersville.
        Conditional Use Permit process, where required
        by the Zoning Ordinance).
        a.   Require each commercial development to be
             built consistent with an architectural theme
             that reflects Farmersville’s identity and the
             identity of the San Joaquin Valley.
        b.   The City should establish a set of design
             guidelines that show graphic examples of
             good design.
        c.   The Planning Department should work with
             the Planning Commission to develop and
             adopt the design guidelines. Guidelines
             should be advisory in nature.
        d.   All commercial parking lots shall be
             landscaped and shall be provided with
             pedestrian-oriented circulation features. The
             design guidelines will provide graphic
             examples of these types of features.
    3.  Promote the development of shopping centers
        and complementary commercial uses that
        enhance the city’s sales tax position.
        a.   Designate adequate land for larger-scale
             commercial development along the northern
             portion of Farmersville Boulevard, and the
             western portion of Visalia Road.

                                                                             Chapter 2: Land Use Element
         b.   Ensure that the commercial zoning applied
              to lands along north Farmersville Boulevard
              and west Visalia Road allows uses that are
              compatible with each other, such as
              shopping centers, offices and fast food
              operations. This zoning should not include
              service commercial uses like auto repair
              (unless conducted as a subordinate part of a
              larger-scale retail commercial business).
III. Encourage commercial           development      to   be
     pedestrian-oriented.
     1.  Through design, require new commercial
         development to be accessible by the walking
         public.

              process the city will insure that the design of
              the commercial development will be

              mentioned design guidelines will provide
              examples of good pedestrian-oriented

ISSUE FIVE: Downtown Farmersville
One of the main goals of any community’s plan is to
preserve and strengthen the downtown. Just as a person
depends on their heart for survival, a good city has a
downtown that pumps life and vigor into the community.
Farmersville’s downtown is not as well-defined as the
                                                                   5       Downtown
                                                                           Farmersville
downtowns of most other Tulare County cities. Where
most cities’ downtowns feature at least several blocks of
commercial use in a fairly compact area, Farmersville’s
commercial uses are situated in strip-fashion along
Farmersville Boulevard and Visalia Road. In addition,
Farmersville’s downtown generally lacks the historic
buildings found in most communities.
Despite these circumstances, there is potential for
Farmersville to strengthen the image of its downtown and
fortify it as the heart of the community. Indeed, this goal
was voiced perhaps more than any other during the
General Plan Committee workshops.                             See also Issue 11: Economic Development
Downtown Farmersville Goals:
Character and Quality of Environment
I.   Enhance Farmersville’s quality of life by
     providing a Downtown which is inviting, friendly,
     clean, safe and aesthetically pleasing.
     1.    The Redevelopment Agency shall establish a
           facade improvement program whereby low- or
           no-interest loans are made to businesses to
           improve their exterior appearance.         Such
           programs exist in Exeter and Woodlake.
           a.   The Executive Director and City Planner
                will work together to formulate a facade
                rehab program.
II. Maintain the Downtown as the government, civic
     and retail/office center for the City.
1.   The City should try to locate future government
     facilities in the downtown area. Future school district
     and county facilities should also be encouraged
     downtown.

ISSUE SIX: Industrial Development
Industrial development generally provides the economic
foundation for a city in that it is a source of employment
and it provides a flow of revenue into the city from
outside sources - other businesses buying raw materials or
                                                                 6         Industrial

finished goods from the local industry.
Industries are typically poor land use neighbors because
they can generate large volumes of truck traffic, they can
produce noise and odors, they may pose public health
hazards and they can be unslightly. For these reasons, it
is important that they be properly located in the
community - away from land uses that are sensitive, such
as schools, residential development and parks.
                                                                                       © 1994 Deneba Systems, Inc.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   Designate sufficient land to accommodate
     industrial development in Farmersville.                    See also Issue 11: Economic Development
     1.  The Land Use map designates land to
         accommodate        industrial    development      in
         Farmersville through the year 2025. When
         warranted, the City shall require the
         establishment      of     buffers,    incorporating
         landscaping, walls or other effective measures.
II. Ensure that new industrial development does not
     conflict with existing or planned adjacent or
     nearby uses.
     1.  The City shall review zoning standards to ensure
         that adequate measures are in place to achieve
         this goal.
         a.   When warranted, the City shall require the
              establishment of buffers, incorporating
              landscaping, walls or other effective
              measures.
     2.  The City Engineer will review each industry that
         wishes to locate in Farmersville to ensure that
         the project will not have an adverse impact on
         Farmersville’s sewer or water systems.

             treating the effluent or by paying an
             appropriate wastewater impact fee to defray
             the city’s cost of treating the effluent.
   3.   New industrial uses will be processed through
        Farmersville’s site plan review process, or
        Conditional Use Permit process (as applicable)
        to ensure that they do not conflict with
        surrounding land uses or adversely impact the

ISSUE SEVEN: Public Facilities
I.  The city should pursue expansion of public
    facilities, as needed.
    1.   Plan for expansion of the Public Works yard by
         acquiring adjacent properties and seeking
                                                                  7         Public Facilities
         funding for the expansion.
         a.   The Land Use map identifies expansion of
              the Public Works yard.
    2.   Consider future relocation of the Civic Center to
         a more centralized location in the city’s
         downtown area.
         a.   Explore the possibility of building a new
              civic center in the downtown area. One
              possible site is the land adjacent to the
              railroad track, west of Farmersville
              Boulevard. This site could function as a          See also Issue 8: Schools
              multi-use facility and include the proposed
              Museum of the Farmworker. Given its
              location, an historic railroad architectural
              theme would be appropriate for this
              structure.
    2.   The City should work with the school district to
         identify building projects where the city and
         district could work together. These projects
         could include:
         -    multi-purpose room
         -    gymnasium
         -    theater
II. Public facilities should be located in the core of the
    community, when possible.
    1.   As previously mentioned, the City should
         consider relocating City Hall to the site adjacent
         to the railroad, west of Farmersville Boulevard.
    2.   Other public facilities should be directed to
         locate in the downtown area.              Existing
         downtown public facilities (such as the post
         office) should be encouraged to remain in the
         downtown.

III.      If a public agency identifies the need to relocate,
          the city shall work with the agency to keep the
          facility in the downtown area.
III. Public facilities should make an aesthetic
     statement in terms of appearance and
     architectural style.
     1.   When new public buildings and facilities are
          developed, the City should take an opportunity to
          set the tone it expects for the community, in
          terms of quality design.
IV. Where possible, public facilities should have
     multi-purpose uses.
     1.   Construction (or) restoration of public buildings
          should provide for public meeting rooms.
          a.   Public meeting rooms should be equipped
               with modern audio-visual equipment and the
               room should also be wired for modern
               telecommunications.

ISSUE EIGHT: Schools
Schools are the cornerstone of any community. A good
school system can provide the foundation for citizens to
prosper.    Equally important is a good relationship
between the city and local school district. Schools are
major land use features in the community. The City and
school district must work together to plan for future
                                                                     8        Schools
expansion of the school system and ensure the system can
respond to demands of future growth.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.  Promote community-based schools.
    1.   The City, Farmersville Unified School District
         and the community should all be involved in the
         design and location of schools.
         a.  To the greatest extent possible, schools
             should be multi-purpose in nature.
         b.  Schools (as appropriate) should be available
             for use by the community during non-school
             hours.                                            The General Plan Committee watched
                                                               a presentation about the town of
         c.  Schools should be designed to accommodate         Gaylord, Michigan which involved the
             some of the community’s recreational needs,       entire community to build a multi-
             like playing fields, hard courts and running
                                                               purpose educational center open to all
             tracks.
                                                               residents.
II. Work to develop schools that are easily accessible
    and free from land use and circulation conflicts.
    1.   Schools should be located in areas of the
         community where they are easily accessible for
         school-aged students.
         a.  Schools should be designed so that they can
             be easily accessed from adjacent residential
             developments.
         b.  Schools should be designed so that students
             can be easily dropped off by their parents.
         c.  Bus drop-off zones should be separate from
             where parents drop off their children.

     2.  The location of schools should not be on
         roadways that attract other types of significant
         traffic (e.g. commuter, industrial or commercial
         traffic).
         a.   Elementary and middle schools should not
              front onto major collector or arterial
              roadways.
         b.   Sidewalks should be installed on all streets
              around a school site.
         c.   Schools should be connected to bike path
              systems.
     3.  To the best extent possible, schools should be
         centrally located in the neighborhoods they are
         expected to serve.
         a.   Existing, centrally located schools should
              consider acquiring adjacent property for
              future expansion.
           b. The Land Use Map identifies the area south
              of Farmersville High School for future
              school development.
III. Encourage schools to establish partnerships with
     other public entities.
     1.  Farmersville Unified School District should
         forge a working relationship with College of
         Sequoias as it pertains to agricultural, technical
         and mechanical training courses. In addition, the
         City could employ summer interns in a variety of
         positions.
IV. Work with educational institutions to fashion a
     training program that teaches skills that mirror
     local industrial sectors, including equipment
     repair, irrigation technology, food processing,
     nurseries, and agricultural technology.
     1.  Farmersville Unified School District should
         develop training and vocational programs for
         students that wish to be employed in the above
         sectors.

IV.     The School District should develop programs in
        cooperation with organizations such as Proteus
        Inc., C-Set, and the Tulare County Private
        Industry Council.
V. Encourage college courses to be taught in the
    Farmersville area.
    1.  Farmersville Unified School District should
        provide classroom space for College of Sequoias
        classes.
    2.  The School District should make its facilities
        available to other institutions that wish to
        provide instruction, training, or certification.
VI. Work to resolve school district boundary conflicts
    between Farmersville Unified School District and
    Visalia Unified School District.          Farmersville
    U.S.D.’s boundaries should include at least the
    City’s Urban Area Boundary.
    1.  The two school districts should meet regularly to
        resolve boundary issues. A date should be set
        for completion of this goal. The City may wish
        to participate in this activity.

ISSUE NINE: Agricultural Lands
Agriculture is the primary industry in the Farmersville area.
This basic industry employs almost 30 percent of the city’s
labor force. Agriculture is a relatively stable industry when
compared to other industrial sectors, like manufacturing,
tourism, and the transportation industries. For this reason,
                                                                         9        Agricultural
                                                                                  Lands
agriculture should be encouraged in the Farmersville area.
Further, land use policies that minimize the impacts between
urban and agricultural uses should be promoted.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   Farmersville will ensure that its primary economic
     base (agriculture) is protected.
     1.   New subdivisions shall be located no more than 1/8
          mile of existing or approved urban development.
          a.   The Planning Commission and City Council               See also Issue 2: Growth Management
               shall make a finding in approving General
               Plan Amendments and Zone Changes, to
               ensure the foregoing statement is true.
     2.   Encourage Tulare County to maintain large-lot
          agricultural zoning (20 acre minimum) to land
          within Farmersville’s Urban Area Boundary.
          a.   The City of Farmersville shall oppose any
               county development within its Urban Area
               Boundary that creates parcels of land smaller
               than 20 acres.
     3.   Moderately increase overall residential densities so
          that Farmersville utilizes land more efficiently.
          a. The Smart Development zone will offer
               moderate increases in residential density as an
               incentive for developers to utilize this zone
               district.
     3.   Urban uses, to the best extent possible, should be
          separated from agricultural uses by streets,
          railroads, canals or similar man-made or natural
          barriers.
          a.   Adoption of the Land Use Element and Land
               Use Map will implement this policy.

ISSUE TEN: Infrastructure
Infrastructure generally refers to a city’s utilities - water,
sewer, storm drainage, gas and electric, phone and cable
television services. In Farmersville, the city operates
water, sewer and storm dainage systems. The other
                                                                   10          Infrastructure
utilities are operated by private firms.
The operation and maintenance of infrastructure is of
paramount importance to cities. Without these services,
human health and well-being would be in jeopardy. Good
infrastructure can also serve as an economic development
tool. For instance, many industries require water supply,
and wastewater disposal capacity. Farmersville must
strive to maintain its existing infrastructure while
planning for expansions to accommodate future growth
and development.
I.    Adequately finance infrastructure systems.
                                                                See also Issue 11: Economic Development
      1.   New development shall be required to install
           water, sewer and storm drainage improvements
           to serve their needs.
           a.   The     City     Engineer    shall    evaluate
                development       projects    and     identify
                infrastructure needs, in the form of
                conditions of approval.
      2.   Farmersville’s water, sewer and storm drainage
           master plans shall be reviewed in order to ensure
           that they can properly and efficiently serve future
           development provided for by the Land Use
           Element.
           a.   The City’s water, sewer and storm drainage
                development impact fees shall be reviewed
                on an annual basis. This review should
                focus on the relationship between the
                amount of fees being collected for each of
                the accounts and the future capital needs of
                each system based on development trends in
                Farmersville.
           b.   The modification of the City’s development
                impact fees should be consistent with
                Assembly Bill 1600, which requires a clear
                relationship between fees and their purpose.

    2.  The City should continue to seek state and
        federal grants for the upgrading and expansion of
        its infrastructure systems.
II. Ensure infrastructure master plans and the
    general plan are consistent with one another.
    1.  The Land Use Element shall identify where
        development will occur in Farmersville through
        the year 2025. The Element will be fashioned
        so that it is generally in concert with existing
        master plans.
III. Maintain, rebuild and upgrade infrastructure
     systems.
    1.  The City shall update its 5-Year Capital
        Improvement Program to ensure that its
        infrastructure system can accommodate the
        urban growth prescribed by the Land Use
        Element.
    2.  The Redevelopment Agency should prepare a 5-
        Year Capital Improvement Program to assist in
        the maintenance, rebuilding and upgrading of
        Farmersville’s infrastructure system, within the
        Redevelopment Project Area.
    3.  The City should work with the private sector to
        participate in the upgrading of the infrastructure
        system when it is developing in the City.
        a.    From time to time, the City may wish to
              work with a developer to upgrade a part of

These types of services are crucial to the public’s health,
safety and welfare. Public safety, which includes police
and fire, ensures that the public and their possessions are
protected from criminal elements and exposure to fire and
hazardous materials;         emergency medical services

respond to calls for emergency medical response and
potentially, the need to transport the victim to a local
health care facility; and health care facilities, which
include hospitals, medical clinics and other types of
medical-related uses, provide to the public physical and
psychological care and treatment.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans:
I.   Promote a safe community that is free of crime
     and fire hazards
     1.   Through the City’s Site Plan Review process,
          new developments should be designed so that
          that crime and fire safety are considered in the
          design.
          a.   Ensure that all new uses have water
               available to the site and that proper water
               pressure is also available.
          b.   Buildings larger than 5,000 square feet in
               size should be equipped with sprinklers.
          c.   Ensure that all new uses are properly
               equipped with on-site lighting to promote
               safety and security. At the same time,
               ensure that outdoor lighting does not
               become a nuisance by unnecessarily
               illuminating adjacent properties. Involve
               officials from the Police and Fire
               Department to ensure that safety concerns
               are addressed in the site design process.
     2.   The City shall establish a Site Plan Review
          committee to provide early review of
          development projects. This goal will ensure that
          communication             between          various
          departments/agencies and project applicants is
          maximized in the development process. The

ISSUE THIRTEEN: Public Participation
For planning to be sucessful, citizens must be involved in
plan-making. A plan created without public input will
more than likely fail, as residents of the community, over
time, may not support the plan’s goals and principles.
The City took an important step in public involvement by
creating a citizen’s General Plan committee to work on
this General Plan. The Committee met over a period of
one year to educate themselves on planning issues, and
then formulate goals, objectives and action plans.
The City should continue to strive to involve citizens in
the planning process. A number of strategies to do this
are available.
I.   Work to educate and involve Farmersville’s
     citizens in the city planning and development
     process.
     1.   Convert the General Plan’s goals, objectives and
          action plans into display boards that will be
          permanently mounted in the City Council
          Chambers.
     2.   Maintain planning maps in the City Council
          Chambers and in the public lobby at City Hall.
          Maps should include the General Plan, Zoning,
          existing land uses, vacant lands, flood zones and
          agricultural preserves.
     3.   Establish a web site for the City. The website
          should include details on the city’s planning
          goals and procedures.
     4.   Develop a set of brochures to explain zoning and
          development standards in a user-friendly fashion.
     5.   Re-design planning application forms to make
          them more user-friendly.
     6.   Send staff, Planning Commissioners and City
          Council members to planning workshops and
          seminars.
          a.   The City shall ensure that funds are
               available to implement the foregoing

             objectives. For printed materials, the city
             should consider creating Spanish language
             versions.
    7.  Establish a beautification awards program where
        property owners in Farmersville are recognized
        for their efforts to maintain and beautify their
        property or businesses. Awards could be given
        on an annual basis for residential, commercial,
        industrial and public/institutional land uses.
        a.   The City should work with the Chamber of
             Commerce to form a citizen’s beautification
             committee, which will undertake an awards
             program.
    8.  Review the General Plan every five years. State
        planning guidelines recommend that cities
        review their general plans on a five year basis.
        This gives the community an opportunity to
        determine how well the plan is functioning and
        whether amendments may be necessary.
        a.   The Planning Director shall schedule a
             Planning Commission review of the General
             Plan, on a five year basis.
    9.  Require public notices be posted at development
        sites, announcing public hearings on the matter.
        a.   The Planning Director will require
             applicants to post public hearing notices at
             their site.

ISSUE FOURTEEN: Special Issues
The General Plan Committee addressed several planning
issues that are unique to Farmersville. These issues
include:
•    Linnel Farm Labor Center
•    Cameron Creek Colony
•    Lands along Highway 198
The Committee decided that these issues warrant special
attention for the community’s long-term planning goals.
Linnel Farm Labor Center
Linnel Farm Labor Center is a farm labor housing
development operated by the Tulare County Housing
Authority, on land west of Farmersville. Linnel is
situated on approximately 72 acres located on the east
side of Road 156 and the south side of Walnut Avenue
(Avenue 288). The site was originally developed in the
1950s and includes 191 dwelling units, a community
center, day care, recreational areas and manager’s facility.
Residency is limited to qualified low-income households.
Over the years, Farmersville has been growing towards
Linnel. Recent city development is now about one-                                     Map 2-5
quarter mile east of Linnel.         Linnel has its own                       Linnel Farm Labor Center
wastewater treatment plant, situated on fourteen acres on
the east side of the site. Farmersville is down-wind from                                                 State Highway 198
Linnel and on occassion, odors from the plant are
noticeable in the community. The presence of Linnel
(and in particular its wastewater treatment plant) may          156
negatively affect Farmersville’s future growth in this area.            Linnell
                                                                Road
                                                                         Farm                            168
In light of these concerns, the General Plan Committee                  Labor
formulated several strategies.                                          Center            Blvd.

I.   Establish a long-term framework to allow
                                                                                          Farmersville

     1.   Open a dialogue between the City and Tulare                  Wastewater
                                                                       Treatment

    2.   Encourage TCHA to continue to upgrade and
         improve the appearance of Linnel, through
         landscaping and routine maintenance.
    3.   Explore the possibility of closing Linnel’s
         wastewater treatment plant. Identify funding to
         extend lines from Farmersville’s sewer system to
         serve Linnel, and expand Farmersville’s
         wastewater treatment plant.
         a.   The City Manager shall contact officials of
              TCHA to set a meeting between the TCHA
              board of directors and the Farmersville City
              Council to discuss these issues.
Cameron Creek Colony
                                                                             Map 2-6
Cameron Creek Colony is a rural residential subdivision                Cameron Creek Colony
situated northeast of Farmersville, on the east side of
Farmersville Boulevard, midway between Walnut Avenue                                              State Highway 198
and State Highway 198. Road 168 forms the eastern

Many of the dwellings are poorly maintained and appear

facilities. Some residents maintain farm animals on their
property.
                                                                                                          Visalia Road
In 2000, Farmersville’s Urban Development Boundary
was expanded to include Cameron Creek Colony. This
means that although presently under the jurisdiction of
Tulare County, the community is ultimately in                                                              north
Farmersville’s future growth area.
As Farmersville continues to grow toward Cameron
Creek, it is expected that the City will eventually be
required to annex the area. This brings a number of
concerns to City and County administration, as well as
residents of the area. It is likely that Cameron Creek
would not be able to pay for public services that it
requires, such as police and fire protection, code
enforcement, recreation and planning and building

services. In addition, as previously mentioned, much of
the subdivision does not appear to meet current city (or
County) development standards.            As Farmersville
continues to grow towards Cameron Creek Colony, the
City and County must coordinate on future planning for
this area.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   Open a dialogue between the City and Tulare
     County officials about the future of the Cameron
     Creek      Colony       development.        Interested
     individuals in Cameron Creek Colony should also
     be involved in this effort.
     1.   At some point, the City should annex Cameron
          Creek Colony.
          a.   Work with Tulare County to establish a
               redevelopment district to generate funding
               to bring public and private development up
               to code in Cameron Creek, including streets,
               utilities and dwellings.
          b.   The City and County should negotiate a
               special tax-sharing agreement that places the
               city in a better position to assume public
               services requirements for Cameron Creek.
          c.   Encourage Tulare County to contract with
               Self-Help Enterprises to conduct a housing
               rehabilitation program for willing property
               owners.
     2.   Establish land use regulations that reflect the
          existing rural residential lifestyle in Cameron
          Creek Colony.
          a.   The Land Use Map identifies most of
               Cameron Creek as “Rural Residential”.
          b.   The City should establish a “Rural
               Residential” zone to apply to Cameron
               Creek Colony. The zone should mirror
               standards contained in the County’s existing
               zoning for the area. This zone should not be
               utilized in other portions of the planning
               area.

State Highway 198
Highway 198 is Farmersville’s “front door” to the world.
Daily, thousands of vehicles pass by Farmersville on the
highway. A number of these vehicles carry international
visitors bound for the scenic wonders of Sequoia National
Park.
As the city’s front door, the City should try to create as
attractive an image as possible. This goal is not only for
aesthetic reasons but is also economic. Travelers do not
want to stop at a location they perceive as unattractive or
unsafe.
Likewise, business owners will not choose to locate their          View looking east on Highway 198
firms in a community that does not appeal to them.
Establishing an attractive highway presence can help
Farmersville bolster its economic development. The City
can also take the opportunity to attract retail commercial
businesses (such as an automobile dealership) that prefer
a high visibility location along the highway. The sales tax
benefits for the City could be significant.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   The City shall take actions to establish an
     attractive development pattern along lands
     fronting State Highway 198.
     1.   The Land Use Map designates a combination of
          Highway Commercial and Industrial land uses
          along the highway.                                 Highway 198 is Farmersville’s
     2.   Require attractive landscape and building          “front door” to the world.
          designs that will reflect positively on
          Farmersville.
                                                             First impressions can “make or
                                                             break” a community’s chances
          a.   Establish a special “Highway 198” overlay
               zone that incorporates special building,
                                                             of attracting new development
               landscaping,    screening    and    signage   and revenue. . .
               requirements.
     3.   Erect “Welcome to Farmersville” signs at the
          interchange of Highway 198 and Farmersville
          Boulevard.
          a.   The City, Chamber of Commerce and to-be-
               formed Beautification Committee should

             work together to design, raise funds and
             establish community identification signs.
    4.  Work with Caltrans to establish landscaping
        within the freeway right-of-way.
    5.  Work with Caltrans to transform the
        Farmersville Boulevard overpass bridge into an
        attractive design element. Antique light poles,
        black wrought-iron railing and banners could be
        considered.
        a.   The City Manager should open a line of
             contact with Caltrans to pursue completion
             of these objectives.
        View of Highway 198/Farmersville Boulevard interchange shows “Welcome to
        Farmersville” sign, landscaping, and decorative light fixtures on the bridge.

Amendments to the Zoning Ordinance
The General Plan includes several recommendations to
amend the Farmersville Zoning Ordinance.                  The
Ordinance is one of the city’s foremost tools for
implementing and enforcing the recommendations of the
Plan.
The primary recommendations are for the creation of
several new zoning districts. These recommendations are
as follows:
                                                                              Farmersville
Rural Residential Zone (R-R)
                                                                           Zoning Ordinance
The Plan recommends creation of this zone to apply to
properties within the Cameron Creek Colony area.
Presently, Farmersville does not have a Rural Residential
district. The R-R zone would be applied to Cameron
Creek upon its future annexation to the City. Most cities
in Tulare County have a Rural Residential zone. Typical
features include large lot sizes and the provision for the
keeping of farm animals. Farmersville should survey
other cities’ zone district and choose from the best
features of each to create its Rural Residential Zone.
Smart Development Zone (S-D)
One of the General Plan’s primary recommendations is
for Farmersville to create a zone to implement “Smart
Growth” design techniques. The recommendations for
this type of zone are detailed further in Appendix A.
Central Commercial Zone (C-C)
The General Plan recommends the city create a special
commercial zone to apply to the downtown area. This
zone is intended to help create a downtown environment
where pedestrian-oriented shops front the sidewalk, and
on-site parking is located to the rear or side of stores.
Highway Commercial Overlay (H-C)
This zone is intended to promote appropriate retail and
service commercial uses that cater to the travelling public,
in locations along or near State Route 198. Appropriate
uses generally would include service stations, restaurants,
lodging establishments, convenience stores and other
complementary uses. This zone is to be applied along

Highway 198 and is intended to be an "overlay" zone.
This means that the zone will be applied as an overlay to
the existing zoning designation.            The Highway
Commercial zone will apply special standards to ensure
that development along the highway occurs in an
attractive manner, with attractively designed buildings,
signs, landscaping, and screening, where desired.
Mixed-Use
As its name implies, the Mixed Use Zone is intended to
facilitate the combination of various land uses on a single
site or within a single building. An example would be a
building that contains retail commercial businesses on the
ground floor, and residential units on the upper floor. The
mixed use zone should be targeted to appropriate areas of
the community, such as the downtown. A mixed use
designation could make parcels in the downtown more
marketable as the possibilities for development are
expanded.
Residential Multi-Family
It is recommended that the R-M zone be recongifured so
that it is consistent with other communities in Tulare
County. Two density standards should be established:
RM- 2.5: One unit per 2,500 square feet of land area
RM-4.0: One unit per 4,000 square feet of land area

designation for that parcel. For instance, a parcel
designated “Residential” in the General Plan must be
zoned for residential land uses.
Table 2-2 below is a matrix that shows which land use
designations are consistent with which zone districts.
Land use designations are listed in the left column of the
matrix while zone districts run across the top. Shaded
boxes show consistency between a land use category and
a zone district. For example, a parcel designated
“Medium Density Residential” would be consistent with
the R-1 zone.           Boxes that are unshaded denote
inconsistency. Per state law, zoning must always be
consistent with its General Plan land use designation.

routes and transportation-related facilities.
The Courts have indicated that not only must a roadway
improvement must be consistent with the General Plan
(Friends of “B” Street.et.al. v. City of Hayward, et. al.,
106 Cal. App. 3d 988 {1980}), there must be a correlation
between the circulation and land use elements. Generally,
correlation is achieved by using the same population and
land use projections for each element.
The Farmersville Circulation Element is composed of five
sections. They are:
1) Existing conditions;
2) An evaluation of the existing circulation system;
3) Traffic projections and evaluations;
4) Circulation goals, policies and action programs;
5) Roadway cross-section designs; and
6) Circulation map.

Existing Conditions
In addition to the information contained in this chapter,
additional circulation information is also provided in Part
II: Existing Conditions, of this document.
Early Circulation System
Farmersville’s road system was centered around the
railroad line that runs east/west through the community.
As such, the community’s streets run east/west and north
south.     The few exceptions occurred where local
waterways required a change in this pattern.
Major east west roadways include Visalia Road, Ash
Street, Walnut Avenue, Highway 198 and the frontage
roads that parallel the highway. Major north south
roadways include Farmersville Boulevard, Road 168 and
Virginia Street
Present Circulation System
Since the early 1900s, a system of roadways has been
constructed in the Farmersville area that falls into one of
the following categories - freeways, arterials, collectors,
local streets and alleys. A profile of major roadways in
the community is as follows:
State Highway 198 is an east/west highway that serves
Central California. The highway stretches from U.S. 101
in central coast region, through the coastal ranges, across
the San Joaquin Valley and into the foothills and
mountains of the Sierra Nevada range. The highway
terminates as a state route at the entrance to Sequoia
National Park but continues on as a federal roadway
within the park.
In the vicinity of Farmersville, the highway features two
travel lanes in each direction, a median divider, paved
shoulders and unlandscaped borders. The interchange
with Farmersville Boulevard features on and off-ramps
for traffic in both directions. The ramps connect to the
frontage roads on both sides of the highway. West of
Farmersville there is an interchange at Road 156 which
also features on and off ramps in both directions. East of
Farmersville the highway changes from a freeway with
controlled access to an expressway with cross traffic.

intersection of Visalia Road and Farmersville Boulevard
is controlled by a traffic signal.
Walnut Avenue (Avenue 288) is an east/west collector
road that runs midway between Visalia Road and State
Highway 198. The roadway generally features one travel
lane in each direction. Where recent development has
occurred, the street features a parking lane with curbs,
gutters and sidewalks. The intersection of Walnut and
Farmersville Boulevard is controlled by a traffic signal.
The frontage roads along State Highway 198 feature one
travel lane in each direction. Recent development along
the southern frontage road has installed paveout, curbs
and gutters. Otherwise, the roads feature unpaved
shoulders.
Local Roadways
Local roadways provide for internal traffic movement
within residential neighborhoods. Adjacent property has
direct access to these types of roadways. Local roadways
typically feature two travel lanes and two parking lanes.
They have rights-of-way widths that range from 52 to 60
feet.

Alleys
Alleys provide rear access to residential dwellings in
some older neighborhoods and to commercial buildings in
the downtown area.         Some alleys contain above-
(electricity and CATV) and below-ground utilities (sewer
and water lines). They also serve as a route for trash
pickup. Most of the alleys are 20 feet wide and are
unpaved.
Railroads
Farmersville grew up around the San Joaquin Valley
Railroad, originally constructed by the Southern Pacific
Railroad. The line through Farmersville connects Visalia
(and points west) with Exeter (and points south). The
railroad is situated within a wide right-of-way, generally
100 feet in width. Presently, there are no uses in
Farmersville that utilize the railroad for transport of
goods.
Public Transportation
Farmersville is the only city in Tulare County without a
public transit service. There is a bus service provided by
Orange Belt stages that provides access to other
California cities.
The City should explore the merits of establishing a dial-
a-ride service for the elderly, youth, handicapped, and
others who may not have access to transportation.
Air Service
Farmersville is served by the Visalia Municipal Airport,
located 15 miles west of Visalia and by Fresno-Yosemite
International Airport (FYI), located in Fresno, about 50
miles northwest of the city. Both airports provide
regularly scheduled freight and passenger service and
furnish private and company aircraft hangers and tie-
downs.
Bicycling and Walking
Presently, there are no established bike lanes in
Farmersville. However, the City has been participating
with the Tulare County Association of Governments in
the preparation of a bike plan for Tulare County and its

Intersections
Intersection analysis have been conducted at the
intersections of Visalia Road/Farmersville Boulevard,
Farmersville Boulevard/Walnut Avenue, and the
                                                         3-5

interchange of State Highway 198, Farmersville
Boulevard and the two frontage roads that parallel the
highway.
The intersections of Farmersville Boulevard/Visalia Road
and Farmersville Boulevard/Walnut Avenue are
signalized and are not expected to require upgrades during
the planning period (unless a large project is proposed
that may adversely affect these intersections.         The
intersections at the Highway 198/Farmersville Boulevard
interchange were analyzed for a recent development
project. These intersections will require signalization at
some point during the planning period. The traffic
consultant has also recommended future signalization at
Farmersville Boulevard and Ash Avenue and Farmersville
Boulevard and Terry Avenue.
 Connectivity
There are various neighborhoods in Farmersville that
would benefit from the extension of a roadway to another
part of the community.           Persons living in these
neighborhoods would be able to travel to other parts of
the community using a direct roadway route.
The railroad is a major impediment to through traffic in
Farmersville. Farmersville Boulevard is the only roadway
that crosses the tracks to connect the southern and
northern sections of the community. This forces residents
of neighborhoods on both sides of the tracks to “funnel
out” onto Farmersville Boulevard to cross the community.
Improved connectivity has the benefits of reducing traffic
on over-burdened streets, reducing trip lengths, reducing
air pollution and fuel consumption. Further, by enhancing
connectivity through Farmersville, emergency vehicles
are better able to access neighborhoods, thereby ensuring
better public safety protection for residents.
Traffic Safety
A roadway system that is safe and efficient - free of
congestion - is a primary circulation goal of all cities.
This goal also promotes a roadway system that is safe for
pedestrians and bicyclists, especially younger children.
The most potentially hazardous roadways in terms of
traffic safety in Farmersville are Farmersville Boulevard,

                                                                     Chapter 3: Circulation Element
Visalia Road, and the interchange at Farmersville
Boulevard and State Route 198.
Driving, riding or walking along these roadways can be
hazardous depending on a variety of factors, including
volume and speed of traffic, the width of the roadway,
cross traffic (vehicles entering and exiting the roadway)
the number of trucks or the number of
pedestrians/bicyclists traveling along the roadway.
Traffic Projections and Evaluations
The traffic consultant has projected traffic volumes for
roadway segments and certain intersections in the
planning area. These projections are based on the
following assumptions:
1.   Traffic volumes on local and State roadway systems
     will generally increase at a rate similar to population
     growth rates within the planning area.
2.   Persons living and working in Farmersville will
     continue to use cars as their primary mode of
     transportation.
3.   Uses that generate abnormally high volumes of traffic
     are not expected to locate in the planning area during
     the planning period.
4.   Current traffic flow patterns in the planning area will
     not change significantly.
Roadway Segment Projections
Increases in traffic volumes over the planning period for
local and State roadways is going to be generated by the
development of the land uses in the Farmersville area and
by increases in population and development in
surrounding communities.
Traffic volume projections for 2025 for selected roadways
in Farmersville are delineated in Table No. 3-3. These
projections are based on data from the Tulare County
Association of Government’s traffic model for Tulare
County and for the Farmersville area.
The projections in Table 3-3 indicate that Visalia Road
will be most impacted by increases in traffic. Even with

ISSUE ONE: Traffic
Even if a roadway is operating at a Level of Service
(LOS) A, which means that traffic flows freely along the
street with little or no congestion, people still complain
that there is too much traffic on the street especially if it is
their neighborhood street. While it is difficult to improve
                                                                    1                Traffic
on a roadway that has a LOS of A, the city can embrace
goals that will minimize traffic impacts on the
community.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   Ensure that streets in Farmersville are not
     congested.
II. Ensure that traffic on Farmersville’s streets
     operates in an efficient and safe manner.
III. Provide for long-term financing               for     street
     construction and maintenance.                                See also Issue 7: Connectivity
     1. A level of service C will be the desirable minimum
          service level in Farmersville at which arterial and
                                                                  2
          collector segments will operate. A level of service
          of C will be the desirable minimum service level in
          Farmersville at which intersections will operate.
          a. The City will program street improvements into
               its 5-year capital budget that will ensure the
               specified LOS is not exceeded in the city
               limits. Funds for these street improvement
               projects will come from gas tax and
               transportation funds.
          b.   The City should develop a traffic impact fee
               for new development in Farmersville. This fee
               shall be consistent with the requirements of
               AB 1600.
     2.   Land use projects which generate large amounts of
          traffic shall be discouraged from channeling traffic
          onto local roadways.
          a.   The Planning Department shall recommend
               denial of discretionary land use projects to the
               Planning Commission and City Council that

ISSUE TWO: Arterials
Arterial roadways carry the greatest amount of traffic in
Farmersville. These roadways carry traffic that may be
traveling at a high rate of speed and they may carry a
significant amount of truck traffic, which can make these
roadways noisy. Because of these characteristics, the
                                                                  2            Arterials
design, location and types of land uses developed
adjacent to these roadways must be carefully planned.
Most persons in Farmersville will travel on an arterial at
least once a day. Travel efficiency on these roadways is
important for two reasons:            (1) congested traffic
conditions cause the traveler to be late to their destination
and (2) congestion creates greater amounts of air
pollution, already a significant environmental problem in
the Valley. Traffic that moves smoothly and efficiently
along an arterial minimizes these two problems.

I.   Establish an arterial road system that conveys                        Program
     traffic in an efficient and safe manner.
     1.   The Circulation Element map identifies arterial
          roadways in the planning area.
II. Arterials should be visually pleasing, and designed
     to accommodate other modes of transportation,
     such as bicycles and pedestrians.
     1.   Study reconfiguring Farmersville Boulevard and
          Visalia Road to provide a landscaped medians,                         Background

        kept to a minimum and, if possible, should be
        reduced or eliminated when redevelopment
        occurs along an arterial roadway.
        a.   Through the site plan review process, the
             Planning and Engineering Departments will
             work to minimize the number of driveways
             that intersect arterial roadways.
    3.  Left turn lanes shall be constructed on arterials
        where they intersect with other arterials or
        collectors.
        a.   The City Engineer and Public Works
             Department will coordinate to ensure that
             left turn lanes are installed as development
             occurs.             For      already-developed
             neighborhoods, the proposed circulation
             impact fee should be set to fund installation
             of left turn lanes.
    4.  Curbing at the intersections of arterial and
        collector streets should be painted red at least 50
        feet in all directions from the corner curb radius
        in order to provide sufficient sight-line for traffic
        pulling into the intersection.
        a.   The Public Works Department will ensure
             that curbing is properly painted.

ISSUE THREE: Collectors
Next to arterials, collectors carry the greatest amount of
traffic in a city. Unlike arterials, collectors may traverse
residential neighborhoods. It is this type of roadway that
“drains” traffic from a neighborhood and conveys it
towards other collector or arterial roadways. Because
                                                                3          Collectors
collectors pass through neighborhoods, their effectiveness
to channel traffic can be diminished by the design of land
uses adjacent to the roadway. If these uses are designed
so that they haphazardly funnel traffic onto the collector,
the efficiency of the collector is reduced.
Collectors that accommodate truck traffic must be located
where they will not have an adverse impact on existing
neighborhoods and yet be able to conduct truck traffic
effectively.
Collectors, due to their location, can impact a residential
neighborhood. The volume of traffic, the level of noise
and a collector’s appearance can influence adjacent           See also
neighborhoods. It is important to properly plan and
design these roadways so that they are an asset to the         Issue 6: Green Streets Program
community and not a detraction.

Goals, Objectives, Policies
I.   Provide efficient and safe circulation access to all
     parts of Farmersville.
     1.   Where possible, collector roadways should
          contain sufficient right-of-way for two travel
          lanes, two bike lanes, two parking lanes and a        Street design standards are shown in
          median/turn lane; and minor collectors should         Figure 3-1.
          have sufficient right-of-way for two travel lanes,
          two parking lanes, two 6-foot parkways, and two
          5-foot sidewalks.
          a.   Major and minor collector roadways will be
               constructed consistent with street cross-
               section illustrations contained Figure 3-1 of
               the Circulation Element.
     2.   All street improvement projects, including
          widening, closing, or constructing new
          roadways, will be reviewed by the Planning and
          Engineering Departments to confirm that the

         project is consistent with the Circulation
         Element.
         a.   The Planning and Engineering Departments
              will review development projects to
              determine consistency with the Circulation
              Element during site plan and subdivision
              review.
    3.   Left turn lanes shall be constructed on collectors
         where they intersect with other arterials or
         collectors.
         a.   Through the site plan review process, the
              Planning and Engineering Departments will
              require this design feature.
    4.   Curbing at the intersections of arterial and
         collector streets should be painted red at least 50
         feet in all directions from the corner curb radius
         in order to provide sufficient sight-line for traffic
         pulling into the intersection.
         a.   The Public Works Department will identify
              which curbs at the aforementioned
              intersections should be red-curbed.
    5.   Driveways that intersect with collectors should
         be kept to a minimum and, if possible, should be
         eliminated when redevelopment occurs along
         this type of roadway.
         a.   Through the site plan review process, the
              Planning and Engineering Departments will
              work to eliminate unnecessary driveways.
II. Establish a collector system that encourages truck
    traffic but not at the expense of the livability of          See also Issue 8: Truck Traffic
    the community or adjacent neighborhoods.
    1.   Designate a system of truck routes in
         Farmersville that minimizes negative impacts on
         sensitive land uses and neighborhoods

ISSUE FOUR: Local Streets and Alleys
Local streets (also frequently referred to as “Residential
Streets” are perhaps the most important roadways in a
                                                                             Local Streets and
community. These are the streets that people live on. They
form the nucleus of the neighborhood. Well designed, local
streets can be an asset to the neighborhood. Poorly designed
                                                              4              Alleys
local streets can become a nuisance, and worse, a safety
hazard.
Local Street Design
Recent studies have suggested that current engineering
standards are creating dangerous streets. Wide residential
streets tend to encourage higher vehicle speeds, making
streets less safe. Narrower streets cause drivers to slow
down In addition, current standards do not require street
trees. Research indicates that heavily shaded streets further
cause drivers to slow down. In addition, shaded streets
generate much less heat, cooling the neighborhood. Shaded
pavement also tends to last longer. Finally, studies have
shown that well-maintained shady streets have higher
property values.
Subdivision Street Patterns
Most new subdivisions are designed with circuitous street
patterns featuring numerous dead-end roads with cul-de-
sacs. The purpose of these designs is to reduce through-
traffic (which in turn theoretically reduces noise and
improves safety). While well intentioned, these designs
usually result in circuitous travel patterns that concentrate
traffic onto collector and arterial roadways as well as the
entry/exit streets into individual subdivisions. The end
result is cities where people are tied to the automobile to
make all of their trips around a community. Walking and
cycling become frustratingly inconvenient.
Older neighborhoods in the original part of towns were
designed almost exclusively using a grid (or modified grid)
pattern.      Dead-end cul-de-sac patterns and walled
subdivisions were almost unknown in city design until the
1950’s. Not uncoincidentally, that is about the same time
that highway-based street design standards (wider streets       To the extent practical, road layouts

Properly designed, subdivisions layed out with grid roadway patterns
can improve connectivity by providing a variety of routes for
motorists, pedestrians and bicycles. If the grid is fine enough,
automobile traffic is diffused so that individual streets are not over-
                                                                             See also Appendix A: A Smart

to further slow vehicle speeds. Other mechanisms such as shorter                         Land Use Element
block lengths, roundabouts, bulb-outs and stop signs can further tame
neighborhood traffic.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I. Revise local street standards to ensure residential streets are
    safe and effective.
    1.   Single family residential subdivisions may have local streets
         that have a minimum right-of-way width of 60 feet, 36 feet
         paved width. Tree-lined parkways shall be installed in this
         right-of-way. The parkway shall have a width of 7 feet; and
         the sidewalk 5 feet (see Figure 3-1).
         Single family residential subdivisions with streets on blocks
         shorter than 600 feet may have a minimum right-of-way
         width of 58 feet, 34 feet paved width. Tree-line parkways
         shall be installed in this right-of-way. The parkway shall
         have a width of 7 feet; the sidewalk 5 feet (see Figure 3-1).
         Subdivisions with all lot larger than 8,000 square feet are
         not required to install parkways.
                                                                          Farmersville’s vision for residential streets:
                                                                          shady, cool, and narrow to slow traffic.
         Parkways and street trees shall be maintained by a landscape
         and lighting district.
    3.   Alleys are permitted within residential subdivisions. Alleys
         shall have a rights-of-way of 24 feet and a paved width of
         20 feet. A concrete vee gutter is required in the middle of
         the alley. The non-paved portion of the right-of-way shall
         be landscaped and provided with irrigation. Garbage pickup
         shall not be permitted in the alleys.
II. Require subdivision designs that utilize grid street patterns,
     reserving cul-de-sacs only where necessary.
    1.   Subdivisions shall be designed to maximize connectivity,
         favoring grid street patterns over cul-de-sac heavy street
         patterns. The use of cul-de-sacs shall be kept to a minimum
         unless needed to allow more efficient utilization of oddly
         shaped or “leftover” portions of the parent subdivision
         parcel.

ISSUE FIVE: Intersections
Circulation at busy roadway intersections can           be
improved with a variety of methods. Signallization is an
effective, but very expensive way to improve traffic flow.
Simpler methods like adding turn lanes or stop signs can
work well in a small community like Farmersville.
                                                                       5            Intersections
However, signals do become necessary when traffic
conditions warrant.
Another way of controlling intersections is the
roundabout. For hundreds of years Europe and Mexico
have used roundabouts to control traffic at intersecting
streets. In addition, the interior portion of the roundabout
often contains a visual feature, like landscaping, trees or
even a fountain or statue. The Walnut Woods subdivision
being developed in the northwest portion of the
community is utilizing roundabouts. The City should
encourage the use of additional roundabouts, particularly
at the intersection of local streets within new
development.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   Ensure that busy intersections are properly                                      Map 3-2

ISSUE SIX: Green Streets Program
Some of the great streets in the world are graced by
landscaped medians or a boulevard of street trees. These
                                                                                 Green Streets
features “soften” the appearance of the street, provide
shade for pedestrians and establish a memorable, positive
image.
                                                                    6            Program
Studies have shown that lands along tree-shaded streets
frequently enjoy higher property values. While the cost
of installing and maintaining trees is a concern, proper
selection of trees can reduce long term maintenance costs.
Non-profit organizations like the Urban Tree Foundation
can assist Farmersville in establishing a green streets
program.
I.   The City should explore establishing landscaped
     medians and tree lined parkways on Farmersville
     Boulevard,Visalia Road and Walnut Avenue.
1.        The City shall have prepared a streetscape design
          plan that will establish a 20-year improvement
          program for the construction of landscaped
          medians for Farmersville Boulevard and Visalia
          Road. This Plan should include details for
          lighting, landscaping and signing.
          a.   The Engineering and Planning Departments
               will prepare the streetscape design plan.
               Funds will come from tax increment, gas
               tax, transportation funds and the state grant
               programs.
          b.   The City shall apply for urban forestry             Visalia Road before (above) and after
               grants to assist in the funding of landscaped       (below) conversion to a “Green Street.”
               medians.
     2.   Existing parkways that do not contain trees
          should be planted with trees.
          a.   The City should apply for an urban forestry
               grant to pay for the cost of installing street
               trees.
     3.   Parkways with trees that have broken or lifted
          adjacent sidewalk shall be removed and replaced
          with more appropriate street trees.

ISSUE SEVEN: Street Connectivity
Good connectivity is important for an effective street
system. A well connected pattern of collectors and
                                                                           Street

burdened with traffic. Good connectivity also helps to
reduce air pollution and fuel consumption, by reducing
                                                                7          Connectivity
trip lengths and delays.
Connectivity in Farmersville is hampered by the railroad.
Farmersville Boulevard is the only street in the entire city
that crosses the tracks. This requires requires motorists to
rely solely on Farmersville Boulevard to travel
north/south through the community. In order to alleviate
this situation, it is recommended that additional railroad
crossings be established.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.    Improve connectivity in Farmersville’s street
      system

          Avenue
          1.   The City shall seek funding to establish a
               railroad crossing at Ventura Avenue.
          2.   Coordinate with the San Joaquin Valley
               Railroad in the design and timing of the
               crossing.
      2.  Explore establishing a railroad crossing east of
          Farmersville Boulevard.         Possible crossings
          could be established at Rose Avenue or
          Brundage Avenue. Altnernately, the City could
          explore creating a new collector street east of the
          existing city limit line that connects Visalia Road
          to Walnut Avenue.
          a.   The City Manager and City Engineer shall
               prepare a report on this matter for
               presentation to the City Council.

Truck traffic can adversely affect a community (and
specifically residential neighborhoods) because of the
noise and vibrations they generate. Further, heavy trucks
can damage local roadways because of their weight.
However, trucks are an essential ingredient for the local

ISSUE TEN: Transit
Alternative modes of transportation are important to
different groups of people for different reasons. For low-
income, handicapped or non-driving age persons, public
transit may be the only means of travel. For a person who
is concerned about polluting the air, riding a bus or bike
                                                                 10           Transit

Farmersville is presently the only city in Tulare County
that does not have some type of transit system. As the
community grows, the City should explore adding at least
a dial-a-ride type service. This would be a particularly
valuable addition for individuals who do not have access
to other modes of transportation
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.        Promote opportunities for residents                to
          increase mobility within Farmersville.
     1.   Farmersville should explore the concept of
          establishing a local transit service, such as a dial-
          a-ride system
          a.   The City should coordinate with the Tulare
               County Association of Governments to
               consider and operating structure and funding
               mechanisms necessary to establish a dial-a-
               ride system.        Also, coordinate with
               neighboring communities that do operate
               transit service.

ISSUE ELEVEN: Bike Paths and Pedestrian
                      Pathways
Bicycling is an important form of transportation. In a
small community like Farmersville, bicycling can provide
                                                                             Bike Paths and

When added to the local bike traffic generated by school-
aged children, it is important to properly locate and design
Farmersville’s bikepath system.
By encouraging persons to walk in Farmersville, personal
contact is promoted. This interaction makes for a more
close-knit community in addition to promoting a more
healthy lifestyle.
Farmersville has been participating with the Tulare
County Association of Governments in developing a
county-wide bicycle route plan. As of this writing the
plan is in the draft stage. The draft plan identifies four
future bicycle routes in Farmersville, including Visalia
Road, Farmersville Boulevard, Walnut Avenue and
Avenue 296 (the frontage road along the north side of
State Route 198).
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   Encourage persons to ride bikes for good health as
     well as for environmental reasons.
II. Ensure that Farmersville’s bikepath system is
     consistent with the Tulare County Association of
     Government’s             Countywide             Bicycle
     Transportation Plan.
III. Encourage residents to walk in Farmersville.
     1.  Develop a bike path plan for the City of
         Farmersville. Consider other routes in addition
         to those identified in the regional bike plan.
         a.   Design the Plan so that some of the bike
              path segments are not along surface streets
              but along the railroad right-of-way, parks
              and creek/canal easements.

        b.  Apply for state and federal funds to finance
            the construction of the bikepath system.
        c.  Ensure that subdivisions are designed so that
            persons riding bikes can access adjacent
            properties from the neighborhood.
        d.  Cooperate with the County of Tulare to
            ensure that Farmersville’s Plan is linked to
            the County’s regional bikeway network.
        e.  Consider implementing        traffic calming
            designs where bike paths cross surface
            streets.
        f.  Bikepaths will be constructed consistent
            with the bikepath cross-section illustrated in
            Appendix A of the Circulation Element.          Investigate the use of creek and canal
                                                            easements for walking paths
    2.  Provide safe and convenient pedestrian access to
        all areas of the city, including between
        neighborhoods.
        a.  Maintain and repair sidewalks to make them
            safe for pedestrians.
        b.  Plant existing parkways that lack trees to
            make the walking experience more
            comfortable and enjoyable.
        c.  Provide signage for walking paths.
        d.  Investigate the use of creek and canal
            easements for walking paths.

Open space lands are undeveloped areas that provide a
low density perception in an urban area, define the edge
of a community, and provide the sight lines that allow
long distance vistas to the Sierra Nevada, agriculture
fields, or other local view-points. Most people think of
open space as park areas, but a large portion of a city's
open space is provided by residential yard areas and right-
of-way along streets.
A park is an open area that provides an assortment of
recreation and leisure opportunities for a community. A
park can include community recreation parks, school
playgrounds, community centers, and other publicly-
owned outdoor recreation areas. Parks can supply active
as well as passive recreation. Activities can range from
family picnics to organized sporting events.
One of the primary purposes of parks is to contribute to
Farmersville’s quality of life. The City accomplishes this
through the provision of convenient, well-equipped and
maintained sites and facilities, conservation of natural
resources, and a comprehensive and quality program of
recreational activities and services for all citizens of the
community.

The Element
The open space portion of this Element identifies lands
that are appropriate for open space and parks acquisition
as well as the development of recreation programs on
these lands. The Element establishes goals, policies,
action programs and standards for the conservation and
treatment of open space.
Government Code Section 65560 et seq. defines open
space as land that can be used for any of the following
uses:
•    Conservation of natural resources
•    Managed production of resources
•    Outdoor recreation
•    Preservation of lands for the purpose of protecting
     the public's health and safety
Specific requirements of the conservation portion of the
Element are identified in Government Code Section
65302 (d). This portion of the element includes "the
conservation, development and utilization of natural
resources, including water, forests, soils, rivers and other
waters, wildlife, and other natural resources." Items that
are addressed in this category include the conservation of:
•    Agricultural lands
•    Soils
•    Air and water quality
•    Mineral resources
•    Wildlife habitat
•    View opportunities
The Parks and Recreation Element is an optional element
of the General Plan. This Element identifies existing and
potential recreational opportunities within the community.
Since it is closely related to the City's open space system,
integration of the three documents into one element
makes good planning sense.

Existing Conditions
Part II of the General Plan contains an in-depth profile of
conditions in the Farmersville planning area. A brief
summary of these conditions is provided below, as they
pertain to particular topics addressed by the Element.
Air Quality
Farmersville has a moderate climate with warm summers
and generally mild winters. The City is located within the   The San Joaquin Valley, including
San Joaquin Valley Air Basin. The closest air monitoring
station is located in Visalia, where Ozone and PM-10         Farmersville, has failed to

achieve state and federal standards for these pollutants
and is therefore designated as a non-attainment area.        and is therefore designated as a
There are several factors which cause this to occur. They    non-attainment area
are:
1.   The topography of the valley as a basin surrounded
     by mountains has the effect of trapping stagnant or
     polluted air.
2.   The local climate (abundant sunshine and high
     atmospheric pressure) is favorable for the formation
     of smog.
3.   The primary factor is the growth of population in the
     Valley. With more and more people moving to the
     valley, smog is produced by fossil fuel burning and
     emissions from factories and other combustion
     processes.
Water Resources
Farmersville currently obtains its water from underground
supplies. The aquifer underlying the Cityis a good supply
of water although the relative shallowness of the water
table can make the supply susceptible to surface
contaminants. In recent years, the water table has been
as shallow as 20 feet below ground level. In order to
reduce the possibility of contamination, the city’s well
system draws water from 240 to 400 feet below ground
level.

The water table is recharged primarily by water moving
downhill from the watersheds of Sierra Nevada streams,
particularly the Kaweah River and its distributary system,
which includes Deep Creek. Irrigation waters also help to
recharge the water table. Rainfall in the Farmersville area
provides only a small amount of groundwater recharge.
Deep Creek is a natural waterway which has been
trenched and channelized since the arrival of European
settlers. However, portions of the channel retain some
“native” vegetation such as oak trees, willows and vines.
The presence of these relatively undisturbed stream
sections represents an important natural resource. These
types of riparian areas can function as a protective travel
corridor for wildlife through an otherwise “sterile” area.
In addition to Deep Creek there are other irrigation
facilities in the planning area. These include channels
maintained by Tulare Irrigation District (TID) and
People’s Ditch Company.
In 2000, the Tulare Irrigation District (TID) canal that
runs along the west side of Farmersville was the subject
of a proposal by TID to line the channel with concrete, in
order to reduce the loss of water to percolation.
Controversy centered over the loss of groundwater
recharge from what was historically a natural stream
channel, and also the loss of numerous large Valley Oak
trees along the banks of the ditch.
The project was cancelled when an agreement was
reached between TID, Kaweah Water Conservation
District and the City of Visalia that set forth a mechanism
whereby TID would receive payments for water lost to
percolation.
Agricultural Resources
Farmersville is surrounded by thousands of acres of
producing cropland. Agricultural lands have provided a
strong economic base for the community as well as a rural
landscape and open space "system" that surrounds the
City. As Farmersville continues to grow, surrounding
agricultural lands are taken out of production to
accommodate residential, commercial, and industrial
growth.

In 1965, California adopted the Williamson Act to
address the loss of agricultural lands due to urbanization.
The Williamson Act provides property owners with a
reduction in their property tax if they agree to maintain
their land in agriculture for a ten-year period. This
ensures, at least for the near-future, that agricultural lands
will remain undeveloped, thereby continuing agricultural
production and enhancing the sense of open space around
Farmersville. Map 4-1 shows properties within the
Farmersville planning area that have a Williamson Act
contract. Approximately 60 acres within Farmersville’s
Urban Development Boundary are in agricultural
preserves under Williamson Act contracts
Mineral Resources
There are no known mineral resources within the planning
area and no known mining of mineral resources has
occurred in the planning area. The closest significant
mineral resources consist of sand and gravel deposits
along the Kaweah River northeast of Farmersville, near
the Sierra Nevada foothills. Several open-pit sand and
gravel mines operate along the river. Recent applications
to expand these operations have generated controversy
over their potential environmental impacts.
Soil Resources
Soils are discussed in detail in Part II: Resources. The
soils in the Farmersville area are described by the Soil
Survey of Central Tulare County, prepared by the Soil
Conservation Service, Department of Agriculture (see
Map 2-2 in Part II: Community Profile). The Soil Survey
identifies three specific soils in the planning area. They
are
•    Grangeville sandy loam, drained, 0 - 2 % slopes;
•    Nord fine sandy loam, 0 - 2% slopes;
•    Tagus loam, 0 - 2% slopes.
According to the survey, these soils have few limitations
for urban development. At the same time, they are
considered to be prime agricultural soils.

Regional Parks Facilities
There are several regional parks that are within driving
distance to Farmersville. Generally speaking, at a
maximum, most people are willing to travel thirty minutes
to get to a regional park facility, and possibly one hour if
there was some type of event scheduled there, such as a
church gathering, family reunion, or school function.
Farmersville has two regional parks operated by Tulare
County within 15 minutes driving time. Cutler Park is a
regional park located about 5 miles north of Farmersville.
The park is situated on 50 acres along the bank of the St.
Johns River and features grassy areas shaded by towering
oak trees. Facilities include picnic tables and barbecues,
walking paths, restrooms and passive play areas.
Mooney’s Grove is a regional park located about five
miles west of Farmersville, on the south side of Visalia.
This park covers some 140 acres and preserves a large
area of native valley oak trees. The park features a
historical museum, picnic tables, restrooms and play
areas, ponds, and creeks.
About two miles northeast of Farmersville is Kaweah
Oaks Preserve. This 324-acre property contains the
largest protected example of Great Valley valley oak
riparian forest anywhere within the Kaweah River Delta.
About half the property at the Preserve is an equally rare
habitat called alkali meadow where bunchgrasses and
other alkali-loving native plants thrive. The Preserve is
frequently used as an educational resource by local school
classes.
Kaweah Oaks Preserve was originally operated by the
Nature Conservancy but is now owned and operated by
the Sierra Los Tulares Land Trust.           The trust also
operates the Herbert Wetland Prairie Preserve on 725
acres about six miles south of Farmersville. This site
features vernal pools scattered amid extensive grassland
and is a rare example of the valley landscape before
widespread agricultural and urban development.

per 1,000 residents, the City should have about 26 acres
of parks. As such, Farmersville is currently “short” by
about 6.7 acres.
Projections of a community's open space and park needs
involves many factors. Population, income, education,
accessibility, and age must all be considered in
determining the correct amount of open space/parks for a
community.
Park aquisition must strike a balance between use and the
maintenance available to sustain the park. Generally
speaking, city parks cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000
per acre per year to maintain.
A city may have 10 acres of open space per 1,000
persons; however, if this acreage is not maintained
properly, its value as usable open space will be greatly
diminished. As Farmersville acquires more parkland, it
must also dedicate the resources to adequately maintain
that land.
Americans today are spending more of their time in
recreation leisure activities than ever before. This
emphasis has created a much higher demand than ever for

quality open space, parks and recreation facilities. In
response to this, cities must designate areas for such uses,
before development occurs.
Parkland
In order to determine the type, location and amount of
parkland that will be required by Farmersville within the
23-year planning period, population projections are
required. Two population projections (low and high) are
displayed in Table 4-3. The table shows that as
population increases, so does the need for park acreage.
Table 4-3 shows that Farmersville is currently “short” 6.7
acres on park land - using the standard of 3 acres per
1,000 residents. By the year 2025, the City would need to
add about 34 acres to meet the standard (using an annual
growth rate of 2.9% per year. Using the “high” growth
rate of 3.4% per year, the City would need to add 41 acres
of parkland.

Accessibility
Another important factor in the planning of future parks is
to insure that parks are accessible to all citizens of the
community. For instance, although a city may currently
meet the standards regarding the amount of parkland
required; the existing park sites may not be easily
accessible from all areas of the community.
Map 4-3 shows the location of existing City-owned park
facilities and their service areas. Service area dimensions
are those provided by the National Parks and Recreation
Association. Generally, a community park will have a
one-half mile service area, and a neighborhood park has a
one-quarter mile service area. In general Farmersville has
been successful in establishing a good distribution of
parks throughout the community. The community will
need to continue planning for park needs as new
neighborhoods are developed.

ISSUE ONE: Designation of Park Facilities
The City's General Plan must designate adequate
                                                                             Designation of Park
recreational facilities for future development. The Land
Use Element and this Element must provide locations for
the future development of conservation, open space, parks
and recreation facilities. If adequate sites are not
                                                                 1           Facilities
designated in advance, the City will continue to grow with
no property set aside for these uses.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   Plan for adequate park and recreation facilities to
     meet existing and future needs in Farmersville.
     1.  Maintain compliance with adopted City park
         standards now, and as the City grows.
         a.   The City shall review and, if necessary,
              increase its park impact fees in order to
              ensure that it maintains its ratio of at least 3
              acres of parkland per 1,000 people.
     2.  Provide a variety of park sites and recreational
         facilities to accommodate the City's diverse
         population.
         a.   Future park sites are identified on Map 4-4
     3.  Plan for the acquisition of parks prior to urban
         growth and development. These lands may be
         acquired and left vacant until funding for
         development is available.
         a.   Adoption of this Element and the Land Use
              Element will provide implementation of this
              item.
     4.  Encourage private or commercial development
         of recreational opportunities such as racquetball
         courts, golf, commercial softball, etc., that are
         available to the public.
         a.   The City will encourage the development of
              private recreation facilities.

             Departments must ensure that developers are
             assessed park impact fees.
    6.  Creeks and canals in the planning area shall be
        investigated for use as public open space
        features, with landscaped pathways and
        landscaping adjacent to the waterway.
        a.   Farmersville will work with local canal and
             irrigation districts to develop standards to
             incorporate local waterways as open space
             features. The City could require developers
             of adjacent lands to install a pathway and
             landscaping within canal easements. This
             could satisfy the developer’s open space
             dedication obligation.
                                                              Investigate the use of creeks and canals
                                                              for use as public open space features,
                                                              with landscaped pathways and
                                                              landscaping adjacent to the waterway.

ISSUE TWO: Park Location and Design
The City of Farmersville must work to ensure there is an
adequate distribution of park and open space facilities
throughout the City. Active park sites and passive open                    Park Location and
space areas should be accessible to all segments of the
community.
                                                               2           Design
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.  Establish parks in appropriate locations and
    ensure their design caters to the needs of the
    community.
    1.  Design park sites that fulfill the open space,
        passive and active recreational needs of all the
        citizens of Farmersville.
        a.   Prior to the design of each new park, the
             City and Recreation Commission shall
             conduct public workshops to receive input
             from citizens regarding the design of the
             park.
    2.  Locate future parks in such a way as to be
        accessible and available to all the citizens of
        Farmersville.
        a.   Adoption of this Element and the Land Use
             Map and its policies will provide
             implementation of this policy. The City
             must observe this policy when considering
             the location of new parks.
    3.  Locate park and recreational facilities so that
        they do not conflict with adjacent land uses.
        a.   Adoption of this Element and its policies
             will provide implementation of this policy.
             Factors to consider include avoiding streets
             with high traffic, industrial uses, and noise
             sensitive uses.
    4.  Consider the design of parks that double as
        stormwater retention/detention facilities.

        a.   The Planning Department and City Engineer
             shall explore the feasibility of designing
             future parks to act as dual use facilities,
             incorporating recreation and storm drainage.
    5.  All parks shall be designed to meet the needs of
        the handicapped.
        a.   The Building Department shall review plans
             for proposed facilities for compliance with
             handicap/accessibility requirements of the
             Uniform Building Code.
    6.  Create a new Smart Development zone district
        that will require new subdivisions of forty acres
        or more to incorporate a neighborhood
        subdivision park into the project. In turn for
        development of the park, the city could allow a
        moderate increase in residential density within
        the subdivision.
        a.   The Planning Department shall develop a
             new zone which incorporates the above-
             referenced standards.
    7.  Parks and other facilities that may require a
        significant amount of night lighting, such as ball
        parks and tennis courts, should be designed in
        such a way as to minimize the impacts of
        lighting on the surrounding neighborhood.
        a.   The Planning Department shall review
             lighting schemes for all projects.
    8.  Park design may incorporate the use of berms
        and small hills where appropriate to provide
        relief to the otherwise flat terrain of
        Farmersville.
        a.   Grading plans for all park sites should
             include areas of berms and mounding, as
             appropriate. Earth moved from ponding
             basins or other construction projects can
             provide a ready source for berms and hills.

ISSUE THREE: Acquisition and Funding
Adequate funding is the key to establishing and
                                                                            Acquisition and
maintaining a quality parks and recreation program.
Numerous sources of funding exist, however it is not
always easy to tap these sources. To be successful, the
City should evaluate a variety of funding methods and
                                                                 3          Funding
sources. Strategies for doing this are provided in the
following goals, objectives and action plans.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   Create and preserve open space in the
     Farmersville area to meet the needs of the
     community now, and in the future.
     1. Farmersville shall continue to require developers
        to pay park impact fees (Quimby fees) or
        dedicate land in lieu thereof. The State of
        California adopted Section 11546 of the
        Business and Professional Code, which allows a
        jurisdiction to require the dedication of parkland
        by a subdivider, or in-lieu-of dedication, to pay a
        fee of equivalent value.
        a.   The City shall annually review its fees for
             recreational programs, park lands and rentals
             to insure that they are sufficient to finance
             future park needs. Areas that could be
             considered for review include:
             -    Increasing the park land dedication
                  standard from 3 acres per 1,000
                  residents. State law allows cities to
                  require up to 5 acres per 1,000 residents
             -    Charging user fees for use of a facility
                  or participation in an activity,
             -    Entrance fees for admission to a large
                  park or other developed recreation area,
             -    Charging rental fees for the use of
                  recreation equipment or property, and
             -    Admission fees can be charged for
                  special events, exhibits, or rallies.

                                                                        Parks and Recreation Element
        2. Ensure that the City of Farmersville receives
           its full share of federal and state grant funds
           including matching and competitive grants.
           The City shall also seek out available              Ensure that the City of
           charitable contributions for parks and open         Farmersville receives its full
           space facilities.
                                                               share of federal and state grant
           a.   The City shall apply for available state       funds including matching and
                and federal grants as they become              competitive grants.
                available.       Contracting with an
                established grant writer should be
                considered.
           b.   Farmersville should explore securing
                gifts from foundations and individuals
                to support special interest recreation
                programs or park projects.
        3. Farmersville should explore the financing of
           park and recreational facilities through the
           use of tax-increment funds, generated by the
           sale of tax-allocation bonds.
           a.   The City should conduct a feasibility
                study of financing park and recreation
                facilities by the sale of tax-allocation
                bonds.
        4. Farmersville        should     explore      the
           opportunities to enter into joint powers
           agreements with other agencies to share the
           costs of park and recreation facilities
           development and maintenance.
           a.   The City should consider approaching
                the Farmersville Unified School District
                and Tulare County Parks Department to
                discuss a joint powers agreement for the
                sharing of park and recreation facilities.
        5. Farmersville       should    utilize,    where
           appropriate, landscape and lighting districts
           to maintain parkways, landscaped medians
           and neighborhood parks.
           a.   Where appropriate, the City shall
                require proposed subdivisions to

                 establish landscape and lighting districts
                 to maintain open space areas.
        8.  Develop an "adopt          a   park"   program
            throughout the City.
            a.   The City should implement an "adopt a
                 park" program in which private citizens
                 or organizations (ie; service clubs,
                 churches, scouting groups, etc.) help
                 with the maintenance of open space,
                 parks, and recreation facilities. The
                 City should contact other communities
                 who are succesfully operating similar
                 programs.
        9.  Encourage donations of land and/or money
            towards the acquisition, development or
            maintenance of parks and recreational
            facilities.
            a.   The City shall seek out donations of
                 land or money towards park facilities.
                 The City may announce these efforts in
                 recreation schedules, telephone book
                 schedules, plaques or notices at existing
                 parks, etc.
        10. Coordinate efforts to acquire and develop
            park and recreational facilities with the
            Farmersville Unified School District to
            ensure that there is no unnecessary
            duplication of facilities or programs.
            a.   The City of Farmersville shall
                 coordinate     the      development     of
                 recreation     facilities     with     the
                 Farmersville Unified School District.

ISSUE FOUR:          Urban Boundaries and Farmland
Protection
The City of Farmersville and its surroundings have locally
significant natural resources that must be preserved.                       Urban Boundaries and
Chief among these natural resources are the surrounding
agricultural lands. As the city grows, increased pressure
to develop these areas can result in conflicts, which may
                                                                 4          Farmland Protection
lead to the permanent loss of these resources. The City
will adopt policies so that these precious resources can be
conserved.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   Establish policies to reduce the impact of
     urbanization on agricultural lands, while allowing
     the City to grow.
     1.  Preserve and protect agricultural lands as a
         means for providing open space and for the
         managed production of resources.
         a.   The City shall strive to ensure that new
              development is designed in a manner that
              uses land efficiently and reduces the need to
              expand the urban area outward onto prime
              agricultural lands.
         b.   The Planning Department shall conduct an
              annual review of cancelled Williamson Act
              contracts and development proposals on
              agricultural land within the City Limits and
              Sphere of Influence.
     2.  Develop buffers and transition areas between
         urban uses and agricultural land to reduce
         incompatibility issues that are associated with
         cultivation, pest control and harvesting of crops.
         a.   Adoption of the Land Use Element and
              Land Use map will provide the
              implementation of this policy.
         b.   Work with the Cities of Visalia, Exeter and
              Tulare County to establish an agricultural
              preservation area to keep Farmersville,

                                                                          Parks and Recreation Element
            Visalia, and Exeter from physically growing
            together.
    4.  Promote infilling and moderately increase
        overall residential densities in the City of
        Farmersville to reduce the rate of urbanization of
        surrounding agricultural lands.
        a.  Strive to create an overall community-wide
            residential density of five units per acre. All
            unit types (single and multi-family
            residential) shall be counted in calculating
            community-wide density.
    5.  Establish and maintain "hard edges" around
        Farmersville that define where urbanization stops
        and agricultural open space begins.
        a.  In order to discourage sprawl and leapfrog
            development,       require    the      Planning
            Commission and City Council to make a
            finding that new development is within 1/8
            mile of existing or approved development
            when       approving       new       residential,
            commercial, industrial or quasi-public
            construction projects.
        b.  Where appropriate, the City will discourage
            zoning requests in the Sphere of Influence
            and surrounding County areas to permit
            further parcelization for development of
            large lot residential purposes ie; ranchettes.

ISSUE FIVE: Air and Water Quality
The City of Farmersville exceeds two important air
pollution standards - ozone and particulate matter. As
                                                                           Air and Water
growth occurs, more smog is produced by fossil fuel
burning and emissions from factories. The City must
encourage development that will minimize vehicular
                                                                5          Quality
emissions by providing an adequate circulation system.
The City of Farmersville obtains its water supply from a
vast aquifer underlying the San Joaquin Valley. The
quantity and quality of water appears to be adequate,
however, in the future, Farmersville must provide for
long-range community water needs and protect water
quality and quantity. It must also maximize the efficient
use and conservation of the community's water resources.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.  Protect air and water quality from negative
    impacts.
    Air Quality
    1.   Participate in the regional planning efforts to
         meet air quality goals by working to improve air
         quality for the entire planning area.
         a.   The Planning Department will send
              proposed development plans to the San
              Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution
              Control District for review of potential air
              pollution impacts.
    2.   Consider traffic flow in the planning of
         residential,     commercial      and    industrial
         developments.
         a.   The Planning and Engineering departments
              will review all new projects to ensure that
              efficient traffic flow maintained, thereby
              minimizing vehicle-related air emissions.
    3.    Maintain adequate roadway levels of service
         (LOS) to avoid congestion which contributes to
         the air pollution problem.

        a.   The Planning and Engineering departments
             will review all proposed development
             projects to ensure that roadway service
             levels do not fall below Level C for arterials,
             collectors and intersections. The City will
             utilize gas tax and transportation funds to
             maintain these transportation standards.
    4.  Develop an organized and efficient circulation
        system to reduce vehicle trips in the planning
        area, idling time, intersection delays, and other
        emissions-producing activities.
        a.   The Circulation Element establishes policies
             that will encourage increased connectivity in
             the City’s street patterns.
    5.  The City shall encourage residents to use
        alternative modes of transportation.
        a.   The City will seek funds to implement the
             bike path system, consistent with the
             Circulation Element map.
    Water Quality
    1.  Promote a community awareness program that
        will educate the community in water-saving
        methodologies at the home and the work place.
        a.   The Public Works department will provide
             the community with information brochures
             containing water-saving techniques. Further
             the department should prepare a Water
             Conservation Ordinance for adoption by the
             City Council.
    2. Promote the use of native and drought-tolerant
        new landscaping in existing and future parks.
        a.   The       City's     to-be-prepared     Water
             Conservation Ordinance shall stress the use
             of native and drought-tolerant species.
    3.  Allow for adequate groundwater recharge by
        developing storm ponding and retention basins
        where feasible. In some areas these ponds or
                                                         4-23

ISSUE SIX: Energy Conservation
Energy conservation is a topic of increasing importance.
The State of California has experienced recent power
                                                                            Energy
shortages that have threatened to cripple the local
economy. It is becoming increasingly difficult to tap new
sources of energy, from a fiscal, political and
                                                                 6          Conservation
environmental perspective. At the same time, the state
continues to grow at a rapid pace.
Local governments can take a number of actions to ensure
that new (and existing) development is as energy-efficient
as possible. Strategies for Farmersville are outlined
below.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   Consider energy conservation in the planning and
     design of new and existing development in
     Farmersville.
     1.  Development in the planning area shall be
         designed in a fashion that maximizes energy
         efficiency.
         a.   Street standards shall be revised to increase
              shading along all future streets. Residential
              street widths for future streets shall be
              narrowed, thereby reducing the amount of
              pavement area - reducing heat buildup.
              Shade trees will also help to reduce heat
              buildup. For more information, see the
              Circulation Element.
         b.   The City shall work with subdividers to
              design subdivisions so that a majority of
              dwelling units are properly oriented with
              respect to the sun, to take advantage of
              passive solar heating and cooling
              opportunities.
         c.   The City shall work with developers to
              maximize the planting of deciduous shade
              trees around buildings and in paved areas.

ISSUE SEVEN: Biotic Resources
Conservation of biotic resources generally refers to the
protection of plant and animal species that have been
                                                                             Biotic
determined to be rare, threatened or endgangered. A
biotic survey prepared for the General Plan did not
indicate the presence of any listed species in the planning
                                                                  7          Resources
area. The survey did note several locations in the
planning area that could serve as habitat for species of
concern, particularly the riparian habitat along Deep
Creek along the east side of the community. While
development proposed under the General Plan is not
expected to have a significant impact on biotic resources,
the community should do what it can to minimize these
impacts.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   Minimize the impact of new development on biotic
     resources in the planning area.
     1.  Explore establishing the banks of             local
         waterways as an open space resource.
         a.   The Planning Department shall conduct an
              analysis of this proposal and prepare a plan
              of action.
     2.  The City shall review any attempts to line or
         pipe local waterways. This policy recognizes the
         value of local waterways as historical sources of
         groundwater recharge and wildlife habitat.
         a.   The City shall remain vigilant in monitoring
              acitivities of local canal and irrigation
              districts and shall forward comments
              regarding lining or piping canals.
     3.  Protect areas that may serve as habitat from
         impacts of development.
         a.   Where warranted, the City Planner shall
              require a biotic assessment for projects that
              may impact habitat areas.

    4.  Investigate establishment of a recreational trail
        along Deep Creek between Farmersville and the
        Kaweah Oaks Preserve.
        a.  The City should coordinate with Sierra Los
            Tulares Land Trust, Tulare County and
            intervening property owners to explore this
            concept.

ISSUE EIGHT: Historic/Cultural Resources
Although the City of Farmersville does not have any
structures designated as "historic" by the Tulare County
                                                                              Historic/Cultural
Historical Society, there are some architecturally significant
structures that enhance Farmersville's identity. Several
buildings along Farmersville Boulevard and Visalia Road,
                                                                   8          Resources
in the central area display an interesting architectural
character that create a sense of place. Spanish and western
style architecture is used prominently, helping to give the
community identity.
Conservation of cultural resources generally refers to the
protection of historic and pre-historic artifacts. In the arena
of city planning, this often pertains to buried objects (such
as human remains, arrowheads, tools, and other objects left
behind by previous cultures. State law requires the
protection of these objects. The City is responsible for
implementing these preservation laws.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.   Take actions to promote Farmersville’s historic
     identity and protect cultural resources.
     1. Work with developers and architects in creating new
         buildings and renovating old buildings in a manner
         that is sensitive to the architectural character of
         Farmersville and the San Joaquin Valley.
         a.   The City shall adopt design guidelines that
              promote good architectural design that
              reenforces Farmersville’s identity and sense of
              place.
     2.  Protect cultural resources that may be impacted by
         new development.
         a.   The Planning Department may require
              preparation of a cultural resources analysis
              where warranted. Areas along waterways are
              of particular concern. When cultural resources
              are uncovered during construction projects, all
              work in the vicinity of the “find” must be
              stopped and a qualified cultural resources
              expert consulted to determine appropriate
              protective measures.

What is the Housing Element?
The Housing Element is one of seven General Plan Elements mandated by the State of
California. The Element is intended to guide Farmersville's residential development
activity in a manner consistent with the community's economic, environmental and social
values while attempting to achieve the State's goal of providing housing opportunities for
all Californians.
The Housing Element serves as Farmersville's official response to the finding by the State
Legislature that:
        "the availability of housing is of vital statewide importance,
        and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living
        environment for every Californian, including farmworkers, is a
        priority of the highest order."
By identifying local housing needs, adopting appropriate goals and policies, and
providing local legislation and programs to meet these needs, local government will be
effective in dealing with the housing needs of its residents.
What is the Authority for Preparation and Administration of the Housing Element?
Section 65580 of the California Government Code contains directives for preparation of
local housing elements. In formulating this section of the Government Code, the
Legislature found and declared the following:
(a)     The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early
        attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every
        California family is a priority of the highest order.
(b)     The early attainment of this goal requires the cooperative participation of
        government and the private sector in an effort to expand housing opportunities
        and accommodate the housing needs of Californians of all economic levels.

                                                         Chapter 1: Introduction
(c)     The provision of housing affordable to low- and moderate- income households
        requires the cooperation of all levels of government.
(d)     Local and state governments have a responsibility to use their vested powers to
        facilitate the improvement and development of housing to make adequate
        provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community.
(e)     The California Legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility, each
        local government also has the responsibility to consider economic, environmental,
        and fiscal factors and community goals set forth in the general plan and to
        cooperate with other local governments and the state in addressing regional
        housing needs.
Failure to prepare and adopt a housing element that is substantially in compliance with
the State's guidelines for the contents of a housing element can potentially place a city in
a legally precarious position (Section 50459 of the Health and Safety Code).
Buena Vista Gardens Apartments v. City of San Diego Planning Department (1985) 175
Cal. App.3d 289, provided a court interpretation that the City of San Diego had not met
the statutory requirements contained in Section 50459 of the Health and Safety Code.
In the case of the Committee for Responsible Planning v. City of Indian Wells (1989) 209
Cal.App.3d 1005, the court ruled that Indian Wells' housing element failed the inter-
element consistency finding and it did not contain the required information specified by
Section 50459 of the Health and Safety Code. The ominous result of this ruling is that
the court imposed a moratorium, which prevented the City from issuing building permits
and approving planning permits - subdivisions, conditional use permits, zone
amendments and variances.
State planning law requires all local jurisdictions to adopt and maintain a General Plan
incorporating seven required elements. The law also requires consistency between these
general plan elements. For example, if the Farmersville Housing Element includes a
policy stating that the City provide adequate sites for a range of housing types, including
multi-family residential uses, then the Land Use Element would have to be consistent
with this policy by designating sufficient land area for this type of development.
Another example of inter-element consistency involves the use of population projections,
which is the basis for future land needs for housing units and other urban uses. The Land
Use and Housing Elements should use the same population projections in their needs
analysis to avoid inter-element inconsistencies.

What Are the Contents of the Housing Element?
Government Code Sections 65583 and 65588 primarily explain the required components
of a housing element. Section 65583 states that the housing element shall contain an
identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of
goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled programs for the
preservation, improvement, and development of housing.
The housing element shall also identify adequate sites for housing, including rental
housing, factory-built housing, mobilehomes, homeless and emergency shelters, among
others, and shall make adequate provisions for the existing and projected needs of all
economic segments of the community. In general, the element shall contain all of the
following:
1.      An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints
        relevant to the meeting of these needs.
2.      A statement of the community's goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative
        to the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing.
3.      A program that sets forth an eight year schedule of actions the local government is
        undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the
        goals and objectives of the housing element through the administration of land use
        and development controls, provision of regulatory concessions and incentives,
        and the utilization of appropriate federal and state financing and subsidy programs
        when available.
Section 65588 of the Government Code requires the housing element to review and
evaluate the results and effectiveness of the previous housing element. This evaluation
ensures that the element being prepared is more effective and relevant. This section
requires the element to evaluate the following:
1.      Review the effectiveness of the previous element's goals, objectives, policies, and
        programs.
2.      Compare what was projected or planned in the previous element to what was
        actually achieved.
3.      Based on the above analysis, describe how the goals, objectives, policies and
        programs in the updated element are going to be adjusted to incorporate what has
        been learned from the results of the previous element.

                                                         Chapter 1: Introduction
To incorporate the above requirements, this Element is organized into eight chapters.
•   Chapter 1 defines the intent of the housing element and the relationship of the
    element with State directives and other general plan elements.
•   Chapter 2 reviews the effectiveness of the 2009 Housing Element. It reviews and
    quantifies achievements of the previous element and addresses how the proposed
    element might be written so that it is more effective.
•   Chapters 3 and 4 provide current population, economic, and housing information.
•   Chapter 5 establishes current and future housing needs for Farmersville.
•   Chapter 6 provides an inventory of available lands and public utilities that are
    available to meet housing needs.
•   Chapter 7 provides a discussion of governmental and non-governmental constraints
    as they impact the ability to provide housing.
•   Chapter 8 sets forth goals and policies and action plans of the Housing Element.
    This chapter also summarizes quantitative goals of the Housing Element
What is the Planning Area?
Cities in Tulare County utilize a unique system of planning boundaries. Four geographic
areas are significant for purposes of this element (see Map 1-1). These include:
-       lands within Farmersville city limits
-       lands within Farmersville’s Urban Development Boundary
-       land within Farmersville’s Sphere of Influence
-       lands within Farmersville’s Urban Area Boundary
Development of lands within Farmersville’s city limits is controlled by the City through
its Land Use Element and zoning map. New development must be designed and built to
standards contained in the city’s municipal code, including the zoning ordinance,
subdivision ordinance and improvements standards manual. It is within this area where
Farmersville's short-term housing needs will be provided. The city limits boundary
currently contains about 1,262 acres.
The Urban Development Boundary (UDB) is a line surrounding the City established to
provide future growth and development areas. Essentially this line represents a “20-year
growth boundary”. The establishment of this line was reinforced through adoption of the
                                             1-4

2025 General Plan. The UDB currently contains approximately 1,285 acres.
The Sphere of Influence (SOI) marks lands that can potentially annexed to the city.
Annexation of land requires approval by the City but also by the Tulare County Local
Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO). LAFCo policies require that the City
demonstrate that it can extend city services (such as water and sewer) into the area being
annexed. Currently the SOI contains approximately 2,149 acres
Finally, the Urban Area Boundary (UAB) is considered to be a “comment line” The line
typically lays furthest outside the city limits. Lands in this area are directly under control
of Tulare County but are considered to have an “effect” on the City. Any projects
proposed in this area must be referred to the city for review and comment. The current
UAB contains approximately 2,509 acres. The UAB and SOI are mostly coterminous
around much of Farmersville – exceptions occur along the north, northwest, and
southwest areas, where the UAB takes in a larger area than the SOI.
The County tends to maintain agricultural land use and zoning designations on land
outside Farmersville city limits (within the Urban Area Boundary). This has the effect of
facilitating future urban development (such as housing) and also preventing the
establishment of uses that could have a negative impact on the community
What is the Planning Period?
The time frame for the goals and policies, action plans and implementation strategies
contained in the Farmersville Housing Element is approximately eight years: January 1,
2016 to December 31, 2023.
What About Public Participation?
The City has conducted a number of workshops as part of preparation of the Housing
Element. Five workshops open to the public were conducted with the Planning
Commission in 2015, including in April, July, August, November 2015 and January
2016. Notice of these workshops was posted in English and Spanish at City Hall, the
Post Office and Library, as well as on the City’s website.
A community-wide workshop was conducted, on January 20, 2016. A copy of the city’s
flyer for this workshop is attached to the Housing Element as Appendix “A”. Translation
for Spanish language speakers was available at the workshop. Some ideas and concerns
expressed at these workshops are important parts of the City’s housing programs,
including the removal of substandard units and also whether the City prohibits small
dwellings (e.g. “tiny houses”). Other concerns raised included maintenance of multi
family complexes and how they can be designed to better “fit” into their neighborhoods.

                                                         Chapter 1: Introduction
Some of the action plans in the Housing Element resulted from input at the workshops,
including:
-        Creation of a new single family residential zone (Action Plan C-4).
-        Removal of substandard units (Action Plan D-3).
-        Weatherization program (Action Plan F-2).
In order to solicit additional community input copies of the Housing Element were made
available at various locations, including City Hall, Farmersville Library, Farmersville
Community Center and the Farmersville Senior Center. The document was also made
available on the City’s website.
The City also reached out to local housing groups for input and information. The City
worked with Self Help Enterprise to obtain information on their housing programs and
preferences for future programs. The City also coordinated with Tulare County Housing
Authority on information on the Section 8 program as well as operations at their large
facility (Linnel Farm Labor Center) immediately west of the City.
Public hearings for adoption of the Housing Element will be advertised in both Spanish
and English, and notice will be sent to local and regional groups and agencies known to
be interested in housing issues in Farmersville.
How is the Housing Element Consistent with the General Plan?
The Housing Element is consistent with the General Plan because:
1.       Both documents use the same population and residential land-demand projections.
2.       There are policies and actions that are common to both elements, including
         promoting mixed-use development, and the maintenance of improvement of
         existing housing units, among others.
Additional analysis of the Housing Element’s consistency with remaining General Plan
elements is provided in Chapter 7.

2 • EVALUATION OF THE 2009
             HOUSING ELEMENT
A key requirement is that the Housing Element review the results of the previous
Housing Element - to evaluate the effectiveness of its goals, objectives, policies and
action programs. Farmersville’s previous Housing Element spanned the years August 1,
2009 to August 1, 2014. The state subsequently allowed the planning period to be
extended through December 31, 2015. Many of the goals, objectives, policies and
programs contained in the 2016 Housing Element will be based on what was learned
from the review of the 2009 Housing Element.
The 2009 Housing Element established a number of actions and programs designed to
meet Farmersville’s housing needs. The City now has an opportunity to determine if
these actions and programs were successful.
Action plans in the 2009 Housing Element were contained in Chapter 8 of that document.
A typical action plan was as follows:
        Increased Density in RM-2.5 zone. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to
        specify an increased density for the RM-2.5 (High Density Multi-Family
        Residential (one unit per 2,500 square feet)) zone district. Specifically, the
        density standard shall be increased to allow a “realistic” density of at least 20
        dwelling units per acre. The current maximum density standard is one dwelling
        unit per 2,500 square feet of lot area. This has yielded a maximum of about 17.4
        units per acre.
                 Year: Third quarter, 2010
                 Responsible Entities: City of Farmersville
                 Funding: General Fund
To determine the results of the 2009 Housing Element, interviews were conducted with
City officials, development companies and housing agencies such as the Tulare County
Housing Authority among others. Unfortunately, in some cases information from these
sources was limited or not available.
It should be noted that some of the action plan programs were not directly the
responsibility of the City of Farmersville. In some cases financing from federal programs

is specified for development of housing by private entities. Tulare County Housing
Authority, which operates rental units and provides rental assistance for target households
also plays an important role in the City's housing process. The City's responsibility often
rests in assisting other agencies whenever possible.
The 2009 Housing Element established housing production goals for the years 2009 -
2014 by income level and housing type. The State of California has established
household income categories for all counties as follows:
Income Category          Household Income limits
“Extremely Low”        Earning less than 30 percent of the County median income
“Very Low”             Earning between 30 and 50 percent of the County median income
“Low”                  Earning between 50 and 80 percent of County median income
“Moderate”             Earning between 80 and 120 percent of County median income
“Above-Moderate”       Earning above 120 percent of County median income
To arrive at actual income levels, the State determines the median income for all counties
in California on an annual basis. Housing deemed "affordable" is generally considered to
be housing that does not exceed 30% of the income of a household. As an example, for a
household earning $50,000 per year, affordable housing should cost no more than
$15,000 per year or $1,250 per month.
The 2009 Housing Element established the following housing production goals for
income groups and housing types:
                                          Table 2-1

                            Extremely Low          45 units
                            Very Low               37 units
                            Other Low              40 units
                            Moderate               89 units
                            Above-Moderate         306 units
                            TOTAL                  518 units
During the planning period, the City witnessed the following residential development
activity:

TOTAL                  518 units            49 units
The results illustrated in the foregoing tables shows an extreme contraction in the
production of new housing in Farmersville. This is consistent with observations in other
area cities and even nationwide, during the planning period.
The main reason for the shortfall was the economic downtown associated with the
worldwide recession that began in 2005. This recession has been deemed the worst since
World War II, and followed a “housing bubble” in the early part of the first decade of the
2000’s which saw an unprecedented amount of housing development in California and
the nation.
Ultimately this housing bubble was unsustainable and triggered a severe recession that
lasts through the present time. As the recession wore on numerous households found
themselves in unsustainable financial position due to “upside down” mortgages – where
the amount owed on the mortgage exceeds the value of the home. The Great Recession
led to a significant increase in unemployment, with the national unemployment rate
surpassing 10 percent, with Farmersville approaching a rate of nearly 20 percent.
Rehabilitation Goals
The Housing Element also established goals for housing rehabilitation. Specifically the
Element established a goal for the rehabilitation of 60 lower income units during the
planning period of the 2009-2014 Housing Element. Records indicate that the City has
facilitated the rehab of 32 units during this time frame.

3 • C OMMUNITY P ROFILE
This chapter provides a snapshot of socio-economic conditions in Farmersville.
Understanding these conditions allows City policy makers and other agencies and
organizations to properly fashion housing programs that will mirror the needs of residents
of Farmersville.
Location
Farmersville lies on the eastern side of the central San Joaquin Valley, in Tulare County.
The City is about ten miles southeast of Visalia, the County seat, and largest City in the
County. Other nearby cities are Exeter, about five miles east, and Lindsay, about fifteen
miles southeast. The City is immediately south of State Highway 198, a major east-west
highway in Central California. Highway 198 connects Farmersville to Visalia and State
Highway 99 to the west, and to Three Rivers and Sequoia National Park in the Sierra
Nevada Mountains, to the east (see Map 3-1).
For many years, Farmersville has functioned as a residence place for persons employed in
the agricultural industry of central California. According to the 2010 U.S. Census,
approximately 15 percent of residents were employed in agriculture in 2010 – down from
18 percent in the year 2000. This may indicate that Farmersville’s economy is gradually
becoming more diversified.
Other leading employment sectors in Farmersville include:
-       “Retail trade” (15%)
-       “Education/Health/Social Services” (15%)
-       “Manufacturing” (9%)
-       “Food/recreation/accommodations” (9%)
Particularly reflecting location near Visalia, it is believed that Farmersville’s economic
composition has been changing in recent years. Over time the City has begun
functioning as a more affordable housing alternative for residents who may work in
Visalia (and other area cities) but choose to live in Farmersville.
Unemployment rates in Farmersville and Tulare County have historically been higher
than California as a whole. This typically reflects the nature of the agricultural-based
economy of the area. Many agricultural jobs are seasonal in nature. Unemployment rates

tend to fluctuate during the year, with the highest rates generally occurring during non-
harvest periods - November through April.
Population
Farmersville’s population has shown a steady increase during the last 30 years. Chart 3-1
shows population growth since 1970. The City’s population has increased over 216%
since 1970. Information provided by the State of California, Department of Finance
indicates that the population has increased to over 10,900 persons in 2015. Between the
year 2000 and 2010, the City’s population has increased by an average of 1.9 percent per
year. Since 2010 the growth rate has slowed to 0.8% per year.

Population projections for Farmersville have been established in the 2025 Farmersville
General Plan and are shown in Chart 3-2. By the year 2010 the estimates had forecast a
“low” population of about 11,628 and a “high” population of 12,206 persons. By the
year 2025, the estimates forecast a low population estimate of 17,854 and a high
population of 20,155 persons. With the year 2015 population at 10,908, it is apparent that
the projections in the General Plan were more robust than Farmersville’s actual growth.

Income
The median household income Farmersville in 2010 (the most recent year for which data
was available) was $32,384 – up from $27,782 in 2000. For comparative purposes,
Tulare County’s median household income in 2010 was $42,708. Income levels for
Farmersville and several other area communities (and Tulare County as a whole) are
shown in Chart 3-3.

Retail Sales
Taxable sales are an indicator of a city’s economic vitality. A common measure is per-
capita taxable sales. This is the amount of taxable sales generated by a City, divided by
its population. A city with a high per-capita taxable sales figure generally reflects a
community with numerous retail and/or durable goods commercial establishments or
citizens with higher purchasing power.
Chart 3-4 shows per-capita taxable sales for Farmersville and other area cities for the year
2013 (the most recent year for which data are available). The table shows that
Farmersville’s per-capita taxable sales figure is among the lowest of Tulare County’s
cities. For Farmersville this indicates a serious fiscal condition, especially given the fact
that most cities are increasingly reliant on sales tax revenues as a major portion of their
general funds. To combat this situation the City is pursuing retail commercial
development opportunities and is working closely with the Tulare County Economic
Development Corporation (EDC).

Employment
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Farmersville’s employment picture is becoming
increasingly diversified with retail, education and health care, and agricultural
occupations dominating the list (see Chart 3-5). This reflects a positive development
from past decades when agricultural jobs were the number one employer in the
community - not surprising given the City’s location in the midst of one of the world’s
most productive agricultural regions.
In the future, Farmersville will need to further diversify its employment base so that its
citizens are not so restricted to one type of income. Agricultural employment can be

overseas imports, price supports and federal and state agricultural policies.

Age
The median age of residents in Farmersville according to the 2010 Census was 26.2 years
– up from 24.3 years in 2000. It is expected that the median age has not changed
significantly since 2010. The next verification will occur with the 2020 Census.
Knowledge of age of the local population is important, particularly with respect to
women of children-bearing ages (typically 16 to 34). If a community has a significant
component within that age range, then a population “boom” might be expected –
resulting in an increased demand for housing.
Information displayed in Chart 3-6 shows that Farmersville has a slight bulge in the 15 to
19 year old group. This may indicate a need for more housing geared toward new
families in the near future.

Ethnicity
Farmersville's population is dominated by the Hispanic and white groups. Chart 3-7
shows the ethnic breakdown of the community's population, with data from the past three
Census counts (1990, 2000 and 2010).
Since 1990 the percentage of the city’s Hispanic population has grown at a steady rate,
increasing to 84 percent in 2010. Correspondingly the white population has dropped at a
similar rate, to 14% in 2010. Other ethnic groups accounted for less than three percent of
Farmersville’s population in the year 2010.

This chapter provides an overview and evaluation of Farmersville’s housing stock.
Analysis of past housing trends provides a basis for determining the future housing needs
of the City.
Housing Units
A review of census and California Department of Finance data indicates that
Farmersville’s housing stock grew by 612 units during the period 2000-2015. Data
shown in Chart 4-1 reveals that the number of dwelling units in Farmersville increased
from 2,162 in the year 2000 to 2,774 in 2015 - an average annual increase of about 41
units. Since 2010 growth has slowed dramatically as the City has added just 48 units –
only about 10 dwellings per year.

Housing Types
An examination of census data provides insight into the changing demand for different
types of dwelling units within the City. The three basic types of housing units for which
data are presented are:
1.    single-family units;
2.    multiple-family units, which can range from duplexes to large apartment
      developments containing many units; and
3.    mobile homes located in mobile home parks and on individual lots.
The proportion of housing unit type in Farmersville has remained nearly constant since
the year 2000. In 2000 single family homes made up about 84% of the City’s housing
stock. The figure dipped slightly by 2010 but had increased back to 84% by 2015.
Meanwhile, multi-family units have remained constant at about 13 percent of the housing
stock. Mobile homes have remained a minor part of the City’s housing picture, at about
three percent of the total number of housing units in Farmersville, since the year 2000.

Household Size
In 2000, the average number of persons per household unit in Farmersville was 4.04; this
number had risen to 4.1 in 2010 and is 4.13 in 2015 - the highest among the County’s
eight incorporated cities, and is significantly higher than the average of 3.3 for all
incorporated cities in Tulare County, as well as the figure of 3.4 persons per dwelling for
the County as a whole. Chart 4-3 shows how Farmersville compares to neighboring
cities.
The relatively high number of persons per unit household signifies an overcrowding
problem not uncommon to communities that are dominated by an agricultural economy.
This situation points to a need to increase the supply of housing in the community,
particularly affordable housing.

Household Tenure
Tenure refers to whether a dwelling is owner-occupied or renter-occupied. Home
ownership as a percent of total housing units has dropped from 68 percent in 2000 to 63
percent in the year 2010. Correspondingly, the number of renter-occupied units has
increased from 32% in 2000 to 37% in 2010. The 2020 Census will show whether this
trend is continuing. Chart 4-4 shows the trend in tenure in Farmersville since 1980.

Vacancy Rates
The vacancy rate is a measure of the general availability of housing. It also indicates
how well the type of units available meet the current housing market demand. A low
vacancy rate suggests that families may have difficulty finding housing within their price
range; a high vacancy rate may indicate either the existence of deficient units undesirable
for occupancy, or an oversupply of housing units.
In the year 2010, the vacancy rate in Farmersville was 0.9% for owner-occupied units,
and 5.0% for renter-occupied units. According to the California Department of Finance,
the overall vacancy rate for all dwellings in Farmersville was 4.8% in 2015. This is
lower than the rate of 6.0% for all cities in Tulare County in 2015. The vacancy rate for
the County as a whole (cities and unincorporated areas) was 7.7 percent. Vacancy rates
are displayed in Chart 4-5. Farmersville’s rate points to a need to increase the supply of
housing.
Vacancy rates can vary dramatically over short periods of time, particularly when new
developments come on the market. For small agricultural communities like Farmersville,
seasonal variations related to the movement of farmworkers following the harvest can
also affect vacancy rates.

This chapter reviews existing and future housing needs in Farmersville, including the
needs of special groups such as:
-       Extremely low income families
-       Elderly
-       Disabled residents
-       Farmworkers
-       Homeless
-       Female-headed households

-       Overpayment
-       Housing conditions
-       Poverty and unemployment
-       Future housing demand
Overview
In comparison to many other areas of California, land and development costs are still
relatively low in Farmersville in relationship to the ability of households to afford
housing. Yet, there are still a number of households in the community that have
difficulty obtaining affordable, safe and decent housing.
Housing need is a complex issue, consisting of at least three major components:
-       housing affordability,
-       housing quality, and
-       housing quantity
In addition, certain segments of the population have traditionally experienced difficulty in
obtaining adequate housing, including the elderly, the handicapped, female heads of
household, the large family, homeless, extremely low income households, and farm
workers. Housing element law requires specific analysis and planning for these special
groups.

Housing Affordability
State housing policy recognizes that cooperative participation of the private and public
sectors is necessary to expand housing opportunities to all economic segments of the
community. A primary State goal is the provision of a decent home in a satisfying
environment that is affordable. The private sector generally responds to the majority of
the community's housing needs through the
production of “market-rate” housing – by
definition, residential dwellings that are
affordable to households making 120 percent

        compete with less advantaged households for rental housing. The expected
        outcome is lower vacancy rates for apartment units and higher rents. Fortunately
        in Farmersville a number of new single- and multi-family homes have been
        developed in recent years. This has opened the market for homebuyers, and
        reduced pressure on available multi family units.
-       Overpayment: The cost of housing eventually causes fixed-income, elderly and
        lower income families to use a disproportionate percentage of their income (over
        30 percent of their adjusted gross income) for housing. This causes a series of
        other financial challenges often resulting in a deteriorating housing stock because
        the costs of maintenance must be sacrificed for more immediate expenses (e.g.,
        food, clothing, medical care and utilities). Farmersville's efforts in facilitating the
        construction of of new housing, using state grants, tax credits, and redevelopment
        funds (before its discontinuation), has helped to mitigate this potential housing
        problem. Even persons who are agricultural field workers have affordable
        housing opportunities in Farmersville through public housing units operated by
        the Tulare County Housing Authority, as well as the use of Section 8 vouchers
        provided by the Authority.
-       Overcrowding: As housing prices climb, lower income households must be
        satisfied with less house for the available money. This can result in
        overcrowding, which places a strain on municipal infrastructure. Further, it does
        not provide a satisfying living environment, and eventually can cause conditions
        that contribute to both deterioration of the housing stock and neighborhoods.
        Farmersville has attempted to mitigate this problem through its Redevelopment
        Agency's low income housing funds and the City's facilitation of new residential
        development.
Median Home Prices
The 2010 U.S. Census provided the following information on median home values:
Farmersville: $105,000
Tulare County: $163,100
California: $366,400
Since the year 2000, median home prices have experienced a period of extreme volatility.
The median home price in Farmersville peaked in the third quarter of 2006 at about
$190,000. Since then median housing values have plummeted to about $105,000 by
2010. It is important to recognize that this is the median value for all houses listed for
sale in Farmersville. The price for new homes is much higher – in the range of $124,000
to $225,000 in recent years.

Rents
According to the 2010 Census, median rents in Farmersville were $728, up from a
median rent of $472 in 2000. This compared with median rents of $821 for Tulare
County and $1,224 in California in 2010.

         were overpaying for shelter
-        74 percent of renter-occupied households
         were overpaying for shelter
For lower income households the situation is more bleak. Over 68% of extremely low
income owner-occupied households were overpaying for shelter, while nearly 93% of
renter occupied households were overpaying in the same income category.
Given the increase in median home prices and median rents observed since 2010
(coupled with stangnant incomes) it is expected that these figures have only gotten worse.
The City will need to review the 2020 Census data when it becomes available and update
this information.

The housing affordability problem has been addressed through various means - by the
City and its Redevelopment Agency (prior to the termination of redevelopment by the
State), through its first-time home-buyer’s program, the private sector through a variety
of means, including use of State tax credit funds, and by the Tulare County Housing
Authority, which owns and operates the 191-unit Linnel Farm Labor Center immediately
to the west of Farmersville. The Authority also assists families in renting private
dwellings through its Section 8 voucher program. Currently, the Authority has 55
Section 8 units in Farmersville. A Section 8 certificate allows a qualified lower income
family to receive rental assistance from the Housing Authority.
In addition, prior to its termination, the City’s Redevelopment Agency had been actively
assisting housing projects through its Low-Moderate Income (LMI) fund. Most recently
the Agency has provided financial assistance for Park Creek Village apartments
($300,000 loan) and Gateway Village apartments ($200,000 loan). Park Creek Village

Village has 64 affordable units on the north side of Visalia Road at Shasta Avenue.
Housing Quality
A housing condition survey was conducted in 2015 to determine the physical condition of
Farmersville's housing stock. In this survey, each dwelling unit was evaluated for its
physical condition and appearance. The housing condition survey was conducted using
the four definitions listed below:
1)      Sound Structure: a well maintained structure in good condition with no or very
        few defects of minor consequence.
2)      Deficient Structure: a structure in relatively good condition, but in need of more
        than a few minor repairs and in general maintenance.
3)      Deteriorated Structure: a structure in need of several minor repairs including
        plumbing and electrical work and roof repairs.
4)      Dilapidated Structure: a structure in need of more than two major repairs and/or
        a high number of minor repairs which makes the rehabilitation of the structure
        economically unfeasible.
The results of the survey are summarized in Chart 5-1.

The survey revealed that housing conditions in Farmersville have stayed roughly the
same since the survey in 2009.
Overcrowding
The Census Bureau defines overcrowded housing units as those having more than one
person per room (excluding kitchens, bathrooms, hallways, etc.).
About 18 percent percent of the housing units in Farmersville were overcrowded in 2010,
according to the Census. This is down from 37% of units in 2000. In terms of tenure,
about 14 percent of owner-occupied units were overcrowded; nearly 24 percent of
renter-occupied units were overcrowded. In Tulare County as a whole, the percentage of
overcrowded units was about 11 percent.
It is also expected that overcrowding worsens during peak harvest times when seasonal
farmworkers are seeking shelter in valley communities.
Overcrowding is typically reflective of one of three conditions:
1.     A family or household is living in too small a dwelling;
2.     A family is required to house extended family members (i.e. grandparents or grown
       children and their families living with parents); or
3.     A family is renting inadequate living space to non-family members (i.e. families
       renting to migrant farm workers).
Whatever the cause of overcrowding, there is a direct link between overcrowding and
housing affordability. Examples of this condition include the following:
-      Homeowners/renters with large families are unable to afford larger dwellings.
-      Older children wishing to leave home who cannot qualify for a home loan or are
       unable to make rental payments.
-      Grandparents on fixed incomes are unable to afford suitable housing or have
       physical handicaps that force them to live with their children.
-      Families with low incomes will permit overcrowding to occur in order to derive
       additional income, or there is an insufficient supply of housing units in the
       community to accommodate the demand.
Overall, renters are more likely to live in overcrowded conditions than homeowners.
This problem is likely related to Farmersville's nature as an agricultural community. Not
surprisingly, some units become overcrowded during peak harvest times.

There are a number of ways to address this problem, including the addition of bedrooms
to existing units, rehabilitation of uninhabitable units and construction of new rental units
and second units.
Poverty and Unemployment
An important measure of the ability to afford decent housing is the poverty level. In
2013 (the most recent year for which data is available), over 33 percent of Farmersville
households had income levels at or below the poverty level. Farmersville compares
favorably with some neighboring cities, but the poverty rate is certainly much higher than
desired. Chart 5-2 displays poverty rates for Farmersville and neighboring communities.

Another measure of prosperity (or lack thereof) is a City’s unemployment rate.
Unemployment rates in communities that are heavily dependent on agriculture can vary
significantly during the year. Chart 5-3 displays Farmersville’s unemployment rate in
June, 2015 along with that of surrounding communities. As the chart shows,
Farmersville’s unemployment rate ranks among the highest of Tulare County cities.

Special Needs Groups
Housing Element Law requires that the housing needs of specified groups be addressed in
the Housing Element, including:
-        the elderly;
-        the disabled;
-        large families;
-        female heads of household;
-        homeless;
-        farm workers; and
-        extremely low-income residents.
It is important to realize that some individuals may fall into multiple categories. For
instance, an elderly person may also be disabled, and may also fall into the “extremely
low income” category. In these instances, the difficulties of finding affordable housing
(and simply coping with the daily challenges of life) are multiplied.
Elderly Persons
The special housing needs of the elderly are an important concern of Farmersville since
they are likely to be on fixed incomes and/or have low incomes. Some elderly are also
disabled. The elderly also have special needs related to housing construction and
location. The elderly often require ramps, handrails and lower cupboards and counters, to
allow greater access and mobility.
In addition, the elderly have special needs based on location. They need to have access to
shopping, medical offices, and public transit. In many instances, the elderly prefer to stay
in their own home rather than relocate to a retirement community, and therefore may
need assistance to make home repairs.
The 2010 Census showed that 761 residents, or 7.2 percent of the total population in
Farmersville were 65 years of age or older. The Census also indicated that almost 25
percent of the households in Farmersville were occupied by one or more persons that
were 65 or older. In terms of tenure, approximately 22 percent of Farmersville’s elderly
households were owner-occupied; 12 percent of renter-occupied households were
elderly. Finally, almost 56 percent of residents over 65 categorized themselves as
disabled.
There are two existing senior housing project in Farmersville – Village Grove
Apartments is located on South Farmersville Boulevard and has 48 units. In 2010 the
Farmersville Senior Apartments were constructed. This complex provides 40 units for
seniors and is also located on South Farmersville Boulevard.

To further meet the needs of senior citizens the City provides funding assistance for
operation of the Farmersville Senior Center – located at 444 N. Gene Avenue. The center
provides meals and social activities for seniors on a daily basis.

Persons with Disabilities
There are many types of disabilities and definitions can be problematic. Local
government utilizes the definition of "handicapped" person as contained in Section
22511.5 of the California Administrative Code for vehicle and building code
enforcement. This definition generally includes those persons with certain levels of
impairment related to vision, cardiovascular health, respiratory systems, and use of
extremities.
Handicapped persons often require specially-designed dwellings to permit free access not
only within the dwelling, but to and from the site. Special modifications to permit free
access are very important. The California Administrative Code Title 24 requirements
mandate that public buildings provide for wheelchair access. Ramp ways, larger door
widths, restroom modifications, and other improvements, enable better access to the
handicapped. Such standards are not mandatory of new single family or multi-family
residential construction that have fewer than ten units.

                                                        Chapter 5: Housing Needs
Like the elderly, the handicapped have special needs based on location. Many desire to
be located near public facilities, and especially near public transportation facilities that
provide service to the handicapped.
According to the 2010 Census, 11.4 percent of Farmersville's population listed some type
of disability. This figure is significant and points to a need for future development to
include handicap-accessible units.
State law now requires Housing Elements to analyze the housing needs of
developmentally disabled individuals. A "developmental disability" is defined as a
disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years old, continues or can be
expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that
individual. This includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism.
While many developmentally disabled persons are able to live and work normally, more
severely disabled individuals require a group living environment with supervision, or an
institutional environment with medical attention and physical therapy.
Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first housing issue for the
developmentally disabled is normally the transition from living with a parent/guardian as
a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
According to data maintained by the California Department of Development Services in
2015 there were 38 developmentally disabled residents in Farmersville less than 18 years
of age and 49 developmentally disabled residents over 18 years, receiving assistance. It
should be noted that these are only those persons receiving assistance from the
Department of Developmental Services. The actual number of developmentally disabled
residents is likely higher.
The most common type of disability was intellectual, followed by epilepsy and/or autism.
The least common was cerebral palsy. Developmentally disabled individuals may also
have more than one disability.
The City has analyzed its codes and policies to determine whether any of these may pose
a constraint to the production of housing for the disabled. In terms of permit
requirements, new single family dwellings require a building permit. The City contracts
with the Tulare County Building Department for building plan review and inspection.
Plan review typically requires one to two weeks, while site inspection generally can occur
the day after a request is made.
Multi-family housing (in the RM-2.5 and RM-4.0 (multi-family residential zones))
requires processing of a Site Plan Review permit, followed by a building permit. Details
of this process are described further in Chapter 7 of this Housing Element.

                                                        Chapter 5: Housing Needs
Consistent with State law, the City permits the establishment of group homes for up to
seven individuals by right. Group homes larger than that are permitted by Conditional
Use Permit.
State law requires cities to disclose whether the term “family” is defined in a fashion that
would constitute a constraint to the development and maintenance of housing for the
disabled, such as group homes. The Zoning Ordinance’s definition of “Family” is:
      “Family means one or more persons occupying a premises and living as a
      single housekeeping unit, as distinguished from a group occupying a boarding
      house, lodging house, or hotel, as defined in this chapter.”
The City does not impose additional zoning, building code, or permitting procedures on
group homes other than those allowed by State law. The City also does not limit
concentrations of group homes.
In general, the City’s codes and policies do not pose significant constraints for the
production of housing for disabled residents. In addition the City has completed
amendments to the zoning ordinance concerning disabled housing that were contained in
the previous Housing Element, including:
-     A reduction in parking requirements for disabled housing projects – recognizing
      that disabled persons are less likely to drive a car.
-     A “Reasonable Accommodations” ordinance to allow reductions in setbacks and
      other zoning standards for housing retrofits and new construction for disabled
      access improvements, such as wheelchair ramps.
Large Family Households
The State of California classifies “large families” as those with five or more members.
Large families are indicative not only of those households that require larger dwellings to
meet their housing needs, but also are reflective of a large number that live below the
poverty level.
Building records indicate that a large number of single family dwellings constructed in
Farmersville have only three bedrooms. These size homes are often inadequate to serve
the needs of large family households. An increase in the number of homes with four or
more bedrooms would help alleviate overcrowding problems experienced by large
families. Most recently the City amended its Density Bonus ordinance to allow
additional density when projects include dwellings designed with four or more bedrooms.
This was the result of an action plan in the previous Housing Element.

                                                         Chapter 5: Housing Needs
The 2010 Census indicated that nearly 55% percent of owner-occupied households fell
into the “large household” category (up from 36% in 2000); about 52 percent of renter-
occupied households were “large households” (up from 38 percent in 2000).
Female Heads of Household
Families with female heads of household are more likely to experience a higher incidence
of poverty than other households. Table 5-2 lists the numbers and percentages of those
female-headed households in which at least one child is present. In 2010, over 23 percent
of Farmersville's households were female-headed. This figure compares with 16% for
Tulare County as a whole.
Since the female's time may be limited to taking care of basic household chores, earning
income, and caring for their children, they may have little time to spend on maintaining
their home. A high poverty level can result in poorly maintained dwellings since income
is more apt to be spent on more immediate needs such as food, clothing, transportation
and medical care.

Homeless and Emergency Housing Needs
The problem of homelessness is a growing concern in many major metropolitan areas in
California; however, it has historically been a relatively minor problem in Farmersville.
Interviews conducted with code enforcement and police officials indicated that there are
very few, if any homeless persons living in Farmersville – likely fewer than 10. These
officials did indicate that from time to time individuals or families that are migrant
farmworkers will have difficulty securing housing. However, in most cases, they will
move into existing living quarters with other persons that are also migrant farmworkers.
These living units that are occupied by more than one individual or family include
privately owned single and multiple residential units, and farm labor housing units.
The Housing Element is required to analyze the needs of families and persons in need of
emergency shelters, and plan for those needs. Emergency shelters are typically geared
toward providing housing for homeless families and individuals.

In order to address the needs of the homeless (and similar populations) Farmersville has
amended its Zoning Ordinance to allow for various types of housing that are geared
toward the homeless and similar groups, including:
-       Emergency Housing
-       Transitional Housing
-       Supportive Housing
-       Single Room Occupancy (SRO) housing
Emergency housing and SRO units are a permitted use in the RM (Multiple Family
Residential zones subject to certain standards covered in Chapter 7 of the Housing
Element. Transitional and Supportive housing units are permitted uses in the R-1 (Single
Family Residential) and RM zones, subject to development standards that apply to other
residential uses in those zones. Since amending the code to allow these uses the City has
received no applications for their development.
Extremely Low Income Households
Extremely low-income is defined as households with incomes less than 30 percent of area
median income. The county area median income in Tulare County is $57,900 for a four
person household. For extremely low-income households, this results in an income of
$24,250 or less for a four person household. Households with extremely low-income
have a variety of housing situations and needs. For example, most families and
individuals receiving public assistance (such as social security insurance (SSI) or
disability insurance) are considered extremely low-income households. Table 5-3
displays information on the needs of extremely low income households in Farmersville.

Existing Needs
According to HUD’s Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy report there were
approximately 445 extremely low-income households residing in Farmersville,
representing almost 21 percent of the total households.
Most extremely low-income households likely experience a high incidence of housing
problems. For example, nearly 88 percent of extremely low-income households faced
housing problems (defined as cost burden greater than 30 percent of income and/or
overcrowding without complete kitchen or plumbing facilities). Further over 23 percent
of extremely low-income households paid more than 50 percent of their income toward
housing costs.
Projected ELI Needs
To calculate the projected housing needs, Farmersville assumed 50 percent of its “very
low-income” housing need is made up of extremely low-income households. As a result,
from the very low-income need of 74 units, Farmersville has a projected need of 37 units
for extremely low-income households through 2023. Many extremely low-income
households will be seeking rental housing and most likely facing overpayment,
overcrowding or substandard housing conditions. Some extremely low-income
households likely include persons with mental or other disabilities and special needs.
Chapter 8 provides programs to address the needs of extremely low-income households
in Farmersville.
Farm Workers
Tulare County is sometimes the nation's number one agricultural county, in terms of the
value of farm products sold. The county's farm-based economy makes each of its cities a
prime location for households that depend on agriculture as a source of income.
In Farmersville, nearly 18 percent of the population was employed in agricultural
occupations, according to the 2010 Census. While significant, this percentage was less
than several other nearby cities.
During the height of the harvest season, it is estimated that the farm worker labor force
may swell by up to 25 percent. These individuals and families usually crowd into existing
housing units in the community. Because they are migrant farm workers, these persons
will also live on a temporary basis in non-traditional living quarters, such as trailers,
garages, storage sheds, and mobile homes. They may also occupy a room with two or
three other individuals.
Some generalizations can be made about the housing situation for farmworkers. Many
farm workers are plagued by low incomes and live in unsanitary, overcrowded housing

conditions, often doubling and tripling up in a single bedroom in a residential dwelling
unit.
Seasonal Farm Workers
Many farm workers are classified as seasonal farm workers. The State of California
defines seasonal employees as individuals are employed less than 150 consecutive days
by the same employer.
Information provided by the USDA indicates that in Tulare County in 2012 there were
2,448 farms employing 25,247 farmworkers more than 150 days per year. Of these, 296
farms were classified as “large” (those with 10 or more farmworkers) employing 8,690
farmworkers. In terms of seasonal farmworkers the USDA data indicates that there were
1,452 farms employing 13,502 seasonal farmworkers in 2012.
Obviously, this group of workers can encounter special problems in finding housing.
Some landlords may not be willing to rent to migrants because of the short length of their
stay, coupled with the fact that farm workers sometimes overcrowd affordable housing
units. As a result of these circumstances, many farm workers often take whatever shelter
is available, even if this means sleeping in garages, sheds, vehicles or trailers.
To meet the need of farm workers, the Tulare County Housing Authority operates 191
units of housing at the Linnel Farm Labor Center, situated on Walnut Avenue and Road
156, immediately west of Farmersville city limits. The Authority also operates 175 units
for farmworkers at the Woodville Farm Labor Center, about 15 miles south of
Farmersville near the unincorporated community of Woodville. The Housing Authority
requires low income farm worker families to pay 30 percent of their adjusted gross
income towards rent. Any additional rent is paid for by the USDA Rural Development
program
New farm worker housing in Farmersville is permitted as a multi-family residential use in
the RM-2.5 and RM-4.0 (Residential Multi-Family) zone districts. The Zoning
Ordinance requires the developer to process plans through the city's Site Plan Review
process – this typically involves a review the Planning Commission (no public hearing is
required). Development standards are those required under the RM-2.5 and RM-4.0
(Multiple Family Residential) zones. Additional information on these standards is
provided in Chapter 7 of the Housing Element.
Employee Housing
Closely related to the topic of Farmworker Housing is the subject of Employee Housing.
Recent amendments to State law require cities to allow employee housing by-right
(without a Conditional Use Permit) in single family zones (for less than six persons in a
dwelling), and in agricultural zones for no more than 12 units or 36 beds. As a result of

action plans in the previous Housing Element, the City has amended its Zoning
Ordinance to allow employee housing “by right” in all residential zones.
SRO Units
SRO (or Single Room Occupancy) units are a type of residential unit similar to
apartments, however as the name implies, they typically consist of a single room. These
units are usually marketed to extremely low income families and individuals. As a result
of action plans in the previous Housing Element, the City has amended its Zoning
Ordinance to allow SRO “by right” in the RM (Multi Family Residential) zones –
subject to development standards that apply to other multi family projects in that zone.
As of this date the City has not received any development applications for SRO units.
Projected Housing Needs
Information presented in Chapters 2 and 3 documented the recent growth in the
population and housing stock in Farmersville. The Regional Housing Needs Assessment
Plan (RHNA), prepared by the Tulare County Association of Governments, calculated
the projected new construction need for the period January 1, 2016, to September 30,
2023. This is displayed in Table 5-4.
This projected housing need takes into account the projected number of households,
vacancy factors, housing market removals, and existing housing units in Farmersville.
Table 5-4 shows that the "above-moderate" income group will constitute the greatest
demand for new housing in the community, during the planning period. However, this
does not diminish the importance of providing housing for the other lower income
groups.

Chapter 6 of this Housing Element will analyze the availability of land and public utilities
to accommodate this housing need. Chapter 7 analyzes development constraints to the
provision of this housing. Finally, Chapter 8 will provide action plans to help facilitate
the production of housing.
Preservation of Assisted Housing
There are several residential projects in Farmersville which were constructed or are
otherwise subsidized using government funding in the form of low-interest loans or other
subsidies. In return for these subsidies, the developers have been required to agree to
restrict rental of some or all of the units to persons of lower income. However, these
rental restrictions are required to remain in effect only during the term required by the
funding agency. After that point, the owner of the project may charge market rate rents -
essentially whatever the market will bear.
There are a number of government programs that can incur rent restrictions of the type
mentioned above. These include:
-     Development loans, such as the Farmer's Home Administration 515 program that
      can be used to develop low income rental projects.
-     Tax credits. Developers of affordable housing projects can apply for tax credits
      through the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee.
-     Section 8 rent certificates. These are certificates issued to qualified low income
      individuals that permit them to receive rent subsidies. Property owners contract
      with Tulare County Housing Authority to provide rental housing to Section 8
      certificate holders.
-     Local density bonus. A municipality may grant an increase above the number of
      units that a developer would normally be permitted to build in exchange for the
      developer agreeing to reserve a certain number of the units for rental to various
      lower income groups or the elderly.
State Housing Element law (Section 65583) requires that cities determine whether any
subsidized rental units are at risk of converting to market rate units within the next ten
years, and if there are any, to formulate a program to preserve the affordability controls
that are currently in place.
In terms of federally and state assisted projects, the City contacted several sources,
including HCD, USDA Rural Development, California Housing Finance Agency
(CHFA), the publication Federally Assisted Multifamily Housing Inventory and Risk
Assessment and Tulare County Housing Authority.
Information received indicates that there is at least one project with units at risk of
conversion in Farmersville during the next ten years. This is the Villa Del Rey
apartments located at 244 S. Ventura Avenue. These units were funded with tax credits

and California Housing Finance Agency funds and restrictions could terminate by 2021.
The project has 43 of those 36 are subsidized units.
Most likely the owner of this facility will apply to continue their subsidies before they
expire, however to address this concern the Housing Element must prepare an estimate of
the cost to replace, acquire or subsidize the project to maintain existing rents.
Cost of Replacement
Based on discussion with developers and further analysis the City has determined that the
per-unit cost to construct comparable new units to replace those in Villa Del Rey
Apartments is approximately $165,000 per unit. For a total of 36 units the cost would be
$5.94 million
Cost to Acquire and Rehabilitate
The estimated cost to acquire and rehabilitate the 36 subidized units in the Villa Del Rey
apartments is estimated at $115,000 per unit, for a total of $4.14 million.
Rent Subsidy
The cost to subsidize rent for the 36 units depends on a resident’s income. Analysis of
these costs results in the following variables:
                         Monthly                                              Subsidy for All

In order to address the risk of conversion of the Villa Del Rey Apartments, an action plan
has been included in Chapter 8 of the Housing Element.
The Housing Element is also required to list entitities that are interested in participating
in California's first right-of-refusal program. These entitities would be notified when a
project becomes eligible for conversion to market-rate rents - to give the entity the
opportunity to "step in" to provide funds or other measures to preserve the affordability
of the units.

In order to properly plan for future housing needs, undeveloped lands available for
housing within existing city limits and Sphere of Influence lines must be inventoried. In
addition, this chapter analyzes the City of Farmersville’s infrastructure systems that
support the development of housing – water, sewer, storm drainage and streets.
AVAILABLE LAND INVENTORY
The following tables and map itemize the amount of land and potential number of
residential units that could be generated based on existing zoning and General Plan
designations in and around Farmersville.
These properties include vacant and agricultural lands presently within the city limits that
are zoned for residential development, as well as unincorporated lands on the fringe of
the community that are presently zoned for agriculture but are within the City’s Sphere of
Influence and are designated for residential development by the Land Use Element of the
Farmersville General Plan.
At an appropriate time in the future, these fringe properties can be zoned to a residential
classification upon annexation to Farmersville. Both City and County policies encourage
urban development to take place within cities where urban facilities and services are
available.
Single Family Residential Land Supply
Tables 6-1 through 6-4 list vacant or agricultural parcels in and around Farmersville that
are zoned or designated for residential development. These are also shown on Map 6-1.
Table 6-1 lists the number of vacant lots in subdivisions that have been approved in
recent years in Farmersville, but where development has not commenced.

never began construction, however their tentative subdivision maps are currently still
valid.
Table 6-2 lists other undeveloped lots that are zoned R-1 (Single Family Residential) in
Farmersville. Some of these lots are "in-fill" lots - typically small vacant lots in existing
developed neighborhoods. Other lots are larger-scale lots or agricultural parcels that are
zoned R-1, and which could be subdivided in the future.

                                                      Chapter 6: Land Availability
All of the parcels listed in Tables 6-1 and 6-2 have access to utilities (water, sewer,
storm drainage) and are free from any significant constraints to development - except that
some of this land (like much of Farmersville) is within a 100- or 500-year flood plain.
It should also be noted that each parcel listed could potentially be developed with a
second residential unit, consistent with the City’s Second Dwelling Unit law.
Land for Multi-Family Residential Development
State housing policy generally considers multi family residential development to be the
only feasible way to provide affordable housing for lower income households (those
within the “Extremely Low-”, “Very Low-“ and “Low-Income” categories. As such,
cities must document the amount of undeveloped land that is zoned for multi family
dwellings.
Table 6-3 lists vacant parcels that could be developed with multi-family residential units.
As noted previously, the State typically considers high density multi-family zoning (such
as Farmersville’s RM-2.5 zone (one dwelling per 1,700 square feet of lot area)) to be
most feasible for the development of affordable housing for the low- and very low-
income groups. Farmersville also allows multi-family development in the RM-4.0 (one
dwelling per 4,000 square feet of lot area) zone. Development standards for these zones
are discussed and analyzed in Chapter 7 of this Housing Element. The lots listed in Table
6-3 are also shown on Map 6-1.

parcels that

at least 16 units
Note: “MHDR = “Medium High Density Residential”
The information shown in Table 6-3 indicates that Farmersville currently has 23 vacant
lots that are zoned RM-2.5, totaling 14 acres. At a typical "build-out" of 20 units per
acre, these lots could potentially yield about 280 dwelling units.
State housing policy generally considers only those parcels large enough to accommodate
at least 16 units as being counted toward a city’s regional housing need. These units
must occur within a zone that allows a “realistic density” of at least 20 units per acre. In
Farmersville this would be the RM-2.5 zone.
Of the parcels listed in Table 6-3 three sites are large enough to accommodate at least 16
dwellings. These parcels total 7.6 acres and could accommodate up to 153 units. This
exceeds Farmersville’s assignment for the “Extremely Low-“, “Very Low-“ and “Low
Income” groups of 139 units.
Potentially-Developable Residential Land Outside City Limits
Table 6-4 inventories land designated for residential development that lies outside the
existing city limit boundary - but within Farmersville’s Sphere of Influence. This land is
designated for future urban development by Farmersville’s 2025 General Plan. The
General Plan establishes policies and land use designations through the year 2025.

Table 6-4 shows that over 116 acres are designated for future residential development
outside Farmersville’s current city limit boundaries but within the Sphere of Influence.
These lands are designated primarily for single family residential use. At full buildout,
these lands could accommodate approximately 485 dwelling units. The actual amount
may vary depending on whether some land is utilized for parks, storm drainage basins,
etc. Currently this land is not served with infrastructure - extensions of water and sewer
mains would be required.

OTHER HOUSING STRATEGIES/MECHANISMS
Density Bonus
It should be noted that the numbers of estimated dwelling units presented in the above
tables could be increased further if a developer were to use the density bonus provision
allowed by State law. A density bonus allows up to a 35 percent increase in overall
density if a certain percentage of a proposed development is set aside or designated for
qualified low- or very low-income or senior citizen households. The City also amended
its density bonus ordinance to allow a density bonus for projects that provide large family
units – dwellings with four or more bedrooms. This was an action plan of the 2009
Housing Element.
                                            6-6

                                                    Chapter 6: Land Availability
The number of units could also be increased if homeowners take advantage of the zoning
ordinance's provision for second residential units. This ordinance allows owners of
properties zoned R-1 to construct a second unit as long as basic zoning standards are met.
Planned Development Zone
Another option for encouraging more compact development is the use of the Zoning
Ordinance’s Planned Development (PD) zone. This zone allows flexibility for zoning
standards, including lot sizes. Flexibility is allowed as long as the overall density of the
project does not exceed that allowed by the underlying zoning. The City has approved
several residential P-D projects in the past decade, that allowed flexibility with respect to
yard setbacks and lot sizes.
Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
Manufactured housing is also considered an important affordable housing alternative,
especially as it relates to serving the needs of lower-income households. State planning
law requires that manufactured housing on permanent foundation systems must be
permitted in all single-family zoned lots, so long as the unit is no more than ten years old
on the date of application, and meets federal and optional local standards specified in
Government Code Section 65852.3. According to City records there are currently 80
mobile homes in Farmersville.
Section 65852.3 states that local governments may impose architectural requirements on
the manufactured home itself which are limited to roof overhang, roofing material, and
siding material, so long as the requirements, or any other lot development standards
imposed on the manufactured home installation, do not exceed those required for a
conventional home on the same lot. Section 65852.4 has been added to the Government
Code to specify that a locality may not subject an application to install a manufactured
home on a foundation system on a single-family lot to any administrative permit,
planning, or development process or requirement unless it is identical to those which
would be imposed on a conventional home on the same lot.
Other Housing Products/Types
In addition to providing adequate land for single and multi-family residential
development there are other types of residential development that the zoning ordinance
and general plan must provide for, including farmworker housing, emergency shelters,
and transitional housing. The Farmersville Zoning Ordinance permits factory-built
housing, mobile homes, and second units in the R-1 zone.
In order to facilitate other affordable housing products the City has completed a number
of Zoning Ordinance Amendments - to comply with recent changes in housing laws (and
                                              6-7

to comply with action plans in the previous housing element). As a result the following
housing types are now permitted:
-  Emergency Shelters are a permitted use in the RM zones.
-  Transitional Housing is a permitted use in the RM zones.
-  Supportive Housing is a permitted use in the RM zones.
-  Employee Housing is a permitted use in all residential zones.
-  Single Room Occupancy Units are a permitted use in the RM zones.
AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC FACILITIES
City policy requires that sewer, storm water drainage, domestic water, and street
improvements be installed by developers when property is being developed. These
installed improvements become a part of the city's larger infrastructure and circulation
systems.
The city's circulation system is generally in good condition and is maintained and
improved using gas tax, transportation funds and state and federal grants. The City's
sewer, water and storm drainage systems, described below can also accommodate
development prescribed in the Housing Element. A brief description of each system is as
follows:
Sewer System
The City provides sewer service to developed properties within its city limits. The
existing system consists of a network of 6- and 8-inch collection lines that connect to 10-
and 12-inch mains. These in turn connect to an 18 inch trunk line that terminates at the
city's wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), located southwest of the urban area.
The WWTP is designed to accommodate a daily maximum flow of 1.5 million gallons
per day (mgd). However, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board permits
the plant only a 1.25 mgd flow. The reason is that the water table in the vicinity of the
plant is shallow, thereby reducing the soil's capacity for percolation. Recent flows to the
treatment plant have averaged about 0.95 mgd. As such, the plant is operating at about
76 percent of its treatment capacity.
The City will be commencing a project to expand capacity of the treatment plant in 2015
to increase treatment capacity to 1.4 mgd. This expansion is expected to serve growth of
the community through the year 2025. An additional expansion of the plant to treat up to
2.4 mgd is also being considered. Additional study needs to be done before an expansion
of that magnitude can be approved.

                                                   Chapter 6: Land Availability
Water Supply System
The City of Farmersville provides water service to developed properties within its city
limits. The city pumps groundwater from seven wells (with an additional well out of
service) located throughout the community. The depth of the wells range from 240 to
400 feet, with groundwater reached around 60 feet. Each well has a pumping capacity of
about 700 gallons per minute (gpm) for a total capacity of about 4,900 gpm.
The current water demand is about 1,500 gallons per minute, with peak demands
approaching 6,000 gpm (which also includes fire flow demands).
The City prepared a Comprehensive Infrastructure Master Plan (CIMP) in 2012 which
served to amend and update previous utility master plans. The CIMP establishes
programs to upgrade and expand the water system with future wells, distribution lines
and a storage tank.
The Engineering Department has reported that the water system as it currently exists has
capacity to supply the development of approximately 330 additional homes. This is less
than the 466 dwellings assigned to Farmersville by the Regional Housing Needs
Assessment over the next eight years, but much greater than the average of 10 dwellings
per year built over the past six years. The City is currently preparing a grant application
to add another well that would give the City more than enough capacity to meet its
housing needs through 2023 (as well as provide for other types of development –
commercial, industrial, public, etc.). Provision of this grant has been included as an
action plan in Chapter 8 – to ensure that water supply does not become a constraint to the
development of housing.
Also, as noted previously the City has a policy that reserves priority for water supplies for
the development of lower income housing.
Development projects in Farmersville are responsible for installing water facility
improvements to serve their site, as well as paying utility impact fees which the City uses
to make capital improvements. These fees are discussed further in Chapter 7.
Storm Drainage System
Storm drainage within the community is provided by the City of Farmersville. The City
is divided into 26 individual drainage sub-areas. Most of these sub areas discharge
drainage water into one of the canals or creeks running through the city. Several
discharge into retention basins. The City has adopted a storm drainage master plan that
identifies improvements that will be necessary to serve future development in the
planning area. This master plan was augmented with preparation of the Comprehensive
Infrastructure Master Plan in 2012 – which prescribes future improvements to the system.

As with other utilities, project developers are responsible for installing storm drainage
improvements to serve their site.
Streets and Roads
At the current time, the circulation system in Farmersville is generally adequate. All
roads in city limits are operating at Level of Service “C” or better. Street routes and
design standards are established in the Circulation Element of the Farmersville General
Plan. Design standards are comparable to other neighboring communities. Caltrans
controls access to State Highway 198 which has freeway status past the northern edge of
the City.
The City is currently undertaking a major road improvement project that will widen
Farmersville Boulevard between Walnut Avenue and Highway 198, along with the
installation of two roundabouts at the highway interchange. As with other utility
systems, developers are responsible for installing street improvements to serve their
projects. Currently Farmersville does not have a circulation impact fee.

7          •        D EVELOPMENT
                    C ONSTRAINTS
A number of factors affect the ability of the private sector to respond to the demand for
housing, and constrain the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for all
economic groups. Constraints, however, can generally be translated into increased costs
to provide housing, and fall into two basic categories: governmental and non-
governmental.
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Governmental constraints are potential and actual policies, standards, requirements, or
actions imposed by the various levels of government on development. Although federal
and state programs and agencies play a role in the imposition of governmental
constraints, they are beyond the influence of local government and cannot be effectively
addressed in this document. Analysis of potential local governmental constraints are as
follows.
Land Use Controls
Land use controls are basically minimum standards included within the City's Zoning and
Subdivision Ordinances. Zoning is essentially a means of ensuring that the land uses of a
community are properly situated in relation to one another, providing adequate space for
each type of development. Zoning regulations control such features as:
-        height and bulk of buildings;
-        lot area and dimensions;
-        yard setbacks;
-        population density; and
-        building use
If zoning standards are too rigid and do not allow sufficient land use flexibility, then
development costs could increase and development interest may decrease. Housing
affordability could be jeopardized.
The Subdivision Ordinance governs the process of converting raw land into building
sites. It allows the City to control the internal design of each new subdivision so that its
pattern of streets, lots and public utilities will be safe, pleasant and economical to
maintain.
                                               7-1

                               Farmersville Housing Element 2016 – 2023
                                       Chapter 7: Development Constraints
Again, overly restrictive standards will result in greater land development costs and
potentially a lack in development interest. Farmersville's land use controls are generally
consistent with those enforced by other cities in the region and are not considered to be
overly restrictive. In fact, it has been the lack of controls in the past which have
contributed to some of the housing quality problems plaguing Farmersville today,
including lack of curbs and gutters, improper storm drainage, or adjacent land uses that
pose nuisance problems.
Building Codes
Building codes regulate the physical construction of dwellings and include, for example,
the plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. Farmersville follows the 2013 Uniform
Building Code (UBC) as established by State law and as such, has little control over State
standards. There have been no local amendments to the UBC.
Building codes are enforced by the City through inspections. Inspections normally occur
as a result of building permits for new construction, remodels or rehabilitations. Other
inspections may result from requests from individuals for assessments of building quality
or from enforcement complaints or when the inspector notices construction occurring
without permits. The City contracts with the Tulare County Building Department for
plan check and inspection services.
Site Improvements
Public improvement requirements for housing projects in Farmersville are consistent with
most other cities in the region. For single family residential subdivisions, Farmersville
requires the subdivider to install curbs, gutter, sidewalks and roadways (58-60-foot right-
of-way with 36 feet of paving (though 32 foot wide streets have been allowed in planned
unit development projects)); extend sewer and water lines; and provide for storm
drainage and park facilities. Multi-family housing projects, in addition to providing the
above improvements, are required to provide on-site parking, landscaping and irrigation,
and trash enclosures.
For single family subdivision projects, the City’s off-site public improvements are
reasonably consistent with neighboring communities – based on interviews with
developers and city planners who are building in other cities in the region. While
materials costs have fluctuated significantly in recent years, the installation of these off-
site improvements are considered a "cost of doing business". From the vantage point of
the City, these required improvements are necessary to ensure that the City is built in a
manner that benefits residents of the subdivision and the City.

                                   Source: Farmersville Zoning Ordinance
A review of zoning standards shown in Table 7-1 indicates that Farmersville’s standards
are fairly consistent with requirements of other cities in the region. In response to an
action plan in the previous Housing Element the City amended the density standard for
the RM-2.5 zone from one unit per 2,000 square feet to one unit per 1,700 square feet.
This allows multi family projects to meet the state’s standard of achieving at least 20
units per acre. These calculations account for land use controls including setbacks,
parking and height standards and observations of existing built projects in the city.
For the most part, developers of recent projects in Farmersville have not voiced concerns
that any of the City’s standards are constraining their ability to develop. However, where
a developer desires greater flexibility, the City offers the PD (Planned Development)
zone. This zone allows developers to propose flexibility with zoning standards as long as
the overall density of the project does not exceed the density allowed by the underlying
zone district.
Second Units
Farmersville adopted a second unit ordinance in 2006. This allows the development of
second dwelling units on lots zoned R-1 (Single Family Residential) that contain at least
6,000 square feet – the minimum lot size in the R-1 zone.

                                      Chapter 7: Development Constraints
Special Housing Types
As a result of State law and the previous Housing Element Farmersville has amended its
zoning ordinance to allow the development of emergency, transitional and supportive
housing units. Emergency housing is permitted in the RM (Multi Family Residential)
zones subject to a requirement that parking be provided at a rate of one space per ten beds
and one space per employee. All other zoning requirements (such as setbacks, height,
etc.) are those of the underlying zones.
Transitional and supportive housing are permitted in the RM zones subject only to zoning
standards that apply to other residential development in the particular zone. The City has
become that transitional and supportive housing must also be permitted by right in all
zones that allow residential development in Farmersville. Accordingly the City must
amend the zoning ordinance to allow these uses in the R-1 zone. An action plan has been
provided for this in Chapter 8.
The City also amended the Zoning Ordinance to allow SRO (Single Room Occupancy)
units as permitted uses in the RM-2.5 (High Density Multi-Family Residential) zone.
The standard limits the minimum floor area for each unit to 150 square feet, and a
maximum floor area of 400 square feet.
The City also has no restrictions on factory built or manufactured housing. This type of
housing can be more affordable than stick built housing.
Developers also have the option of requesting a density bonus for projects. As stipulated
by State law, a density bonus allows an increase in density over that allowed by the
zoning of the site, provided that the project is restricted to certain groups – low income
and/or elderly residents. The City must also provide at least one concession in
development standards – such as reduced setbacks, parking, or an increase in building
height, for example. Farmersville has not received any requests for density bonuses in
the past five years, but remains ready to facilitate this type of project in the event one is
proposed. The City recently adopted its own density bonus ordinance, consistent with
State law.
Annexation Process
Lands outside Farmersville City limits but within the Sphere of Influence are typically
designated for future development by the Land Use Element of the Farmersville General
Plan. This includes residential development. At an appropriate time these lands may be
considered for annexation into the City. Annexations involve several levels of
government review, including the City, the County, and Tulare Local Agency Formation

Commission (LAFCo). Since 2000 the City has approved six annexations totaling about
185 acres. The annexation process is typically as follows:
-       Applicant submits request for annexation (this is typically paired with a request
        for a zone change and subdivision map)
-       City conducts environmental analysis consistent with CEQA (California
        Environmental Quality Act)
-       Project is scheduled for public hearing before the Planning Commission
-       If approved by the Planning Commission, project is scheduled for public hearing
        with City Council.
-       If approved by the City Council, annexation application is filed with Tulare
        LAFCo.
-       LAFCo analyzes request and schedules a public hearing for annexation
-       If approved by LAFCo, annexation is scheduled for final approval by City
        Council.
Processing Fees
Although planning processing fees contribute to the total cost of housing development,
and therefore the cost of housing, they generally are not considered a significant cost
factor. The City of Farmersville collects processing fees for several different types of
planning permits, including subdivision maps, annexations, conditional use permits, site
plan review, environmental review, general plan amendments, zone changes, variances,
and others. The fees have been calculated so as to reimburse the City for its actual
processing costs, and have also been evaluated in comparison to fees charged by
neighboring jurisdictions. Farmersville’s current planning fees are detailed in Table 7-2.

Development Impact Fees
Development impact and building permit fees typically constitute a much larger
percentage of housing costs than do the planning permit fees discussed above. These fees
pay the capital costs of public facilities which serve a project, such as:
-       water;
-       sanitary sewer;
-       storm drainage;
-       parks;
-       public safety
In addition, impact fees are assessed by the Farmersville Unified School District, to
provide for the construction of new educational facilities.
Farmersville most recently updated its fees in 2006. The current fee list is shown in
Table 7-3 and displays fees for both single and multi-family development. Table 7-4 is a
comparison of impact fees of Tulare County cities for water, sewer and storm drainage.

Total                              $10,613/unit               $9,946/unit
As mentioned previously, developers are also required to pay impact fees to the
Farmersville Unified School District, for the construction of educational facilities. The
District’s fee is currently $5.08 per square foot. For a 1,700 square foot single family
dwelling this fee would amount to $8,636.
Based on the foregoing information and using a 1,700 square foot single family home
valued at $175,000, Farmersville’s impact fees constitute approximately 6 percent of the
cost of the dwelling. When the school district’s fees are added, this rate increases to
about eleven percent of the unit cost.

Permit Processing
Farmersville contracts with consultants for planning and engineering services, and
contracts with Tulare County for building plan check and inspection services.
Because of the limited number of planning and development requests that are typically
submitted to Farmersville, processing of these applications usually begins within days of
receiving the application. A typical single family residential subdivision will require four
to six months to process, from submittal of application to filing of final subdivision map
with the Tulare County Recorders Office. Each processing phase of a typical residential
subdivision is listed below along with the amount of time required to process each phase.
Subdivision applications that require an annexation typically add three months to the
processing time.
Step            Task
1.      Applicant submits residential subdivision with processing fee and forms filled
        out, including environmental assessment form.

   * Items marked with an asterisk denote tasks that typically overlap with other tasks.
Multi-family residential developments proposed in Farmersville require Site Plan
Review. This involves a meeting with the Planning Commission. For Site Plan Review
the following processing procedures and time lines are usually required.
1.      Applicant submits application with processing fee and forms filled out;
2.      Review application for completeness - one week;
3.      Review project - two weeks;
4.      Planning Commission holds meeting for Site Plan Review permit.
The City reviews applications to ensure that projects meet basic zoning standards (listed
in Table 7-1), including setbacks, parking and landscaping, in addition to right-of-way
improvements (including curb, gutters, sidewalks and lighting) and that infrastructure
(water, sewer and storm drainage improvements) is available. If a project does not meet
basic standards, the applicant is informed and instructed to revise plans accordingly (or
where applicable, to apply for a Variance to reduce the subject standard).
Farmersville’s Site Plan Review process for multi-family residential development has
been considered very straight forward and generally not a constraint to new development.
Environmental Review Process
Certain types of projects must be reviewed for environmental impacts under the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The environmental review process is
mandated by state law, and thus, Farmersville has little control over processing. Review
times will vary depending on the complexity of the project and environmental issues
being evaluated. In general, an Initial Environmental Study and Negative Declaration
take about six to eight weeks to process – including the required public review/comment
period. A full Environmental Impact Report (E.I.R.) may take two to four months to
process. No residential projects proposed in at least the last fifteen years in Farmersville
have required an EIR. Most projects qualify for a Negative Declaration; many are
exempt from environmental review, including multi family developments on properly-
zoned sites.

                                       Chapter 7: Development Constraints
Governmental Constraints on Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Senate Bill 520-Chebro (effective January 1, 2002) amended housing element law to
require localities to include the definition of "disability" into the housing element.
Further, it states that housing should be designed for occupancy by, or with supportive
services for persons with disabilities, which includes persons with mobility impairments,
AIDS/HIV, Alzheimer's, and the homeless, to name a few. The bill's requirements
include:
1. As part of a governmental constraints analysis, the housing element must analyze
    potential and actual constraints upon the development, maintenance and improvement
    of housing for persons with disabilities and demonstrate local efforts to remove
    governmental constraints that hinder the locality from meeting the need for housing
    for persons with disabilities.
2. As part of the required constraints program, the element must include programs that
    remove constraints or provide reasonable accommodations for housing designed for
    persons with disabilities.
The City has amended its Zoning Ordinance to introduce a Reasonable Accommodations
permit for persons with disabilities wishing to request reductions in zoning standards (e.g.
reduced setbacks for ramps, etc.). This permit can usually be processed in a day and
there is no fee. The City has prepared promotional materials to advertise this type of
permit.
Housing Element law requires analysis of potential zoning constraints that may affect the
establishment of group homes in the community. Group homes are permitted in
Farmersville’s Zoning Ordinance as “Residential care homes”, defined as follows:
      “Residential care home” means a state authorized, certified or licensed family
      care home or foster home serving six or fewer mentally disordered or
      otherwise handicapped persons or dependent and neglected children on a
      twenty-four-hour basis.
Residential care homes are permitted by right in the City’s R-1 and R-M zones. There
are no restrictions on groupings or concentrations of such homes in the Zoning
Ordinance. Further, the Zoning Ordinance does not require improvements beyond those
required for permitted uses in the zone (e.g. setbacks, parking, etc.)

                                        Chapter 7: Development Constraints
Governmental Constraints Conclusions
Farmersville's land use controls, building codes, site improvements, development impact
fees, and permit processing procedures for the most part do not pose substantial
constraints to the city's efforts to provide affordable housing. Farmersville's development
impact fees are in line with fees charged by other cities in the area and its processing time
for subdivisions is about as expeditious as State planning laws will allow.
The City has also amended its Zoning Ordinance to comply with State law and action
plans contained in the previous Housing Element, as follows:
-     Multi family dwellings are permitted by right in the RM zones (rather than
      requiring a Conditional Use Permit)
-     Permitted density in the RM-2.5 zone has been increased to one dwelling per 1,700
      square feet of lot area, which allows for a realistic density of at least 20 units per
      acre.
-     Transitional- Supportive- and Emergency Housing has been added as a permitted
      use in the RM zones subject to the same zoning standards that apply to other uses in
      those zones.
-     Employee Housing has been added as a permitted use in single and multi family
      residential zones.
-     Farmersville has adopted a Reasonable Accommodations ordinance
-     Farmersville has adopted a density bonus ordinance, which also includes provisions
      for large-family homes (those with four or more bedrooms)
-     Single Room Occupancy units are a permitted use in the RM zones.
-     Residential care homes have been reclassified as a permitted use.
-     The City has zoned additional land for multi family residential development, to
      meet its obligations under the Regional Housing Needs Assessment plan.
Analysis of Consistency with General Plan Elements
Farmersville’s Housing Element must be internally consistent with its other general plan
elements, including land use, circulation and parks, open space, recreation and
conservation elements. Internal consistency among the general plan elements has been
accomplished by using consistent population projections, land use demand acreages and
growth boundary lines.
Consistency between the Housing Element and the Land Use Element is the best measure
of internal consistency. The City adopted a new General Plan in 2002 and policies from
that plan are evaluated here. The proposed Land Use Element contains numerous goals,
                                              7-11

polices and action programs that serve to further the objectives of the Housing Element,
especially objectives pertaining to affordability, density and infill. Examples of these
goals, polices and objectives are listed below. In order to ensure that consistency is
maintained between the Housing Element and other General Plan elements, an action
plan is being added to the Housing Element requiring that any time another General Plan
element is amended there must be an analysis of consistency between the amended
element and the Housing Element.
Community Image
Code Enforcement/Property Maintenance
     2. The City shall actively enforce the State Housing Code, which provides a procedure for
         abating or rehabilitating unsafe, dilapidated residential structures.
         a. The Building Inspector shall report to the City Council on an annual basis progress on
             rehabilitating or removing unsafe residential structures.
         b. The Planning Department shall maintain a city map that identifies the location of
             unsafe residential dwellings.
         c.  The Farmersville Redevelopment Agency should explore the use of state or federal
             funds to promote infill residential development while concurrently facilitating the
             rehabilitation of stubstandard dwellings and the removal of unsafe residential
             structures.
Growth Management
New Development
III. Promote Smart Growth planning principals in order to discourage urban sprawl and
     the premature urbanization of agricultural land, and to create more livable
     neighborhoods. This issue is addressed in more detail in Appendix A: “A Smart
     Growth Primer”.
     1. The City shall amend its Zoning Ordinance to add a Smart Development District.
         a. The Smart Development District shall incorporate planning principals that promote
             moderate increases in residential densities, narrower streets, better connectivity in
             and between neighborhoods and site and architectural design that emphasizes a
             humanized evnironment, as opposed to an automobile-oriented environment.
         b. Smart Growth design techniques should be incorporated into Farmersville’s
             residential and commercial zone district standards, as appropriate (see Appendix A:
             “A Smart Growth Primer”).
     2. New urban development should occur in an orderly manner with initial development
         occurring on available undeveloped properties which are closer to the existing built-up
         area.
                                                 7-12

                                        Chapter 7: Development Constraints
       a. The City should promote in-fill development and development of lands immediately
           adjacent to existing urbanized areas, before allowing development of outlying lands.
       b. The General Plan maps designates lands further away from existing development
           with a “Reserve” status. Development of these lands should be delayed until land
           closer to the city is developed.
    3. The City should promote mixed-use development where appropriate.
       a. The City shall amend its Zoning Ordinance to provide for a Mixed-Use Zone District.
       b. The City should identify sites in the downtown core where mixed-use development
           would be appropriate.
    4. The City shall amend its Zoning Ordinance to permit residential development in the
       downtown.
       a. The City shall amend the Zoning Ordinance to permit housing development in the
           downtown with a conditional use permit.
       b. Housing units should be permitted in the upper stories of downtown buildings with a
           Conditional Use Permit.
Neighborhood Maintenance and Revitalization
I.  Take actions to keep existing neighborhoods strong and healthy.
    1. Remove substandard homes from residential neighborhoods.
       a. The City shall abate or rehabilitate substandard residential dwellings through the
           process established in the State Housing Code.
       b. The Redevelopment Agency should consider the purchase of substandard housing in
           order to clear the property for new, low to moderate income housing.
    2. Rehabilitate homes that have deteriorated.
       a. The City should continue to apply for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
           funds to rehabilitate homes that have deteriorated.
    3. Upgrade public improvements in blighted neighborhoods, including sidewalks, alleys,
       street trees, roadways, parkways and street lights.
       a. Establish an annual objective for repairing or replacing broken curbs, gutters and
           sidewalks.
       b. Replant vacant parkways with street trees.
       c.  Identify alleys that can be abandoned and initiate the process consistent with the
           Streets and Highways Code.
       d. Upgrade alleys with pavement, where possible.

                                            Chapter 7: Development Constraints
     4. Encourage residential infill development in neighborhoods that are blighted.
        a. Consider the reduction of development impact fees on residential infill projects.
        b. Consider increasing the allowable underlying density on land that will support a
             residential infill project. Increased density can help make projects “pencil-out”.
     5. Continue to enforce the city’s property maintenance ordinance.
-       The planning and building department will work together to ensure that building and
        zoning code violations are corrected and/or eliminated.
        b. The city on a monthly basis will send out correction letters to persons who are in
             violation of planning or building code regulations.
     6. The city will annually seek state and federal grant funds that can assist in the elimination
        of blight in residential neighborhoods.
        a. The City should contract with a grant writer to obtain funding.
     7. The Farmersville Redevelopment Agency will use its tax increment funds and low to
        moderate housing income funds to eliminate conditions of blight in residential
        neighborhoods.
New Development
II. Promote neighborhoods that are quiet, visually pleasing, and cool.
     1. The City should discourage land uses that are incompatible with residential
        neighborhoods.
        a. Adoption of the Land Use Element and Land Use Map will implement this policy.
III. Promote attractive, well-maintained and designed residential neighborhoods.
     1. The City should develop a Smart Development Overlay Zone which promotes:
        -    Narrow, tree-lined residential streets.
        -    Neighborhood parks.
        -    Dwellings that are architecturally reflective of historic and traditional styles used in
             Farmersville and the San Joaquin Valley.
        -    Common areas that are maintained by Landscaping and Lighting Districts.
        a. Appendix A: “A Smart Growth Primer”, includes recommendations for the creation of
             a Smart Growth development code.
     2. Encourage residential developments and adjacent land uses to be pedestrian-oriented.
        a. All residential developments with walls should provide openings for pedestrian and
             bike traffic.
                                                 7-14

                                         Chapter 7: Development Constraints
        b. Land uses adjacent to residential developments should provide for pedestrian access
             between the two types of developments.
    3. The City should consider promoting mixed uses in the Smart Development Overlay Zone.
        Examples might include a neighborhood commercial building with multi-family units next
        to, or above the commercial use.
IV. Protect existing neighborhoods from incompatible land uses.
    1. Through the Site Plan Review and Conditional Use Permit process, ensure that the city’s
        zoning ordinance regulations do not permit uses that will be incompatible with residential
        neighborhoods.
Multi-Family Development
I.  Multi-Family development shall be well-designed, well-maintained and properly sited.
    1. The City shall prepare design guidelines that provide examples of good multi-family
        residential design.
        a. The Planning Director will work with the Planning Commission to create and adopt
             design guidelines.
    3. Multi-family developments shall be required to enter into a maintenance agreement with
        the City, prior to occupancy. The maintenance agreement shall be reviewed and
        approved by the Planning Commission.
        a. The Zoning Ordinance shall be amended to incorporate this standard.
    4. The City shall explore requiring a maintenance bond be posted for new multi-family
        residential development.
        a. The Community Development Director and City Attorney shall research this issue
             and present their findings and recommendations to the City Council.
    5. All multi-family residential development shall require a Conditional Use Permit.
        a. The Zoning Ordinance shall be amended to reflect this policy.
    6. Duplex and triplex buildings may be integrated into single family residential subdivisions,
        on corner lots, through a Conditional Use Permit.
        a. The Zoning Ordinance shall be amended to incorporate this standard.
    7. The City shall review the Zoning Ordinance’s development standards for multi-family
        residential development, and amend the ordinance where deemed necessary.
        a. The Community Development Director shall review the Zoning Ordinance with the
             Planning Commission, who shall forward their recommendations to the City Council.
    8. A traffic study shall be required for all multi-family residential projects of twenty units or
        greater.

        a. The Zoning Ordinance shall be amended to reflect this requirement.
Downtown Farmersville
Housing
I.  Promote multi-family and senior citizen housing in the Downtown area, to facilitate diversity,
    security and to extend “life of the streets” into evening hours.
    1. The City should promote the downtown area as a location for future multi-family
        development
        a. The Land Use Map identifies the downtown as a mixed use area, which permits the
             combination of residential and commercial land uses
Special Issues
Linnel Farm Labor Center
I.  Establish a long-term framework to allow Farmersville’s continued growth in the
    vicinity of Linnel Farm Labor Center.
    1. Open a dialogue between the City and Tulare County Housing Authority (TCHA) to
        discuss issues of mutual interest relating to Linnel Farm Labor Center.
    2. Encourage TCHA to continue to upgrade and improve the appearance of Linnel, through
        landscaping and routine maintenance.
    3. Explore the possibility of closing Linnel’s wastewater treatment plant. Identify funding to
        extend lines from Farmersville’s sewer system to serve Linnel, and expand Farmersville’s
        wastewater treatment plant.
        a. The City Manager shall contact officials of TCHA to set a meeting between the TCHA
             board of directors and the Farmersville City Council to discuss these issues.
Cameron Creek Colony
I.  Open a dialogue between the City and Tulare County officials about the future of the
    Cameron Creek Colony development. Interested individuals in Cameron Creek Colony
    should also be involved in this effort.
    1. At some point, the City should annex Cameron Creek Colony.
        a. Work with Tulare County to establish a redevelopment district to generate funding to
             bring public and private development up to code in Cameron Creek, including streets,
             utilities and dwellings.
        b. The City and County should negotiate a special tax-sharing agreement that places
             the city in a better position to assume public services requirements for Cameron
             Creek.

        c.  Encourage Tulare County to contract with Self-Help Enterprises to conduct a housing
            rehabilitation program for willing property owners.
    2. Establish land use regulations that reflect the existing rural residential lifestyle in
        Cameron Creek Colony.
        a. The Land Use Map identifies most of Cameron Creek as “Rural Residential”.
        b. The City should establish a “Rural Residential” zone to apply to Cameron Creek
            Colony. The zone should mirror standards contained in the County’s existing zoning
            for the area. This zone should not be utilized in other portions of the planning area.
A review of the foregoing General Plan policies indicates that none of these policies
would present a significant constraint to the production and maintenance of housing in
Farmersville.
NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Non-governmental constraints are those that are generated by the private sector and that
are generally beyond the control of local governments. A few of the impacts of non-
governmental constraints can be mitigated to a minimal extent by local governmental
actions, but usually the effects are very localized and have little influence on the total
housing need within the jurisdiction or market area.
Cost of Financing
Interest rates for the purchase of a single family home are presently between four and six
percent for 20-year and 30-year loans. Rates have remained fairly consistent, even
dropping lower in recent years. These low interest rates are one of the few “bright spots”
in a housing market that has seen new residential development come to a near halt in
recent years – with the effects of a recession and significant number of home foreclosures
severely impacting the market. Despite these circumstances, the low interest rates have
caused home ownership to remain more affordable than it would otherwise be. In a
market like Farmersville, the interest rate is probably the single most important factor
influencing the affordability of homes.
Individuals purchasing a single family home can typically qualify for financing if the
monthly cost of the home does not exceed 30 percent of their gross monthly income.
Costs would include principal and interest, property tax and insurance.
To reduce the cost of financing, local jurisdictions can often apply for state and federal
funds that provide a lower interest rate or they can reduce the amount of the mortgage by
providing down-payment assistance (HOME funds). Funding shall not exceed 50% of the
                                                7-17

home purchase price and shall never exceed the subsidy limits per unit as outlined in
Section 221 (d) (3) established by HUD and updated annually. Farmersville has
facilitated nearly sixty first-time homebuyer purchases using the HOME program since
the previous Housing Element.
Price of Land
The cost of vacant land designated for residential development has fluctuated
significantly during the past five years. During the height of the housing “boom” in the
first part of the decade, land was being purchased nearing $70,000 per acre. In more
recent years the cost has settled down to about $35,000 per acre.
Mitigation measures dealing with land costs that are available to local governments
include the use of Community Development Block Grant funds to write down land costs,
utilization of government-owned surplus land for housing projects, and with past use of
tax increment from redevelopment agencies for construction of low - to moderate income
housing.
Cost of Construction
Volatile and rising costs of labor and materials have contributed to the non-governmental
constraints on housing development and improvement. These costs were a substantial
part of the increased housing costs during the past decade. Builders must pass those
increases along to the home buyer or renter. In the last several years, construction costs
for materials, land and labor have dropped, as the demand for housing has decreased.
One of the most significant results of Proposition 13, passed by the voters of California in
1978, was the severe limitation imposed on the development of infrastructure. These
costs can no longer be passed on to the taxpayer by the local jurisdiction and must be
borne by the developer, who then must pass them along by increasing the cost of housing
or rents.
Where appropriate, local governments can utilize Community Development Block Grant
funds to write down the cost of construction, the preferred method being the financing of
infrastructure improvements, (ie; water and sewer lines, streets, etc.). Redevelopment
previously offered a tool that cities could use to provide for the needs of lower income
households, however this mechanism was terminated by the State in 2012. There are,
however, other actions that can be implemented that can reduce the cost of housing.
These actions are detailed in Table 7-6.

 Land                      Allow smaller lots using Smart Growth principals, increasing
                           densities
 Improvements              Reduce level of improvements required (e.g. narrower streets,
                           combined park/pond basins, fewer street lamps, etc.)
 Impact Fees               Secure state and federal funds to pay for fees instead of
                           requiring the developer to pay fees
 Labor                     Self Help Housing
 Materials                 Generally cannot mitigate. Consider use of "green" and/or
                           recycled building materials and components
 Administrative/costs      Reduced if developed by non-profit agency. Streamline the
 and profit                planning process
Lifestyle
Part of the increase in housing costs from the late 1990s to the present was due to
consumer preference and life style expectations. The size of the typical single family
house increased and other amenities included in the housing package changed, such as
the number of bedrooms. All of these life style choices have costs associated with them.
The trends emerging now, due to governmental and non-governmental constraints and the
resulting increase in housing costs, are expected to be towards smaller units, smaller lots,
and alternatives to the single family detached dwelling.
Although the consumer preference may still tend toward the desire to own a single family
home, past surveys have shown that some households are now more willing to accept
alternatives to that lifestyle mostly out of necessity. Local government can assist this
change by permitting higher densities, and innovative approaches such as zero-lot-line
housing and smaller lots. Good design is a vital part of this equation - to ensure that
compact neighborhoods maintain their value over time.
Non-Governmental Constraints Conclusions
Despite the increasing costs of housing in California and the San Joaquin Valley,
Farmersville continues to offer relatively affordable housing. Land values are low,
interest rates are hovering around 5 percent and cost of construction is low compared to
other regions in California.

                                       Chapter 7: Development Constraints
Although the median family income in Farmersville in 2000 was one of the State's
lowest, a family with a moderate income who can take advantage of special housing
programs like first-time homebuyer funds, can purchase a moderately-priced home.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Housing Element law requires an analysis of any known environmental constraints that
could affect residential development in the planning period. There are several
environmental issues that have some effect on all types of development (including
housing) in Farmersville, but none of these effects are considered to be substantial.
Flooding
Maps prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency indicate that portions of
the City are within the 100-year and 500-year flood plains. Most of the 100-year flood
plain area is situated west of Farmersville Boulevard, south of Walnut Avenue. Most of
this area is fully developed at the current time. Much of the remaining area of the
community (including future growth areas is either in the 500-year flood zone or in areas
of minimal or no flooding.
The presence of designated flood zones can be a challenge to the production of housing
in the past, but not a complete impediment. Typical methods to mitigate the threat of
flooding include the elevation of building pads above the known flood level, raising the
foundation of buildings, or a combination of both.
Soils and Ag Preserves
The Soil Conservation Service’s Soil Survey of Central Tulare County, California
(USDA, SCS, 1971) for the Farmersville area indicates that much of the planning area’s
soils are composed of prime farmland soils. Further a number of parcels around the
community are entered into agricultural preserve contracts.
The purpose of ag preserves is to preserve agricultural lands by preventing the premature
conversion of agricultural land to urban development. Properties encumbered with an ag
preserve are granted a reduced tax rate (based on agricultural use of the property as
opposed to speculative urban development possibilities).
While contracts can present an impediment to urban growth (and therefore the
development of housing) the contracts can be terminated in one of several ways - the
owner can file a notice of non-renewal and the contract will terminate after ten years; the
City can facilitate termination of an ag preserve contract if the City had filed a “protest”

when the contract was first established (this has been the case with several contracts
adjacent to Farmersville); finally the City can terminate a contract by making special
findings (typically occurring when a parcel is annexed from the County into the City).
In dealing with ag preserve contracts, the City must attempt to strike a balance between
ag land preservation and the need to provide for appropriate urban development. To date,
the presence of ag preserve contracts has not proven to be a significant constraint to the
provision of housing in Farmersville, and is not expected to be in the foreseeable future.
In conclusion there are no known environmental constraints on sites identified for
housing, and any conditions can be mitigated. Further, none of the sites identified are
within agricultural preserve contracts.

                   P LANS
The following sections establish the individual policies, goals and action programs of the
Housing Element. This chapter is divided into eight program areas, which are required
by Government Code Section 65583(c)(1)-(7). For each of these program areas, this
chapter will detail the goals, policies, objectives and programs that will implement the
state-mandated program area.
A. PROVISIONS FOR EXTREMELY LOW-, VERY LOW-,
     LOW-, AND MODERATE-INCOME HOUSING
_______________________________________________________________________
Section 65583(c) of Housing Element law states that "localities are to address their
housing needs through the administration of land use and development controls,
provision of regulatory concessions and incentives, and the utilization of appropriate
federal and state financing and subsidy programs, when available."
Section 65583(c)(2) states that the housing element shall contain programs which "assist
in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income
households."
________________________________________________________________________
To develop through public and private channels, sufficient new housing to
ensure the availability of affordable housing for all households in
Farmersville.
Affordability is the most pressing problem of the housing issues in California. For the
extremely low-, very low- and low- income household, the problem is basic - having
enough money to afford shelter. For the moderate- and above moderate-income
households, the issue is being able to afford the purchase of a home. Between these two
ends of the spectrum are the households that can afford housing (either renting or buying)
but may struggle with making ends meet because housing is consuming a greater amount
of their monthly income.

                              Farmersville Housing Element 2016 – 2023
                        Chapter 8: Goals, Objectives and Action Plans
Although state and local governments, as well as private industry, have important roles in
providing assisted housing, federal funding is essential to the provision of housing for
very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. Without this resource, the ability of
local government to address the housing needs of these income groups is very limited.
Policies
1.      Wherever appropriate, facilitate the use of federal or state programs that can assist
        in the development of new housing consistent with identified city-wide housing
        needs and adopted local plans and programs.
2.      Support efforts that serve to coordinate and improve the ability of the housing
        industry to effectively respond to local housing needs.
3.      Accommodate and encourage development of a full range of housing types within
        Farmersville by 2023.
4.      Maintain a sufficient inventory of developable land to accommodate timely
        construction of needed new residential units.
5.      Promote balanced, orderly growth to minimize unnecessary developmental costs,
        which increase the cost of housing.
Objectives
1.      Construction of 207 non-market rate dwellings by 2023, which equals the City of
        Farmersville’s regional housing needs share.
2.      Construction of 259 market-rate dwellings by 2023, which equals the City of
        Farmersville’s regional housing needs share.
Programs
1.      HOME Funding. Farmersville will encourage and work with a qualified housing
        entity to submit an application for funds under the HOME Program on behalf of
        the City. The City will in turn provide funds to first-time homebuyers, either as
        down-payment assistance and/or to pay development impact fees. This program
        provides financial assistance to low- to moderate- income families for the
        purchase of newly constructed homes or existing homes. Other groups that could
        be assisted with rental housing include Extremely Low Income and disabled
        residents. The City Planner and City Manager will work with a qualified non-
        profit housing entity to identify appropriate building sites.

   Year: Annually/ongoing
   Responsible Agency: City of Farmersville and qualified developers
   Funding: HOME funds
3. In-Fill Development. Farmersville will work with a qualified developer to
   construct single family homes that are affordable to low- and moderate- income
   households. These homes could be constructed on in-fill residential lots some of
   which may have originally contained dilapidated homes that have been
   demolished. The City Planner and Code Enforcement officer will identify
   appropriate lots for this program.
   Year: Annually/ongoing
   Responsible Agency: City of Farmersville
   Funding: CDBG funds
4. Planned Development Zone. The City of Farmersville will encourage private
   developers who are proposing residential development to seek a P-D (Planned
   Development) zone district. These districts allow for greater flexibility in
   residential design and better utilization of land. These opportunities allow the
   developer to potentially provide a more affordable housing product. The City will
   prepare an informational brochure that explains the standards and procedures for
   this zone.
   Year: This program will be implemented on an ongoing basis.
   Responsible Agency: City of Farmersville, Planning Department
   Funding: General fund
5. Density Bonus. The City of Farmersville will encourage developers to apply for
   a density bonus for qualified projects. The City adopted its own density bonus
   ordinance in 2015 but prior to that processed density bonus applications through
   the State’s density bonus law. The ordinance provides that a density bonus may
   be granted for projects that agree to limit residency to qualified households,
   including low-income and the elderly. In addition to granting a density bonus of
   up to 35 percent, the City must also grant at least one additional development
   standard concession – such as reduced building setbacks, for instance. The City
   will continue to monitor amendments to the State’s density bonus laws and
   incorporate those into local code as appropriate.

6. Housing Authority. The City of Farmersville will assist the Tulare County
   Housing Authority's implementation of the conventional Public Housing Rental
   Program and the Section 8 Existing Program, which provides rent subsidies
   directly to participating landlords, and will support that Agency's attempts to
   secure additional funding for expanded programs.
   The City Planner will assist the Housing Authority on an ongoing annual basis in
   identifying additional rental housing stock that can be used for the Section 8
   Program.
   Year: This program will be implemented on an ongoing basis
   Responsible Agency: City of Farmersville and Tulare County Housing
   Authority
   Funding: HUD funds and other sources
7. Farmworker Housing. The City will identify a development partner for a
   farmworker housing project to develop affordable housing for farmworkers. The
   City will support the project by expediting approval and consideration of impact
   fee reductions, waivers or deferrals will be given. The City will seek to develop
   50 units in this fashion during the Housing Element planning period.
   Year: Annually and ongoing
   Responsible Agency: City of Farmersville
   Funding: General fund.
8. Assist in Development. The City will proactively contact developers of housing
   affordable to lower income households, including extremely low income and
   special needs groups such as persons with disabilities. The City will seek
   opportunities for partnership and assist development, including:
-  Assistance with site identification
-  Facilitate entitlement (e.g. priority processing)
-  Grant incentives and concessions to promote feasibility of housing for lower
   income households
-  Fee deferral or reduction as appropriate
-  Explore and pursue or assist in application to various funding sources, such as
   State and Federal funds.
   Year: Annually and ongoing
   Responsible Agency: City of Farmersville

B. MITIGATION OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
     (SECTION 65583(c)(3)
_______________________________________________________________________
Section 65583(c)(3) states that for each policy, requirement, or procedure identified as a
governmental constraint, the element must include an appropriate program action to
eliminate or modify the constraint or demonstrate how it will be offset by another policy
or program."
_______________________________________________________________________
Minimize governmental constraints in Farmersville that would jeopardize
the development of affordable housing.
Policy
1.     Minimize significant constraints to affordable housing caused by the City of
       Farmersville, including residential development standards, improvement
       standards and residential density standards.
2.     Remove governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, or
       development of housing for the disabled.
Objective
1.     The City shall continue to review its residential zoning districts to provide greater
       flexibility in regards to zone standards, including setbacks, lot size, parking
       requirements, and height limitations.
2.     The City shall implement zoning recommendations of the 2025 General Plan
       Update that pertain to residential development standards.
Programs
1.     Infill Projects. The City shall take action to promote development of qualified
       affordable housing projects on properly zoned small/odd shaped lots. Financial
       assistance could be made available to assemble parcels, reduce, defer or eliminate
       impact fees, reduce building/planning permit fees or assist in the installation of
       off-site improvements, such as curb/gutter or infrastructure, or for the demolition
       of existing substandard units. The City will establish a program to facilitate this
       action plan, including creation of a map identifying potential infill sites and a
       brochure to market the program to potential developers. These materials will be
                                            8-5

   completed by the first quarter of 2017. The City will endeavor to facilitate the
   development of 20 units during the planning period of the Housing Element.
           Year: Immediate, ongoing
           Responsible Entities: City of Farmersville
           Funding: General Fund
2. Add Transitional and Supportive Housing as permitted uses in all residential
   zones. Farmersville currently allows transitional and supportive housing in the
   RM zone but state law requires that it be allowed in all residential zones, only
   subject to zoning standards that apply to other residential uses in that zone.
   Accordingly the City will need to amend the zoning ordinance to allow
   transitional and supportive housing in the R-1 zone. The City will incorporate
   these amendments into the comprehensive zoning ordinance update that is
   currently under way.
           Year: Fourth quarter, 2016
           Responsible Entities: City of Farmersville
           Funding: General Fund
3. Ensure General Plan Consistency. Whenever a General Plan element is being
   amended (to add new policies or new land use designations, for example) the
   Planning Department shall include an analysis of whether the amendment is
   consistent with policies of the Housing Element.
           Year: Annually/ongoing
           Responsible Entities: City of Farmersville

C. MODERATE -INCOME HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
_______________________________________________________________________
Section 65583 (c)(2) states that moderate-income housing should be promoted as well as
lower-income housing. Some cities are only receiving lower-income housing and
housing for the middle -class is becoming nonexistent.
_______________________________________________________________________
To develop a market for middle-income housing
Policies
1.     Promote the construction of middle-income housing in Farmersville using HOME
       funds for first-time home buyers.
2.     Utilize the Planned Development district to promote innovative design concepts
       and affordable middle-income housing.
3.     Through Farmersville's economic development efforts, the City should seek to
       attract industries that have a wage scale that supports the purchasing of middle
       income housing units.
Objectives
1.     The City shall implement recommendations of its 2025 General Plan update
       regarding diversification of the local economy.
2.     The City of Farmersville shall utilize its low- to moderate-income redevelopment
       housing funds to promote the construction of middle-income housing.
Programs
1.     Planned Development Zone. Farmersville will encourage private developers
       who are proposing residential development to seek a P-D (Planned Development)
       overlay district. Planned Development standards allow for greater flexibility in
       residential design and more efficient utilization of land. These opportunities
       allow the developer to potentially provide a more affordable housing product.
       Within the past five years the City has successfully facilitated the approval of
       over 450 lots within P-D zoned subdivisions.

2. HOME Program Funding. The City of Farmersville will continue to implement
   the first time home buyer program with HOME funds. This program serves those
   households who are otherwise excluded from the market-rate purchase of a home
   within the community (households earning less than 80% of the area median
   income). Buyers will be first-time home buyers (not having owned a home for
   the previous three years). Financial participation in these programs will include
   assistance with down payment costs, closing costs and other secondary financing
   mechanisms. The City will market this program utilizing English and Spanish
   language brochures and will endeavor to assist seven households per year with
   this program.

4. New Single Family Residential Zone. The City will explore establishing a
   single family residential zone with a larger minimum lot size than the current R-1
   zone, which has a minimum lot size of 6,000 square feet. A minimum lot size of
   7,500 square feet (or similar) could be considered, in an effort to attract more
   upscale housing to Farmersville. This would require an amendment to the
   policies of the Land Use Element of the Farmersville General Plan and also an
   amendment to the Farmersville Zoning Ordinance
