CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
The 2014-2021 Housing Element provides for the identification and analysis of existing
and projected housing needs and articulates the City’s official policies for the
preservation, conservation, improvement and production of housing within the City of
Anaheim.
The City of Anaheim has taken many positive steps to facilitate the production of housing
to meet the needs of its diverse population. In 2004, the City adopted a comprehensive
update to its General Plan that created tremendous opportunities for additional residential
development. Not only were several hundred acres of the City re-designated for
residential development, but also several policies were adopted that serve collectively to
facilitate greatly various forms of infill residential development. For example, one of the
primary objectives of the updated General Plan is to provide additional land use options
for under-utilized strip retail sites along the City’s major right-of-way corridors by
redesignating much of the City’s mid-block retail sites to a variety of residential
designations. During the General Plan review process, the City simultaneously updated
its Zoning Code. Multiple-family zones were modified to better address the infill nature
of new multiple-family housing in Anaheim. Setbacks for multiple-family housing
adjacent to single-family areas, a situation which commonly exists in Anaheim, were
modified to provide for more design flexibility. In addition, the City increased the
                                                            DRAFT
permitted height of multi-family development beyond the historic 2-story limit.
In 2005, the City Council adopted an Affordable Housing Strategic Plan with a goal of
                                                                DRAFT
causing development of 1,328 affordable rental housing units by the end of 2009. Two
thirds of these units will target low and very-low income households. The City Council
subsequently increased the 2005-2009 Strategic Plan goal to 1,349 units. In October
2009, the City Council extended the Strategic Plan through 2014 and increased the goal
to 2,812 units. The City Council also diversified the Strategic Plan to include affordable
for-sale housing, rehabilitation of existing structures and preservation of “At-Risk” rental
housing. Since 2005, 1,511 new rental, for-sale and rehabilitation units have been
completed with another 655 in the development pipeline for a total of 2,166 affordable
units. The City was not mandated to create the strategic plan or set this housing
production goal. Instead, the City Council was proactive in addressing this issue in
response to its identified needs. In addition to building these units, the City has provided
other incentives to further encourage the development of affordable housing, such as a
new Density Bonus ordinance to implement updated State law effective in 2005 and an
expedited City review and entitlement process for affordable housing projects.

A.       P U R PO S E A N D C O N T E N T
The City of Anaheim’s Housing Element is a required component of the City’s General
Plan that addresses adequate housing opportunities for present and future Anaheim
residents through 2021. The Housing Element provides the primary policy guidance for
local decision-making related to housing. The Housing Element is the only General Plan
Element that requires review and certification by the State of California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD).
The Housing Element provides a detailed analysis of Anaheim’s demographic, economic
and housing characteristics as required by California Government Code Section 65583,
et. seq. (“State Law”). The Housing Element also provides a comprehensive evaluation of
the City’s progress in implementing the past policy and action programs related to
housing production, preservation and conservation. Based on the community’s existing
housing needs, available resources, constraints and opportunities for housing production
and preservation and past performance, the Housing Element identifies goals, objectives
and action programs that address the housing needs of present and future residents.
B.       H O U S I N G E L E M E N T U PDA T E P R O C E S S
The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and
suitable living environment for every Californian as the State’s main housing goal.
Recognizing the important role that local planning programs play in pursuit of this goal,
the Legislature has mandated that all cities and counties prepare a Housing Element as
part of their comprehensive General Plans (California Government Code Section
65302(c)).
It is intended that this Housing Element be reviewed annually and updated and modified
not less than every eight years in order to remain relevant and useful and reflect the
community’s changing housing needs. This Housing Element covers the planning period
from October 2013 to October 2021. The time frame of the planning period is determined
by State law, which mandates that jurisdictions within the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) region update and adopt their Housing Element by
October 15, 2013. This document represents the update required and responds to the
issues that currently face the City.

The Housing Element is one of the seven General Plan elements mandated by the State of
California, as articulated in Sections 65580 to 65589.8 of the California Government
Code. State Law requires that each jurisdiction’s Housing Element consist of “an

goals, policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled program actions for the preservation,
improvement, and development of housing.” The Housing Element plans for the
provision of housing for all segments of the population.
Section 65583, et seq. of the Government Code sets forth specific requirements regarding
the scope and content of each Housing Element. Table 1-1 summarizes these
requirements and identifies the applicable sections in the Housing Element where these
requirements are addressed.

State Law requires internal consistency among the various elements of a General Plan.
Section 65300.5 of the Government Code states that the General Plan’s various elements
shall provide an integrated and internally consistent and compatible statement of policy.
City staff has reviewed the other elements of the General Plan and has determined that
this Housing Element provides consistency with the other elements of the General Plan.
The City will maintain this consistency as future General Plan amendments are processed
by evaluating proposed amendments for consistency with all elements of the General
Plan.

The City of Anaheim Housing Element is organized into four parts:
    •   Chapter 1: Introduction. Explains the purpose, process and contents of the
        Housing Element;
    •   Chapter 2: Housing Needs. Describes the demographic and economic and
        housing characteristics of Anaheim as well as the current and projected housing
        needs;

This Housing Element was developed through the combined efforts of City staff, the
Housing Element Ad Hoc Committee, the City's Planning Commission, the City’s
Housing and Community Development Commission, the City Council, the Anaheim
Redevelopment Agency and the Anaheim Housing Authority. Citizen input was received
through public workshops, an online survey, written comments received by City staff and
public testimony at the Housing Element Ad Hoc Committee meetings. The notices for
these workshops were published in a local newspaper, prominently posted at City Hall
and on the City’s website, announced and provided to the Neighborhood Councils,
provided at City’s public libraries, and mailed to parties that had expressed an interest in
the Housing Element update. Notices and flyers were provided in both English and
Spanish. In addition, organizations that represent the interests of lower income and
special needs households, or are otherwise involved in the development of affordable
housing, were invited to participate in the public workshops.

The City formed a 10-member Housing Element Ad Hoc Committee. Each City Council
member appointed one Anaheim resident and one stakeholder, who need not reside in the
City, to the Committee. The Committee provided representative assistance in the review
and preparation of the updated Housing Element to help ensure that the document is an
accurate reflection of the City’s collective vision for the future of housing development
within Anaheim. Each Committee member, and the Committee as a whole, was
responsible for:
    • Attending and participating in Committee meetings
    • Providing recommendations on Housing Element goals and policies
    • Reviewing draft Housing Element documents
The minutes from the Ad Hoc Committee meetings are provided in Appendix A1.

CHAPTER 2:
HOUSING NEEDS ANALYSIS
A.      INTRODUCTION
When preparing the Housing Element, jurisdictions must evaluate both existing and
future housing needs for all income groups.
This chapter analyzes demographic and housing characteristics that influence the demand
for and availability of housing. The analyses form a foundation for establishing programs
and policies that seek to address identified housing needs. Housing needs are identified
according to income, tenure and special needs groups.
Primary data sources include the 2010 U.S. Census, 2010 and 2011 American
Community Survey (ACS), the California Department of Finance (DOF), and the
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). These data sources are the
most reliable for assessing existing conditions and provide a basis for consistent
comparison with historical data and the basis for forecasts. The American Community
Survey provides an opportunity to utilize updated information for the timeframe between
the decennial censuses. The ACS provides data to illustrate trends and change in the
community. Additionally, the 2010 Census provides less data than the 2000 Census, so
ACS data is helpful in bridging the data gaps.

The City of Anaheim is one of 34 cities within the County of Orange. DOF estimates
Orange County’s population was 3,055,792 in 2012, the third largest county population
in the state. In 2012, Los Angeles and San Diego counties had the first and second largest
county populations in the State. In 2010, Orange County had the third largest county
population in California with 3,010,232 residents. Overall, the County has experienced
rapid population growth over the last two decades. From 2000 to 2010, the County
population increased by 5.4 percent. Table 2-1 lists the counties in southern California
and their respective populations.

According to the U.S. Census and DOF, the population in Anaheim was 328,014 in 2000;
336,265 in 2010; and 343,793 in 2012. Anaheim experienced a 23 percent population
increase between 2000 and 2010, and a 1.5 percent increase between 2010 and 2012. As
indicated in Figure 2-1, the Center for Demographic Research at Cal State Fullerton
forecasts a leveling population growth rate over the next 20 years with a forecast
population of approximately 397,563 in 2030.
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is a metropolitan planning
organization representing six counties and 191 cities and is charged with planning for
growth and sustainability within the region. The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is a
long-range transportation plan that is developed and updated by SCAG every four years.
The RTP provides a vision for transportation investments throughout the region. Using
growth forecasts and economic trends that project out over a 20-year period, the RTP
considers the role of transportation in the broader context of economic, environmental,
and quality-of-life goals for the future, identifying regional transportation strategies to
address our mobility needs. The Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) is a newly
required element of the RTP. The SCS will integrate land use and transportation
strategies that will achieve Air Resources Board (ARB) emissions reduction targets.
Population projections and demographic research from the 2010 U.S. Census and 2005-
2009 American Community Survey are compiled by and approved by SCAG and made
available on SCAG’s website.

b.       Race and Ethnicity
Anaheim residents are predominantly comprised of two racial/ethnic groups: White and
Hispanic. As of 2010, nearly 53 percent of Anaheim residents were of Hispanic origin
and over 27 percent were White. Between 2000 and 2010, the White population declined
by over 20 percent for a second decade in a row, while persons of Hispanic origin
increased by over 13 percent. The Asian population was the third largest ethnic group in
the city with over 14 percent of the population. The Asian population increased by over

opportunities within the City can lead to growth in demand for housing in proximity to
jobs. The quality and/or pay of available employment can determine the need for various
housing types and prices.

b.       Household Income
The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) publishes an annual
median family income for the purpose of determining program eligibility. The 2012
median family income (MFI) for Orange County is $85,300.
The State of California uses five income categories to determine housing affordability.
These categories are as follows:
    •    Extremely Low Income: 30% or less of the median family income;
    •    Very Low Income: 31% to 50% of the median family income;
    •    Low Income: 51% to 80% of the median family income;
    •    Moderate Income: 81% to 120% of the median family income;
    •    Above Moderate Income: Greater than 120% of the median family income.
Table 2-11 shows the State-defined income ranges for each income category based on the
2012 HUD MFI for Orange County. The State-defined income limits for the Extremely
Low-, Very Low-, and Low-Income categories equals those defined by the HUD for use
in its Section 8 Program. The Section 8 Program provides rental assistance for
households earning 50 percent less than the median family income. The State then sets
the Moderate-Income limits at 120 percent of the median figure. Through the Housing
Element, the State-defined income limits are used for consistency unless otherwise noted.

b.       Tenure
In 2011, 46 percent of the City’s housing units were owner-occupied and 54 percent were
renter-occupied. As shown in Table 2-18, the percentage of renter-occupied units in the
City of Anaheim was more that the County and the State.

c.       Vacancy Rates
Vacancy rates are an indicator of housing supply and housing demand. Low vacancy
rates influence greater upward price pressures and suggest households may have trouble
finding housing with an affordable monthly payment. A higher vacancy rate indicates
downward price pressure and may suggest an over supply of housing units. A four to
five percent vacancy rate is considered “healthy.” As shown in Table 2-19, in 2010 the
vacancy rate in the City of Anaheim was 6.5 percent. In 2011, the vacancy rate in the
City lowered to 5.5 percent.

d.       Age of Housing Stock
The age of a housing unit is often an indicator of housing conditions. In general, housing
that is 30 years or older may be in need of repairs based on the resilience of the materials

used. Housing over 50 years old is considered aged and is more likely to exhibit a need
for major repairs.
Table 2-20 categorizes the City of Anaheim’s housing units by year of construction.
According to the American Community Survey, over 70 percent of the housing units in
the City were built before 1980 and 27.8 percent were built before 1960. In the years
between 1950 and 1980, the City of Anaheim experienced the highest period of housing
construction accounting for 65 percent of the housing stock. Two percent of the City’s
housing stock was built prior to 1939.

The ACS also provides data on housing tenure by age of housing stock. Approximately
74 percent of owner-occupied units in the City were built before 1980 and about 33.4
percent were built before 1960. Of the renter-occupied units, 68.2 percent were built
before 1980 and 22.8 percent were built before 1960. Table 2-21 provides a summary of
tenure by age of housing stock.

e.        Housing Conditions
Housing is considered substandard when conditions are found to be below the minimum
standard of living conditions defined in Section 17920.3 of the California Health and
Safety Code. Households living in substandard conditions are considered to be in need of
housing assistance due to the threat of such conditions to their health and safety.
In addition to structural deficiencies and standards, the lack of infrastructure and utilities
often serves as an indicator for substandard conditions. As shown in Table 2-22, the
ACS identified 432 occupied units in the City of Anaheim that lacked complete plumbing
facilities. Complete plumbing facilities include: hot or cold piped water, a flush toilet,
and a bathtub or shower. All three types of facilities must be located within the housing
unit. Of these units, 56 were owner-occupied and 376 were renter-occupied. The ACS
also reported that 1,548 units in the City of Anaheim lacked complete kitchen facilities.
Of these units, 101 were owner-occupied and 1,447 were renter-occupied. It should be
noted that there may be some overlap in the number of substandard housing units, as
some units may lack both complete plumbing and kitchen facilities.

Anaheim neighborhoods are designated for planning purposes as Levels I through IV.
Each level designation identifies the characteristics or conditions of the neighborhood as
well as responses by City departments to address these conditions. The City has identified
five Level IV neighborhoods and six Level III neighborhoods. The City has not
specifically identified neighborhoods that meet the criteria for Level I or Level II
neighborhoods.
Level I neighborhoods are characterized as very sound neighborhoods experiencing few,
if any, quality of life issues and infrequent requests for Police and Code Enforcement
services.
Level II neighborhoods are characterized as fundamentally sound neighborhoods that are
beginning to show signs of decline. Generally, housing structures are lacking
maintenance and in single-family neighborhoods, there number of homes occupied by
their owners is decreasing. The Police Department and Code Enforcement Division are
receiving an increase in calls for service.
Level III neighborhoods are characterized by moderate to substantial decline. Many of
the housing structures within these neighborhoods are deteriorated. In single-family
areas, many houses have transitioned from being owner-occupied to rentals. In addition,
these neighborhoods may lack key essentials such as streetlights, sidewalks, curbs and
gutters and have an increasing number of calls for Police and Code Enforcement services.
Level IV neighborhoods are characterized by severe social, economic and physical
decline. Housing structures are severely deteriorated and the entire neighborhood lacks
characteristics which contribute to a safe overall neighborhood living environment.
Police and Code Enforcement continue to receive high volume of calls for service.
There are approximately 2,811 dwelling units within the Level III neighborhoods and 560
dwelling units within the Level IV neighborhoods. Of the units in the Level III
neighborhoods, the City estimates 70 percent are substandard units and are in need of
rehabilitation or replacement. Of those units in the Level IV neighborhoods, the City
estimates 90 percent are substandard units and need rehabilitation or replacement. The
neighborhoods that have been identified as Level III and IV neighborhoods are shown in
Exhibit 2-1.

This section evaluates housing costs in the City of Anaheim for both rental and owner-
occupied units.
a.     Existing and New Home Price Trends
In 2011, the median market value for all owner-occupied units in the City of Anaheim
was $373,000. As shown in Table 2-23, 6.6 percent of owner-occupied units were valued
below $100,000. Data indicates that 4 percent of owner-occupied units were valued
between $100,000 and $199,999; 10.8 percent were valued between $200,000 and
$299,999; and almost 79 percent were valued at $300,000 or more.

c.       Affordability Gap Analysis
The cost of home ownership and renting can be compared to a household’s ability to pay
for housing. Housing affordability is defined as paying no more than 30 percent of
household income on housing expenses. Table 2-27 summarizes affordable rents and
purchase prices by income categories based on the State-defined income limits for
Orange County. Affordable purchase price assumes a six percent interest rate with a 30-
year fully amortized mortgage.

d.       Rental Affordability
In the third quarter of 2012, households within the Very Low-Income group would be
able to afford average monthly rent in the City of Anaheim, for a studio apartment or one
bedroom/one bathroom unit. The Low-Income group and above would be able to afford a
unit with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms or smaller based on the average rents.
e.       Ownership Affordability
The median sales price for new and resale-housing units in the City of Anaheim in 2012
continues to exceed the affordability range for all income categories except Above
Moderate-Income households. Lower-Income households may have difficulty finding
housing they can afford to purchase. This indicates greater affordability pressure for
ownership housing.
C.       H O U S I N G N E ED S
1.       Households Overpaying for Housing and Overcrowding
a.       Overpayment
Overpayment is defined as households paying more than 30 percent of their gross income
on housing related expenses. This includes rent or mortgage payments and utilities. High
housing costs can cause households to spend a disproportionate percentage of their
income on housing. This may result in financial difficulties, deferred maintenance or
overcrowding.
Adopted February 4, 2014                                                                           2-23

                                                 Chapter 2: Housing Needs Analysis
According to HUD, in the period between 2005 and 2009, 74.2 percent of the total
households in the City of Anaheim experience overpayment. As shown in Table 2-28, of
the owner-occupied households, approximately 87 percent experience overpayment; and,
of the renter-occupied households, approximately 63 percent experience overpayment.
Thirty percent of owner-occupied households overpaying for housing earn over 100
percent of the median income. It is important to note that some owner households may
choose to allocate a higher percentage of their disposable monthly income in housing
costs, which may explain this high percentage. Of the renter households overpaying for
housing, 38 percent are Extremely Low-Income and 34 percent are Very Low-Income.

b.      Overcrowding
Overcrowding is defined as households having an average of more than one person per
room. Overcrowding can put a strain on public facilities and services, reduce the quality
of the physical environment, and create conditions that contribute to the deterioration of
the housing stock.
Tables 2-29 and 2-30 summarize American Community Survey estimates of
overcrowding in the City of Anaheim cited by the SCAG Existing Housing Needs Data
Report and HUD. Sixteen percent of the City’s total households are overcrowded.
Instances of overcrowding vary by tenure. Approximately 7.5 percent of owner
households are overcrowded and 25.6 percent of renter households are overcrowded. Of
the overcrowded owner-occupied households, 24.5 percent earn over 100 percent of the
median household income. In renter-occupied households, overcrowding is more
prevalent in the Lower-Income categories. Twenty-five percent of overcrowded renter
households are Extremely Low-Income; 29 percent are Very Low-Income; and 28.3
percent are Low-Income.

2.       2014-2021 Growth Needs
SCAG is responsible for allocating housing needs to each jurisdiction in its region. A
local jurisdiction’s “fair-share” of regional housing need is the number of additional
housing units that will need to be constructed in the jurisdiction in order to accommodate
the forecast growth in the number of households, to replace expected demolitions and
conversion of housing units to non-housing uses, and to achieve a future vacancy rate that
allows for healthy functioning of the housing market. The allocation is divided into four
income categories: Very Low, Low, Moderate, and Above Moderate. The allocation is
further adjusted to avoid an over-concentration of Lower-Income households in any one
jurisdiction. Based on the requirements of AB 2634, each jurisdiction must address the
projected need of Extremely Low-Income households, defined as households earning less
than 30 percent of the County MFI. The projected Extremely Low-Income need is
assumed to be 50 percent of the Very-Low Income need.
Table 2-31 summarizes the 2014-2021 Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the City
of Anaheim.

3.      Special Needs Population
Certain segments of the population have more difficulty in finding decent, affordable
housing due to their special circumstances; therefore a more focused assessment of their
needs is required. This section identifies the needs of elderly persons, large households,
female-headed households, persons with disabilities, homeless persons and farm workers.
In addition to the data from the 2010 U.S. Census and the 2011 ACS, this section also
uses data from the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) published by
HUD. The CHAS provides information related to households with housing problems,
including overpayment, overcrowding and/or without complete kitchen facilities and
plumbing systems. The CHAS data is based on the US Census Bureau’s 2005-2009
American Community Survey 5-year data files, but differs from the standard files by
including a variety of housing need variables split by HUD-defined income limits and
HUD-specified household types.
a.      Elderly Persons
Elderly persons are considered a special needs group because most are retired and have
fixed incomes. Elderly persons often have special needs related to housing location and
construction. Because of limited mobility, elderly persons typically need to have easy
access to public facilities (e.g. medical and shopping) and public transit. In terms of
housing construction, the elderly may need ramps, handrails, elevators, lower cabinets
and counters, and special security devices to allow for greater self-sufficiency and
protection.
According to the 2011 ACS, 18.3 percent of the City of Anaheim residents were elderly
(age 65 and over). As shown in Table 2-32, elderly households comprised 24.4 percent of
owner-occupied households and 13.1 percent of renter-occupied households.

As shown in Table 2-35, 29.5 percent of the elderly population in the City of Anaheim
had a “self-care” or “independent living” disability based on the 2009-2011 ACS.
Persons with self-care difficulty report having difficulty dressing or bathing. Persons with
independent living difficulty report having difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting
a doctor’s office or shopping. Elderly persons with disabilities limiting independent
living often need housing with modifications, such as ramps and bathroom grab bars, in
order to accommodate their physical needs. There was no disability reporting in the 2010
Census.

According to 2005-2009 CHAS data, 68 percent of elderly renter-occupied households
and 32 percent of elderly owner-occupied households experience overpayment. The
increasing number of elderly persons in the population is creating a demand for more
affordable housing. The City will address the needs of the elderly population through the
development of policies and programs that will address affordability and special design
guidelines for the elderly. Table 2-36 provides a summary of housing problems
experienced by elderly households in the City of Anaheim.

with at least five persons, representing 21.8 percent of the total households in the City. Of
these large households, owner-occupied units and renter-occupied units were nearly
equally distributed with slightly more renter-occupied units.

According to the 2005-2009 CHAS data, 58 percent of large renter-occupied households
and 26 percent of large owner-occupied households experience overpayment. Currently,
less than six percent of the City’s rental housing stock has four or more bedrooms (refer
to Table 2-15) resulting in a high percentage of lower-income large family households
that are forced to live in overcrowded situations. Table 2-38 provides a summary of
housing problems experienced by large households in the City of Anaheim.

    c.       Female-Headed Households
    Female-headed households are a special needs group due to comparatively low rates of
    homeownership, lower incomes, and high poverty rates. Female-headed households are
    those in which the adult resident is female and there are no adult males residing in the
    household. According to the 2011 ACS, there were 9,857 female-headed households with
    children and 6,365 female-headed households without children in the City of Anaheim.
    Approximately 16.5 percent of all occupied households are female-headed. Of the total
    number of female-headed households in the City, 34 percent were owner-occupied and
    nearly 66 percent were renter-occupied. Data for female-headed households is shown in
    Table 2-39 and 2-40.

SB 812, which took effect January 2011, amended State Housing Element law to require
the analysis of the disabled to include an evaluation of the special housing needs of
persons with developmental disabilities. A "developmental disability" is defined as a
disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years old, continues, or can be
expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that
individual. This includes Mental Retardation, Cerebral Palsy, Epilepsy, and Autism. The
US Census does not have specific information regarding persons with developmental
disabilities. However, each nonprofit regional center contracted with the California
Department of Developmental Services maintains an accounting of the number of
persons served. The Regional Center of Orange County is one of 21 private non-profit
organizations contracted by the State of California to coordinate lifelong services and
support for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. Through the
Lanterman Act, RCOC helps those with developmental disabilities with the appropriate
living arrangements whether in-home or in a facility. The Regional Center currently
serves 2,454 persons with developmental disabilities living in Anaheim. The largest age
group of Anaheim residents served by the Regional Center is 23 to 54 years (41.0 percent
of clients).
e.       Homeless Population and Transitional Housing
Enumeration of the homeless population is difficult because of the transient nature of this
population, and the existence of the “hidden homeless” or persons that move around in
temporary housing situations. Limited information is recorded during shelter intake,
making it even more difficult to determine the number of homeless. There are several
data sources for the homeless population in Anaheim. The most recent data regarding the
homeless population in Anaheim from SCAG Existing Housing Needs Data Report
reports 176 homeless persons within Anaheim from the 2010 US Census.

Table 2-44 shows data from the Orange County 2012 Housing Inventory Count (HIC)
and Point in Time Count (PIT) which also estimate the homeless population. On January
27, 2012, the HIC reported 315 beds and 292 homeless people sheltered. On January 27,
2011, the HIC reported 224 beds and 207 homeless people sheltered.
The 2011 Unsheltered Point in Time Count conducted on January 22, 2011 reported
4,272 homeless people in Orange County. The homeless counted were asked where they
were living before they most recently became homeless and 17.4 percent of the
unsheltered homeless answered Anaheim. The estimate of unsheltered homeless persons
on the night of January 22, 2011 who resided in Anaheim prior to becoming homeless
was 743.

Anaheim has a number of motels that serve as residences for individuals and families
who would otherwise be homeless. These “motel families” are not included in the Point-
in-Time Homeless Count as the motels are not considered shelters. The City participates
in the Collaboration to Assist Motel Families along with a number of non-profit
organizations and other public agencies. According to the Collaboration, the County of
Orange, Department of Environmental Health reports there are 483 hotels and motels in
the County of Orange; 140 of these are hotels and motels in Anaheim. The majority of
the hotels in Anaheim, particularly those near the Disneyland resort, cater to tourists, and
therefore the homeless are less likely to use these for shelter due to prohibitive costs. The
City of Anaheim estimates there are between 50 to 75 “residential motels” in Anaheim
where homeless families are likely to reside. A census of families and individuals living
in motels in Anaheim has not been conducted.
A number of service providers in the City of Anaheim provide shelter, food and other
supportive services. Numerous churches and religious organizations within Anaheim
provide food to the homeless through Food Banks.

percent of the City’s labor force, were employed in agriculture (or related industries). It is
assumed that only a small percentage of persons employed in this industry are involved in
active agricultural production and harvest. Therefore, there is no apparent or recognized
need for farm worker housing.
g.        Extremely Low-Income Households
Extremely Low-Income (ELI) is defined as households with income less than 30 percent
of the area median income. The provisions of Government Code Section 65583 (a)(1)
require quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of Extremely
Low-Income households. In 2011, 5.4 percent of Anaheim households were within the
Extremely Low-Income category (refer to Table 1-13; household income less than
$25,000).
Table 2-45 provides a summary of housing problems experienced by lower income
households in the City of Anaheim. Extremely Low-Income renter-occupied households
experience overpayment and overcrowding. According to Table 2-46, 87 percent of
Extremely Low-Income households experience at least one type of housing problem.

CHAPTER 3:
RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
A.     INTRODUCTION
State Housing Element law requires that local jurisdictions identify and analyze potential
and actual governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, or development of
housing for all income levels, including housing for persons with disabilities. The
analysis should identify specific standards and processes and evaluate their impact on the
supply and affordability of housing. The analysis should determine whether local
regulatory standards pose an actual constraint and demonstrate local efforts to remove
constraints that hinder a jurisdiction from meeting its housing need. Local jurisdictions
must analyze potential non-governmental constraints which are primarily market-driven
and generally outside direct local government control. The Housing Element must
analyze the impacts of the cost of land, construction costs, and the availability of
funding/financing.
This chapter includes identification and description of potential governmental and non-
governmental constraints. While the local standards and processes analyzed may
influence how housing is developed, maintained or improved in Anaheim, they are not
necessarily an undue constraint on housing. The standards and processes implemented by
the City allow for the development, maintenance and improvement of housing that
contributes to quality of life in Anaheim.
This chapter also describes financial and organizational resources that support housing
development, housing maintenance and improvement and the ability of residents to afford
housing in Anaheim.

Governmental constraints are policies, standards, requirements and actions imposed by
the government which affect the development and provision of housing. These
constraints may include building codes, land use controls, growth management measures,

and federal agencies play a role in the imposition of governmental constraints, however
these agencies are beyond the influence of local government and are therefore not
addressed in this analysis.

Governmental resources include programs that provide funds for housing-related
activities, as well as, incentives provided by the local jurisdiction for the provision of
housing.

Land use controls include General Plan policies, zoning designations and regulations,
permit processing requirements and development fees.
a.      G e n e r a l Pl a n
Every city in California must have a General Plan, which establishes its land use-related
goals and policies. The General Plan is the foundation of all land use controls in a
jurisdiction. The Land Use Element of the General Plan identifies the location,
distribution and density of the land uses within the City. Residential densities are
expressed in dwelling units per acre (du/ac). The Anaheim General Plan identifies six
residential land use designations and one residential mixed-use designation. Table 3-1
summarizes Anaheim’s residential land use designations and their associated acreages
and density ranges.

According to the current General Plan, a total of 131,385 dwelling units are anticipated
within the City’s planning areas at build-out. As of January 2012, the State Department
of Finance (DOF) reports that 105,657 dwelling units exist in Anaheim. This leaves a
remaining capacity of 25,728 new dwelling units.
Depending on land costs, certain densities are needed to make a housing project
economically feasible for people at various income levels. The following densities
required to accommodate construction affordable to specific income levels are generally
accepted by HCD:
    •    Very Low- and Low Income: 30 dwelling units per acre minimum
    •    Moderate Income: 11-30 dwelling units per acre minimum
    •    Above-Moderate Income: Up to 11 dwelling units per acre
In addition to the generally accepted densities, Assembly Bill 2348 established “default”
density standards. If a local government has adopted density standards consistent with the
established population criteria, sites with those density standards are accepted as
appropriate for accommodating the jurisdiction’s share of regional housing need for
lower income households. For jurisdictions such as Anaheim in metropolitan counties,
the “default” density is a minimum of 30 dwelling units per acre.
b.       Zoning Code
The Zoning Code is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan. It is designed to
protect and promote public health, safety and welfare, as well as to promote quality
design and quality of life. The City of Anaheim’s residential zoning designations control

both the use and development standards of each residential parcel, thereby influencing
the development of housing.
Table 3-2 summarizes the permitted residential uses in the residential and mixed-use
zones. Single-family residential zones include three designations for hillside areas: RH-1,
RH-2, RH-3 (Single-family hillside) and four designations for other areas of the City:
RS-1, RS-2, RS-3 and RS-4 (Single-family). Single-family, detached units are permitted
by right in all of the single-family residential zones, except for RS-4 where a conditional
use permit is required.
The multi-family residential zones are RM-1, RM-2, RM-3 and RM-4. Multi-family
dwellings are permitted by right in the RM-2, RM-3 and RM-4 zones. They are subject to
a conditional use permit in the RM-1 zone. Single-family attached dwellings are
permitted by right in the RM-2 zone and require a conditional use permit in the RM-1,
RM-3 and RM-4 zones. Single-family detached units are permitted by right in the RM-2,
RM-3 and RM-4 zones when combined with single-family attached dwellings in the same
project. Single-family detached units are subject to a conditional use permit in the RM-1
zone.
The City of Anaheim has also established three mixed use overlay zones: the Platinum
Triangle Mixed Use Overlay (PTMU), the Downtown Mixed Use Overlay (DMU) and
the Mixed Use Overlay (MU). The PTMU Overlay Zone covers approximately 590 acres
within the Platinum Triangle. The DMU Overly Zone covers approximately 37 acres in
the Downtown area. The MU Overlay Zone can be used in conjunction with any
underlying zone in the City.
To implement the 2006-2014 Housing Element policy program, the City established the
Residential Opportunity (RO) Overlay Zone. This Overlay Zone can be applied to
properties that are currently zoned and/or developed with non-residential uses but
designated for multiple-family residential uses by the City’s General Plan. The Overlay
Zone is intended to serve as an implementation tool of the City’s Housing Element by
facilitating residential development on identified “housing opportunity sites.” The RO
Overlay Zone may be applied to properties that currently maintain an underlying non-
residential zone designation within the City. The RO Overlay Zone may also be applied
to properties with an existing residential zoning designation that does not yield the
maximum density allowed by a property’s General Plan designation. Parcels designated
as Medium Density Residential in the General Plan Land Use Element are subject to the
RM-4 zoning designation. Parcels designated as Low-Medium Density Residential in the
General Plan Land Use Element are subject to the RM-3 zoning designation.

process. In addition to the housing types shown in Table 3-2, the City also permits or
conditionally permits mobile home parks, residential care facilities, convalescent and rest
homes, group care facilities, senior second units, second units and senior citizen housing
in many of the residential and non-residential zones.

Single family detached dwellings are defined as “…one dwelling unit on a single lot,
which dwelling is separated from any other dwelling unit. This use class includes
detached condominiums and detached single-family dwellings in other common interest
developments, as defined in Section 1351 of the California Civil Code, as it may be
amended from time to time. Manufactured homes certified under the National Mobile
Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, which are installed on a
permanent foundation approved by the City, are also included.” (Anaheim Municipal
Code Section 18.90) A manufactured/factory built house is considered to be single-family
detached dwelling.
Single family attached dwellings are defined as “one dwelling unit, on a single lot,
constructed with a common wall, with one or more single-family units located on other
lots. This use class includes attached condominiums and attached single-family
dwellings in other common interest developments, as defined in Section 1351 of the
California Civil Code, as it may be amended from time to time.” (Anaheim Municipal
Code Section 18.90)
Multiple family dwellings are defined as “two or more dwelling units within the same
structure, located on a single lot, each with its own kitchen and bathroom facilities.”
(Anaheim Municipal Code Section 18.90)
The Zoning Code does not differentiate between owner-occupied and rental uses, with
the exception of projects utilizing the density bonus ordinance for affordable housing in
that rental units may be entitled to additional density bonus incentives.

Table 3-4 summarizes the single-family residential zoning designations and their
requirements. Tables 3-5 and 3-6 summarize the multi-family residential designations
and requirements. Table 3-7 summarizes the requirements for mixed-use residential
development.
The maximum number of units allowed in a multi-family residential development is
determined primarily by the minimum lot area required per dwelling unit, the maximum
allowable site coverage and the maximum permitted building height. Of these three
standards, the minimum lot area required per dwelling unit is the most important in
determining the number of units that can be developed on a site. This standard accounts
for the minimum size of the unit based on bedroom count and the necessary parking and
recreational space for each unit. Based on the numerous constructed and approved multi-
family projects in Anaheim that have been developed while adhering to these standards,
the City has not found that the development standards adversely impact the cost and
supply of the housing or the ability to achieve maximum densities.

i.       Downtown Mixed Use (DMU)
The Downtown Mixed-Use (DMU) Overlay Zone was adopted in 2003 in order to
introduce a mixed-use setting into a 36-acre portion of the Downtown area. The Overlay
provides maximum flexibility while encouraging consistency between the City's historic
architecture and new development. The Overlay Zone does not have any setback, height
or density requirements thereby allowing for maximum design flexibility. Development
requires approval of a Final Site Plan, which is reviewed for consistency with the
standards for the DMU Overlay Zone, including the Design Guidelines for the
Downtown Mixed Use Overlay. The guidelines allow for the use of innovative solutions
to design constraints. Approval of a Final Site Plan is required prior to approval of
grading or building plans. The Final Site Plan is reviewed by the Planning Commission;
however, it does not require a public hearing. If the Final Site Plan is found in
conformance with the DMU Overlay Zone, it is approved. Development within the
DMU Overlay Zone typically falls within the environmental analysis completed by a
previously certified EIR for the existing Redevelopment Area and thus does not require

further environmental review, which also helps streamline the development review
process. Since its adoption, 6.5 acres have been developed or are under construction
pursuant to the DMU Overlay Zone, resulting in 129 condominium-units, 277 apartment
units, over 55,000 square feet of commercial uses and a 13,000 square foot
cultural/heritage center (the Muzeo). The densities for this development range from 44 to
102 dwelling units/acre. Because the Overlay Zone allows for maximum design creativity
and does not require public hearings for development approvals, it been a successful tool
towards introducing high density, mixed-use development to the Downtown area.
ii.     Mixed Use (MU) Overlay Zone
The Mixed Use (MU) Overlay Zone was adopted in 2004 to implement the General Plan
Mixed Use land use designation in areas outside of the City's DMU Overlay Zone and
The Platinum Triangle. The MU Overlay Zone allows development at densities of up to
60 dwelling units per acre, much higher than any of the City's residential zones. Since
mixed-use development in the MU Overlay Zone is not specific to one geographic area,
project proposals will vary from project to project and location to location. The
conditional use permit process allows development flexibility for these projects as long as
the Planning Commission can determine that the development meets the following
criteria that can be supported with evidentiary findings: (1) the proposed use will not
adversely affect the adjoining land uses, or the growth and development of the area in
which it is proposed to be located; (2) the size and shape of the site proposed for the use
is adequate to allow the full development of the proposed use, in a manner not
detrimental to either the particular area or health and safety; (3) the traffic generated by
the proposed use will not impose an undue burden upon the streets and highways
designed and improved to carry the traffic in the area; and, (4) the granting of the
conditional use permit under the conditions imposed, if any, will not be detrimental to the
health and safety of the citizens of the City of Anaheim. Since 2004, approximately eight
acres have been reclassified to the MU Overlay Zone. Development has included a 52-
unit apartment complex with 36 units affordable to very-low income families and 15
units affordable to low income families. Another project includes the preservation of a
historic commercial building and historic homes. Development proposals have not yet
been submitted for the remaining properties in the MU Overlay Zone.
iii.    Platinum Triangle Mixed Use (PTMU) Overlay Zone
Development within Sub Area A of the Gateway District of the Platinum Triangle Mixed
Use (PTMU) Overlay Zone is subject to the approval of a conditional use permit. A
conditional use permit was approved for this area in 2005 for a specific development
project (Archstone Gateway). This project encompasses the entirety of Sub Area A and
has been completed. The application for this project was submitted prior to the adoption
of the PTMU Overlay Zone. Due to the complex nature of this project (the 884-unit
apartment complex is located in two cities) and the amount of design work that was
completed prior to the adoption of the PTMU Overlay Zone; it was determined that a
3-18                                                                 Adopted February 4, 2014

conditional use permit would be the best tool to allow greater design flexibility to
accommodate the unique characteristics of this project.

Table 3-9 summarizes the residential parking requirements in Anaheim. Parking
requirements do not constrain the development of housing directly. However, parking
requirements may reduce the amount of available lot areas for residential development.
The City determines the required number of parking spaces based on the type and size of
residential unit and has found the required parking spaces to be necessary to
accommodate the number of vehicles typically associated with each residence. It should
also be noted that uncovered parking spaces, such as those allowed to meet the parking
requirements for multi-family residential development, are not included in the calculation
of lot coverage. Based on the numerous constructed and approved projects in the
Anaheim, the City has found that the parking requirements do not unduly impact the cost
and supply of housing.

2.      Density Bonus Ordinance
In order to encourage the construction of affordable housing developments for very low
low and moderate income households, and in accordance with Chapter 4.3 Section 65915
et. seq. of the California Government Code, the City of Anaheim has adopted a Density
Bonus Ordinance (Chapter 18.52 of the Municipal Code). Upon request from the
applicant, the City grants a density bonus based on the percentage of affordable units,
senior housing units or transfer of land to the City for development of very-low income
housing units or the provision of child care facilities. Projects qualifying for the density
bonus also receive reduced parking requirements, concessions and other development
incentives.
a.       G e n e r a l D e n s i t y B o n u s f o r A f f o r da b l e U n i t s
The City grants a density bonus for developments providing units affordable to and
occupied by moderate, low and very-low income persons and households. The project
must have a minimum of five units and an affordability covenant is required for at least
30 years. Table 3-10 outlines the density bonuses allowed based on the percentage of
units in each affordability category in conformity with State law.

b.      Density Bonus for Senior Housing
Senior housing developments meeting the criteria of California Civil Code Sections 51.3
and 51.12 are granted a density bonus of 20 percent. Section A.3 of this chapter describes
the City’s Senior Citizen’s Apartment Projects Ordinance.
Adopted February 4, 2014                                                                    3-21

c.       D e n s i t y B o n u s f o r T r a n s f e r of L a nd
Upon application and pursuant to the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance, the City grants a
density bonus when an applicant agrees to donate land to the City for the development of
very-low income affordable units. The transferred land must be at least one net acre or of
sufficient size to develop at least 40 units. The land must also be sufficient in size to
permit construction of affordable units equal or greater than ten percent of the number of
units proposed by the associated subdivision map, parcel map or residential development
approval. The transferred land must also have the appropriate zoning and general plan
designation, be or will be served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure, and be
within the boundary of the proposed development or another acceptable area. The density
bonus is based on the percentage calculated by number affordable units to be built on the
transferred land divided by the total number of units in the proposed housing
development. Table 3-11 shows the density bonus granted based on percentage of very-
low income units. This increase is in addition to any increase in density under the density
bonus for affordable units up to a maximum combined density bonus of 35 percent.

A density bonus, or another incentive of equivalent financial value, is granted for a
condominium conversion project when the applicant agrees to provide at least 33 percent
of the total ownership units to low or moderate income households or 15 percent to lower
income households. The density bonus is a 25 percent increase in units over the number
of units otherwise legally permitted.
e.       D e n s i t y B o n u s f o r C hi l d C a r e F a c i l i ti e s
Developments that qualify for a density bonus and include child care facilities located
on-site or adjacent to the development are granted an additional density bonus equal to or
greater than the amount of square feet of the child care facility. In lieu of the density
bonus, an additional concession or incentive that contributes significantly to the
economic feasibility of the construction of the childcare facilities can be granted.

         Development
The City has developed significant incentives and allows for concessions to encourage
affordable rental housing development through its Density Bonus Ordinance. The
Ordinance, which goes above and beyond State-mandated density bonus provisions, was
developed in a cooperative effort between the City and affordable housing advocacy
interests. Qualifying affordable rental housing developments are granted a density bonus
of 35 percent. A qualifying project must be at least one acre in size with at least 36 units
unless this requirement is waived by the Planning Director. A minimum of 20 percent of
the total units or five units, whichever is greater, must be affordable to very-low income
households for at least 55 years. In order to encourage development of housing suitable
for families, no more than 30 percent of the total units in the development can be one
bedroom units, unless the development is targeted for a special needs population and
approved by the Planning Director.
g.       Development Incentives
Anaheim’s development incentives are organized in two tiers. Tier One Incentives are
granted through ministerial review. Tier Two Incentives are granted through a public
hearing process before the Planning Commission. The number of incentives granted is
based on the percentage of affordable units provided. Projects proposing a child care
facility that is granted a density bonus receive one additional incentive. Affordable Rental
Housing Developments receive any and all Tier One Incentives and up to three Tier Two
Incentives. Table 3-12 lists the number of incentives granted by the level and percentage
of affordability.

The Zoning Code allows Senior Citizen Housing in all multi-family zones and the
Neighborhood (C-NC), Regional (C-R) and General (C-G) commercial zones with a
conditional use permit. Development standards for Senior Citizen Housing are found in
Chapter 18.50 (Senior Citizens’ Apartment Projects) of the Municipal Code. Projects are
reviewed for design, compatibility with existing neighborhood scale and character and a
high level of livability for senior citizens. Any proposal for a senior citizens' apartment
project shall include adequate consideration and information as to the location of the site
in relation to the proximity and accessibility to necessary services, including grocery
stores, transit stops, medical facilities and banks. As a condition of approval for a senior
citizens’ apartment project, at least 49 percent of the total dwelling units must be
affordable to very-low income households with an affordability covenant for at least 30
years.

To accommodate its share of the region’s homeless, there are numerous non-profit
organizations within the City of Anaheim and adjacent jurisdictions that offer shelter and
services to homeless persons. Non-profit organizations that have received funding
through the City’s Emergency Shelter Grant program include: Anaheim Interfaith
Shelter, Colette’s Children’s Home, H.I.S. House, Mental Health Association, Mercy
House Transitional Living Centers, Inc., Thomas House, WISEPlace and Women’s
Transitional Living Center (WTLC). The City also participates in the Orange County
Continuum of Care Community Forum. The City works within this collaborative to help
identify needs and gaps in the housing/service needs of the region’s homeless.
State Housing Law requires that cities identify sites that are adequately zoned for
homeless shelters and transitional housing. Additionally, cities must not unduly
discourage or deter these uses. Table 3-15 provides a summary of emergency shelters and
transitional housing in Anaheim.

excluding properties within Development area 5 or 6. However, emergency shelters are
not permitted in either zone on parcels designated by the General Plan for any residential
use, including mixed-use residential. Emergency shelters for more than 50 occupants are
subject to a conditional use permit in the Industrial Zone or the Northeast Area Specific
Plan No. 94-1 Zone. Religious institutions located within the Industrial Zone may
establish on-site Emergency Shelters for up to 50 occupants without the need to amend an
existing conditional use permit or apply for a new conditional use permit, regardless of
current combined capacity with any existing Emergency Shelters currently in operation.

During implementation of the 2006-2014 Housing Element, the City analyzed areas of
the City that met the locational criteria described above to identify parcels which could
accommodate emergency shelters. These “emergency shelter opportunity areas” are
shown on Exhibit 3-1. There are 1,218 parcels within the emergency shelter opportunity
areas. These parcels total 1,615 acres and the average parcel size is 2.07 acres. These
parcels include areas that are currently underutilized, or have potential for reuse.
b.      Transitional and Supportive Housing
Supportive Housing, as defined by Section 50675.14 of the California Health and Safety
Code, is housing with no limit on the length of stay and that is occupied by a target
population. The target population for supportive housing includes low-income persons
having one or more disabilities. These disabilities may include mental illness, HIV or
AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health conditions. Such housing is also linked to
on-site or off-site services that assist residents in retaining their housing, improving their
health status, and maximizing their ability to live and, when possible, work in the
community. On and off-site services may include, but are not limited to, tutoring, child
care, and career counseling.
Transitional Housing, as defined by Section 50675.2 of the California Health and Safety
Code, is housing configured as rental housing developments, which may include multi-
family housing, single-family housing, or group homes. Such housing is operated under
State or Federal program requirements that call for termination of assistance and
recirculation of the housing unit to another eligible program recipient at some
predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six months. Additional
services that help individuals gain necessary life skills that support independent living are
also allowed but not mandated.
State law allows a distinction in the permitting requirements for certain residential uses in
single-family homes based on whether there are six or fewer, or seven or more people
served by the housing type. This size distinction currently exists in the City’s Zoning
Code for Residential and Group Care Facilities. Residential and Group Care Facilities
provide 24-hour per day residential living accommodations in exchange for the payment
of money or other consideration, where the duration of tenancy is determined, in whole or
in part, by the individual resident's participation in group or individual activities, such as
counseling, recovery planning, or medical or therapeutic assistance. Residential or Group
Care Facilities include, but are not limited to, residential care facilities for persons with
3-30                                                                    Adopted February 4, 2014

chronic, life-threatening illnesses, and alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment
facilities. Residential Care Facilities provide residential living accommodations for six or
fewer persons and Group Care Facilities provide living accommodations for seven or
more persons.
In single-family residential zones, the City permits Supportive and Transitional Housing
for six or fewer people in the same manner as a single-family dwelling unit, consistent
with the current provisions for a Residential Care Facility. If the use is for seven or more
people, a conditional use permit is required, consistent with the requirement for a Group
Care Facility. Supportive and Transitional Housing is permitted as a matter of right
within multiple-family residential and mixed use zones, regardless of the number of
persons the housing serves.
c.       Single Room Occupancy Units
Single Room Occupancy (SRO) housing provides an opportunity to meet the needs of
very-low income persons and households and serve the needs of the homeless population.
The Anaheim City Council adopted a Single Room Occupancy Housing Policy in 1991.
The intent of the policy is to provide development incentives to the private sector to
develop SRO housing without public subsidy. The City of Anaheim policy identifies a
SRO development as a building designed as a residential hotel consisting of at least 100
furnished single-room guest units with not more than two occupants in each unit. A SRO
unit is a unit in a SRO development designed to accommodate no more than one resident.
A Living Unit is a unit in an SRO development designed to accommodate no more than
two residents. Each unit has its own bathroom and limited kitchen facilities. Twenty
percent of the total number of units in an SRO development must be affordable to
persons earning no more than 30 percent above minimum wage and 29 percent must be
affordable to very-low income persons earning not more than 50 percent of the Orange
County median income.
SRO developments may be located in the General Commercial (C-G) and Industrial (I)
zones. SRO’s are subject to a conditional use permit and require a management plan be
developed and adhered to. Each project is reviewed and the conditional use permit is
granted by the Planning Commission. The process is not intended to deter the use of
SRO’s, but to ensure development of high quality projects located in appropriate areas
with services and facilities to assist the SRO development residents. General provisions
include requirements for locating near employment services and public transit, maximum
persons allowed to reside in each unit and minimum furnishings and amenities. Each
project is required to have a management plan based on the City’s standard management
plan to ensure consistency in the requirements from project to project.
Parking requirements are as follows:
    • Minimum of 0.8 spaces per SRO unit and 1.6 spaces per Living Unit.
    • Additional 1.0 space for each resident staff member and 0.5 space for all
         remaining personnel.
Adopted February 4, 2014                                                                 3-33

                                                                             Housing Element
                                                 Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints
    • Additional 0.2 space per unit for guest parking.
Parking requirements may be reduced based on the location of bus stops or provision of
mass transit incentives.
The development standards, permit procedures and standard conditions of approval
provide consistency that encourages and facilitates the development of SRO’s. Since the
adoption of the policy, the City has received two applications for SRO’s. Both of the
applications were approved by the Planning Commission. However, the developers
elected not to proceed with the projects.
5.      Second Dwelling Units
Second dwelling units provide additional opportunities to provide housing for people of
all ages and economic levels, while preserving the integrity and character of single-
family residential neighborhoods. The City of Anaheim permits second units in the RH-1,
RH-2, RH-3, RS-1 and RS-2 zones, provided certain requirements are met.
Requirements for a second unit include:
    • Minimum lot size of 5,000 square feet;
    • Minimum total floor area of 400 square feet for an efficiency unit and 550 square
        feet for a one or two-bedroom unit;
    • Maximum total floor area of 30 percent of the main dwelling unit living area for
        an attached second unit. If the main dwelling unit is 1,334 square feet or less in
        size, a 400 square foot efficiency unit is permitted;
    • Maximum total floor area of 50 percent of the main dwelling unit living area or
        1,200 square feet, whichever is less, for a detached second unit;
    • No more than two bedrooms;
    • Minimum separation of 10 feet between the main dwelling and a detached second
        unit; and,
    • One off-street parking space for an efficiency or one-bedroom unit and two spaces
        for a two-bedroom unit.

The U.S. Census Bureau defines persons with disabilities as those with a long-lasting
physical, mental or emotional condition. This condition can make it difficult for a person
to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or
remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being able to go outside the
home alone or to work at a job or business.
The City of Anaheim allows, by-right, residential care facilities for 6 or fewer persons in
any residential zone. Group care facilities for seven or more persons are permitted subject

                                                                        Housing Element
                                                 Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints
to a conditional use permit in any commercial zone as well as the Public Recreational
(PR) and Semi-public (SP) zones.
The City’s Municipal Code defines a Family as “An individual or a collective body of
persons, living together as a single housekeeping unit, in a domestic relationship based
upon birth, marriage or other domestic bond of social, economic and psychological
commitments to each other, as distinguished from a group occupying a boardinghouse,
lodging house, club, fraternity, sorority, hotel, motel, or any residential or group care
facility requiring a conditional use permit.” The City’s interpretation of the definition of
“family” is broad in that it includes unrelated persons living together, except in the
situations explicitly called out within the definition. This definition is consistent with
State law.
Residential care facilities are considered a residential use and are not subject to
discretionary review, provided the project meets the development standards and
requirements for the zone it is located in. These projects are administratively reviewed by
the City staff for compliance with applicable codes. The City does not have maximum
concentration requirements for residential care facilities.
Group care facilities are subject to discretionary review by the Planning Commission and
require granting of a conditional use permit. The Planning Commission may establish
such conditions as it may determine to be reasonably necessary to safeguard and protect
the public health and safety, promote the general welfare, and ensure the development of
any use authorized in accordance with approved plans, provided such conditions are
reasonably related to the impacts of the use of the property for which the conditional use
permit is requested.
The City approved a conditional use permit for a group care facility in February 2008.
The conditions of approval for this project included:
    • That no required parking areas shall be fenced or otherwise enclosed for outdoor
         storage uses.
    • That no public telephones on the property shall be located outside the building.
    • That trash storage areas shall be permanently provided in a location acceptable to
         the Public Works Department, Streets and Sanitation Division.
    • That final landscaping plans shall be submitted to the Planning Department for
         review and approval. Any decision made by the Planning Department may be
         appealed to the Planning Commission as a Reports and Recommendations item.
    • That the property shall be permanently maintained in any orderly fashion through
         the provision of regular landscaping maintenance, removal of trash or debris, and
         removal of graffiti within twenty-four hours from the time of discovery.
The conditions are no different than those that would be applied to other conditionally
permitted uses in the same zone. The City also allowed the project to provide less than
the required parking spaces through a parking waiver.
Adopted February 4, 2014                                                                3-35

                                                   Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints
Parking requirements for residential care facilities are the same as those for residential
uses in their applicable zones. Group care facilities are required to provide a minimum of
0.8 parking spaces per bed.
Based on approved projects in Anaheim, the City’s development standards and
procedures, including site planning requirements, do not constrain housing for persons
with disabilities.
The City amended the Municipal Code in 2011 to establish reasonable accommodations
procedures. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a
disability, their representative or any entity, when the application of a zoning law or other
land use regulation, policy or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. A
request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the
rules, standards, practices and procedures regulating the siting, development or use of
housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide
a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice. An application for
a request for reasonable accommodation can be filed with the Planning Department.
a.      H o u s i n g f o r P e r so n s w i t h D e v el o p m e n t a l D i s a b i l i t i e s
There are a number of housing types and opportunities appropriate for people living with
a developmental disability, including rent subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed
single-family homes, Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home purchase, HUD
housing, and SB 962 homes. SB 962 homes are licensed residential facilities for adults
with developmental disabilities who are medically fragile and require around the clock
licensed nursing support. The design of housing-accessibility modifications, the
proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities are
some of the considerations that are important in serving this group. Incorporating
‘barrier-free’ design in all, new multifamily housing (as required by California and
Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially important to provide the widest range of choices
for disabled residents. Special consideration should also be given to the affordability of
housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
In order to assist in the housing needs for persons with developmental disabilities, the
City coordinates with the Regional Center of Orange County to promote opportunities for
supportive living services and support efforts to eliminate barriers for housing for persons
with developmental disabilities.

Building and safety codes are adopted to preserve public health and safety, and ensure the
construction of safe and decent housing. These codes and standards also have the
potential to increase the cost of housing construction or maintenance.

a.      B u i l di n g C o d e s
The City of Anaheim has adopted the 2010 California Building Code and 2010 California
Residential Code, which is based on the 2009 International Building Code and 2009
International Residential code and establishes construction standards for all residential
buildings. The Code is designed to protect the public health, safety and welfare of
Anaheim’s residents. The City amends the Code as needed to further define requirements
based on the unique local conditions.
The City’s adopted amendments to the 2010 California Residential Code include the
following:
    • Completed Table R301.2(1) Climatic and Geographic Design Criteria to include
        information/requirements specific to the local conditions.
    • Revised Section R403.1.3 by deleting the “Exception” for stem walls.
    • Revised Section R405.1 by deleting the “Exception” relating to drainage systems
        for foundations retaining earth.
    • Revised Section R902.1 to allow only class A or B roofs.
Anaheim’s amendments to the Code are generally consistent with the amendments
adopted by other local jurisdictions in Orange County. The City requires plan check,
issues building permits and conducts inspections to ensure compliance with the building
and zoning codes.
b.      C o d e E n f o r c e m en t
Code enforcement in the City is performed both proactively and on a complaint basis.
The City responds to community-reported concerns related to zoning and building code
violations. In addition, the City has also developed a proactive, interdepartmental
program to identify neighborhoods with deteriorated housing structures and high volume
of calls for Police and Code Enforcement service (see Chapter 2, Section 4.e). The City
provides assistance in these neighborhoods to address issues and improve and maintain
the housing stock.
Based on its analysis, the City finds the Code, local amendments and building and zoning
code enforcement activities to not be constraints to the development, maintenance or
preservation of housing.
c.      A m e ri c a n s wi t h D i s a b i l i t i e s A c t
The Federal Fair Housing Act of 1998 (FHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) are federal laws intended to assist in providing safe and accessible housing. ADA
provisions include requirements for a minimum percentage of units in new developments

to be fully accessible for persons with physical disabilities. Compliance with these
regulations may increase the cost of housing construction as well as the cost of
rehabilitating older units, which may be required to comply with current codes. However,
the enforcement of ADA requirements is not at the discretion of the City, but is mandated
under federal law.
8.        D e v e l o p m e n t F e es
Various development and permit fees are charged by the City and other agencies to cover
administrative processing costs associated with development. These fees ensure quality
development and the provision of adequate services. Often times, development fees are
passed through to renters and homeowners in the price/rent of housing, thus affecting the
affordability of housing.
The City of Anaheim charges the majority of environmental, planning and engineering
fees on an hourly basis. This ensures the fees are sufficient enough to cover costs
incurred by the City for processing development applications, while not burdening
developers with unnecessary fees.

Based on recent projects (Colony Park III, Donovan Ranch and Oakhaven Circle), the
City has found development fees for single family residential development are
approximately $22,000 per unit. The development fees per unit decrease slightly as the
number of units in the project increase. Assuming the cost of land and construction for a
typical single-family unit is approximately $575,000, the development fees are
approximately 3.8% of the total development cost.
Based on recent multi-family projects (Anton Monaco, Cherry Orchard, and The Vintage
Crossings), the development fees can range from approximately $9,000 per unit to
$17,500 per unit. Assuming the cost of developing a typical 2-bedroom unit in Anaheim
is approximately $193,600, the development fees are approximately 4.6 to 9.0 percent of
the total development cost.

Considerable holding costs are associated with delays in processing development
applications and plans. At times, these holding costs are passed through to renters and
homeowners in the price/rent of housing, thus affecting the affordability. The City of
Anaheim’s development process is designed to accommodate housing development
applications of various levels of complexity and requiring different entitlements. Three

levels of decision-making bodies govern the review process in Anaheim: the Zoning
Administrator, the Planning Commission and the City Council. In addition, if a project
conforms to all Code requirements, the approval can be completed at a staff level.
Certain projects, including affordable housing developments requesting density bonus
incentives, require a pre-file application and review. The pre-file process is designed to
review preliminary plans for compliance with city ordinances and standards, identify
necessary on-site or off-site improvements and to determine the adequacy of the
application. The pre-file process is intended to streamline the overall permitting process,
by providing an opportunity for the applicant to evaluate his or her compliance with
development requirements early in the process, in order to minimize the need for later
plan revisions. This process also provides an opportunity for staff to communicate any
necessary fees, exactions or dedications prior to the filing of a final development
application. Once staff has reviewed and commented on the project, the applicant then
submits a final application for any necessary entitlements.
The Planning Department offers expedited review for affordable housing projects. This
service represents a significant step that has been taken towards reducing the cost of
developing affordable housing. Table 3-17 illustrates the typical time for applications for
standard and affordable housing projects.

a.      Environmental Constraints
Environmental hazards conditions affecting housing units include seismic hazards, risk of
landslides, flooding, toxic and hazardous waste, fire hazards and noise. The following
sections describe hazards that may impact future development of residential units
generally in the city. The potential environmental impacts associated with the sites
identified to meet the City’s RHNA need have been evaluated either as part of a project
entitlement (for the current, in-the-pipeline projects) or as part of Housing Opportunity
Sites Rezoning Project Supplement Environmental Impact Report certified in September
2013. Based on the previous analyses, there are no known environmental constraints that
preclude residential development or cannot be mitigated to allow for development during
the planning period.
i.      Seismic Hazards
Similar to most Southern California cities, Anaheim is located within an area considered
to be seismically active. There are no earthquake faults zoned under the Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zoning Act within the City boundaries. The Alquist-Priolo Act prevents
the construction of buildings used for human occupancy on the surface trace of active
faults. Anaheim is located between two major active fault zones- the Newport-Inglewood
fault zone and the Whittier-Elsinore fault zone. The Newport-Inglewood fault passes
within seven miles of the western limits of the City. It is considered capable of generating
an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 on the Richter scale. The Whittier-Elsinore fault
passes within one mile of the northeastern end of the City and is capable of generating an
earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale. The potential for ground rupture
due to seismic activity in the City is considered low.
ii.     Landslides
Areas of landslide potential have been identified by the City. In the Hill and Canyon
areas of the City, landslides have occurred in the past. The Santiago Landslide
encompasses approximately 25 acres and became active in 1993. The City established a
Geologic Hazard abatement district to maintain, monitor and manage the dewatering
system being used as a mitigation measure in this area.
iii.    Flooding
Anaheim is partially located in an alluvial plain. The Santa Ana River flows through the
eastern part of the City. Portions of the City are located in within the 100-year and 500-
year floodplains. The majority of the Hill and Canyon areas south of Santa Ana Canyon
Road are outside of the 500-year floodplain. Anaheim participates in the National Flood
3-42                                                                       Adopted February 4, 2014

                                                                         Housing Element
                                                 Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints
Insurance Program (NFIP). The City adopts and enforces certain floodplain management
ordinances and, in return, residents can purchase Federally-backed flood insurance.
Flooding due to dam failure is also a potential hazard for Anaheim. Dam failure at
Walnut Canyon Reservoir, Prado Dam, and Carbon Canyon Dam could potentially
impact the City.
iv.     Toxic and Hazardous Wastes
There are a number of land uses within the City of Anaheim whose operations include the
use of hazardous materials. The Environmental Protection Section of the Anaheim Fire
Department administers the hazardous materials program for the City. The Fire
Department has also developed a Hazardous Materials Area Plan to assist agencies in
pre-emergency planning and their emergency response role.
v.      Fire Hazards
The City continues to address the need to defend persons and property from urban and
wildland fires. The central and western portions of Anaheim are highly urbanized and
relatively built-out. The Hill and Canyon area of the City are still threatened by the
potential for wildland fires due to their less developed state with more brush and natural
resources. Properties within Very High Fire Severity Zones and Special Protection Areas
have been identified by the City and are subject to specific standards and regulations to
prevent fires. New developments within high fire hazard areas are subject to Chapter 7A
requirements of the California Building Code. The City currently operates 11 fire stations
within City boundaries. Anaheim is also part of a regional coordination effort with other
Orange County cities called the Metro Cities Fire Authority.
vi.     Noise
Residential land uses are generally considered to be the most sensitive to loud noises. The
principal noise sources in Anaheim are the transportation systems. Roadways are the
primary source of transportation-generated noise. There are also two Metrolink/Amtrak
stations and two railroad freight lines which generate noise. The City’s Planning
Department currently considers noise in the project review process and works with the
applicant to use site planning and other design strategies to reduce noise impacts.
b.      Infrastructure Constraints
i.      Water
Anaheim operates its own water utility and water treatment plant. The water system
services Anaheim, as well as, some unincorporated areas in Orange County. The City
utilizes water from two main sources: groundwater produced by City-owned wells and
imported water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. As of 2011,
Adopted February 4, 2014                                                                3-43

                                                                        Housing Element
                                                 Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints
the City’s water system has 18 active wells, 13 reservoirs, and 752 miles of water mains.
Recent legislation (SBx7-7) requires each urban retail water supplier to develop urban
water use targets to help meet a 20 percent reduction in urban per capita use by 2020 and
an interim 10 percent reduction goal by 2015. The City’s 2010 Urban Water Management
Plan describes the strategies by which the City will meet these goals. According to the
2010 Urban Water Management Plan, the City’s water system will serve a population of
nearly 433,000 people by 2035. The City is capable of providing their customers all their
demands in multiple dry years from 2015 through 2035 with a demand increase of 8.7
percent.
ii.     Sewer
Sewage is collected by City collector facilities and conveyed to trunk sewers owned and
maintained by the Orange County Sanitation District, which then treats the sewage at
regional facilities. Small portions of Anaheim local sewer receive service from adjacent
agencies, including the Stanton County Water District and the Garden Grove Sanitation
District. The City currently maintains over 500 miles of sewer lines. The City has
identified areas with sewer deficiencies. An analysis of these deficiencies in relation to
the development of housing is provided in Appendix B-2. The deficient areas have been
identified in the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and will be upgraded as part
of the Program to accommodate new or increased construction of residential units. Costs
associated with these improvements are funded by a sewer user charge and development
impact fees. The City's total sewer capacity, based on these planned improvements, can
accommodate the City's RHNA needs for the 2014-2021 Planning Period.
iii.    Water and Sewer Prioritization Policy
The City of Anaheim established a process to prioritize water and sewer improvements
associated with affordable housing development. In 2007, the City Council adopted a
policy to grant priority for the provision of available and future resources or services to
proposed housing developments that help meet the City’s share of the regional housing
needs for lower income households as identified in the Housing Element and any
amendments to the Housing Element. If the City’s Urban Water Management Plan
identifies the need for the Public Utilities Department to allocate water supplies in the
future, priority for uncommitted water supplies will be granted to applications for water
services for proposed developments that include housing units affordable for lower
income households. In cases of insufficient sewer capacity for potential affordable
housing development sites where funding is not immediately available to correct the
deficiency, the City’s Public Works Department will work cooperatively with the
applicant and other city staff to identify alternative solutions and methods to adequately
serve the proposed project.

11.      Successor Agency to the Anaheim Redevelopment
         Agency
Prior to 2012, much of the affordable housing development in Anaheim was assisted by
the Anaheim Redevelopment Agency through funding and other incentives. Effective
February 1, 2012, the Anaheim Redevelopment Agency was dissolved, consistent with
the dissolution of redevelopment agencies across the state per AB 26. This legislation
provided for the establishment of a Successor Agency to administer the enforceable
obligations of the former Anaheim Redevelopment Agency, all subject to the approval of
an Oversight Board comprised of representatives of the local agencies that serve the
redevelopment project area: the city, county, special districts, and K-14 educational
agencies. On January 10, 2012, The City Council of the City of Anaheim elected to serve
as the Successor to the Anaheim Redevelopment Agency. At the same time, the City
Council elected not to serve as successor agency related to the functions and management
of various housing assets, which had previously been managed by the Anaheim
Redevelopment Agency. The Anaheim Housing Authority subsequently assumed housing
functions and assets. The Anaheim Housing Authority as the Successor Agency for
housing functions is charged with carrying out existing obligations and disposing of
property once owned by the Anaheim Redevelopment Agency. Once obligations of the
former Redevelopment Agency are met, the Successor Agency will be discontinued. The
Successor Agency cannot enter into any new contracts or other obligations.

The City’s ability to offer traditional developer incentives to promote housing
development has been greatly reduced by the elimination of Redevelopment in
California. The City continues to offer incentives and concessions to promote affordable
housing development on a project-by-project basis. Incentives and concessions offered to
developers to offset increased costs associated with affordable housing program
requirements can include the following:
    •    Fund Development Fees: Developers may receive financial assistance to cover
         the cost of various development fees.
    •    Land Write Downs: The City/Housing Authority may assist developers by
         writing down the land cost in exchange for the developer providing affordable
         units.
    •    Pre-Development Loans/Grants: The City may provide pre-development loans
         and or grants to help developers offset the costs associated with potential housing
         development projects.
    •    Provide Off-Site Improvements: The City may provide funds for the design and
         construction of various off-site improvements.
    •    Density Bonus: Developers may receive various development incentives under
         the City’s Density Bonus program. The Density Bonus program is intended to
         promote the creation of affordable housing in return for various development
         incentives, including: reduced parking standards, exterior setbacks and zoning
         code variances.

Site improvements required to develop specific sites vary depending on location and
existing infrastructure. As a condition of approval for a tract or parcel map, the
subdivider must dedicate all parcels within the subdivision that are needed for streets,
alleys, including access rights and abutters’ rights, drainage, easements, public utility
easements and other public easements. The subdivider must also agree to improve all
streets, alleys, drainage easements, public utility easements and other public and private
easements. Fees for other public facilities and services may be required if the area of the
development cannot be adequately served by existing facilities and services. For these
areas, the City determines the area of benefit and facilities plan through a public hearing
process. New private developments must provide street trees in parkways between the
sidewalk and the curb. Subdividers must provide park and recreational facilities or pay an
in-lieu fee. Requiring site improvements ensures that the necessary infrastructure is
available for the new development and is necessary to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the residents.
The City has established standard street cross sections and other design standards related
to public facilities such as roadways and infrastructure facilities. Table 3-20 summaries
the street design standards based on the City’s standard street cross sections.

Energy conservation remains a major goal of the City of Anaheim, as outlined in the
General Plan’s Green Element. The City continues to require compliance with Title 24 of
the California Administrative Code on the use of energy efficient appliances and
insulation. Title 24 includes the California Green Building Code (CalGreen), which
requires energy efficiency and green building technologies to be incorporated into any
new construction, or additions or alterations to existing buildings requiring a building
permit. Through compliance with Title 24, new residential development has produced
reduced energy demands.
The City, through the Anaheim Public Utilities Department, provides information,
technical assistance and incentives to residents and businesses related to energy
conservation measures. Anaheim Public Utilities has developed a Green Building
Program, which offers incentives to builders developing projects under the U.S. Green
Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), California
Green Build, or Build It Green’s Green Building Guidelines.
Anaheim currently offers incentives of up to $6,000 for residential projects meeting the
standards upon certification by USGBC (LEED), California Green Build, Build It Green
or other rating programs. The City also offers a New Construction Incentives Program
which contributes up to $15,000 for design assistance to find the most cost-effective,
energy-efficient options for the development.
Additional residential efficiency programs and incentives provided by Anaheim Utilities,
or promoted through the Utilities website include:
    • Dusk to Dawn Lighting
    • EV Charger Rebates
    • Green Power
    • Home Incentives Rebates
    • Home Utility Check-Up

A thorough analysis of vacant and underutilized land within the City of Anaheim is
provided in Appendix B.
2.       Land Prices
Land costs increases have a tremendous influence on the cost of housing and the
availability of affordable housing. Land prices are determined by a number of factors,
most important of which are land availability and permitted development density. As land
becomes less available, the price of land increases. Generally, the price of land also
increases as the number of units permitted on each lot increases. In Orange County,
undeveloped land is limited, and combined with a rapidly growing population, land prices
have increased.
Given the current downturn in the real estate market, land price projections are difficult
to track accurately. Development of for-sale housing has all but stopped, as the financial
markets are reluctant to provide construction and permanent loans due to the sluggish
market. At its peak, land for residential development was selling for approximately $2
million per acre in Central Anaheim.
3.       C o n s t r u c ti o n C os t s
Construction costs are primarily determined by the costs of materials and labor. They are
also influenced by market demands and market-based changes in the cost of materials.
Construction costs depend on the type of unit being built and the quality of the product
being produced. Table 3-21 summarizes the estimated construction costs based on type of
development in Anaheim.

4.       Financing
Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing. Higher
interest rates increase a homebuyer’s monthly payment and decrease the range of housing
that a household can afford. Lower interest rates result in a lower cost and lower monthly
payments for the homebuyer.
When interest rates rise, the market typically compensates by decreasing housing prices.
Similarly, when interest rates decrease, housing prices begin to rise. There is often a lag
in the market, causing housing prices to remain high when interest rates rise until the
market catches up. Lower income households often find it most difficult to purchase a
home during this time period.
As shown in Table 3-22, the number of loan applications increases as income increases.
The percentage of persons denied for a home loan in Orange County is highest for the
very-low income (less than 50 percent of the MFI) category with 24.7 percent.

Figure 3-1 shows the average interest rates between February 2012 and January 2013.
The interest rates have generally decreased in the past year. Interest rates are determined
by national policies and economic conditions and there is little that a local government
can do to affect these rates. However, in order to extend home buying opportunities to
Lower-Income households, jurisdictions can offer interest rate write-downs. Additionally,
government insured loan programs may be available to reduce mortgage down payment
requirements
Nation-wide there has been a large increase in the number of delinquencies and
foreclosures on residential loans in the last five years. As a result, lenders have more
stringent qualifications for home loans and Lower-Income households may find it more
difficult to qualify.

CHAPTER 4
HOUSING POLICY PROGRAM
This section of the Housing Element describes the Policy Program for the 2014-2021
Planning Period. The Policy Program identifies the specific policy actions necessary to
address present and future housing needs, meet the specific requirements of State law,
and consider the input by residents and stakeholders. The emphasis of the 2014-2021
Policy Program is on actions enabling the City to maintain and increase housing
opportunities affordable to extremely-low, very-low, low and moderate income
households.
In developing this Policy Program, the City assessed its housing needs, evaluated the
performance of existing programs, considered the availability of existing and projected
funding resources and received input from the community through extensive outreach
efforts.
A number of the policy actions identified in the policy program are dependent upon on
variety of external funding sources, including: Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership (HOME), and Emergency Solutions Grant
(ESG). These funds are used for specific policy actions and assist in the leveraging
private and public funds, such as developer equity and low income housing tax credits.
Prior to the adoption of the 2014-2021 Housing Element, the largest single source of
funds came from the Housing Set-Aside fund, which had generated approximately $14
million annually from tax increment revenues and were utilized to increase, improve and
preserve affordable housing. The demise of Redevelopment in California has
significantly degraded the City of Anaheim’s ability to assist in the provision of
affordable housing. The City must now seek alternative sources of funding/financing and
more strategically prioritize the use of CDBG, HOME and ESG funds that are allocated
annually by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). As an
entitlement City, Anaheim is eligible to receive an automatic funding allocation as long
as it has submitted, and received approval of, its five-year Consolidated Plan and Annual
Action Plans. The most recent fiscal year allocations show a trend of reduced allocations.
Adopted February 4, 2014                                                               4-1

                                                   Chapter 4: Housing Policy Program
A.       KEY POLICY CONSIDERATIONS
In order to develop a comprehensive strategy to preserve and expand housing
opportunities for extremely-low, very-low, low, and moderate income households and
address the development challenges unique to the City of Anaheim, it is important to
understand the needs of local stakeholders, the current real estate market and the type and
condition of existing housing stock. A complete overview of these factors is provided in
Chapter 2 of this Element.
Through the City’s efforts to engage its citizenry and stakeholders in the planning
process, a number of housing challenges, opportunities and resources were identified.
The Housing Element Ad Hoc Committee further identified and refined important areas
to consider in policy development. A summary of the community outreach process and its
results is provided in Appendix A.
The input from the community and the Housing Element Ad Hoc Committee, in
conjunction with the needs analysis provided in Chapter 2, resulted in identifying a series
of Policy Considerations which provide the primary guidance for the 2014-2021 Planning
Period.
Policy Consideration 1.0: Financing and Funding for Housing Development
The recent downturn in housing has resulted in a number of challenges to the
development of affordable housing in Anaheim. The private sector’s ability to acquire
funding and financing has been limited by more stringent qualification guidelines for pre-
development and construction financing and the now limited ability to utilize local
government funding and assistance to create viable development opportunities.
Additionally, the demise of Redevelopment in California has resulted in a significant and
undeniable negative impact on the City’s ability to assist in creating and maintaining
affordable housing. The City of Anaheim must now evaluate alternative sources and
methods of funding and financing to bridge the gap created by the loss of Redevelopment.
Policy Consideration 2.0: Growth Needs
The City of Anaheim’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment allocation for the 2012-2014
Housing Element is 5,702 units. In comparison to other cities in Orange County,
Anaheim’s allocation represents a large share of the County’s overall need. Limited land
resources, the loss of Redevelopment tax-increment, construction costs and other
funding/financing considerations significantly influence the ability of the private market
to provide a variety of housing choices to meet the needs for a variety of income levels.

                                                                          Housing Element
                                                   Chapter 4: Housing Policy Program
Policy Consideration 3.0: Utilization of Existing Resources for Housing
The available funding and staffing to address projected housing need is limited.
Therefore, the City must anticipate and pursue comprehensive and strategic utilization of
funding sources, prioritize programs and maximize coordinated participation between
public, private and non-profit entities.
Policy Consideration 4.0: Community Design and Sustainability
Anaheim’s community members and stakeholder groups have identified the maintenance
and enhancement of quality of life as an important factor to address when planning for
the City’s future housing needs. The preservation and enhancement of that quality of life
can be accomplished through community design and sustainability concepts that consider
the function and livability of Anaheim’s existing and planned neighborhoods and can
provide financial benefits, as well. Establishment of a holistic approach to community
design and sustainability can have a positive effect on the quality of life in Anaheim.
Policy Consideration 5.0:         Affordable Housing Opportunities for Anaheim’s
Residents
Programs providing fair housing counseling, education and enforcement have been
identified as means to provide affordable housing opportunities for Anaheim’s residents.
Additionally, the loss of Redevelopment has significantly impacted the funding of these
resources provided to the community. The City of Anaheim should strategically address
the specific needs of Anaheim residents through utilization of existing resources in
combination with County, State, Federal, private and non-profit resources. Specifically,
consideration of homelessness, needs of residents with special needs, housing access,
affordability issues, and rental and for-sale housing opportunities can be best addressed
at the local level through target policies and programs sponsored and/or administered by
the City.
Policy Consideration 6.0: Community Education and Outreach
Outreach to all segments of the community and education on housing and housing-
related topics is important to the success of the City’s housing projects and programs.
Through education and outreach, especially thorough non-traditional means, the City
can ensure that information is available for interested community members and maximize
participation in housing programs.
Adopted February 4, 2014                                                                4-3

                                                                         Housing Element
                                                   Chapter 4: Housing Policy Program
Policy Consideration 7.0: Housing Availability and Affordability
The demand for housing in Anaheim remains high due to employment opportunities, its
strategic location and local amenities. Housing costs in Anaheim and the surrounding
region continue to remain higher than what is affordable for many households, especially
the lower-income segments of the population. Additionally, the need for housing suitable
for special needs groups is not always fulfilled by the housing options currently
available. Providing policies and programs to increase available housing for all
segments of the population will help ensure that current residents and those who work in
Anaheim have the opportunity to remain in the City.
Policy Consideration 8.0: Infill and Redevelopment
There are very few areas of undeveloped land remaining in the City and it must rely on
infill and redevelopment sites, some of which are environmentally-challenged, to
accommodate growth. Policies should allow and encourage creative solutions such as
land assemblage and environmental cleanup of “brownfield” sites to maximize the
potential in redeveloping areas of Anaheim.
B.      GUIDING PRINCIPLES
To address the Policy Considerations identified above, the City has established Guiding
Principles that provide the primary policy direction to address its identified needs.
Guiding Principle A: The provision of a high quality, well maintained housing stock is a
primary contributor to quality of life in Anaheim.
Guiding Principle B: The availability of a range of housing choices for a variety of
incomes in Anaheim contributes to a balanced community and community investment.
Guiding Principle C: Persons with special housing needs should have access to a variety
of housing choices that are integrated within the community.
Guiding Principle D: Sustainable design and the efficient utilization of resources create
more livable neighborhoods and can have both environmental and financial benefits.
Guiding Principle E: Community education and outreach is of fundamental importance
to establishing a well-informed, educated community that can participate directly in the
provision, conservation and preservation of housing in Anaheim.

C.       HOUSING STRATEGY AREAS
The Policy Action Plan for the 2014-2021 Housing Element is organized into five core
policy strategy areas:
1. Housing Production – establishes policy actions for the production of a range of
    rental and for-sale housing units in the City.
2. Housing Conservation and Preservation – establishes policy actions for the
    conservation of the existing housing stock and preservation of housing opportunities
    for Anaheim’s residents.
3. Housing Quality and Design – establishes policy actions for providing high-quality,
    well-designed living environments for Anaheim residents.
4. Housing Rehabilitation – establishes policy actions for the rehabilitation and
    improvement of existing housing.
5. Affordable Housing Opportunity – establishes policy actions for the establishment
    of affordable housing opportunity for all segments of Anaheim’s populations.
Policy Strategy #1: Housing Production
Housing Production Strategy 1A: Evaluate Alternative Funding and Financing
Mechanisms
The loss of Redevelopment in California has had a devastating effect on the ability of
local agencies to provide funding and financing resources for the development of
affordable housing. The City of Anaheim has had a demonstrated successful track record
of utilizing Redevelopment Agency set-aside funds to develop affordable housing. With
the loss of this resource, the City must aggressively pursue alternative funding and
financing tools that will contribute to the development of additional affordable housing
opportunities citywide.
On March 1, 2013, across the board budget cuts, referred to as sequestration, cancelled
approximately $85 billion in budgetary resources to federal agencies. These cuts have
resulted in reduced funding levels for the CDBG, HOME, ESG and Housing Choice
Voucher programs, all critical resources needed to address local housing and community
development needs. In the Housing Choice Voucher alone, known cuts will require that
the program serve approximately 500 less families in FY 2013-2014.
Anaheim will collaborate with private, non-profit, state and federal entities to investigate
alternative methods for funding and financing the construction of new housing units and

rehabilitation and preservation of exiting units citywide. As part of this process,
Anaheim will evaluate potential emerging funding sources and programs such as
boomerang, SERAF, SB 341 or other potential local, state, regional and federal funding
to support the production of affordable housing in lieu of the former Affordable Housing
Strategic Plan which was discontinued as a result of the loss of Redevelopment funding.
The City will also establish continued communication with local, state and federal
legislators to encourage the establishment of alternative funding and financing
mechanisms.
Objective:                                     Exploration of alternative     funding    and
                                               financing mechanisms

                                               least an annual basis
Housing Production Strategy 1B: Expedited Processing for Extremely-Low, Very
Low, Low and Moderate Income Housing Developments
The City shall continue to expedite discretionary entitlement and plan check processes for
lower income housing developments. The expedited processing program was initially
developed in 2009 as part of the City’s Affordable Housing Strategic Plan and currently
provides approximately 20 days in time savings. Expedited processing is provided as an
incentive to encourage development of affordable housing projects as shorter
development timeframes results in lower housing production costs.
The City will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the expedited processing program
and modify as needed to further encourage affordable housing development. As part of
this evaluation, the City will analyze and monitor the effectiveness of inter-departmental
coordination to ensure that expedited reviews are occurring in a consistent and
coordinated manner.
Objective:                                     Expedited processing for affordable
                                               housing developments to reduce housing
                                               production costs.

Housing Production Strategy 1C: Affordable Senior Housing Program
The City recognizes the unique needs of its senior population. Seniors typically have
fixed incomes and unique housing needs that are not generally addressed in market rate
housing. The City currently provides incentives for affordable senior housing through
the Senior Citizens’ Apartment Project and Density Bonuses chapters of its Municipal
Code. The City shall continue to encourage the development of quality senior housing
that, when feasible, includes transportation and other appropriate supportive services
specific to this population. In addition to the above incentives, the Housing Authority’s
Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program will continue to serve as a vehicle to help
low income seniors afford units of their choice available in the private market.

Housing Production Strategy 1D: Encourage the Development of Housing for
Extremely-Low Income Households
The City encourages the development of housing units for extremely-low income
households earning less than 30 percent of the Median Family Income for Orange
County. Housing Development projects receiving an allocation of Project Based
Vouchers are required as part of the program to designate the assisted units to extremely-
low income families. In addition, the City continues to provide an expedited review
process for developers applying for Federal and State Tax Credits which requires a
percentage of units be designated to extremely-low income households.              Specific
emphasis shall be placed on the provision of extremely low income households by
encouraging the development of transitional living facilities, permanent special needs
housing, and senior housing. The City currently has a number of incentives that can be
utilized to create opportunities for affordable housing development such as the Density
Bonus and Senior Citizens' Apartment Housing ordinances; down payment assistance
programs; Section 8 programs; deferral of City development fees; exemption of
Transportation and Impact Fees for Affordable Housing Developments; and expedited
processing for tax credit projects. The City will continue to investigate additional
incentives and seek funding opportunities to encourage development of housing for
extremely-low income households.
Objective:                                     Production of a minimum of 50 extremely-
                                               low income units.

Housing Production Strategy 1E:          Encourage the Development of Housing for
Special Needs Households
The City understands the need for housing to accommodate special needs households,
including persons with developmental disabilities. Historically, the City has assisted in
the development of housing projects for special needs households by providing technical
assistance with tax credit applications, and public funds, including, ESG, CDBG, and
HOME. The City shall continue to utilize available incentives to encourage and support
the development of rental housing for special needs families within future affordable
housing projects. Developers and builders of such projects will be required to
incorporate specialized social services to assist the special needs households, in exchange
for these incentives.
The City will coordinate with local developers and non-profit entities specializing in
housing for Special Needs residents to meet existing and future housing needs. The City
will also collaborate with the Orange County Regional Center and other appropriate
organizations to better understand the specialized housing requirements of residents with
special needs.
Additionally, the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, specifically the set aside
pool of 100 vouchers for the Non-Elderly Disabled (NEDs), will continue to serve as a
vehicle for providing housing opportunities for special needs, low income individuals and
families.
Objective:                                      Maintain existing and develop new units
                                                for special needs households

Housing Production Strategy 1F: Implementation of The Platinum Triangle Master
Land Use Plan
During this planning period, the City will continue to implement The Platinum Triangle
Master Land Use Plan and coordinate with developers proposing projects in this area in
an effort to further encourage the production of high density housing. The Platinum
Triangle represents an opportunity to replace an older industrial area with a dynamic
mixed-use development district including higher density housing, residential-serving
retail and amenities and employment-generating commercial/office uses. The Platinum
Triangle Master Land Use Plan was developed in conjunction with the General Plan
Update in 2004 and originally allowed for development of up to 9,825 residential units
within the 393 acres of The Platinum Triangle that are designated for mixed-use
residential development. The City Council subsequently amended the Platinum Triangle
Master Land Use Plan in 2010 and increased the maximum number of permitted
residential units to 18,988 at densities of up to 100 units per acre.
Prior to the adoption of the master land use plan, no residential development was
permitted within this area. Development intensities are allocated to individual properties
on a first come basis through the approval of a development agreement. Since the
creation of the Master Land Use Plan, 8,463 residential units have been entitled for
development. Of these entitled units, 1,920 units have been built and permit applications
for an additional 643 units have been submitted but not yet been issued. An additional
6,543 units have been approved through development agreements. The developers of
these approved units have not applied for building permits. It is anticipated that another
3,206 residential units will be completed in the Platinum Triangle by 2021.
The development agreements approved in conjunction with these projects do not set
minimum rents or sale prices for these developments and, therefore, do not preclude the
development of units affordable to moderate and low-income families. In addition, all of
the City’s programs that encourage affordable housing can be utilized within The
Platinum Triangle, including but not limited to, the Density Bonus and Senior Citizens'
Apartment Housing ordinances; down payment assistance programs; Section 8 programs;
deferral of City development fees; exemption of Transportation and Impact Fees for
Affordable Housing Developments; and expedited processing for tax credit projects.

Housing Production          Strategy    1G:    Development       of  Housing    Information
Clearinghouse
The City continues to refer persons interested in homeownership to Neighborhood
Housing Services, a non-profit agency that assists families with housing opportunities.
To disseminate affordable housing information to a wider audience, the City also
established an information clearinghouse accessible to the general public that provides a
“one stop” location for comprehensive information about Anaheim’s housing projects,
programs, policies, available funding, technical assistance, and other applicable items. In
addition to consolidating information, the City will employ a “go to them” strategy by
placing information in easily accessible locations including the City’s website, public
facilities, at public events and at locations community members frequent. The City shall
continue to maintain and update the clearinghouse as needed and make improvement that
will increase the accessibility and usability of the program.
Objective:                                       Facilitate dissemination of housing
                                                 information

Housing Production Strategy 1H: Support for Community Housing Development
Organizations (CHDOs)
Each year the City receives a funding allocation from the HOME Investment Partnership
Program (HOME). Historically, the City’s HOME allocation has been approximately $2
million per year; the allocation for FY 2013-2014 was $1,101,964, a significant
reduction. Per the HOME program regulations, a minimum of 15 percent of HOME
funds must be allocated to qualified Community Housing Development Organization
(CHDO). A CHDO is a non-profit, community-based organization with the capacity to
develop affordable housing within the community it serves. Only projects in which the
CHDO acts as a developer, sponsor or owner of housing are eligible to receive a part of
the 15 percent of HOME fund allocation. In FY 2013-2014, the amount of HOME funds
allocated for CHDOs is $165,295. The Community Development Department has
partnered with many non-profits and CHDOs in the past to develop affordable projects,
and will continue to do so on future projects.
Objective:                                       Continue to provide funds to qualified
                                                 CHDOs for affordable unit production

Housing Production Strategy 1I: Developer Incentives Program
The City’s ability to offer traditional developer incentives to promote housing
development has been greatly reduced by the elimination of Redevelopment in
California. The incentives and concessions that can still be offered to developers to
offset increased costs associated with the production of affordable housing include:
funding of development fees; write downs of land costs; long-term ground leases of
public property; pre-development loans/grants; funding of off-site improvements; bond
financing; density bonus incentives; fee deferrals; and, assistance with tax credit
applications. Current housing production projections indicate that the Developer
Incentives Program will help create approximately 710 new and rehabilitated affordable
housing units through 2021.
For Non Housing Authority sites, the City will support and seek to utilize any emerging
State and Federal and private funding sources.
Objective:                                    Financial incentives for developers (based
                                              on available funds) to help facilitate the
                                              construction of 710 new and rehabilitated
                                              affordable housing units by 2021

Housing Production Strategy 1J: HOME Homebuyer Program
The HOME Homebuyer Program provides deferred payment second mortgage loans to
assist low income households in purchasing a home. This loan program offers a 3%
simple interest rate and monthly loan payments are deferred for up to 30 years.
Homebuyers are required to provide a minimum 3% down payment. To promote the
availability of the HOME Program Down Payment Assistance Program, the City will
include information, including application requirements, as part of the Housing
Information Clearinghouse (see Housing Production Strategy 1J).

Housing Production Strategy 1L: Development of Emergency Shelters/Transitional
and Supportive Housing in Compliance with SB-2
The City is in full compliance with the provisions of SB-2, establishing provisions that
permit the development of emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing “by-
right” in certain locations.
The City understands the importance of addressing the needs of the temporary and
chronically homeless. To further address this issue, it will work collaboratively with
service providers, advocacy groups and other entities to define any challenges in
providing for the temporary and long-term needs of Anaheim’s homeless. The City will
evaluate the effectiveness of current programs and entitlement procedures and determine
the feasibility of modifying standards, entitlement provisions and other methods of in-
kind and financial assistance to address any identified challenges. As part of this effort,
the City also will explore the feasibility of implementing a fee waiver or reduction
program for non-profit organizations to encourage the development of homeless shelters.
Objective:                                    Development of emergency shelters,

Housing Production Strategy 1M: Re-examination of Development Standards,
Entitlement Processes and Development Fees
The City understands that overly-restrictive development standards, burdensome
entitlement processes and unreasonable development fees can pose a significant barrier to
future residential development. In order to ensure that such conditions do not pose a
local barrier to future housing production, the City will re-examine its residential
development standards, entitlement processes and fees to ensure their reasonableness and
effectiveness in support of future residential development while encouraging innovation,
maintaining compatibility with surrounding neighborhoods, and promoting quality
housing.
Objective:                                     Ensure reasonable development fees,

Housing Production Strategy 1N: Promoting Availability of Housing Opportunity
Sites
Appendix B-3, Housing Opportunity Sites, identifies properties that are designated for
residential land uses by the General Plan and have strong potential to accommodate
future affordable or market rate housing. As a follow-up item to the City’s 2006-2014
Housing Element, in 2013, these sites were re-zoned to include a Residential
Opportunities Overlay Zone that allows by-right residential development on these
properties at densities consistent with their underlying General Plan designations. The
City will continue to refer potential housing developers to these sites as a means to help
ensure that the City meets its Quantified Objectives. By mid-point of the 2014-2021
planning period, the City will also re-evaluate its Housing Opportunity sites to determine
if the program is effective in providing housing opportunities for a variety of income
levels, including lower income and if the Overlay Zone or other strategies can be applied
as a means to further incentivize housing development for a variety of income levels.
Objective:                                     Promotion of Housing Opportunity Sites

Housing Production Strategy 1O: Accommodating Transitional and Supportive
Housing
To accommodate transitional and supportive housing, the City will a revise definitions
for “target population”, “transitional housing” and “supportive housing” in its Municipal
Code consistent with Government Code Section 65582. In addition, the City will amend
the Municipal Code in accordance with Government Code Section 65583(a)(5) to
consider transitional housing and supportive housing as a residential use of property,
subject only to those development standards that apply to other residential dwellings of
the same type in the same zone.
Additionally, the City of Anaheim will review existing separation requirements and
spacing criteria for emergency shelters and revise as appropriate.
Objective:                                     Accommodation of transitional and

Policy Strategy #2: Housing Conservation and Preservation Strategy
Housing Conservation and Preservation Strategy 2A: Monitoring and Preservation
of “At-Risk” Units
To ensure the continued provision of affordable units, the City will regularly monitor the
over 2,200 deed-restricted, affordable housing units that exist citywide. Of these units,
516 have been identified as having the potential of converting to market-rate units during
the planning period as a result of expiring deed restrictions. The City will provide
targeted outreach to owners of these units to encourage the extension and/or renewal of
deed restrictions and/or covenants that ensure affordability. In order to proactively
address units at-risk of conversion, the City shall develop a program to partner with non-
profit housing providers and develop a preservation strategy. The preservation strategy
will allow the City to act quickly if and when notice of conversion is received. As part of
the strategy, the City shall ensure compliance with noticing requirements; conduct tenant
education and pursue funding to preserve the units.
Objective:                                     Continual monitoring of all assisted units
                                               with focused effort on the identified 516 at-

Housing Conservation and Preservation Strategy 2B: Conservation of Existing
Historic Resources
The City is currently home to 271 historic homes that maintain valid Mills Act contracts.
These contracts provide a powerful incentive aimed at maintaining and preserving these
cultural resources that add tremendous value to many of the City’s neighborhoods,
including its established Historic Districts. The City shall continue to provide

Housing Conservation and Preservation Strategy 2D: Neighborhood Improvement
The City shall continue the identification and mitigation of substandard units and
properties exhibiting deferred maintenance through the Neighborhood Improvement
Program and enhanced Code Enforcement efforts. The City shall continue to focus
efforts on neighborhoods exhibiting significant blight and on those “borderline”
neighborhoods that have the potential to become blighted absent focused attention. The
City shall also continue to facilitate private efforts to acquire substandard rental
properties, rehabilitate the buildings and establish long-term affordability covenants.
During the planning period, the City will re-assess its list of Priority III and IV
neighborhoods to ensure that these neighborhoods remain properly classified. In
addition, the City will seek to identify other neighborhoods that are exhibiting blight, or
that have the potential to become blighted, for potential inclusion on the priority lists
associated with the Neighborhood Improvement Program.

Housing Quality and Design Strategy 3A: Sustainable Development/Green
Building/Efficient use of Energy Resources in Residential Development
The City understands the importance of sustainable use of limited resources and
embraces the concept of “green building” in new and existing housing developments.
The City’s Green Building Program provides technical assistance and financial incentives
subject to funding availability, for qualified housing projects incorporating sustainability
measures. To encourage “green building” practices in new and existing residential
development, the City shall continue its efforts in providing financial assistance to
projects meeting sustainability standards and third-party green building program
guidelines. The City shall continually analyze current trends and best practices and
provide an array of incentives that will facilitate and encourage the incorporation of
materials and technology that promote the development of high-efficiency, sustainable
buildings and neighborhoods.
Encourage residential developers to maximize energy conservation through proactive
site, building and systems design that exceed the provisions of Title 24 of the California
Building Code. To further promote efficient use of energy resources, the City shall
investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of offering incentives or other strategies to
further encourage energy conservation in new and existing housing.
Objective:                                      Increased sustainable building practices/

Housing Quality and Design Strategy 3C: Universal Design
The City recognizes that all people have varying physical abilities and that many people
will encounter temporary or permanent changes in ability to conduct the tasks necessary
for daily living throughout their lives. Universal Design Principles were adopted in 2012
and are available on the City’s Website to guide the design and construction of homes to
incorporate features that are usable by people of all abilities. These features help to
create housing that can allow residents to stay in their homes over their lifetime and
create living environments that are safer and more accessible for everyone. The Universal
Design program intends to provide development incentives which will facilitate the
building of residential spaces that include products and technology to accommodate
families of all ages and backgrounds. The City shall continue to monitor over time to
ensure implementation of Universal Design features in housing.

The Green Element of Anaheim’s General Plan is a comprehensive plan to ensure that the
community’s recreational needs are being met. Parks and open space are important
factors that contribute to Anaheim residents’ quality of life. As the City’s housing stock
and population grows and vacant land becomes scarcer, the City will need to continue to
explore creative opportunities to provide quality parks, open space and recreational
amenities for Anaheim residents. The City will ensure consistency between the goals of
the Green Element and Housing Element to ensure a balance between the provision of

Housing Quality and Design Strategy 3E: Community Design
The Community Design Element of Anaheim’s General Plan provides policy guidance to
ensure quality design of the City’s built environment. This element addresses
community-wide design features such as gateways, landscaping, streets and public
signage, as well as special policies for specific districts within the City. Many of these
policies are also reflected in the City’s Zoning Code (Title 18 of the Municipal Code), as
well the City’s other design guidelines/plans such as the Affordable Housing Design
Guidelines; The Anaheim Colony, Vision Principles and Design Guidelines; The
Platinum Triangle Master Land Use Plan; and, the Greater Downtown of Anaheim Guide
for Development.
In order to ensure quality design of the City’s neighborhoods, the City will ensure that the
Community Design Element continues to be referenced and used during the review of
proposed housing developments. The Element will also continue to be updated to
address current development trends, as necessary.

Policy Strategy #4: Housing Rehabilitation
Housing Rehabilitation Strategy 4A: Affordable Housing Acquisition and
Rehabilitation
The City’s ability to maintain prior levels of acquisition and rehabilitation to create
affordable housing units has been diminished by the elimination of Redevelopment.
As a result, the City will primarily focus the use of its scarce resources in neighborhoods
previously identified as Level III and Level IV priority neighborhoods through the
Neighborhood Improvement Program. To support such efforts, the City shall continue to
provide, through regulatory incentives such as expedited processing, financial incentives
and development concessions, for the acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable
housing. Efforts shall be focused on the acquisition, rehabilitation, conversion and
accessibility of existing market-rate units to affordable units. As part of this strategy, the
City shall also consider the feasibility of acquisition, rehabilitation and conversion of
motels into permanent residential uses with all of the amenities and supportive services
necessary to ensure a quality living environment for future residents.
The City Council has also continued to support the continued acquisition and
rehabilitation of apartment buildings in the Hermosa Village neighborhood in order to
create and expand long-term affordability. The City will continue to implement an
aggressive acquisitions program within this neighborhood.

       •   Please note: CDBG funds can and in the past have been used to improve
           neighborhoods. That is largely no longer the case. At the same time these
           funds are being used for non-neighborhood improvement things like buying
           buildings to house non-profit groups. The CDBG funds have decreased yet the
           city expanded the areas covered and the funding committee thus decreasing
           the overall effectiveness in addressing real neighborhood blight and sub-
           standard conditions.
       •   Are they still available- and to whom? Investors, that might want to build?
           Individuals?

       • We have a concentration of affordable housing in the downtown area. This
           area cannot support any additional affordable housing projects. We must
           enforce existing codes in high density rental housing areas where absentee
           landlords do not maintain their property and people live in overcrowded, sub
           standard conditions. The city should not be property owners or landlords and
           should stop engaging in so called public/private partnerships to develop tax
           subsidized, high density, affordable and/or low income projects.
       • This is the first time I've heard of the flashlight walk program. Interesting.
       • Most of the jobs in the city are being created around the service sector which
           does not pay enough to afford rent in Anaheim, leading to long commutes,
           pollution and congestion. Low wages and not enough affordable housing
           create problems for everyone.
       • As a Mills Act home owner in the Palms District, I would like to see an
           increased amount of neighborhood and historic preservation with a high
           standard for the appearance and upkeep of rental properties. Most of my
A-20                                                                Adopted February 4, 2014

                                                                    Housing Element

           neighbors are in some sort of low-income housing with dwellings that are
           overcrowded and neglected by the landlords. I feel a more stringent code for
           rental properties with inspections by the city or a third party entity will not
           only improve the aesthetics the community, but also help the families living in
           these dwellings.
       •   City beautification projects. Improve the landscaping along major roads in
           Anaheim. Make established neighborhoods more desirable. Give them a
           facelift.
       •   The number of homeless is increasing in Anaheim including the number of
           homeless students in the schools. It is urgent an emergency shelter and multi
           service center is created in Anaheim to move these residents from the street to
           self-sufficiency.
       •   I believe that concentrating low income housing to certain areas creates
           heightened crime issues. It is in the best interest of all residents to have
           affordable housing spread throughout the city, including Anaheim Hills. By
           spreading housing equally we are ensuring that low income households are
           able to access the same high quality services as others. Additionally, we
           spread children from low income families to various schools so that we don't
           end up with a "bad" school as a result of high numbers of poverty. Yes, many
           don't like the idea of having affordable housing in their neighborhood, but the
           fact that someone is poor does not mean that they are a bad person. I believe
           Anaheim has a great opportunity to implement a housing model that
           adequately meets the needs of all residents.
       •   The City needs to identify ways to incentivize the rehabilitation of aging
           single-family homes and develop a dedicated funding source to pay for the
           relocation of historic homes threatened by development
       •   Housing/shelters for the homeless. Several local parks are currently occupied
           by the homeless.
       •   Consider petitioning CA state to repeal density bonus law
       •   Townhouse and apartment building are not providing enough parking creating
           a backfill in neighboring residential neighborhoods.

discussion.
A total of seven meetings are planned to be held at this point, plus additional
meetings. Meetings will occur monthly through September. No more than two
absences will be allowed. Only the appointee may serve and attend Ad Hoc
Committee – no substitutes.
Meetings will start and end on-time. However, notice must be given in advance if it is
projected that the meeting will go longer. Actual scheduled meeting start times to be
discussed later.
Mr. Barquist stated that the Ad Hoc Meetings are publicly noticed meeting so they
should start at the noticed time.
Meetings will be recorded. Minutes will be taken, approved by committee at
following meeting, and archived. Minutes are prepared in summary format and
approved at the following meeting.
Come prepared to meeting, having reviewed any pertinent information.
Committee should try to come to a consensus on policy issues, but that may not
always be possible. Committee can make a motion to vote or add anything to the
document.
4. Review of Brown Act
City of Anaheim Assistant City Attorney, Mr. Ted Reynolds, provided an overview of
the Brown Act.
All meetings must be transparent to the public.
This committee must abide by the Brown Act.
If six or more members are at a social gathering, it could be viewed by the public as
a meeting. Refrain from discussing the work effort of the committee and do not
deliberate. Talking about an issue to build consensus outside of meeting in not
allowed. Do not “reply all” on e-mails which can become a “discussion”.
A meeting consists of hearing, discussion, or deliberating.
Proper etiquette during meetings includes no texting.
Committee members may only speak in front of the City Council as a citizen, unless
authorized by committee to speak on behalf of committee.
The written agenda must contain all items to be discussed. Items not listed may not
be discussed, but may be added to next agenda. The agenda items must be
submitted one week before meeting and must be posted 72 hours prior to meeting.
Every agenda includes public comment only on items about the Housing Element.

Speaker cards should be provided for public commenters.
This committee will not conduct closed sessions.
Violating the Brown Act is considered a misdemeanor.
5. Overview of Committee Binder Contents
Mr. Barquist notified the committee that the previous Housing Element is on CD in
the binders provided to them. This binder is a living document and will be changing
and updated throughout the life of this committee.
The binder contains agendas and minutes for every meeting. Prior to meetings
minutes approval, members should ensure that all items deliberated are included in
the minutes.
Ground rules discussed today to be provided to committee members for their
binders.
Mr. Barquist made a motion to provide phone and contact info of all committee
members to all members of committee. Motion passed by committee.
Community workshops – multiple rounds are scheduled. City has reached out to
many organizations to boost attendance. Outreach will include booths at numerous
festivals and farmers market.
Binder contains an overview of legislation and internet resources.
The entire current Housing Element document in pdf format on CD is provided in the
back of the binder.
A five minute break will be added to ground rules.
A five minute break was then called.
6. Review of Housing Element Process/Legal Requirements/RHNA Process
Mr. Barquist introduced and gave brief descriptions of the Housing Element process,
legal requirements, and the Regional Housing Needs Assessment process.
Mr. Barquist explained that the Housing Element and housing need allocations
provide the context for the private market to develop. Development slowed and
market conditions have changed from the last cycle. Sites previously identified by
Housing Element that were not developed may still be utilized.
City Staff stated 9,500 units was last cycle target. This is much higher than the
projection for this planning cycle which is approximately 5,700 units.
Quantified objectives set local targets during planning period and will be discussed in
later meetings.

Ms. Richardson asked who comes up with projected numbers. Mr. Barquist
explained the process and methodology and that the numbers are allocated by
SCAG.
Mr. O’Brien commented on the statistics used to determine the RHNA numbers. A
vacancy adjustment is shown in the reduced numbers.
Ms. Kreitner asked if the numbers were determined by needs or by Section 8
housing list. Mr. Barquist explained HE is 50/50, existing and future needs. Existing
needs are separate from future growth needs. The numbers account for motel
families.
Ms. Greenberg asked if the range of projected needs was to attract people in specific
income levels. Mr. Barquist stated that the projections are not “recommended” but,
“identified projected growth needs.”
Mr. Balsamo commented that SCAG creates numbers as a result of natural
population growth as well.
Mr. Abdulrahman asked if there is an empirical equation to show the factors. Mr.
Barquist responded that there is a methodology used by SCAG.
Mr. Borrego stated that those projected numbers will not change. City Staff monitors
methodology and allocation process and believes this is a fair allocation.
Mr. Abdulrahman asked if the City reviewed the past performance from the previous
Housing Element.        The City Staff responded yes, that there is an annual
review/progress report of Housing Element submitted to the State. The next annual
review is scheduled for City Council consideration at its next meeting.
The City Staff continued to explain that there are challenges to the City from the
closure of Redevelopment Agencies. This funding source for affordable housing is
now gone. The Community Development Director, John Woodhead, will be at the
next Ad Hoc meeting to discuss this issue. Redevelopment was the largest source
of funding for affordable housing in the City.
Mr. Barquist continued to speak about the needs assessment and terminology,
resources and constraints analysis (governmental and non-governmental). He also
explained that the Policy Program is the official City policy on housing.
Mr. Barquist then reviewed the five phases of the Housing Element update process.
7. Discussion of Upcoming Ad Hoc Meetings
Mr. Barquist and the City Staff initiated a discussion on setting the dates and times of
the next 6 meetings, as well as the agendas.
A motion to start all meetings at 6 pm was passed.
The group discussed and determined that the next (second) meeting will take place
on April 15, 2013 at 6:00 P.M. The location is to be determined.

  A location for future meetings was discussed and locations in central Anaheim will be
  considered first.
  The third Ad Hoc Committee meeting was scheduled for Thursday, May 30th at 6:00
  P.M.
 Public Comments
  Mr. Patrick Kreitner asked about housing growth. He stated that there is a
  percentage for need of housing for various incomes and wanted to know how many
  people fall into these categories. He also stated that it seems like the number of
  lower income families are becoming greater. Mr. Barquist replied that the Housing
  Needs Assessment Report will cover all the information that Mr. Kreitner was
  inquiring about.
 Adjournment
  The meeting was adjourned at 9:09 p.m. to the next scheduled meeting to be held in
  on April 15, 2013, at 6:00 P.M. at a location to be determined.

•   Discussion Items
    1. Presentation by Community Development Department Director Regarding the
        Effect that Elimination of Redevelopment will Have on Future Housing
        Development
        Mr. Borrego introduced John Woodhead, Community Development Director, to provide
        an overview of the dissolution of redevelopment agencies and the impact on future
        housing production.
                                                                                          1

Mr. Woodhead first thanked the Ad Hoc Committee for serving and described that the
State of California had taken approximately $50 million in redevelopment funds from
Anaheim over the last decade to augment education funds. The State was poised to
take an additional $1.7 billion in a single fiscal year from redevelopment agencies
statewide and an ongoing amount in subsequent years. Under that scenario, Anaheim’s
contribution would have been $16.4 mil in the first year and $4 mil in the subsequent
years. The California State Redevelopment Agency sued to stop the State’s “ransom
request” and that legal process ended with the elimination of all redevelopment agencies
statewide as of January 2012.
In terms of its history, redevelopment had become active beginning in the late 1970’s.
During this time, approximately 6,000 housing units were developed in Anaheim through
the involvement of the Redevelopment Agency (RDA). One of the requirements of
RDA’s was a housing set-aside fund where no less than 20 percent of the tax increment
revenue was required to be used for affordable housing. Anaheim opted to set aside 30
percent in conjunction with an action to extend its RDA plan for another 10 years,
making the 30 percent set aside mandatory.
In 2005, the City Council adopted a five-year Affordable Housing Strategic Plan. The
Plan was extended out to 2014 and called for the development of 2,800 affordable units.
Approximately 1,500 affordable units have been developed under the plan thus far.
The loss of redevelopment funds equates to a loss of $1.3 billion for Anaheim, including
$400 million in housing set aside funds. The direct use of public funds also induced
private investment. For example, Colony Park had approximately $25 million in net
public investment, but induced approximately $300 million in additional private
investment. Colony Park is an example of using housing development in the downtown
to generate a viable retail/commercial environment.
The Successor Agency is the City acting as “trustee” of sorts and is a separate legal
entity. Approximately 40 acres of housing development sites have been transferred to
the Successor Agency. This land is valued at approximately $25 per square foot. There
is also a loan portfolio of 350 first time homebuyer loans, totaling about $10 million.
There is also about $15 million in new loans obligations. The Successor Agency has $15
million for the Avon Dakota rehabilitation project. There is also approximately $8 million
in housing set aside funds that were loaned to the non-housing redevelopment side.
Residual receipts for housing projects will provide a $1.5 to 2 million annual income
stream.
Without redevelopment, Anaheim does not have an ongoing revenue stream that it is
able to bond against. The City will act similar to a private developer going forward,
needing to produce some revenue from future housing activities. Anaheim will probably
not provide financial assistance directly to rental projects. The primary focus will likely be
on acquisition and rehabilitation of the city’s older housing stock. Efforts will be
concentrated in one neighborhood until that neighborhood project is complete, then
move on to next neighborhood. Some housing programs will not be funded.
Committee Member Balsamo asked why the philosophy has changed from focusing on
rental to acquisition/rehabilitation. Was this direction from the City Council? Mr.
Woodhead responded that the City Council is leaning that way. There is also a large
segment of the community that recognizes the housing stock in Anaheim is older and
                                                                                             2

needs fixing up. The ratio of single-family to multi-family development is skewed towards
multi-family. Acquisition/rehabilitation will help address occupancy problems,
infrastructure, and things that create slums. Financing for acquisition/rehab is fairly
viable without needing a large public subsidy to make tax credits work. Avon Dakota is
an example. There will be a 55-year ground lease with a revenue stream resulting from
the project.
Committee Member O’Brien asked how much acquisition/rehab can play in meeting the
RHNA allocations. Mr. Woodhead responded that acquisition/rehab will play a very small
role in meeting the RHNA numbers. The City has some federal funds that may be
reallocated, but remaining funds for housing are limited.
Committee Member Henniger noted that rents at Avon Dakota will be fairly low, creating
affordable units.
Mr. Woodhead commented that the 40 acres owned by the Agency must be used for
affordable housing. The ability of developers to get funding to build on sites will make a
difference in development happening on those sites.
Committee Member Richardson commented that it may be more feasible to increase
public revenue through the property taxes on ownership units than rent from rental units.
Mr. Woodhead commented that some of the housing sites are not ones that developers
are willing to build for-sale properties on, unless the condo market comes back. The
product developed will also depend on how rapidly the properties need to be developed.
In the past, under RDA, five years was the limit. That rule may or may not apply.
Housing advocates will probably ask those time limits still be enforced.
Committee Member Richardson commented that she thinks the condo market is strong
and young professionals and first time homebuyers are looking for condos. Mr.
Woodhead commented that this is true, but a strong condo market isn’t consistently
seen in Anaheim right now. For example, condominiums have not taken off in the
Platinum Triangle.
Committee Member Greenberg asked what the range is for affordable housing. Mr.
Woodhead answered that affordable housing serves a wide range of incomes. The
affordability level is based on the area median income. Mr. Woodhead provided some
examples of income levels from the latest HCD income limits.
Committee Member McCafferty asked what incentives can be given to developers to
revitalize the city if redevelopment is gone. Mr. Woodhead provided examples of ways to
make the entitlement process easier, including pre-entitling property, assistance with
utilities and infrastructure by tandeming with a public works project, and streamlining the
process.
Committee Member Leos noted that one of the things young parents look at when
buying a house is the quality of the schools in the area. He commented that this will be a
challenge for some neighborhoods in Anaheim. Committee Member Henniger agreed
that schools make a big difference in the neighborhood and attracting buyers.
Committee Member Leos noted that there are not enough schools in some of the
neighborhoods and gave the Platinum Triangle as an example. Mr. Woodhead
commented that the elimination of redevelopment did not directly provide more funds for
schools.
                                                                                           3

Committee Member Greenberg commented that creating mixed-income communities will
help the schools by balancing the community. Mr. Woodhead responded that creating
mixed-income communities will be difficult to do with the existing housing stock. The cost
per unit increases dramatically when they are demolished and rebuilt. The cost for
rehabilitating a unit is $50-60,000. This increases to $200,000 if tearing down and
rebuilding. The City is trying to integrate the affordable housing into larger
neighborhoods to create a bigger district with a sense of identity.
Committee Member Henniger asked what are some of the best practices for meeting the
RHNA needs without redevelopment. What are other cities doing? Mr. Woodhead
responded that many cities are rezoning property to make the opportunities available,
but not proactively doing anything to try to develop numbers up to the RHNA.
Mr. Borrego commented that the City’s quantified objectives will be different than the
RHNA target. The quantified objectives are what the City considers to be feasible within
the planning period. Mr. Borrego asked Mr. Barquist what other cities are doing in terms
of setting a reasonable quantified objective.
Mr. Barquist said that cities are looking at facilitating private investment by reducing time
and uncertainty. They are looking at the approval process and also when fees are paid.
The City may look at deferral of fees to occupancy.
Committee Member Buffa commented that a policy could be to have the City go to the
State to change the RHNA process and lower numbers.
Mr. Barquist commented that the Housing Element is part of the General Plan which
typically has broad policy, but State law includes very specific requirements for the
Housing Element.
Committee Member Balsamo described the County of Orange’s by-right overlay where
100 percent affordable housing can be developed on commercial and industrial
properties. About 500 units have been built through the overlay.
Mr. Borrego explained the City of Anaheim’s housing overlay. The City has over 200
parcels identified in the current Housing Element as opportunity sites. The housing
overlay allows for by-right housing on these sites. The overlay has been created and the
preparation of CEQA documentation is in process. Hearings to apply the overlay to the
sites will occur during the summer. Most of the sites are currently developed with strip
retail and older hotels. These sites are designated for residential in the General Plan, but
currently zoned commercial.
Committee Member Leos commented that there may be community concerns with
concentrating low income housing through the overlay. Mr. Borrego clarified that the
overlay allows for all housing, not just affordable housing. The projects could be market
rate and he expects to see both affordable and market rate development at these
locations.
Committee Member Richardson commented that the City also started putting in
infrastructure to accommodate units. Mr. Woodhead confirmed this; saying over $100
million was put into infrastructure around the Anacapa development.
Committee Member McCafferty asked if the units will also be able to use density bonus.
Mr. Borrego responded yes.
                                                                                             4

Committee Member Balsamo suggested the City look at other standards as well.
Committee Member McCafferty commented that, coupled with making it easier to
develop, the City should look at putting in the infrastructure investment.
Mr. Borrego noted that there is currently a surcharge added to Anaheim utility bills to
make upgrades to the infrastructure. There have already been improvements made in
west and central Anaheim. Sewer capacity remains a large issue for some areas.
Committee Member McCafferty said one of the policies in the Housing Element might be
to prioritize capital improvement projects for housing opportunity sites and providing
certainty as to when the improvements will be made. Mr. Borrego commented that this
would be a great idea to include in the policy development discussions. Committee
Member Balsamo noted that the Housing Element focus is on housing and will not be
able to solve every issue.
Mr. Borrego talked about CEQA reform. CEQA can be a challenge for development right
now with the amount of time and money needed. The housing overlay zone is being
prepared under a supplemental EIR to the General Plan EIR. This will allow the City to
exempt infill development and speed up the development process.
Committee Member Henniger asked if the residual receipts to the Housing Authority
could be bonded against. Mr. Woodhead said this is not a very viable option right now,
but may be in the future.
Committee Member O’Brien asked how affordable housing development happened prior
to RDA. Mr. Woodhead responded that there was not much interest in affordable
housing in California then. The first redevelopment efforts did not even require affordable
housing.
Committee Member Abdulrahman asked if Anaheim receives federal assistance. Mr.
Woodhead responded yes, the City receives CDBG and HOME funds. There have been
substantial cutbacks though.
Mr. Woodhead explained that the City may have to eliminate 500 Section 8 vouchers
due to sequestration.
Committee Member Kreitner asked what the timeline is to eliminate the 500 Section 8
vouchers. Mr. Woodhead responded that the City is working with HUD to see. The
timeline was originally by the end of 2013, but that may change. The program has a
natural attrition of about 20 to 25 households per month. Committee Member Kreitner
commented that Cherry Orchard will be open in the fall and could house 45 of the
Section 8 families.
Mr. Woodhead also explained that the Housing Element will look at at-risk units. For
example, Miracle Terrace, a 200 unit senior complex, has expiring affordability
requirements.
Committee Member Kreitner asked if it would make sense to take money out of rapid
rehousing to address the Section 8 issue.
                                                                                          5

    Committee Member Richardson commented that there may be people with Section 8
    vouchers who should not be eligible. Mr. Woodhead commented that fraud is always a
    concern and the Police Department investigates any fraud concerns.
    Mr. Woodhead concluded the discussion by saying tools to replace redevelopment may
    be available in the future. This is the first time a Housing Element has to be prepared
    with a constrained fiscal environment. Looking at how to eliminate barriers for the private
    sector should be a focus.
The Committee took short recess. Upon returning, Mr. Barquist noted that the library closes
at 8:00 pm. Therefore the Committee will end their meeting at 7:50 pm.
2. Review of Past and Planned Community Outreach Efforts
    Mr. Barquist provided an overview of the community outreach activities to date. The City
    had a booth at the farmers market in downtown. People could provide comments on
    sticky notes at their convenience. The comments will be provided to the Committee at
    the next meeting.
    The City also had a workshop series in March. Participation rates were low. The City is
    going to use the “go-to-them” strategy and have opportunities to participate at the La
    Palma Park Cinco de Mayo event and other larger community events. Staff will also be
    at the West Anaheim BBQ to get input.
    Mr. Borrego also noted that staff is making a big push to increase attendance at the next
    round of workshops. Staff will be attending the neighborhood council meetings to
    announce the upcoming workshops. Staff is also updating the Housing Element
    webpage to be more user-friendly and catchy. The webpage is expected to launch next
    week. There will also be an online survey.
    Committee Member Balsamo asked what questions will be asked of the community. Mr.
    Barquist responded that the questions are related to higher order issues, what needs to
    be addressed, what needs to be considered by decision makers, what is the broad
    direction.
    Mr. Barquist summarized the input received at the workshops related to housing
    challenges and opportunities.
    Challenges identified included:
    o   Crime/Gangs/Graffiti
    o   Location and Concentration of Housing
    o   Funding
    o   Affordability
    o   Traffic and Parking
    o   Hotel/Motel Families

      o    Development of Small Units
      o    CDBG Funds
      o    Private Financing for Rehabilitation of Housing
      o    Incentive Program with Lenders for Home Improvements
      o    Rehab Rebate Program
  3. Review of Housing Element Background Report
      Mr. Barquist introduced the Housing Element Background Report. Chapters 2 and 3 of
      the draft Housing Element were provided to the Committee. Given time constraints, the
      background report will be presented at the next Committee meeting.
  4. Review of Past Performance
      Mr. Barquist introduced the Review of Past Performance. The Committee has been
      provided with a table showing the existing policies in the Housing Element. There is a
      column where staff will provide information on progress in implementation. This will
      provide information needed to discuss what should be changed. One consideration is
      that RDA is listed as the funding source for many of the programs. The completed table
      will be provided to the Committee prior to the next meeting.
      Committee Member McCafferty asked how the review of past performance relates to the
      City’s annual Housing Element report. Mr. Barquist responded that information from the
      annual report will be integrated into the matrix.

•   Discussion Items
    Mr. Barquist requested that the Committee amend the meeting agenda to move Discussion
    Item #3 Review of Past Performance before Item #2 Review of Housing Background Report
    because Housing Programs Manager Grace Stepter is in attendance and can answer any of
    the Committee’s questions regarding the Review of Past Performance. The Committee
    agreed to hear Discussion Item #3 first.
    1. Review of Past Community Outreach Efforts
    Ms. Lieberman gave an overview of the community outreach activities and the input
    received since the last Ad Hoc Committee meeting. These activities included Workshop
    Series #2 (consisting of three community workshops), the WAND Barbeque and the Cinco
                                                                                          1

de Mayo festival at La Palma Park. The Consultants provided the Committee with hard
copies of the community input notes from the outreach activities to date.
Mr. Barquist explained the EB 5 program that was mentioned in the community input. The
EB 5 program is a federal program that provides foreign companies with ability to obtain
visas for employees in return for creating permanent jobs and investment in the United
States.
A committee member asked for clarification on the “move on program” for historic homes.
Principal Planner Borrego explained that the program was funded by the Redevelopment
Agency to relocate historic homes that would potentially be demolished by new construction
otherwise.
A committee member asked for clarification on the community member’s comment on
promoting gated communities. Mr. Barquist said that the community member made the
comment in the context of parking and gated complexes having higher demand for parking
within the confines of the complex versus non-gated complexes where parking spills out into
the neighborhood as well. One committee member commented that it may be related to an
overcrowding issue where there are multiple cars per apartment unit. Another committee
member noted that many people use their garages for storage instead of parking. Another
committee member said it gates may be in response to security concerns. Another
committee member said he would not advocate for including a policy promoted gated
communities in the Housing Element and that developers should be able to choose to put in
gates or not. There was general agreement amongst the committee on this. Another
committee member commented that gating communities segments the community and limits
communication.
A committee member asked for clarification on a community member’s comment regarding
petitioning the State to remove the density bonus requirement. Another committee member
asked for clarification on what the density bonus requirement entails. Mr. Barquist explained
that the density bonus requirement includes provisions that must be granted to a developer
if certain affordable units are provided. He explained that the community member’s comment
was related to the State’s purview over local government and the political dynamic of the
State in local affairs. The density bonus provisions are included in the Resources section of
the Housing Element background report.
A committee member asked if the summary of the outreach efforts would be provided in the
Housing Element. Ms. Lieberman said that the summary will be provided in the full draft
Housing Element.
A committee member asked if Staff heard a difference in the types of community comments
from area to area within the City. Principal Planner Borrego said that there were some
differences in the overall themes of the comments. At the Cinco de Mayo festival, there were
many comments about maintenance issues and absentee landlords. At the WAND
barbeque, there were many comments about crime, overconcentration of affordable housing
and homeless.
Principal Planner Borrego noted that the amount of input at the two events was greater than
the workshops, but that the second workshop series also had a higher attendance than the
first round of workshops. The City’s online survey has also had over 50 responses to date
and will remain open online.
                                                                                              2

A committee member asked if the community members providing input at the La Palma Park
event were primarily Hispanic. Principal Planner Borrego said that most of the community
members who spoke with staff were Hispanic.
2. Review of Past Performance
Principal Planner Borrego introduced Housing Programs Manager Grace Stepter.
A committee member asked to receive documents to review early on to allow for adequate
time for review. Principal Planner Borrego indicated that additional review time will be
provided with future documents to be reviewed by the Committee.
Ms. Lieberman read through each of the housing strategies listed in the current Housing
Element and the staff’s summary of the progress in implementing the strategy. Discussion
was as follows.
Housing Production Strategy 1A: Meet or Exceed the Production Goals of the Affordable
Housing Strategic Plan – Principal Planner Borrego commented that the City is no longer
pursuing housing development under the plan, except for the projects that are already in the
pipeline. Housing Programs Manager Stepter commented that the current projects under the
plan were already underway and committed to before the Redevelopment Agency was
dissolved. A committee member asked if it would advantageous to ask the City Council to
revise the policy to reflect the numerical objectives to be in line with the achievable
outcomes of the plan. Principal Planner Borrego said that the City Council could be asked to
rescind the plan or revisit the plan since it is still official policy, but not being acted upon.
Housing Production Strategy 1B: Implementation of an Affordable Housing Overlay Zone –
Principal Planner Borrego said this was included in the original Affordable Housing Strategic
Plan, but then in the development of the Housing Element the City had to identify Housing
Opportunity Sites to allow by-right residential development so the Overlay Zone became
redundant. The City is moving forward with the rezoning of the Opportunity Sites this
summer.
Housing Production Strategy 1C: Expedited Processing for Extremely-Low, Very Low, Low
and Moderate Income Housing Developments – A committee member asked if the City has
received feedback about processing timelines for other projects. Principal Planner Borrego
said staff has not received specific feedback yet, but would like the committee to discuss
this item in the resources and constraints discussion at the next committee meeting. The
committee member commented that getting the pieces to work for expedited processing can
be very difficult and it may not be the best tool to incentivize development. Many times the
applicant does not have the plans prepared to the level of detail necessary for expedited
processing, but has an expectation that the process will be expedited. Principal Planner
Borrego commented that different departments also have different capabilities to expedite
processing. Another committee member commented that he had worked on a development
that received expedited processing that saved time, but the tradeoff was that the project
itself was expensive to develop.
Housing Production Strategy 1G: Encourage the Development of Housing for Extremely-
Low Income Households - A committee member asked if these units were developed using
Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside funds. Housing Program Manager Stepter said that
there was a combination of funds used, including Section 8 Project-Based Vouchers. A
committee member asked if these projects are mixed income. Housing Program Manager
Stepter said that most of the projects involved tax credits and that the households with the
                                                                                                  3

highest income within the projects would be households earning 60 percent of the area
median income.
A committee member asked if the City has found that the crime rate is higher in these areas.
Housing Program Manager Stepter said that the City has found that the crime rate is not
higher, and in many cases is lower. A crime study was done in the Hermosa Village area
that shows that calls for service are lower now. The income-restricted projects have
requirements for background checks on the tenants. The communities tend to be better
maintained. Active data matching occurs with the Police Department so that the Housing
Authority is notified of any criminal activity.
A committee member asked if there are any projects on the list that are still being
developed. Housing Program Manager Stepter said that Cherry Orchard is still in progress.
A committee member commented that Hermosa Village has private security and is gated,
but many residents are hesitant to complain because they do not want to be kicked out. He
commented that a good management company helps make the project better.
A committee member commented that a portion of the units at Cherry Orchard are tied to
Section 8 service vouchers so that the households agree to receive some sort of supportive
services with their housing. The project also has a community center.
Housing Program Manager Stepter explained the difference between public housing, where
all of the households pay 30 percent of what the household could afford, and affordable
housing in Anaheim where the rent is set and not tied to the specific occupant’s income.
Traditional public housing is being demolished through a federal program called Hope VI
because of the problems of large concentrations of low income housing without proper
management.
Housing Production Strategy 1H: Encourage the Development of Housing for Special
Needs Households – A committee member noted that Diamond Street has 24 units, not 25
units, for special needs households. There is one manager unit.
Housing Production Strategy 1J: Development of Housing Information Clearinghouse – A
committee member asked if the Neighborhood Housing Services of Orange County is part of
the City, County or a separate entity. Ms. Lieberman explained that it is a separate
organization that is located in Anaheim. The City refers people to NHS. A committee
member asked if there are still funds going forward to support this program. Housing
Programs Manager Stepter said that the City is continuing to provide this through the
Housing Authority and growing the web presence and automated tools.
Housing Production Strategy 1O: HOME Homebuyer Program – Housing Programs
Manager Stepter commented that the majority of the City’s HOME funds are going to
prioritized acquisition and rehabilitation efforts, not to this program. A committee member
asked if there are programs looking at other aging neighborhoods in Anaheim and making
sure they do not deteriorate any further. Housing Programs Manager Stepter said that the
HOME funds are being used towards rehabilitating rental housing in the Avon Dakota
neighborhood. A committee member commented that programs to address aging single-
family neighborhoods are needed. Housing Programs Stepter said there may be future
programs that provide funding for a program.
Another committee member noted that there is a need for rehabilitation of houses with
absentee or non-responsive landlords and code enforcement could be used as a tool. There
                                                                                            4

are also concerns about elderly homeowners that may not be able to afford to make
improvements.
Housing Production Strategy 1Q: Compliance with SB 2- Adequate Sites for Emergency
Shelters/Transitional Housing – A committee member asked if transitional and supportive
housing requirements will be more liberal than emergency shelters. Principal Planner
Borrego responded that transitional and supportive housing will be treated more like a
single-family residential use as opposed to an institutional use.
A committee member asked if a program is no longer being funded and was not available
during the current Planning Period, would the program be removed from the future Housing
Element. Ms. Lieberman said that those specific programs would be removed. Mr. Barquist
commented that if the underlying issue or concern remained, the policy program would look
at how to address the issue and where funding could come from.
Housing Production Strategy 1R: Affordable Housing Program – A committee member noted
that Diamond Street received funds through this program.
Housing Conservation and Preservation Strategy 2C: Community-Based Neighborhood
Enhancement – A committee member asked if Paint Your Heart Out is funded by the City.
Ms. Lieberman answered that Paint Your Heart Out is a non-profit organization and has
volunteers. The committee member asked if the Housing Element could include non-profits
in the policy program. Ms. Lieberman responded that coordination with these groups could
be part of the policy program.
A committee member asked about the number of traffic-related improvements listed and if
housing funds were used for these. Principal Planner Borrego responded that these are
through separate funds from Public Works or CDBG.
Housing Quality and Design Strategy 3A: Sustainable Development/Green Building – A
committee member asked if there are funds available for this program. Principal Planner
Borrego responded that the program is primarily provided through Anaheim Utilities. A
committee asked if rebate incentives are still available for developers. Another committee
member responded that the rebate incentives have been terminated, along with the
expedited processing incentive.
Housing Quality and Design Strategy 3C: Adopt Reasonable Accommodation Procedures –
A committee member asked if this waives ADA requirements. Principal Planner Borrego said
this program actually removes zoning requirements that might conflict with ADA
requirements such as the installation of a wheelchair ramp in a front setback area.
Housing Quality and Design Strategy 3H: Definition of Family – A committee member asked
who would be writing the Municipal Code amendment for the definition of family. Principal
Planner Borrego responded that staff would be writing the amendment in coordination with
the City Attorney and it would ultimately be adopted by the City Council. He commented that
this amendment will be looked at in conjunction with the provisions for transitional and
supportive housing.
Affordable Housing Opportunity Strategy 5B: Section 8 Rental Assistance Program – A
committee member asked for an update on the status of reducing the number of Section 8
vouchers based on federal cutbacks. Housing Programs Manager Stepter said that the
Housing Authority is working with HUD on the issue and there is a national set-aside that the
City could apply for if vouchers need to be terminated. The City plans for the fiscal year of
July to June while the HUD plan is for the calendar year of January to December.
                                                                                              5

  A committee member asked about the Integrity House project and what program it was
  funded through. Housing Programs Manager Stepter said that the project received Section 8
  Project Based Vouchers.
  Affordable Housing Opportunity Strategy 5J: Workforce Housing – A committee member
  asked how workforce housing is defined. Housing Programs Manager Stepter said
  workforce housing is generally located near a large employer and provide housing at levels
  affordable to employees, like those who work at Disneyland. They are typically family units.
  Mariposa Village and Diamond Street needs to be removed from the list. A committee
  member asked if employers contribute to these projects. Housing Programs Manager
  Stepter said they do not at this time. A committee member said that asking employers to
  contribute should be considered in the new policies.
  A committee member asked that a line be added to each of the programs that were
  discontinued to explain why and if funding was lost.
  Principal Planner Borrego said that at the next meeting, the committee will have the
  opportunity to revisit the Review of Past Performance to address any follow-up questions.

    further questions or discussion.
    2. Continued Review of Housing Element Background Report (Chapters 2 and 3 of
        the Draft Housing Element)
    Ms. Lieberman provided an overview of Chapter 2: Housing Needs Analysis. This chapter
    includes the following topics:
                                                                                          1

    o   Population Trends and Characteristics
    o   Employment Trends
    o   Household Characteristics
    o   Housing Inventory and Market Conditions
    o   Overpayment
    o   Overcrowding
    o   Growth Needs (RHNA)
    o   Special Needs Groups
There are approximately 340,000 residents in Anaheim as of 2012. Anaheim has grown
about 4.8 percent since 2000, which is lower than the overall County’s growth rate. Mr.
Barquist noted that the information from DOF (Department of Finance) is a projection based
on the 2010 Census benchmark.
Committee Member Henninger asked why Anaheim’s growth rate in the past years was
higher than the overall County’s. Ms. Lieberman responded that a number of factors
contribute to growth including housing availability and employment opportunities.
Ms. Lieberman said that between 2000 and 2010, the retirement age and senior citizen age
groups have grown. Between 2000 and 2010, the Hispanic population has grown, along with
the Asian/Pacific Islander population and the Black/African American population.
Committee Member Buffa asked why race and ethnicity are important to the Housing
Element. Mr. Barquist responded that the State requires the Housing Element to look at race
and ethnicity. Also, there may be some housing preferences related to race and culture
including multiple generations living in the same household. He provided the example of
Amerige Heights in Fullerton that has houses with granny units/second units that
accommodate families with multiple generations living together. Committee Member Buffa
commented that discussing household size would be more appropriate than discussing
race/ethnicity.
Committee Member Abdulrahman asked if the information provided is tied to income. Mr.
Barquist responded that the information on race/ethnicity provided is not tied to income, but
could be drilled down to that level from the Census data.
Mr. Henninger asked where the Middle Eastern population is categorized in the
race/ethnicity data. He noted that there is a growing Middle Eastern population in the City,
many of which are refugees. Ms. Lieberman noted that the Census is self-reported and that
people of Middle Eastern descent may choose to report themselves in the “Other” category.
Mr. Henninger commented that there does not seem to be a way to understand the Middle
Eastern population through just looking at race in the Census data. Mr. Barquist commented
that there would have to be a separate data analysis for this. Mr. Abdulrahman commented
that most would likely choose to report themselves in the “White” category.
Ms. Lieberman said there are about 98,000 households in Anaheim. The average persons
per household is about 3.41, which is higher than the overall County average of 3.04. About
53.7 percent are renter-occupied and 46.3 percent are owner-occupied. The vacancy rate
as of 2011 is about 5.5 percent. Mr. Barquist noted that about 5 percent is a healthy
vacancy rate. Lower than 5 percent has an upward push on housing price and vice versa.
                                                                                              2

Ms. Lieberman showed a slide showing the industries employing the most Anaheim
residents. Manufacturing moved from being the industry employing the most Anaheim
residents in 2000 to being the second highest. Education services, health care and social
services employ the most residents as of 2011. Committee Member Buffa asked about the
significance in looking at employment data when every person needs housing, regardless of
where they are employed. Mr. Barquist responded that it is required to be included in the
Housing Element analysis under State law. The employment data also provides information
on what industries to look at if trying to provide housing close to employment opportunities.
Committee Member McCafferty asked what category the Disneyland employees would be
in. Ms. Lieberman responded that they would likely be in the “retail trade” and “arts,
entertainment, and recreation, and accommodation and food services” categories.
Ms. Lieberman said that the unemployment rate as of 2011 was 11.1 percent. The median
income for owner-occupied households was $83,159 and $37,428 for renter-occupied
households. The overall median income was about $54,000, and lower than the overall
County median income. Committee Member O’Brien asked what the change was income
level since 2000. Ms. Lieberman responded that the overall median income in 2000 was
$47,000. The owner households’ median income was about $66,000 and the renter
households’ median income was $34,000.
Ms. Lieberman presented information about the physical housing stock in the City. She
noted that houses over 30 years old are those that are more likely to see deferred
maintenance issues or be in need of rehabilitation. Approximately 70 percent of the houses
in Anaheim were constructed prior to 1980. Approximately 2 percent were constructed prior
to 1939. These are likely to be historic homes that have had some sort of rehabilitation. The
median sales price in Anaheim as of November 2012 was $373,000 and the median rent
was $1,365. Committee Member McCafferty commented that the number of homes
constructed prior to 1980 is significant and there should be discussion on policy regarding
how to maintain and preserve that older housing. Mr. Borrego commented that the housing
age would be very similar to other areas in Central and North Orange County and that
looking at ways in which other cities have addressed older housing stock could provide
ideas for Anaheim’s Housing Element. Committee Member Henninger commented that
looking at older Los Angeles County cities, such as Lakewood, and how they have
addressed their aging housing stock will be beneficial since they have been addressing the
issue for years.
Ms. Lieberman provided information about overypayment (paying more than 30 percent of
the gross income towards housing) and overcrowding (having more than 1 person per
room). About 87 percent of owner-occupied households and 63 percent of renter-occupied
households are experiencing overpayment. Overpayment is more prevalent in lower-income
renter households and moderate/above moderate-income owner households. She noted
that people who own their houses may be willing to pay more than 30 percent of their
income towards housing in exchange for a potential return on the investment. Over 7
percent of owner-occupied households and over 25 percent of renter-occupied households
are overcrowded. Committee Member Buffa commented that in an area such as Orange
County where home prices and salaries are higher than in other parts of the country, there is
almost an expectation that a person would pay more than 30 percent of the income towards
housing. The concerns about overpayment are more relevant for lower-income households,
not households that have a larger amount of discretionary income. Committee Member
Henninger noted that many households are paying more for housing because they consider
it an investment. Committee Member O’Brien asked if the amount was pre-tax or after tax.
                                                                                              3

Ms. Lieberman responded that it is pre-tax. Mr. Barquist commented that qualification
standards for home loans have changed over the last few years.
Committee Member Abdulrahman asked if the information about overpayment and
overcrowding could be broken down to show the differences in the different parts of the City
and the differences in the needs. Mr. Barquist responded that some information is available
at the Census tract level, but it is time consuming to do that. It could be done if it is
instructive to the Committee. Mr. Borrego said that Staff could potentially do a sampling of
the Census tracts to have an understanding of the needs in the various geographic areas.
Ms. Lieberman commented that some of the data is not available at the tract level, but there
may be specific tables where it would be helpful to break the data up.
Committee Member Henninger asked how overpayment changed over the past few years
and if change in employment has caused households that were paying less than 30 percent
of their income to now paying a higher percentage. Ms. Lieberman said that the data in the
current Housing Element shows overpayment as of 2007. About 27 percent of the owner-
occupied households and 26 percent of the renter-occupied households were experiencing
overpayment. Committee Member Henninger commented that over the next planning period
the overpayment numbers may go down as jobs pick up. Committee Member Abdulrahman
asked if this data is used to project what is going to be happening in the future and
commented that using data from 2010 to project for 2020 could be misleading. Mr. Barquist
responded that the State does projections. There are some economic projections done by
other parties. However, projections done a few years ago were not close to what actually
happened with the economic downturn.
Committee Member McCafferty commented that renters often cannot choose how much of
their income goes towards housing and when rents increase they compensate by living with
multiple families in one unit. The focus should be on these households.
Ms. Lieberman presented a slide with the RHNA allocations. Mr. Barquist noted that the
median family income (MFI) will change every year based on the economy. Committee
Member Buffa asked if there is somewhere in the document that shows what the affordable
housing prices are for each income category assuming 30 percent of a household income
goes to housing. Mr. Barquist responded that table 1-29 shows the affordable payment and
purchase price would be, based on the 2012 MFI. Committee Member Buffa commented
that higher income households may choose to pay more for housing and that while the
RHNA numbers allocate a certain amount to each income level, buyers may not want to
actually buy in the corresponding price ranges.
Ms. Lieberman provided information on the five special needs groups required to be
analyzed by the State- elderly, large households, homeless, farmworkers and female-
headed households. Elderly (age 65 years and older) comprise about 9 percent of Anaheim
residents. About 35 percent of the elderly have a disability. Median income is about
$33,000. About 68 percent of elderly renter households and 32 percent of elderly owner
households experience overpayment. Committee Member Richardson commented that
there may be differences in the different areas in Anaheim. In West Anaheim there are many
elderly persons and this may lead to more rentals because the homes will be left to trusts.
Committee Member Buffa asked if there is a link between the age of the housing stock and
age of the owner. She commented that there are likely many household built prior to 1970
that are lived in by the original owners.
                                                                                             4
Committee Member Abdulrahman asked if the income considers both persons in the
workforce and those receiving governmental assistance. Ms. Lieberman said it includes
both. Committee Member Henninger asked if there is information on what a person’s assets
are because an elderly person with savings is able to spend more on housing than one who
is only receiving Social Security. Ms. Lieberman said that the Census does not ask for that
information from people.
Ms. Lieberman provided information on Large Households (5 or more person). About 21.8
percent of Anaheim households have 5 or more persons. About 58 percent of renter
households and 26 percent of owner households experience overpayment. About 88
percent renter households and 64 percent of owner household have “any housing
problems”. This is defined by HUD as overpayment, overcrowding, or lacking complete
kitchen or plumbing facilities. Committee Member Richardson commented that there are a
lot of households that have even more than 5 persons. Mr. Barquist noted that the Housing
Element has information for households with 7 or more persons per household.
Approximately 7,000 households in Anaheim have 7 or more persons (Table 1-11). The
numbers of large households have increased since 2000.
Ms. Lieberman provided information on Female-Headed Households. The State requires the
Housing Element to look at Female-Headed Households because they have historically had
the highest incidence of poverty. About 16 percent of Anaheim households are female-
headed and about 13 percent are living below poverty level. Committee Member Henninger
asked if female-headed households are defined as not having an adult male living in the
house. Ms. Lieberman responded yes, that the information provided excludes female-
headed households with an adult male present. Committee Member O’Brien asked what the
city-wide percent of persons living below poverty level is and if female-headed households
in Anaheim are more likely to be below the poverty level. Ms. Lieberman said that the
consultant will add the information to the Housing Element.
Ms. Lieberman showed information on Persons with Disabilities. About 1.8 percent of
residents between ages of 5 and 17 have a disability and 6.1 percent of residents between
ages of 18 and 64 have a disability. A new requirement of Housing Elements is to look at the
needs of persons with developmental disabilities. According to the Regional Center of
Orange County, 2,454 Anaheim residents have a developmental disability. The majority are
age 23 to 54. Committee Member Richardson commented that there is a growing number of
elderly in the City that need to move out of their homes into assisted living-type facilities and
asked if there is enough of that type of housing in the City to meet the need. Mr. Barquist
commented that the draft Housing Element includes numbers and percentages of elderly
with disabilities including self-care disabilities. Committee Member Richardson asked if there
has been an increase in the number with disabilities over time. Ms. Lieberman answered
that the numbers have actually decreased from 2000 to 2011. Committee Member
Henninger asked if it was a decrease in percentage or a decrease in absolute numbers. Mr.
Barquist responded that it was a decrease in persons by about 300.
Ms. Lieberman said that farmworkers comprise less than 1 percent of the City’s workforce. It
is assumed that these people are in or looking for permanent housing and not traditional
farmworker housing because there are no large seasonal fluctuations in farming in Anaheim.
Mr. Barquist commented that this different from a large agricultural community like Salinas
where farmworkers would come in to live in the city for just part of the year.
                                                                                                 5

Ms. Lieberman provided information on homeless persons from the 2011 County count. The
count found 207 sheltered homeless in Anaheim and 743 unsheltered homeless. This does
not include people living in motels. The preliminary data for 2013 shows the number of
homeless County-wide has gone down. Committee Member Richardson said she has not
seen a decline in West Anaheim and said that many of the parks have many homeless and
many motel families. She said that West Anaheim needs attention on this issue. Committee
Member Abdulrahman agreed. Committee Member Henninger said that addressing motel
families is important for Anaheim, both as homeless persons and also as persons in
inappropriate housing. Committee Member Richardson said that the hotels need to be
cleaned up and be held accountable. Mr. Borrego said that this could be a part of the policy
program discussion. Committee Member McCafferty noted that the City has tried to have the
hotels clean up, but the tenants at the time were concerned with being kicked out of the only
housing available to them. Committee Member Richardson said addressing homeless in
parks is important, maybe through building a place especially for them. Committee Member
Leos said that this would lead to NIMBY-ism and residents not wanting a homeless shelter
near them. He said the Housing Element may not be able to address all of these things as
they are politically challenging. Committee Member Henninger said he agreed to some
extent, but that the Housing Element should report the City’s issues related to
homelessness and motel families.
Committee Member Buffa asked for the definitions of population group quarters and
homeless and asked if the motel families are captured in any of these groups. Ms.
Lieberman answered that information comes from the Census and motel families do not
necessary receive the Census questionnaire. Committee Member Buffa said that a count of
persons living in motels is needed. Mr. Borrego said that Staff has made contact with the
task force that works with motel families and the task force has said they do not have a
count. Committee Member Buffa said that qualitative information could be provided. Ms.
Stepter commented that the City works with service providers that could provide anecdotal
information. She also said there is difference between motel families who are typically
“working poor” families with children and homeless in the parks that are mainly single and
couple adults. She said that the Community Services Department is proposing a pilot
program to provide storage bins to homeless to store their belongings while they go to a
shelter or service provider.
Mr. Borrego said that the City identified zones where a homeless shelter could be located as
a matter of right as part of implementing the current Housing Element under SB 2. The
ordinance includes detailed operational and development standards. Since the ordinance
has been adopted, there have not been any service providers that have approached the City
about opening a new shelter. There is a shelter being proposed in Fullerton close to the
Anaheim border.
Committee Member McCafferty said it is not a political issue to identify the homeless/motel
family need and the information is needed to help make recommendations for policy.
Committee Member Abdulrahman asked if the Census includes illegal immigrants.
Committee Member Henninger said that they receive the Census questionnaire. Mr. Borrego
said that the Census does not make a distinction between legal residents and illegal
residents. Mr. Barquist said it is possible that illegal immigrants could possibly be counted in
the Census, but cannot assume that they are captured. Ms. Lieberman commented that a
household with illegal immigrants may choose to report on less than the true number of
persons living in the house.
                                                                                                6

Committee Member Henninger asked if the information on vacancies for rental and housing
unit sizes could be matched up. The information may help make decisions on what
constraints and resources are. Ms. Lieberman responded that the information is not
available through the Census or Department of Finance. Committee Member Henninger
asked if there was another way to get the information, maybe through a sampling of
apartments throughout the City. Mr. Barquist said this could be done, but time and money
would need to be spent to complete a survey. Committee Member Henninger said it would
useful.
Committee Member Buffa noted Table 1-17 had errors in the number additions and
percentages. She asked if the location and unit type of those summarized in Table 1-23
(units lacking plumbing and kitchen) were known. Ms. Lieberman said they do not include a
converted garage because those units would be part of the main house. Committee Member
Buffa asked if code enforcement data could be connected to this. Mr. Borrego said that Staff
has created maps of where code enforcement calls for service occurred over time. Mr.
Nogal said the maps could be shown at the next Committee meeting. Mr. Borrego said the
self-reported numbers through the Census are probably not as helpful as the City’s code
enforcement data. Committee Member Buffa asked if plumbing/kitchen data must be
reported. Mr. Barquist said that it is required and noted that in the current Housing Element
there were questions about the usefulness of the information as well. Committee Member
Richardson asked if the information should be broken out into motels, etc.
Committee Member Buffa commented that “single-parent” households have the same issues
as female-headed households and that poverty is the determining factor, not gender.
Committee Member Henninger noted that he emailed a list of comments to Staff and
provided them for any other Committee Member or the public to look at.
Committee Member Buffa commented that she marked typos and formatting issues. Mr.
Barquist said that the Committee does not need to focus on formatting and staff would like
the Committee to focus on overarching policy discussions.
Committee Member Abdulrahman asked if the Committee will see the final version. Ms.
Lieberman said, yes, it will. Mr. Barquist said additional information on motel families, etc.
and updated data will be provided if available.
Ms. Lieberman provided an overview of the contents of Chapter 3: Resources and
Constraints Analysis. The State requires these topics to be analyzed. Constraints are the
potential constraints to housing. Governmental are the things the City has more control over.
Non-governmental includes things that the City does not necessarily have control over. The
chapter includes the following topics:
•   Governmental Constraints/Resources
          Land Use Controls including General Plan land use, zoning, parking
            requirements, open space requirements
          Density Bonus Ordinance. The City’s density bonus provides for more than the
            State-required density bonus, focused on rental housing.
          Provision of a Variety of Housing Types (emergency shelters, transitional
            housing, housing for persons with disabilities, etc.)
                                                                                               7

            Building Codes and Enforcement
            Development Fees, including a comparison between Anaheim and neighboring
             jurisdictions
          Processing and Procedures
          Environmental and Infrastructure including seismic, flooding and other factors
          CDBG and HOME Funds
          Developer Incentives
          On and Off-Site Improvement Requirements including street ROW, dedications,
             and other requirements for subdivisions
•   Non-Governmental Constraints/Resources
          Land Prices
          Construction Costs
          Financing
          Energy Conservation including incentives and promotion
Committee Member Abdulrahman commented that energy conservation could be
considered a governmental factor since it is a function of some City programs. Ms.
Lieberman said it could be moved to that section.
Committee Member Henninger said that Chapter reads as if there are no constraints and
everything is a resource. He gave an example of unit size requirements that may drive up
housing costs because of construction costs per square foot. The language may not be
accurate and should be looked at in detail. Mr. Borrego said that almost everything could be
considered a constraint, but at what point should the City address it as an issue? He said
that generally developers say Anaheim is a good place to do business and the fees and
processes are reasonable. He would like to identify constraints that really stand out as a red
flag and should be addressed in comparison to other cities. Committee Member Henninger
said that more units could be built if some of the zoning standards were not in place, which
increases supply and drives down cost. Mr. Borrego asked that the Committee identify those
barriers and constraints that appear to be significant. Mr. Barquist said that there may not
need to be a policy to address every constraint or resource. Identifying the constraints may
be difficult when there are many layers of development standards and incentives and may
be different for each project. He said a summary of the key things to think about could be
provided at the front end.
Committee Member Richardson commented that without parking requirements there would
be more overflow into the neighborhoods.
Committee Member Henninger said that there does not have to be a change for every
factor, but that the constraints should be clearly identified.
Committee Member McCafferty said he would like to see a comparison to other cities in
Orange County to see if Anaheim is competitive. He said that the BIA would likely tell the
City if the standards were not competitive. He thinks Anaheim is more developer-focused
than other cities.
                                                                                              8

  Committee Member Buffa said the approach should include discussion about how/why the
  City chooses to have standards that may affect the cost of housing and that it is a factor that
  should be acknowledged and considered.
  Committee Member Buffa noted that on page 3-2 the numbers do not add up. She also
  commented that on page 3-32 would be a good place to address motel families.
  Committee Member McCafferty said that aging infrastructure is a large constraint to housing
  development.
  Mr. Borrego said that Chapter 3 will be revised to have a better discussion of constraints
  versus opportunities and have a different introduction.
  In response to a question by Committee Member McCafferty, Mr. Borrego said that a Public
  Works staff member could present to discuss the City’s Capital Improvement Program and
  infrastructure deficiencies mapping at the next Committee meeting.
  Committee Member Henninger asked that a redline-strikeout version of the revised chapters
  be provided.

•   Approval of Minutes for the Meeting of June 19, 2013
    Motion by Henninger, second by AB. Passed as presented
•   Discussion Items
    1. Review of Housing Element Background Report Supplemental Information
       Staff and the consultant team provided additional background information in response to
       questions the Committee had during the previous meeting.
       Mr. Barquist indicated that more information on motel families will be provided by staff at
       the next Committee meeting.
       Principal Planner Borrego provided information on overpayment based on sampling of
       Census tracks in different parts of the City (west, east and central). There were some
       similarities across the City. In Anaheim Hills, approximately 45 percent of the
       households are experiencing overpayment. In west Anaheim overpayment rates are in
       the low 50 percent range. In central Anaheim, between 50 and 60 percent of households
       are experiencing overpayment. It appears that generally areas with lower incomes have
       higher rates of overpayment.
                                                                                                 1

   Mr. Barquist provided information about substandard housing and code enforcement
   service calls in the city. There were 5,223 housing related complaints from June 2011 to
   June 2013. Heat maps showing the number of complaints were provided to the
   Committee members and shown on the screen. There were more complaints in the west
   and central parts of the City than the east. Principal Planner Borrego noted that many of
   the hotspots correlate to higher density neighborhoods built with apartments. He
   explained that City has identified Level 1 through 4 neighborhoods. Level 4
   neighborhoods have the most signs of physical decay.
   Committee Member Henninger asked if there were any hotspot areas that are not
   already part of a priority or Level 4 neighborhood in the City.
   Principal Planner Borrego responded yes. He gave the example of a neighborhood on
   the west side of Euclid, north of I-5, that had high level of service calls, but is not a Level
   3 or 4 neighborhood.
   Committee Member Henninger asked when the priority neighborhoods survey was
   conducted.
   Principal Planner Borrego responded that it was conducted about 10 years ago.
   Committee Member Abdulrahman asked if the hotspots correlate to age of housing.
   Principal Planner Borrego responded yes.
   Committee Member Henninger commented the hotspots seem to include some of the
   City’s older neighborhoods, but not the oldest neighborhoods that have likely been
   rehabilitated already.
   Ms. Lieberman provided information from the BIA Development Fee Survey for 2011-
   2012. A comparison of the fees in Anaheim, Irvine, Newport Beach and Brea was
   shown.
   Mr. Victor Cao from the BIA Orange County provided an additional comparison that was
   recently conducted for the City of Irvine. He also said that an 8 percent hourly rate
   increase is expected to be adopted by the City of Anaheim. The BIA has been in
   discussions with the City about the rate increase and understands that the rate increase
   is going to be used to have staffing available to keep up with the level of development
   and provide the same level of customer service that Anaheim has historically provided.
2. Initial Review of Housing Element Policy Program
   Mr. Barquist explained that City staff and the consultants are working on drafting edits to
   the existing policies based on available funding and other resources. Those
   recommended changes to the policy program will be provided at the next Committee
   meeting.
   Mr. Barquist asked that the Committee provide additional information tonight about some
   of the items brought up for additional consideration by the Committee during prior
   meetings. For each topic, the Committee was asked to discuss and provide direction
   what the context is around the topic, what is the desired end state or objective, and what
   are the potential strategies and techniques for addressing the issue.
                                                                                                 2

Rehabilitation and Preservation of Older Housing Stock
Committee Member McCafferty said he wants the City to prevent more code
enforcement hotspots. He is starting to see some neighborhoods “fray around the
edges” and wants to focus on these areas where redevelopment is not going to occur to
prevent the neighborhoods from further deterioration.
Committee Member Buffa commented that the City can use code enforcement as a tool
for this and also may be able to recoup the cost.
Committee Member Greenberg said she is concerned about large homes being
subdivided into multiple units. She would like to see new development respect the
character of the existing neighborhood.
Committee Member Kreitner said the City needs to address the housing shortage while
being careful not to discourage multi-generational families living together. Her
organization encourages extended families to live together to deal with cost and
availability issues. She noted that it is hard to police multiple families living in one house.
Committee Member Greenberg said multiple people living in the same house is not the
issue as much as a single family house being divided into multiple separate dwelling
units.
Committee Member O’Brien said the granny flat concept and other zoning incentives are
key to providing economic incentives to homeowner or developer to rehab a home and
add unit.
Committee Member McCafferty said the City must allow granny flats/second units under
state law. Property owners should be required to comply with housing codes and make
sure the building is maintained.
Committee Member Buffa said the situation is allowing multi-family uses in a single
family zone.
Mr. Barquist commented that the Committee appears to want the policy to focus on how
the neighborhood feels and the quality of the neighborhood.
Committee Member Henninger commented that both the condition of individual units and
the feeling of community/neighborhood should be included. He suggested that if there
are neighborhoods with properties that are already becoming more multifamily in nature
that the entire neighborhood be encouraged to transition to multifamily.
Committee Member Richardson commented that parking will be an issue if this happens.
Committee Member McCafferty said this may create spillover into the community. He
would like to see exterior maintenance, enforcing building and zoning, and proactive
code enforcement.
Principal Planner Borrego said the City has flexible second unit guidelines in the Zoning
Code right now. The largest limitation on second units is infrastructure availability in
                                                                                              3

some areas of the City. Second units are also required to provide an additional parking
space.
Committee Member Richardson expressed concern about garage conversions.
Principal Planner Borrego responded that garage conversions are not allowed and it is a
comment code enforcement complaint.
Committee Member Henninger commented that the use of garages for storage causes
parking problems. He also commented that often the parkways are not irrigated or
maintained and make the neighborhood look run down.
Principal Planner Borrego responded that the homeowner is responsible for maintaining
the parkways. He said that the City recently amended the Municipal Code to include
clear requirements for maintaining parkways which will allow code enforcement to more
effectively act on these cases.
Committee Member Kreitner commented that unmaintained front yards are also a
problem and a deterrent from renting/owning in a neighborhood.
Principal Planner Borrego responded that homeowners are required to maintain
landscaping per the Municipal Code. The level of code enforcement is often determined
by the amount of resources provided by City Council. The current City Council is
providing more resources to code enforcement than in the past.
Committee Member Richardson commented that many people are not aware of code
enforcement or how to submit a complaint.
Committee Member McCafferty suggested having a standard reminder flyer that code
enforcement can post on doors of homes with maintenance issues so that a formal case
does not have to be opened.
Principal Planner Borrego said the City takes a cooperative approach with the property
owners for code enforcement.
Committee Member Abdulrahman asked about commercial trucks parking in residential
neighborhoods overnight.
Principal Planner Borrego said there is a size/weight limit to trucks that can park in
residential neighborhoods.
Mr. Barquist asked if there were any comments from the Committee about resources for
code enforcement, understanding that the City can be proactive and the community can
also contribute.
Committee Member Buffa commented that some of the older HOA’s in the City do not
have much control over architectural issues and not a lot of authority to enforce
standards.
                                                                                        4

Committee Member Greenberg suggested a statement be made about not allowing
“McMansions” to change the character of the neighborhood and that the Planning
Commission should be responsible for not allowing deviation.
Principal Planner Borrego responded that many of the large houses do not require
Planning Commission review/action and that the City does not have design guidelines
that would cover these issues.
Committee Member O’Brien suggested ways to educate people about code enforcement
should be considered. For rehabilitation and preservation housing, neighborhoods or
older units could be identified and be eligible for permit relief or other incentives.
Mr. Cao commented that the City of Tustin had a very successful permit relief program.
Committee Member Buffa commented that Anaheim had a similar program in the past.
Committee Member Henninger suggested looking at what other Post-War cities have
done to address aging housing.
Committee Member McCafferty suggested the policy should be multi-faceted and
include code enforcement, targeted incentives, and targeting certain neighborhoods first
to maximize the effect in a shorter period of time.
Committee Member Richardson agreed with Committee Member McCafferty.
Committee Member Henninger commented that the list of priority neighborhoods should
be updated.
Motel Families
Mr. Barquist commented that the current Housing Element does not address motel
families and motel families were not a large discussion item in the last Housing Element
update.
Committee Member Richardson suggested having the Illumination Foundation speak to
the Committee and provide guidance on the topic.
Committee Member Kreitner commented that her organization has been working with
motel families for several years. May motel families are in need of help with move-in
costs and credit repair to move into permanent housing. Disney has recently approached
the organization to understand who is living the motels. She noted that the City has just
released a RFP for case management to help motel families move into permanent
housing.
Committee Member McCafferty asked what the makeup of a typical motel family is.
Committee Member Kreitner said they usually start as a 2-parent household and many
times evolve into a single-parent household. Families often move to campgrounds in the
summer, but new enforcement levels at campgrounds have prevented that this year.
Substance abuse generally occurs with single (non-family) motel occupants. Some
                                                                                          5

families have been in motels for as long as five years. The cost to “rent” a motel room is
about the same as the cost of an apartment, but food costs can be higher since there
are no kitchens to cook in.
Committee Member McCafferty asked if income in an ongoing issue once a motel family
is established in permanent housing.
Committee Member Kreitner responded that about 30 percent of motel families could be
placed in permanent housing if helped with security deposit and dealing with eviction
issues. The organization follows the families on a quarterly basis for a year to make sure
income is not an issue.
Committee Member McCafferty commented that the market has not filled the gap for this
type of housing needed.
Committee Member Kreitner commented that rapid rehousing is a fairly new model. HUD
is focusing on getting people out of transitional housing within 9 to 12 months and is
moving down to getting people out in 30 days, but some people may need longer to
become established.
Committee Member Greenberg commented that some motels are taking advantage of
families by not providing appropriate facilities and asked how enforcement could be
done.
Committee Member Kreitner suggested “family motels” be required to have one room
dedicated to support services. She gave the example of the El Dorado and Valencia
motels as being model facilities.
Committee Member Greenberg asked what kind of requirements for kitchens, etc. are
motels held to.
Housing Programs Manager Stepter said motels are not considered housing providers,
but a business. She commented that police have limited enforcement ability. She said
that the City has some federal ESG money to provide to agencies for rapid rehousing
and rental assistance. The goal of the program is to help 20 to 45 families.
Committee Member Richardson asked if there will be monitoring of the recipients of this
fund.
Housing Programs Manager Stepter said the families are required to receive supportive
services, document income every three months, and abide by house rules.
Principal Planner Borrego said the City is looking at changing ordinances for motel
operations. He asked if there enough service providers available if motels would be
required to provide space for on-site supportive services.
Committee Member Kreitner said there are many service providers including small, faith-
based providers that would be interested. She suggested that he City pay for the room
for supportive services at each motel for a year.
                                                                                           6

Committee Member Greenberg commented that providing a space for services is not
enough, but that the City should consider if the rest of the motel is an appropriate place
for people to live.
Committee Member Henninger commented that a motel will never be a quality living
environment.
Committee Member Greenberg expressed concern about crime in motels.
Committee Member Richardson said the new ordinance would address all motels and
include security requirements and things like requiring parking permits.
Committee Member McCafferty said having on-site services is a good idea because the
non-profit provider can be the eyes on the site for the City, including police. He also
commented that families should be getting out of motels into permanent housing as
quickly as possible. He said that the ordinance should also not give the motels
opportunity to transition to being used as housing if they are not already.
Committee Member Henninger asked if the City can do anything to encourage
apartment owners to take in motel families by loosening requirements for credit and
background checks.
Housing Programs Manager Stepter said the City has had discussions with affordable
housing providers regarding this idea but with little success.
Committee Member Buffa said the City should not be involved in trying to get property
owners to accept motel families and that private and faith-based organizations should be
taking on that role.
Committee Member Henninger asked for clarification on the difference between having a
public agency help people maintain their home through funding programs versus
assisting families get into apartments.
Committee Member Buffa responded that the public agency’s role should be focused on
citing code violations.
Committee member Henninger asked if there were incentives that could be provided to
apartment owners to encourage them to accept the financial risk of allowing a motel
family to move in.
Committee Member Kreitner said there would have to be financial incentives or a
guarantee that someone would pay the rent if the tenant could.
Committee Member Buffa commented that the Housing Element should acknowledge
that motels have become defacto transitional housing, but motels also help bridge the
gap when people do not have other options.
Committee Member Kreitner agreed and also suggested the City look at designating
some motels as “family motels” that are safe environments.
                                                                                           7

Committee Member Richardson stressed the importance of having the pending
ordinance for motels adopted.
Committee Member Buffa commented that motels need to be recognized as businesses,
not housing providers.
Committee Member Greenberg asked for clarification on the purpose of the discussion
and the Committee’s role in drafting new policy.
Mr. Barquist responded that the Housing Element provides the framework to define and
solve issues, but the Committee does not need to actually come up with the solutions
tonight. The Committee should provide input on overarching direction and the policies
will consider available resources and participation by the City and other agencies.
Committee Member Henninger suggested that the Housing Element define the problem
as families using motels as transitional housing.
Committee Member Kreitner added that part of the problem is that the motel families are
not connected to supportive services, which would help reduce the length of
homelessness.
Committee Member Henninger summarized that the policy should focus on moving
motel families to appropriate permanent housing and providing better alternatives for
people who would otherwise move in to motels.
After a short recess, Mr. Barquist commented that the Committee will discuss
infrastructure at the next meeting and that proactive code enforcement was already
addressed in the first topic discussion.
Homelessness
Committee Member McCafferty commented that homelessness seems to be a smaller
issue compared to the other needs throughout the City.
Committee Member Kreitner commented that the homeless Point-in-Time Count is not
accurate and that rain on the day that counts were taken skewed this year’s results. She
said that the count showed a decrease in homelessness Countywide, but they know that
is not true.
Committee Member Henninger commented that people he has spoken to are noticing
more homeless because the homeless are congregating more in concentrated areas,
usually where services and meals are provide.
Committee Member McCafferty agreed that concentrated services attract more
homeless people to that spot.
Principal Planner Borrego said that the City established by-right zoning for homeless
shelters under requirements of SB 2. Many complaints about homeless shelters are
regarding loitering, but the City’s ordinance requires a shelter to be open 24 hours a day
and have supportive services to prevent loitering. The City put the zoning in place on a
                                                                                          8

large amount of land and worked with service providers to make sure the ordinance
worked for them.
Committee Member Kreitner asked to see a map of the areas that are zoned to permit
emergency shelters by-right.
Principal Planner Borrego said he will email a map to the group.
Committee Member McCafferty said it sounds like the City has taken all the appropriate
steps regards to homelessness and shelters.
Committee Member Henninger commented that no shelter has been proposed in
Anaheim even though land is zoned for it.
Committee Member Kreitner said there are many steps to open a shelter and it will take
time and money.
Housing Programs Manger Stepter said that the County has identified general fund
money to develop a shelter, but it will serve the larger homeless population.
Committee Member McCafferty asked if there tend to be differences between a motel
family and a homeless person/family.
Committee Member Kreitner said some homeless persons choose to live on the street
as a lifestyle and are not willing to take supportive services.
Committee Member Richardson said some homeless persons like living in the parks.
Committee Member Kreitner said that the Housing Element should support the efforts of
non-profits that propose shelters.
Housing Programs Manager Stepter said that the City is developing a pilot program for
storage of belongings for homeless persons in the parks. The program will also look at
coordinating meals and steering people to supportive services.
Mr. Cao said that the BIA is involved with the issue through its sister organization
HomeAID. He said that they agree with Committee Member Kreitner that the Point-in-
Time count is inaccurate. He also stated that a small percentage of the Orange County
homeless population is chronically homeless. He also said that 60 to 70 percent of the
homeless are families.
Committee Member Kreitner commented that motel families become homeless for a
couple weeks of the year.
Mr. Barquist summarized the discussion and said the policy will include coordination and
monitoring.
Committee Member Kreitner asked if there could be a policy stating the City’s intention
to support the building of an emergency shelter.
Mr. Barquist responded that it would be something that the City Council would decide.
                                                                                        9

Committee Member Buffa said that “support” would need to be defined.
Committee Member Kreitner clarified that support would mean support another provider
to come in and develop the shelter.
Principal Planner Borrego said the current zoning allows for by-right development of a
shelter with up to 50 beds. There is no requirement for a public hearing.
Committee Member Henninger commented that the areas permitting shelters are all
industrial areas that may not have access to public transit, restaurants, grocery stores,
medical clinics and other services that support quality of life. The areas zoned also limit
the City’s ability to provide support though Housing Authority-owned land.
Principal Planner Borrego commented that the City did look at proximity to transportation
when identifying the areas to ensure the homeless had access to services which may
not exist in a industrial area.
Committee Member Kreitner said transportation in close proximity to the shelter is key.
Medical services and food could be brought in. She raised concerns about lighting and
unsafe street crossings from transit stops to the facilities in industrial areas. She
suggested the policy consider City support for improving these conditions with
crosswalks and lights in the public right-of-way.
Principal Planner Borrego said the goal is to present the draft policy program to the City
Council on August 20th. Staff will come back to the group with a final draft of the full
Housing Element before it goes to HCD.
Persons with Developmental Disabilities
Housing Programs Manager Stepter noted that there are three developments for the
developmentally in the City. The City participated by adding Section 8 vouchers/funding
to the units.
Committee Member McCafferty recommended stating a policy to continue existing
programs.
Housing Programs Manger Stepter commented that funds for the construction of the
units are not available with the elimination of Redevelopment.
Committee Member Henninger commented that the Diamond Aisle project used other
funds besides RDA funds and that the Housing Authority has land it could provide.
Committee Member Buffa suggested that the Housing Element note the use of RDA
funds is not available although they were dependent upon in the past. She also
commented that the City’s Zoning Code allows for group homes that serve disabled
populations.
                                                                                          10

Employer Contribution to Workforce Housing
Mr. Barquist commented that policy might be to engage employers in identifying how
they can participate in providing housing for their workers.
Committee Member Richardson asked if the City was giving funds to house some
employees at CIM.
Associate Planner Nogal said there was a program for rental assistance at one time but
unsure of its current status.
Committee Member Kreitner asked if the policy would be looking at employers giving
funds to their employees or giving funds to build new units.
Mr. Barquist read the existing policy in the current Housing Element.
Committee Member Kreitner said the policy sounds comprehensive but asked if there
have been any results from it.
Mr. Barquist responded there has been employer interest, but no commitments.
Committee Member O’Brien said that the ability to form public-private partnerships has
diminished since Redevelopment has been eliminated. He suggested it would be
appropriate for employers to help their employees through vouchers or a matching plan,
but it would not make sense to require businesses to pay for housing. This could result
in driving business away.
Committee Member McCafferty agreed with Committee Member O’Brien.
Committee Member Henninger said he likes the existing language, but it could be
strengthened. He suggested looking at the City of Irvine’s affordable housing trust fund.
He also suggested looking at the transportation and environmental impacts of
companies that provide low wage jobs where employees have to commute a long
distance.
Committee Member O’Brien commented that new development is already required to
pay transportation impact fees.
Committee Member McCafferty commented that personal choice also plays a part in
where one lives. He noted that, in Irvine, it is easier to negotiate because there is one
large primary landowner, where Anaheim has many more landowners.
Committee Member Henninger suggested utilizing transportation fees to reduce the
impacts by providing housing closer to jobs rather than mitigating the traffic impacts that
encourage long distance commutes.
Mr. Cao said that many impact fees are programed to mitigate specific impacts and it
would be challenging to change this. He said that planning through SB 375 has looked at
providing more housing through vertical growth in certain places. He also commented
that Irvine encourages affordable housing units to be constructed before adding to the
affordable housing trust fund.
                                                                                          11

Mr. Barquist summarized the Committee’s discussion and said the policy will be drafted
to explore the issue and not suggest solutions right away.
Committee members McCafferty, O’Brien and Buffa said a housing tax should not be
explored.
Committee member McCafferty said he would rather incentivize the development of
housing.
Committee Member Greenberg asked if there is a requirement for affordable housing for
higher density projects
Committee Member McCafferty responded no.
Mr. Cao referenced a court case, Palmer v. Los Angeles that does not allow affordable
units to be required of high density projects.
Committee Member Buffa said the City provides density bonus incentives.
Committee Member O’Brien said that many of the incentives/tools such as
downpayment assistance have gone away with the elimination of redevelopment and the
language in the Housing Element should reflect this challenge.
Principal Planner Borrego commented that the City is seeing a slow, but steady stream
of affordable units proposed by using density bonus incentives and tax credits.
Committee Member Henninger asked that the Housing Element look at how to
encourage developers to build more housing.
Committee Member Kreitner asked about rental rates and housing prices and noted that
she has seen a large increase recently.
Committee Member Richardson said she has seen a leveling, but there are a lot of
investors purchasing and renting out homes with high rents.
Committee Member Abdulrahman asked if rent control was an option.
Associate Planner Nogal said density bonus projects are required to have affordable
units for 30 to 55 years, depending on the program.
Mr. Barquist gave an example of where rent control might be applicable in another city
with mobile home parks. He said that the Housing Element cannot necessarily solve
rental rates as there are private market factors.
Committee Member Greenberg stated that she is not in favor of rent control.
Mr. Cao said that the BIA is creating a model ordinance for inclusionary housing and
Committee Member Balsamo will provide that information when available.
                                                                                       12

      Other Items
      Committee Member Abdulrahman asked if the Committee will discuss CEQA.
      Mr. Barquist said the CEQA process will be streamlined and there will not be an EIR.
      Principal Planner Borrego asked if there are other items the Committee would like staff
      to address in the draft policies.
      Committee Member Henninger asked that ideas for how to encourage development of
      more housing units be included.

•   Approval of Minutes for the Meeting of July 30, 2013
    Committee Member Kreitner asked to clarify a comment recorded on page 9 of the minutes
    regarding motel families. Her comment should read motel families may become homeless a
    couple of weeks out of every month, instead of a couple weeks out of the year.
    Committee Member Henninger motioned to approve the minutes as amended. The motion
    was second by Committee Member Kreitner and carried. Committee Member Leos
    abstained.
•   Discussion Items
    1. Review of Housing Element Background Report Supplemental Information
        Development Fees
        Planning Director Vander Dussen provided the Committee with additional information
        about how City’s hourly fee for planning and building plan check and permitting was
        derived. Each city can set its own fees. Some cities choose to subsidize the fees.
        Approximately five years ago, the City of Anaheim switched to full cost recovery and the
        fee was set at $181 per hour by the City Council. The fees cover employee salary and
                                                                                                1

overhead costs. There have not been any increases to the fees in the last five years,
although costs have gone up. The City subsidizes $40,000 to $500,000 in fees every
year from the General Fund. The proposed increase is not changing the planning fees.
The proposed increase is eight percent for building plan check and inspection fees. The
increase in fees will allow for an additional plans examiner and other positions to
maintain levels of customer service. The City met with the BIA and developers to discuss
the fees and have not received opposition.
Committee Member Kreitner asked if there was a possibility for rate relief for non-profit
organizations. Planning Director Vander Dussen said this has not happened yet, but the
City Council could choose to do this. Committee Member Kreitner suggested looking in
to rate relieve for non-profits seeking CUPs.
Committee Member Henninger asked how often the City returns a portion of the deposit.
Planning Director Vander Dussen said it depends on the application. CUPs without
CEQA documents typically do not exceed the deposit amount while projects with more
extensive outreach or CEQA documents usually require more than the initial deposit.
Committee Member O’Brien commented that not being able to move deposit funds
around between City departments from deposit leads to longer time and more paperwork
for the developer. Planning Director Vander Dussen said the City can look at its
practices in this area. Committee Member O’Brien noted that the City has provided good
customer service for his company in the past.
Homeless/Motel Families
Mr. Barquist showed a map of the City’s emergency shelter opportunity areas. Principal
Planner Borrego explained that the areas shown in green permit emergency shelters by-
right. The areas shown in blue are industrial areas within 1,000 feet of a residential zone
and shelters not permitted in these areas.
Committee Member Leos commented that there are no green areas around La
Palma/Imperial Highway. Principal Planner Borrego said these are industrial areas within
1,000 feet of residential zones.
Committee Member Richardson noted that there is an area that permits shelters close to
La Palma Park.
Committee Member Leos asked if there is a shelter proposed in that area. Principal
Planner Borrego responded that there was a shelter proposed near there, but in the City
of Fullerton. The County has chosen not to proceed with plans for that shelter due to
opposition.
Infrastructure
Principal Engineer Garcia gave a brief presentation on infrastructure deficiencies in the
City. The Public Works Department deals with three types of deficiencies. The first are
roadways related to traffic. In this case, the City requires roadway widening and
dedications. The second type is storm drain deficiencies. New water quality
requirements include containment on-site, but when a site is constrained and cannot
infiltrate all of the runoff, the project is required to help offset the increased demand to
the system. West Anaheim has the most storm drain constraints. The third type of
deficiency is sewer. In the past, the City identified priority sties and generated funds
                                                                                             2

   through bonds to upsize certain sewer lines. These projects are coming to an end.
   Looking forward, the City will look at where upgrades will have the biggest benefit. The
   sewer in Central Anaheim has operational deficiency with smaller, 100-year old sewer
   lines. There is also a capacity deficiency. Sewer impact fees help offset some of the cost
   for upgrades. West and Central Anaheim are generally sewer deficient, but East
   Anaheim is not. There are no deficiencies in terms of potable water and electricity. There
   are also constraints if the County does not upgrade the storm channels that it controls.
   Most of the sewage goes to the County sanitation district for processing, but the City is
   not aware of any constraints with the County sanitation facilities.
   Committee Member O’Brien suggested that the City research the means and methods to
   make funding available to upgrade infrastructure that serves the housing opportunity
   sites so that these sites are available without deficiencies.
   Principal Engineer Garcia said the City is updating its maps of deficiencies right now
   based on existing and ultimate buildout conditions. The burden will be on the developer
   if a project goes beyond buildout. The City identifies deficiencies based on computer
   models and also by monitoring actual sewer flows. The City also develops diversions to
   spread out the flow into the sewer system and help increase capacity. If an improvement
   is built by the developer, the developer is not charged the impact fee.
   Committee Member Leos asked if there are any areas that are critical or emergency
   cases. Principal Engineer Garcia said there are no emergency cases right now, but the
   City is careful about development in the Downtown/Central Anaheim area.
   Committee Member Richardson asked if the diversions are permanent. Principal
   Engineer Garcia responded yes.
   Committee Member Richardson asked if the apartment development on Ball Road in the
   unincorporated areas were required to provide infrastructure upgrades or did the City
   provide the upgrades. Principal Planner Garcia responded that if the area is serviced by
   the City, the County must get approval from the City before development occurs. The
   Ball Road apartments paid sewer impact fees. The storm drains in that area do not have
   any additional capacity and every project must retain its storm water on site.
   Committee Member Henninger asked if the City has limits for on-site stormwater
   retention. Principal Engineer Garcia responded that the City provides guidance and
   reviews the water quality management plan for each project. The most ideal place to
   retain water is on open land, but there is no open land available. Most sites infiltrate
   stormwater in the front yards. Some projects have done creative things like permeable
   concrete gutters, but this can impact existing utilities such as cable.
2. Review of Housing Element Policy Program
   Mr. Barquist and Principal Planner Borrego explained that Staff and the consultant will
   walk through the existing 2006-2014 policy program with the Committee and talk about
   whether each policy will potentially be removed or kept for the new policy program.
   Committee Member Henninger said that he would like to discuss how the City can
   increase the number of units being developed. He commented that while the City’s
                                                                                             3

zoning is generally good, it is hard to achieve the maximum densities due to parking
requirements, landscape setbacks, and other requirements.
Committee Member O’Brien commented that Anaheim’s setbacks are based on distance
between primary, secondary, and tertiary sides of buildings. This occurs in other cities in
California as well. His company has applied for a CUP to achieve compromises to the
requirements in the zoning code.
Committee Member Henninger provided an example, Diamond Aisle, where the site
configuration and setback requirements made development difficult.
Planning Director Vander Dussen said the City allows projects to modify the setbacks
and other requirements through a CUP, instead of a variance. The CUP does not require
the same level of findings that a variance does.
Principal Planner Borrego gave an example of small lot single family homes where the
traditional development standards do not fit with the lot sizes. The City has allowed
modifications to the standards through a CUP instead of a variance. The CUP also
allows the City to look at each project individually to see what is appropriate.
Committee Member Leos asked if the CUP has been a good tool to use or if the process
has been difficult. Committee Member O’Brien responded that his experience has been
positive
Committee Member Leos asked if there have been any examples of projects that were
not able to be built because of the CUP requirements. Committee Member O’Brien
responded that there have been some projects that have only been able to move
forward because of the CUP process.
Committee Member Henninger said the only possibility of the process preventing a
development would be if the City would not allow use of the CUP.
Principal Planner Borrego said he does not have any examples of projects that have not
been developed because of the CUP. The City works closely with developers to resolve
any issues.
Committee Member Buffa commented that other cities require a specific plan to get
same result. The specific plan is a longer and more expensive process.
Committee Member O’Brien commented that the CUP process is more predictable.
Committee Member Greenberg commented that West Anaheim has a lot of density no
places for kids to play. She asked how this can be prevented.
Principal Planner Borrego said this is addressed through development standards for
open space/recreational space.
Committee Member Leos commented that the City is becoming more cognizant of
requiring open space and play areas in last few years.
Principal Planner Borrego said in the late 80’s/early 90’s there was a push from the City
Council to reduce permitted densities in Central and West Anaheim through
downzoning.
                                                                                           4

Committee Member Leos commented that residents more willing speak up about
projects now and ask for more open space and less density.
Committee Member Buffa said upzoning has occurred in the Platinum Triangle where
the infrastructure capacity allows for more density. Upzoning is a way to incentivize
development and the market needs to catch up now.
Committee Member Richardson commented that in West Anaheim higher density
development has changed the dynamic of the area. She would like to see more
homeownership.
Committee Member Greenberg said young people are moving back to urban
environments. She asked how Anaheim can develop an urban environment, but can also
have places to interact, and schools and transportation.
Mr. Barquist asked for a recommendation for policy related to the topic from the
Committee. He summarized the Committee’s discussions into two topics. One about
creating community and one about providing the private market the ability to achieve the
most development. There were community design and sustainability in policy
considerations in the 2006-2014 Housing Element. The policy regarding private market
and incentives could be exploratory.
Committee Member Leos suggested looking into providing new affordable housing in
east Anaheim where infrastructure is available.
Committee Member Henninger suggested looking at areas of the City where projects
could get tax credits for funding. These would need access to transportation and would
help spread out the affordable housing supply.
Mr. Barquist suggested using the term “community infrastructure”.
Committee Member Henninger suggested that the City include an objective to meet the
RHNA needs for low, moderate and above moderate housing through development of
market rate housing.
Committee Member Buffa asked how the City would make this happen.
Committee Member Henninger suggested reducing parking requirements for high
density projects.
Committee Member Buffa commented that it would be difficult to change lifestyles of
residents to move away from having a car.
Committee Member O’Brien said Anaheim can look to how mature cities have handled
parking. Parking becomes more of a premium. He also commented that providing more
parking is not a way to facilitate growth.
Committee Member Richardson commented that Anaheim does not have the public
transit to accommodate people who choose not to have a car.
Principal Planner Borrego said the City has reduced parking standards in the Platinum
Triangle. The City also looks at parking for mixed-use projects on a case-by-case basis.
Affordable housing projects also get a break on parking based on the density bonus
ordinance.
                                                                                         5

Committee Member Leos asked where kids will go to school in Platinum Triangle. There
are no schools within walking distance.
Mr. Barquist said there are existing policies in the Housing Element that discuss
coordination, monitoring and developing techniques/tools to incentivize private
development. He said that policy could be modified.
After a short recess, Mr. Barquist reviewed he policy matrix with the Committee. The
draft policy program will be shared with the Committee in advance of the next meeting.
Housing Production Strategy 1A. Meet or Exceed the Production Goals for the
Affordable Housing Strategic Plan
Committee Member O’Brien how many units have been completed under the Affordable
Housing Strategic Plan to date.
Associate Planner Nogal said most of the projects have been completed and some are
under development right now, including Cherry Orchard. The City Council updated the
plan to allow for rehabilitation of units and affordable for-sale units.
Committee Member O’Brien said the policy should include for-sale and mixed income
developments and the objective should be updated to match the RHNA numbers.
Principal Planner Borrego said the City can determine quantified objectives different
from the RHNA numbers based on the City’s resources and market conditions.
Mr. Barquist said Staff with come back at the next meeting with policy language for
consideration.
Housing Production Strategy 1C: Expedited Processing for Extremely Low, Very
Low, Low and Moderate Income Housing Developments
Committee Member Buffa suggested adding fee waivers and reductions for non-profit
organizations to this policy.
Principal Planner Borrego noted that staff will update target numbers for all of the
policies based on funding availability.
Housing Production Strategy 1I: Implementation of the Platinum Triangle Master
Land Use Plan
Principal Planner Borrego noted that capacity in the Platinum Triangle has increased
since this policy was written.
Committee Member Greenberg asked how many units have been built in the Platinum
Triangle to date.
Principal Planner Borrego said he could provide that information to the Committee.
Housing Production Strategy 1L: Developer Incentives Program
Committee Member O’Brien said this policy should look at new incentives and
replacements for RDA funding. Mr. Barquist said loss of RDA funding will be added to
the policy considerations and the policy program could include exploring alternative
funding.
Housing Production Strategy 1P: Police Residence Assistance
                                                                                       6

Committee Member O’Brien asked how many police officers have actually taken
advantage of this program. Housing Program Stepter said that there were fewer than 10
in the current planning period.
Committee Member Kreitner commented that police officers might not want to live in the
same City where they work.
Housing Programs Manager Stepter said there are some programs that encourage
officers to live in the neighborhoods they work in.
Committee Member Leos commented that the internet allows people to find out where
others live.
Housing Production Strategy 1Q: Compliance with SB 2- Adequate Sites for
Emergency Shelters/Transitional Housing
Committee Member Kreitner suggested revising to add language to support the
implementation of emergency shelters.
Housing Production Strategy 1U: Land Acquisition and Write Downs
Committee Member O’Brien commented that the City should look at finding replacement
funding for this program.
Other Comments
Committee Member Kreitner asked if the City could increase the cost share for Section 8
vouchers and then offer more vouchers. Housing Programs Manager Stepter responded
that the 30 percent cost share is a federal requirement. There are some cases where the
cost share could go up to 40 percent at entry if the family wants to move into housing
that costs more.
Committee Member Kreitner suggested the City include language on supporting
emergency shelters by offering CUP relief, providing safety improvements such as
crosswalks and lighting, support in community outreach, and flexibility on what the
shelter would look like. Shelters could be in a large tent. The City could also offer
monetary support. .
Committee Member Henninger agreed with Committee Member Kreitner.
Principal Planner Borrego noted that a CUP not required for shelters with 50 or less
beds.
Committee Member Kreitner asked if there are other permits required for shelters.
Principal Planner Borrego responded that building permits are required separately.
Principal Planner Vander Dussen said the City Council would need to allocate money
from the General Fund to support shelters with money.
Committee Member Kreitner noted that a shelter has not been developed even though
the zoning allows it.
                                                                                       7

Principal Planner Borrego said the City has not received any direct feedback from
organizations saying if or why a shelter would not be feasible.
Committee Member Kreitner said she will talk to some organizations about what would
be needed to build a shelter and will report back at the next meeting.
Committee Member Henninger suggested changing Strategy 4A to focus on Avon
Dakota and say the source of funds is residual receipts used by the Anaheim Housing
Authority.
Housing Programs Manager Stepter said the City is looking to expand the program to
Guinida Lane, not exclusively Avon Dakota.
Committee Member Leos asked for Committee input on potential incentives for
developers.
Committee Member O’Brien said the City needs to find a replacement for the things that
were previously done through RDA, including property assembly and brownfields clean
up.
Committee Member Leos said he wants developers to be excited to develop in Anaheim.
Committee Member O’Brien reiterated that the zoning code could be modified if
developers are not able to active the maximum densities.
Committee Member Buffa said the City needs to balance new housing with density.
Committee Member Henninger commented that the City Council members are not land
use planners and they do not necessarily see the impacts of land use decisions. The
Committee can provide them with guidance.
Committee Member Greenberg commented that motels that are part residential use and
part motels are problematic.
Principal Planner Borrego said that staff looked at the possibility of motel conversions as
part of the Affordable Housing Strategic Plan, but the motel owners were not incentivized
to convert because motels can be lucrative. The City has designated many of the motel
areas as residential in the General Plan and the areas will slowly transition to permanent
housing.
Committee Member Greenberg asked if a motel could be both a residential use and a
motel.
Principal Planner Borrego responded that the Zoning Code does not allow the motels to
be both residential units and motels.
Committee Member Kreitner commented that the only way it seems to have to motels
convert to residential would be for someone to buy out the existing owner and redevelop.
                                                                                          8

      Principal Planner Borrego said the workshop on the Housing Element with the City
      Council will be on September 3rd at 3:00 pm and the Committee is invited to attend.
      Committee Member Richardson asked when the draft policy program will be ready for
      the Committee to review.
      Principal Planner Borrego said he will let the Committee know shortly.
      Principal Planner Borrego said, in response to an earlier question, that approximately
      2,000 units have been constructed in the Platinum Triangle and another 8,000 units are
      entitled but not built.
      Committee Member Richardson asked if the entitlements are recent or older.
      Principal Planner Borrego said some of the entitlements are older.
      Committee Member Richardson asked if there is building activity in the area happening
      right now.
      Principal Planner Borrego said they are seeing a lot of activity.
      Planning Director Vander Dussen said there is one project in the building permit review
      process right now.
      Committee Member Richardson asked if the units are apartments or for-sale.
      Planning Director Vander Dussen said they are all apartments. There is only one for-sale
      development in the Platinum Triangle right now.

APPENDIX B:
RESIDENTIAL LAND RESOURCES
A.       ADEQUATE SITES ANALYSIS
State Housing Element Law requires that cities demonstrate the availability of adequate
sites to accommodate their projected growth needs. An analysis of land resources must
be completed and take into consideration zoning, development standards, and the
availability of public services and facilities to accommodate a variety of housing types
and incomes. The City must demonstrate that it has capacity or adequate sites to
accommodate the projected need for housing.
The State Department of Finance (DOF) is responsible for projecting the total statewide
housing demand, with the State Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD) apportioning this demand to each of the state’s regions. This demand represents
the number of additional units needed to accommodate the anticipated growth in the
number of households, to replace expected demolitions and conversions of housing units
to non-housing uses, and to achieve a future vacancy rate that allows for healthy
functioning of the housing market.
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), the Council of
Governments (COG) representing the region, in cooperation with the local jurisdictions,
is tasked with the responsibility of allocating the region’s projected new housing demand
to each jurisdiction. The allocation is further divided into four income categories:
           Very-Low Income – 0% to 50% of the median income;
           Low Income – 51% to 80% of the median income;
           Moderate Income – 81% to 120% of the median income; and,
           Above-Moderate Income – more than 120% of the median income.
This process is known as the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA), and the
goals are referred to as either the RHNA goals or the “regional share” goals for new
housing construction. The allocation takes into account factors such as market demand
for housing, employment opportunities, the availability of suitable sites and public
facilities, commuting patterns, type and tenure of housing need, and others. In
determining a jurisdiction’s share of new housing needs by income category, the
allocation is adjusted to avoid an over-concentration of lower income households in any
one jurisdiction.
Adopted February 4, 2014                                                               B-1

                                                                         Housing Element
                                             Appendix B: Residential Land Resources
The current RHNA prepared by SCAG allocates housing needs for the period from
January 1, 2014 to October 1, 2021. The RHNA identifies the City of Anaheim’s share of
the region’s housing needs as 5,702 new housing units. The City of Anaheim’s share of
the region’s housing needs for 2014-2021, as determined by SCAG, is the projected need
for housing used in this evaluation. This evaluation of adequate sites represents planning
goals, and not a goal for actual production of housing within the planning period.
1.      Capacity to Meet Regional Share Goals
The City of Anaheim has the capacity to meet its RHNA goals through properties that are
already designated for residential land uses by the City’s General Plan and Zoning Code.
In 2004, the City of Anaheim completed a comprehensive update of its General Plan.
Through this effort, the City redesignated several acres of underutilized commercial and
industrial properties for multiple-family residential development. Through this effort, the
City also identified several locations that would be suitable for mixed-use residential
development, including the Downtown and The Platinum Triangle areas. These new
residential designations have yielded several housing projects since 2004 and continue to
provide opportunities for infill and redevelopment projects that will help the City achieve
its RHNA goals.
a.      Current Projects
The City of Anaheim has a number of residential projects that are “in-the-pipeline.”
These projects include 4,282 units that have been issued building permits; have pending
building permits and are in the plan check phase; or, are entitled projects that have not yet
been submitted for building permits, but have been approved for development through
development agreements, density bonus agreements, subdivisions or conditional use
permits. These projects further detailed in Appendix B-1. The locations of these units
are shown in Exhibits B-1 and B-2.
Within The Platinum Triangle, development intensities are allocated to individual
properties on a first come, first served basis through the approval of a development
agreement. There are 3,206 dwelling units within The Platinum Triangle that have been
approved by a development agreement, but are not under construction. The development
agreements approved in conjunction with these projects do not set minimum rents or sale
prices for these developments and, therefore, do not preclude the development of units
affordable to moderate and lower income families. Based on current rental rates in the
Platinum Triangle, future units are anticipated to be affordable to range of income levels.
However, for the purposes of this analysis, the units entitled within the Platinum Triangle
are assumed to be affordable to above-moderate income households.

b.        Housing Opportunity Sites
During the 2006-2014 RHNA planning period, the City identified a number of Housing
Opportunity Sites to accommodate its lower and moderate-income RHNA need. The
zoning code amendment during the 2006-2014 planning period applied either the Mixed
Use Overlay Zone or Residential Opportunity Overlay Zone to the Housing Opportunity
Sites. Refer to Chapter 3, Resources and Constraints for more information about the
Mixed Use and Residential Opportunity Overlay Zones. The Housing Opportunity Sites
that are still available for development and continue to provide opportunities to
accommodate the City’s RHNA need for the 2014-2021 planning period are shown in
Exhibit B-3 and B-4 and are further detailed in Appendix B2.
The housing opportunity sites identified during the 2006 to 2014 planning period were
carefully selected based upon their likelihood to transition to housing uses during the
planning period. The City chose not to identify properties that were occupied by newer
and/or lucrative forms of development that are unlikely to redevelop in the near term.
Conversely, nearly all of the opportunity sites are occupied by underutilized commercial
or industrial uses and are indicative of the types of sites historically pursued by local
Adopted February 4, 2014                                                                                           B-5

housing developers interested building a variety of in-fill housing types. For example,
there are several recent market rate and affordable housing projects that have been
developed on sites formerly occupied by manufacturing businesses, underperforming
retail centers or plant nurseries. The probability that several of the City’s housing
opportunity sites will develop with higher density housing, consistent with their assumed
density range, is bolstered by recent housing development activity. The following table
illustrates three recent examples of housing projects that have been proposed on
identified housing opportunity sites. These sites are identified by Opportunity Site
number, consistent with the analysis conducted during the 2006-2014 Housing Element
Update and are considered a representative example of development opportunities
expected from these sites. Development applications for these sites were received in late
2013 and it is anticipated that these sites will be developed in 2014. The densities
proposed are consistent with the densities of other in-fill housing developments that have
been constructed during the 2006-2014 planning period.

The City was very selective in identifying its Housing Opportunity Sites and only elected
to include those properties which had definite potential to redevelop. Properties deemed
unlikely to develop or redevelop to housing affordable to moderate or lower-income
families were eliminated in this analysis. For example, the following types of properties
were not identified as Housing Opportunity Sites because they have a low likelihood of
redeveloping to a residential use during the planning period:
     • Properties developed with schools; community/religious assembly uses, such as
         churches and synagogues; or, other similar uses that are unlikely to redevelop in
         the foreseeable future.
     • Properties developed with mobile home parks.
     • Properties that would not yield a greater amount of residential units than currently
         exist on the property (with the exception of certain sites that could be
         consolidated into a larger development area).
     • Properties that are designated for residential land uses by the General Plan, but at
         densities unlikely to result in development of units affordable to moderate or
         lower income households (i.e., less than 13 units/acre).
     • Small parcels unlikely to be consolidated with surrounding properties.
     • Properties designated for non-residential land uses by the General Plan. Sites with
         known environmental constraints which would preclude residential development
         during the planning period.
 Several of the Housing Opportunity Sites consist of parcels with light industrial and
 commercial uses in buildings that are 40 or more years old and that are generally in
 marginal condition. The City has an excellent recent track record of redeveloping
 parcels with similar uses and characteristics with residential units. In fact, many of the
 affordable housing units that have been constructed during the 2006-2014 planning
 period were developed on sites once occupied by similar commercial and industrial
 uses.
 As indicated in Table B-2, the Housing Opportunity Sites that were identified provide
 the opportunity to develop up to 3,727 dwelling units. However, when Opportunity
 Sites that do not meet the 16 unit/site requirement of AB 2348 are excluded from this
 total, the net number of dwelling units that could be developed is up to 3,078 dwelling
 units.
 The capacity of each Opportunity Site was determined by utilizing the maximum
 density permitted by each site’s applicable General Plan land use designation. Recent
 development activity illustrates the fact that these maximum permitted densities are
 oftentimes met or exceeded, based upon current land use and regulatory policies. These
 policies include several affordable housing incentives that are incorporated into the
 City’s Zoning Code. An analysis of recently approved and constructed housing units
 demonstrates the City’s ability to meet or exceed density thresholds in the City’s
 General Plan.

 Within the Mixed-Use Overlay Zone, the realistic capacity for residential units is not
 reduced by the inclusion of non-residential uses. The Overlay Zone does not require a
 minimum non-residential square footage and developments must include a residential
 component developed at a density of at least 36 du/ac. Developers of projects within the
 Mixed-Use Overlay Zone have traditionally sought to maximize the residential
 development potential to the greatest amount feasible.

The Opportunity Sites designated by the General Plan for densities over 30 dwelling units
per acre (the default density standard set by the State as appropriate for accommodating
Anaheim’s share of regional housing need for lower-income households) would allow for
development of up to 1,902 net units and would fulfill the City’s obligations to provide
sites to accommodate the remaining lower income RHNA need (1,713 units). The
Opportunity Sites designated by the General Plan for development densities within the
generally accepted density for moderate income units (11-30 dwelling units per acre)
could produce up to 1,176 net units. These sites would accommodate development of
housing for the remaining RHNA need for moderate-income households as indicated in

The Housing Opportunity Sites include approximately 3.3 acres of vacant land that could
be developed with up to 64 dwelling units. Although the majority of the Housing
Opportunity Sites are developed with existing uses, the City has an excellent track record
of transforming underutilized properties into residential uses, as is evident in the site
characteristics of the projects that are currently entitled for development (see Appendix
B-2).
Since the Housing Opportunity Sites are already designated by the General Plan for
residential uses, the proposed density of development proposed on the Housing
Opportunity Sites has already been analyzed by the Environmental Impact Report
prepared for the General Plan Update (EIR No. 330). The proposed density of
development has also been analyzed by the City’s 2010 Urban Water Management Plan.
Sewer deficiencies related to the General Plan build-out have been identified in the City’s
capital improvement program (CIP) and will be upgraded as part of the CIP to
accommodate new or increased densities of residential units. Costs associated with these
improvements are funded by a sewer user charge and development impact fees. Per State
law, the City has adopted a resolution giving sewer priority to affordable housing
development and has an aggressive, on-going sewer improvement program in place.
Although the Opportunity Sites comprise approximate 31 acres collectively that are each
less than one acre, these smaller sites are located adjacent to other parcels that provide the
opportunity for lot consolidation. While the feasibility of assembling small parcels for
residential development may be a limiting factor for some jurisdictions, it is important to
note that Anaheim has a proven history of successful assemblage that has resulted in the
development of several affordable housing projects in the recent past.
Site constraints have also historically been successfully addressed through the
implementation of the Density Bonus chapter of the Zoning Code (Chapter 18.52).
Incentives such as reduced required building setbacks, increased allowable site coverage
and increased maximum building heights are available to projects proposing affordable
housing. These incentives along with density bonuses and reduced parking requirements
help make the density permitted by the General Plan foreseeable on the Housing
Opportunity Sites.
Combined with the City’s current projects (4,282 units), the “net" Opportunity Sites
(3,078 units) allow for the development of up to 7,360 units, far exceeding the City’s
RHNA target of 5,702 units.

CONVERSION
Jurisdictions are required by State Housing Element Law to analyze government-assisted
housing that is eligible to convert from low income to market rate housing over the next
10 years. State law identifies housing assistance as a rental subsidy, mortgage subsidy or
mortgage insurance to an assisted housing development. Government assisted housing
might convert to market rate housing for a number of reasons including expiring
subsidies, mortgage repayments or expiration of affordability restrictions.
This section will address:
    •   An inventory of assisted housing units that are at-risk of converting to market rate
        housing,
    •   An analysis of the costs of preserving and/or replacing these units,
    •   Resources that could be used to preserve at-risk units,
    •   Program efforts for preservation of at-risk housing units, and
    •   Quantified objectives for the number of at-risk units to be preserved during the
        Housing Element planning period.
1.      Inventory of At-Risk Units
There are 516 assisted housing units “at-risk” of losing their affordability through 2023 in
Anaheim. Programs utilized by these units include the Senior Ordinance, Density Bonus
Ordinance, tax credits, tax-exempt bonds, Housing Set-Aside Funds, HUD, CDGB and
HOME funds. Table B-5 summarizes the units “at-risk” from 2013 through 2018.

Twenty-nine projects with a total of 516 units are at-risk of converting to market rate
housing from 2013 through 2023. Generally, the cost of preserving existing units is more
cost effective than replacing units through new construction. Replacement of these units
with rehabilitated units may be cost effective in some instances.
a.      P r e s e r v a t i o n S t ra t e g i e s
There are many options to preserving units including providing financial incentives to
project owners to extend low income use restrictions, purchasing affordable housing units
by a non-profit or public agency or providing local subsidies to offset the difference
between the affordable and market rate. Scenarios for preservation will depend on the
type of project at-risk.
The City will implement a variety of activities during the Housing Element period in
order to preserve the existing supply of affordable housing. Among the activities to be
implemented are:
        1) Evaluation of legal and procedural framework for preservation of at-risk units
        within the City.
        2) Identification and monitoring of threatened projects.
        3) Analysis of factors that influence an owner’s decision to terminate the
        operation of the units at risk of converting.
        4) Determination of the feasibility of an entity acquiring and preserving the units
        at risk of conversion.
        5) Analysis of Federal, State and local financial incentives available to deter the
        conversion and assist with the acquisition and preservation of units at risk of
        conversion.
        6) Provision of technical assistance to developers, nonprofit corporations and
        resident councils interested in negotiating the acquisition of units at risk of
        conversion.
b.      Local Rental Subsidy
One strategy for preserving the units at-risk during the planning period is to provide a
local rental subsidy to residents. Rent subsidies can be utilized to provide assistance to
residents when their affordable units convert to market rate. To determine the subsidy
needed, Fair Market Rents were compared to market rate rents. Table B-6 provides a
Adopted February 4, 2014                                                                 B-15

Anaheim can also consider the cost of replacing the units with new construction.
Construction cost estimates include all hard and soft costs associated with construction in
addition to per unit land costs. The analysis assumes the replacement units are garden
style apartments with parking provided on-site. Square footage estimates are based on the
average unit size in the region. Land costs have been determined on a per unit basis.
Tables B-8 and B-9 summarize the estimated replacement costs per unit.

A variety of programs exist to assist cities to acquire, replace or subsidize at-risk
affordable housing units. The following summarizes financial resources available to the
City of Anaheim.
i.        Federal Programs
      •   Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)- CDBG funds are awarded to
          cities on a formula basis for housing activities. The primary objective of the
          CDBG program is the development of viable communities through the provision
          of decent housing, a suitable living environment and economic opportunity for
          principally low and moderate income persons. Funds can be used for housing
          acquisition, rehabilitation, economic development and public services. In Fiscal
          Year 2013-2014, Anaheim received $4,605,871 in CDBG funds.
Adopted February 4, 2014                                                                                       B-17

                                                                         Housing Element
                                             Appendix B: Residential Land Resources
    • HOME Investment Partnership- The City of Anaheim receives funds by formula
      from HUD to increase the supply of decent, safe, sanitary and affordable housing
      to lower income households. Eligible activities include new construction,
      acquisition, rental assistance and rehabilitation. In Fiscal Year 2013-2014,
      Anaheim received $1,601,964 in HOME funds.
    • Section 8 Rental Assistance Program- The Section 8 Rental Assistance program
      provides rental assistance payments to owners of private, market rate units on
      behalf of very-low income tenants. Rental assistance is provided through the
      Anaheim Housing Authority. Anaheim anticipates assisting an estimated 5,000
      households annually through Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, subject to
      federal funding availability.
    • Section 811/202 Program- Non-profit and consumer cooperatives can receive no
      interest capital advances from HUD under the Section 202 program for the
      construction of very-low income rental housing for seniors and persons with
      disabilities. These funds can be used in conjunction with Section 811, which can
      be used to develop group homes, independent living facilities and immediate care
      facilities. Eligible activities include acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction
      and rental assistance.
ii.   State Programs
    • California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) Multifamily Programs- CalHFA’s
      Multifamily Programs provide permanent financing for the acquisition,
      rehabilitation, and preservation or new construction of rental housing that
      includes affordable rents for low and moderate income families and individuals.
      One of the programs is the Preservation Acquisition Finance Program which is
      designed to facilitate the acquisition of at-risk affordable housing developments
      and provide low-cost funding to preserve affordability.
    • Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)- This program provides tax credits to
      individuals and corporations that invest in low income rental housing. The LIHTC
      program creates affordable housing opportunities when the developer of a project
      “sells” the tax credits to an investor or investors who contribute equity to the
      development in exchange for an ownership position in the project.
    • California Community Reinvestment Corporation (CCRC)- The California
      Community Reinvestment Corporation is a multifamily affordable housing lender
      whose mission is to increase the availability of affordable housing for low income
      families, seniors and residents with special needs by facilitating private capital
      flow from its investors for debt and equity to developers of affordable housing.

Through the Community Development Department, the City continually monitors the
eligibility of affordable housing to convert to market rate housing. Constant monitoring
allows the City to anticipate the timeframe by which affordability covenants would
expire, allowing the City to implement various resources to ensure the continued
affordability of the housing units.

The development agreements approved in conjunction with these projects do
not set minimum rents or sale prices for these developments and, therefore, do
not preclude the development of units affordable to moderate and low-income
families. In addition, all of the City’s programs that encourage affordable
housing can be utilized within The Platinum Triangle, including but not limited
to, Redevelopment Agency set-aside funds; HOME program funds; the Density
Bonus and Senior Citizens' Apartment Housing ordinances; developer
incentives, including land write-downs and predevelopment loans/grants; down
payment assistance programs; Section 8 programs; deferral of City
development fees; exemption of Transportation and Impact Fees for Affordable
Housing Developments; and, subsidies for tax credit projects.
Amendments to the General Plan and Platinum Triangle Master Land Use Plan
will likely be pursued to allow additional development intensity in response
to anticipated market demand.

those owned by the Anaheim Redevelopment Agency or Anaheim Housing

and there is no desire to retain existing commercial or industrial uses on the
site. For all other sites, an overlay zone will be applied that will provide the
opportunity to develop “by right” housing consistent with the density permitted

overlay zones to promote residential development in areas such as South

The City understands the importance of providing equal housing opportunity
for persons with special needs. Persons with disabilities may require
reasonable accommodations to meet their particular housing needs. To comply
with federal and state housing laws, the City will analyze existing land use
controls, building codes, and permit and processing procedures to determine
constraints they impose on the development, maintenance, and improvement of
housing for persons with disabilities. Based on its findings, the City will
develop a policy for reasonable accommodation to provide relief from Code
regulations and permitting procedures that may have a discriminatory effect on
housing for individuals with disabilities. The policy shall include procedures
for requesting accommodation, timeline for processing and appeals, criteria for
determining whether a requested accommodation is reasonable, and ministerial
approval for minor requests.

target population as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 53260(d), and
that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in
retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her
ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. “Target population" means
adults with low incomes having one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or
AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health conditions, or individuals eligible for

are made to bring about a specific outcome, such as the rehabilitation of housing
affordable by Very-Low and Low-income households.
Tax Increment. Additional tax revenues that result from increases in property values
within a redevelopment area. State law permits the tax increment to be earmarked for
redevelopment purposes but requires at least 20 percent to be used to increase and

currently allocates 30 percent of its tax increment to increase and improve the
community’s supply of very low and low income housing.
Tenure. A housing unit is owner-occupied if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit,
even if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. A cooperative or condominium unit is owner-

         T
                 he identity of Anaheim is varied and
                 extends beyond that of its world-renown
                 resorts, sports venues, and convention
         center. It is a large, diverse city that is home
         to over 330,000 people. Visitors view it from
         major freeways and from its arterial corridors;
         residents experience it along its residential
         streets, parks, schools and shopping centers.

         identity for such a large and diverse area is the           reminders of the City's agricultural heritage.
         goal of the Community Design Element.
         Anaheim is the oldest city in the County and contains historic as
         well as newly developed areas. Its topography varies from hills
         and canyons to flat coastal plains. Its built environment ranges
         from dense commercial and civic uses to estate-type, single-
         family neighborhoods. This Element provides policy guidance
         that respects this diverse context while seeking to unify the City
         through carefully crafted design policies.
                                                The expanded Anaheim Convention
                                                 Center’s dramatic facade of curved
                                               glass and central towers make it one
                                                of the region’s newest architectural
                                                                         landmarks.

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
ACHIEVING THE VISION
A community’s vision is the mental picture of its desired future based on important
community characteristics. In the context of the Community Design Element, the vision
is simply what the community feels Anaheim should look like. This vision is reflected in
the policies of the General Plan.
Anaheim values the character of its neighborhoods and the history and diversity of the
City. It is committed to strengthening neighborhood identity and enhancing its image.
The desire to make Anaheim a better place to live, work, learn and visit is the foundation
of the Community Design Element. The key
objectives of the Element are to create:
    An aesthetically pleasing City unified by select
     design features;
    Aesthetic enhancements along arterial corridors
     and public rights-of-way, including landscaping
     and streetscape improvements;
    Clearly marked formal entries at key locations
     which identify community gateways, edges and
     boundaries;
    Attractive and strategically located retail uses;
    A vibrant and identifiable downtown;
    Preservation of the City’s heritage through
     historic homes, neighborhoods and districts;         Citizens discuss the Vision and
    Well-maintained parks, libraries and community       planning objectives for The Platinum
                                                          Triangle at one of the many public
     centers;                                             outreach events for the General Plan
    Attractive neighborhoods with well-maintained        update.
     streetscapes; and
    An abundance of open space features throughout the City.
ENHANCING THE GENERAL PLAN
The Community Design Element is not a required Element of the General Plan, but the
City has long recognized the importance of community appearance and identity to its
vitality, economic health and overall quality of life. Combined with the “Green Element”
– which combines parks and recreation, open space, conservation, and public
landscaping into a comprehensive plan to beautify the City - the Community Design
Element provides policy guidance for the built environment. It supports the Land Use
Element by providing design policies that complement the City’s diverse land uses, the
Circulation Element by providing guidance for aesthetically enhancing arterial corridors,
and the Economic Development Element by recognizing the relationship between quality
design and economic viability, stability and growth.

                                                    COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
         RELATIONSHIP TO THE ZONING CODE
         Anaheim’s Zoning Code supports the Community Design Element in several important
         ways. As stated in its Introduction, the purpose of the Zoning Code is “to promote
         growth of the City in an orderly manner and to promote and protect the public health,
         safety, peace, comfort and general welfare in conformance with the General Plan.” While
         zoning requirements address land uses and development standards, this Element will
         address community-wide design features such as gateways, streets and public signage, as
         well as special policies for specific districts within the City.
         USING THE COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
         The General Plan is intended to provide policy guidance, rather than specific
         development regulation. This Element is intended to provide a practical framework for
         specific design guidelines to ensure that design decisions in various parts of the City
         serve to implement the City’s Vision.
         COMMUNITY DESIGN COMPONENTS
         The Scale of Community Design
         In planning cities, design exists at various scales – from that of an individual building to
         an entire community. Rather than focusing on the design of one project, community
         design takes a broader view - looking at how the various components of a city fit
         together. From this perspective, community design exists at multiple levels – those of
         the street, neighborhood, district and city. Effective design strategies help to unify a city
         visually, thereby creating a distinct sense of place. For a city as large as Anaheim,
         carefully planned design guidelines can enhance the identity and distinctiveness of the
         City as a whole and the specific areas within it.
         Unifying Elements of Community Design
         There are many elements of community design, but they should all serve to make a City
         more visually rich and identifiable. One approach is to identify and enhance the City’s
         paths, landmarks, activity centers, districts and edges.1 Residents and visitors form their
         image of the City from major roadways, activity centers and neighborhoods. This image
         is further defined by visually prominent buildings and by changes in character from one
         area to the next. Enhancing each of these elements makes sense for Anaheim since its
         large size makes Citywide identity a difficult challenge.
         1 This model of community design was devised by Kevin Lynch, detailed in his landmark book, The Image
         of the City (1960). His primary idea was that cities could create a much more memorable image by
         enhancing the design of their major urban design elements.

Paths
A city is most often viewed from and defined by the
paths that run in and through it. In a very real
sense, perceptions of Anaheim are formed from the
major paths – both freeways and major arterial
corridors – which traverse it. Paths connect activity
areas and can have an important character of their
own. Aesthetic improvements to these paths and
streetscapes have been identified as a key
component in enhancing Anaheim’s overall
appearance.                                               Regularly spaced palm trees provide a
                                                          skyline image and constitutes a
                                                          unifying visual element along paths.
Landmarks
Visually prominent buildings, special geographic
features and important cultural centers serve to give a city a
distinct image and help to orient residents and visitors.
Anaheim has a number of very important landmarks, such as the
Matterhorn in The Anaheim Resort, “The Big A” at Angel
Stadium of Anaheim, the historic Kraemer Building and
Anaheim Museum located in the Colony.
Edges
Boundaries or transitions from one area to another are
important in community design as they signal one’s arrival to a
new area. If edges are clearly marked, such as in the use of
entry signs or monuments, a city’s identity is strengthened.
Two types of edges are important in Anaheim – primary entries
into the City and secondary entries into important districts or           One of the most

         Activity Centers/Districts
         Activity centers, districts and other concentrations of
         land uses provide interest and diversity to cities, and
         planning for them can greatly enhance a city
         economically and socially. Good examples are
         shopping centers, entertainment complexes,
         transportation hubs and town centers. With its
         world-renown tourist destinations, professional sports
         venues, and the historic Anaheim Colony District,
         Anaheim already has many wonderful activity centers.
                                                                       The prominent City Hall West building

         identified in the General Plan Land Use Element on
         the Land Use Map (Figure LU-2).
         Special areas of the City can also have their own visual
         and functional identity, thereby preventing the
         monotony seen in many cities today and creating more
         interest. In selected areas, the City has enhanced its         Rich landscaping along corridors

         The Anaheim Resort and the Anaheim Colony Historic
         District are excellent examples. Enhancing the
         distinctiveness of these special areas while still
         maintaining the overall image of the City is an
         important focus of this Element.
         Integrating the Design Elements
         The Community Design Element combines these
         elements – paths, landmarks, edges, activity centers
         and districts – in such a way that the image of the City
         is strengthened. The goal is to unify Anaheim visually
         while building on its unique qualities. Community-
         wide design features – usually placed along major
         corridors – can serve to unify the City, while activity
         centers, districts and landmarks provide variety and
         interest.
                                                                        This monument in Washington Park

GOALS AND POLICIES
COMMUNITY DESIGN SCOPE AND STRUCTURE
The organizing principle of this Element is that community design exists at two levels,
from the scale of the entire community to that of individual design districts. The goals
and policies that follow will start at the “macro” level of the community and then proceed
downward to specific districts. These policies, combined with the development
standards of the Zoning Code and design guidelines for specific areas in the City, form a
basis for individual project review. In this way, the design policies are tailored to the
appropriate scale or area, yet fit together to address all aspects of community design.
The following structure offers a way of thinking about design features applicable to these
distinct levels and provides the basis for the goals and policies that follow. The list is not
exhaustive, but illustrates design features that occur at various levels simultaneously.

         CITY LEVEL DESIGN FEATURES
         Community Design Identity
         In a city as large and diverse as Anaheim, it is challenging to reinforce a consistent
         community design theme. The City is approximately 50 square miles in size and borders
         eight cities. Its topography varies from the hills and canyons of the northeast to the flat
         areas towards the west. Its neighborhoods
         range from period architecture of the early
         1900’s to suburban tracts typical of
         development in the 1950’s through the
         1990’s. Its commercial areas range from
         specialty retail areas to strip commercial
         development along its many corridors. It
         contains world-famous landmarks such as
         Disneyland, and facilities of national, State and
         regional interest such as Angel Stadium of
         Anaheim, the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim
         and the Anaheim Convention Center.
         Unifying this City of diverse elements is both a
         challenge and an opportunity. The City
         continues to make strong efforts to reinforce
         its identity. Major stretches of arterial

         improvements and public art in many areas of
         the City. Nevertheless, there are still many areas that are indistinguishable from that of
         neighboring cities. This element identifies areas that can reinforce the image of
         Anaheim.
         GOAL 1.1:
         Create an aesthetically pleasing and unified community appearance within the context of
         distinct districts and neighborhoods.
         Policies:
                  1) Continue to designate and provide monumentation for important primary
                       and secondary entry points into the City, especially along major corridors.
                  2) Ensure that the design of all public facilities fit well into their surroundings
                       and incorporate symbolic references to the City of Anaheim, including its
                       past and/or present, as appropriate.

        3) Incorporate the City seal in appropriate public
            spaces and public facilities.
        4) Pursue unifying streetscape elements for major
            corridors, including coordinated streetlights,
            landscaping, public signage and street furniture, to
            reinforce Anaheim’s community image.

            and private projects.
        6) Continue to identify opportunities to incorporate public art in conjunction
            with redevelopment and capital improvements projects.
        7) Screen public and private facilities and above-ground infrastructure support
            structures and equipment, such as electrical substations, and water wells and
            recharge facilities, with appropriately scaled landscaping or other methods of
            screening.
        8) Construct public and private facilities and support structures (e.g., water
            pipes, irrigation and electrical controls, vents) to blend with the surrounding
            environment.
        9) Minimize visual impacts of public and private facilities and support structures
            through sensitive site design and construction. This includes, but is not
            limited to: appropriate placement of facilities; undergrounding, where
            possible; and aesthetic design (e.g., cell tower stealthing).

         Enhanced Arterial Corridors
         Residents and visitors alike often experience Anaheim by traveling along its many arterial
         corridors. These corridors vary in character from designated scenic highways to more
         regional-serving arterial roadways. The City has completed many landscape projects
         and/or improved major sections along its corridors, but major gaps need to be addressed
         and other opportunities need to be identified and pursued.
         From a community design perspective, arterial streetscape improvement plans provide
         visual continuity and interest to the motorist and pedestrian. Such plans can reinforce
         City design themes as well as soften views of adjoining development.
         GOAL 2.1:
         Attractively landscape and maintain Anaheim’s major arterial corridors and prepare/
         implement distinctive streetscape improvement plans.
         Policies:
                  1) Incorporate Citywide design features as well as specialized theme elements,
                      such as street furniture, public signs, landscape palettes, and banners in
                      appropriate areas, and as a part of streetscape improvement plans.
                  2) Use landscaping and facade articulation to break up long stretches of walls
                      associated with residential development along major corridors.
                  3) Continue to underground overhead utility lines along the City’s arterial
                      corridors.
                  4) Ensure adherence to sign regulations, which address issues of scale, type,
                      design, materials, placement, compatibility, and maintenance for uses along
                      freeways, toll roads and major arterial corridors.
                  5) Require replacement of non-conforming signs wherever possible and
                      appropriate, through such mechanisms as sign amortization programs.
                  6) Develop a coordinated program and design hierarchy for public signs along
                      major arterials.
           Landscaped medians and parkways give arterial corridors a stronger identity and provide visual continuity.

Single-Family Neighborhood Quality
With the notable exception of the Colony area, the majority of the City’s single-family
neighborhoods were built after 1950. Most, with the exception of portions of the Hill
and Canyon Area, were not built as planned communities. Consequently, the
streetscapes contain a diversity of housing styles, although of similar scale and massing.
Since these areas are built-out, the architectural impact of these design policies will be
seen over time as older homes are remodeled or replaced by new development. The
design goal is to ensure that redesigned or new homes contribute to the quality of the
neighborhood environment.
Many of the neighborhoods have aged gracefully while others are in need of
improvement, including the replanting of street trees and provision of parkways, and
improved property maintenance. Where there is no predominant design theme and no
need to consider one, the best action is to preserve the existing scale of the
neighborhood, provide ample street trees and parkways, design neighborhood entryways,
where appropriate, and provide property owners with incentives to keep their properties
well-maintained.
GOAL 3.1:
Single-family neighborhoods are attractive, safe and comfortable.
Policies:
         1) Continue to maintain and improve the visual image and quality of life of
             single-family neighborhoods.
         2) Strengthen the important
             elements of residential
             streets that unify and
             enhance the character of
             the neighborhood,
             including parkways,
             mature street trees,
             compatible setbacks, and
             a unified range of
             architectural detailing.

         4) Improve the pedestrian and social
             atmosphere of the street by
             orienting new homes towards the
             street with attractive front porches,
             highly visible street facades, and
             compatible setbacks.
         5) Enhance and encourage
             neighborhood or street identity with

         6) Maintain, improve and/or develop
             parkways with canopy street trees,
             providing shade, beauty and a
             unifying identity to residential
             streets.
         7) Encourage well-designed, front
             yards to provide an effective visual
             transition from the street to the
             homes.
                                                      Landscaped parkways with mature street

             parkways, canopy trees, and
             sidewalk bulbs at the intersections.
         9) Site garages back from the street and
             minimize street frontage devoted to
             driveways and vehicular access.
         10) If desired by the community, provide
             continuous sidewalks and links to
             nearby community facilities, retail
             centers and transit stops for safety
             and convenience.                            Continuous sidewalks buffered from traffic
                                                         are an important amenity.
         11) Encourage a variety of architectural
             styles, massing, floor plans, facade
             treatment and elevations to create visual interest.

         12) Reduce the impact of monotonous walls, located at the periphery of
              residential neighborhoods along arterial corridors, through landscaping,
              varied surface treatment, and use of vertical and/or horizontal design
              elements.
         13) Provide safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access from single family
              neighborhoods to nearby commercial centers, schools, and transit stops.
Multiple-Family Development
Multiple-family housing is an important and challenging concern to the City both in terms
of supply and design. Approximately one-half of the housing units within the City are
multiple-family in nature, the vast majority of which are located along major arterial
corridors in West, Central and East Anaheim. As such, they are visually prominent and
have a strong effect on perceptions of community design. The challenge is to
accommodate higher density housing that retains a neighborhood feel and contributes to
the character of the street environment and provides a quality residential environment
that is safe and attractive.
GOAL 4.1:
Multiple-family housing is attractively designed and scaled to complement the
neighborhood and provides visual interest through varied architectural detailing.
Policies:
         1) Reduce the visual impact of large-scale, multiple-family buildings by
              requiring articulated entry features, such as attractive porches, and detailed
              facade treatments, which create visual interest and give each unit more
              personalized design.
         2) Discourage visually monotonous, multiple-family residences by incorporating
              different architectural styles, a variety of rooflines, wall articulation,
              balconies, window treatments, and varied colors and building materials on all
              elevations.
         3) Require appropriate setbacks and height limits to provide privacy where
              multiple-family housing is developed adjacent to single-family housing.
         4) Reduce the visual impact of parking areas by utilizing interior courtyard
              garages, parking structures, subterranean lots, or tuck-under, alley-loaded
              designs.
         5) Require minimum lot size criteria in the Zoning Code to encourage
              professional, responsible, on-site property management.

                 6) Provide usable common open space amenities. Common open space should
                      be centrally located and contain amenities such as seating, shade and play
                      equipment. Private open space may include courtyards, balconies, patios,
                      terraces and enclosed play areas.
                 7) Where a multiple-story apartment building abuts single-story development,
                      provide for a gradual transition in height by reducing the height of the
                      building adjacent to the smaller scale use.
                 8) Provide safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access from multiple-
                      family development to nearby commercial centers, schools, and transit stops.
                 9) Where possible, underground or screen utilities and utility equipment or
                      locate and size them to be as inconspicuous as possible.
                 10) Encourage multi-family housing developers to comply with Residential
                      Voluntary Measure A4.106.9.2 of the California Green Building Standards
                      Code that outlines the provision of long-term parking for multi-family
                      buildings.
          Quality multi-family development includes semi-private open space enhanced landscaping as well as
          convenient access to public space and nearby commercial centers.
         Rich detailing of facades, varying rooflines and prominent entry features lend multi-family development
         a more domestic scale and enhance the identity of major streets.

Mid-Block Corridor Residential Development
An important feature of the Land Use Element is the identification of areas for the
introduction of mid-block residential development along arterial corridors. Since they
are located along major corridors that oftentimes frame neighborhoods, these residential
areas are intended to provide an alternative to strip commercial development and expand
the City’s housing stock and variety. Since they are located along busy arterials, mid-
block developments will be set back far enough for safety and livability purposes, but
close enough to visually improve the corridor.
The design goal is to encourage mid-block development that incorporates richly detailed
architecture and contributes to an attractive and pedestrian-friendly street environment.
This can be accomplished through design guidelines that encourage residential
developments with a neighborhood scale and appearance, orientation towards the street,
recessed or alley loaded parking and landscaped parkways. Provision of open space
within each development will contribute to an attractive streetscape. These policies allow
design flexibility while outlining design features which create a visually consistent
environment.
GOAL 5.1:
Mid-block residential developments convey a neighborhood atmosphere, high level of
design quality, and strong street-facing orientation.
Policies:
         1) Design facades of residences facing arterial corridors to include richly
             articulated surfaces, walls, and roofline treatments.
         2) Encourage mid-block residential streetscapes that feature well-landscaped
             parkways and rhythmic variations of residential facades, styles and color with
             a minimum of driveways and/or curb cuts provided (access primarily
             provided from the rear of residences).
         3) Incorporate elevated front porches in dwelling units along major arterial
             corridors to provide privacy, security, and visual interest.
         4) In addition to porches, require that each dwelling unit have a reasonable
             amount of usable private open space (e.g., elevated decks, terraces and rear
             yards).
         5) Where front yard fencing is desirable, require that it be low-scale and open-
             view style, incorporating varied architectural elements consistent with the
             residential facades.

                                             COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
         6) Where alley loading is not feasible, minimize curb cuts by incorporating
               shared driveways and locating parking behind residences.
         7) Place parkway street trees at regular intervals to buffer residential uses and
               create a unifying visual element along the arterial corridor.
         8) Require a minimum landscaped setback between the sidewalk and the front
               yard fence to provide more privacy for residents and allow for an additional
               row of trees and landscaping.
         9) Encourage decorative, colored pavement, stamped concrete, brick or
               composite material for shared driveways and alleys to reinforce the
               residential character of the neighborhood.
         10) Where possible, underground or screen utilities and utility equipment or
               locate and size them to be as inconspicuous as possible.
         The design goal is to encourage mid-block development that incorporates richly detailed architecture
         and contributes to a pedestrian-friendly street environment. This can be accomplished through
         guidelines that encourage domestic scale and appearance, orientation to the street, recessed parking
         and landscaped parkways.

Retail Activity Centers
Aging commercial areas represent a challenge and an opportunity. Well-designed and
strategically located retail activity centers that incorporate distinctive architecture, clear
access and ample pedestrian amenities, not only enhance community image, but also
provide a more solid economic base for the City. Retail activity centers also help to
define the street corridor, provide a variety of shopping opportunities, and offer
gathering places in an attractive setting. As it works to facilitate new retail development
at strategic locations (i.e., major intersections), the City can help fulfill both aesthetic and
economic goals.
To improve the overall design and functionality of retail centers, such uses should be
developed on adequately sized sites that are large enough to provide pedestrian
amenities, carefully screened parking areas, and well-planned pedestrian and vehicular
access. Design guidelines can help assure that the center fits together visually and
contains the quality elements that will attract visitors and improve its vitality.
GOAL 6.1:
Focus activity centers at the intersections of selected major corridors to provide a
convenient and attractive concentration of retail and office uses.
Policies:
         1) Locate buildings and building frontages close to the street and street corners
              with parking behind or to the side of the buildings. Where this is not
              possible or practical, ensure that street-facing parking is shielded through
              landscaping or berming.
         2) Design highly visible entrances to retail activity centers through accent
              landscaping and lighting, enhanced intersection features, facade detailing,
              monument signs, public art and other design amenities.
         3) Encourage pedestrian-scale features such as canopies and/or awnings,
              customized signage, and strategically located secondary entrances.
         4) Incorporate architectural interest and variety within the context of a unified
              design theme for large-scale retail activity centers. Architectural interest
              should be provided through varied rooflines, architectural detailing, accent
              lighting and massing. Consistency should be maintained through
              commonalities of architectural style, color, landscaping, signage, and
              lighting.
         5) Richly detail and articulate facade designs thereby avoiding monotonous
              expanses of blank walls.

                                       COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
         6) Link newly developed retail activity centers,
             where practical, to surrounding residential
             and/or office uses through clear and safe
             pedestrian and bicycle connections.
         7) Provide walls when necessary for security
             and/or privacy. Pedestrian breaks should be
             provided where needed for access and walls
             should contain vertical and/or horizontal
             detailing to avoid a blank appearance. Walls
             should also be planted with clinging vines to
             address potential graffiti opportunities and
             have layered landscaping to soften the look
             and create a sense of depth.
         8) Provide people-gathering places and
             amenities – such as mini-plazas, courtyards,        Siting buildings close to the street
             benches, outdoor eating areas, specialized          with visible entrances and
                                                                 pedestrian amenities invites use.
             landscaping, accent lighting, public art,
             shade, trash receptacles, and water
             fountains.
         9) Buffer parking areas from the street and
             adjoining uses through tree plantings
             and landscaped edges and bays (i.e.,
             berms and/or hedges with layered
             landscape). Landscaping on the
             perimeter and within parking lots
             should provide shade and pedestrian
             walkways should be strategically
             located and clearly marked for safe          Landscaped bays reduce the visual
             access to shopping and activity areas.       impact of surface parking.
         10) Where practical, encourage use of parking structures to minimize visual
             impacts of surface parking. Such structures should be sited away from the
             street, landscaped to soften large expanses of walls, and designed to blend
             and be consistent with the commercial buildings.
         11) Encourage internal access between adjacent properties in order to minimize
             curb cuts along major thoroughfares.
         12) Where possible, underground or screen utilities and utility equipment or
             locate and size them to be as inconspicuous as possible.

Neighborhood Retail Centers
Neighborhood retail centers can be convenient and
attractive amenities for nearby residents, a place to
shop, dine and gather. Many times however, such
developments provide little, if any, pedestrian
connection to surrounding neighborhoods, are
visually dominated by large parking lots, and have
very little architectural enhancements or landscaped
features. The primary focus of these centers is to
serve a 4- to 5-block radius, including vehicular,
bike and pedestrian access. These developments,            Landscaping enhances the pedestrian
should, however, include some of the same design           environment and minimizes the visual

principles as retail activity centers, but at a smaller
scale. These principles include street-facing orientation, buffered parking, pedestrian
amenities and distinctive signage and attractive landscaping.
GOAL 7.1:
Neighborhood retail centers are thoughtfully designed to create attractive places that
provide convenient access and ample pedestrian amenities to residents of surrounding
neighborhoods.
Policies:
          1) Locate neighborhood retail center buildings close to the street and, if on an
              intersection, occupy as much of the corner as possible.
          2) Create focal points by encouraging corner buildings that contain special
              design features such as towers, decorative detailing or varied roof designs.
          3) Locate parking in a neighborhood center behind or beside the center’s
              buildings rather than in front of them to reduce the visual impact of surface
              parking lots, where practical. Massive, oversized parking lots should be
              avoided.
          4) To the extent practical, screen views of surface parking areas using shade
              trees, perimeter hedges, and other plantings. Landscaped planters and
              defined pedestrian pathways should be incorporated into the parking lot
              design.
          5) Incorporate street-level pedestrian amenities such as awnings, large
              storefront windows, arcades, small sitting areas, and accent landscaping.

                  6) Encourage pedestrian access to and from adjoining uses by providing paths
                      and breaks in walls or landscaped buffer areas.
                  7) Encourage a consistent sign program which effectively addresses scale, type
                      and placement within the overall design theme of the retail center.
                  8) Ensure that the scale and massing of neighborhood retail centers are
                      sensitive to the context of surrounding residential development.
                  9) Lighting should provide for safety and highlight features of the neighborhood
                      retail center but not shine directly onto neighboring properties.
                  10) Where possible, underground or screen utilities and utility equipment or
                      locate and size them to be as inconspicuous as possible.
         Mixed Use Development
         Mixed-use development has a growing appeal for many cities and for good reasons. With
         the on-going need to provide housing to all segments of the community, mixed-use
         development can provide a desirable option for certain segments of the population such
         as retirees and households without children. Mixed-use areas can revive aging areas,
         generate sales and property tax revenue and provide a vibrant environment for residents.
         The planning and design of mixed-use areas is a challenge. Such uses must be carefully
         integrated with surrounding development and/or future land uses, and there must be a
         proper balance between retail, office and residential uses. Residents must have private
         spaces and convenient parking, retailers need streets with a balance of vehicular and
         pedestrian activity.
         GOAL 8.1
         Anaheim’s mixed-use areas are attractively designed, pedestrian and bicycle-friendly,
         easily accessible, and contain a proper blend of commercial retail, office and residential
         uses.
         Policies:
                  1) Encourage design flexibility in mixed-use development by allowing both a
                      vertical and/or horizontal mix of uses.
                  2) In vertical mixed-use, site retail or office uses on the ground floor, with
                      residential and/or office uses above.
                  3) Encourage architecture that divides individual buildings into a base, middle
                      and top (i.e., second story and higher density residential uses could
                      incorporate different window treatment, architectural detailing, colors,
                      balconies, and bays). For two-story buildings, ground floor retail uses
                      should be distinguished from second story facades, with both containing rich

            surface articulation. Rooflines should have a finished look with cornices,
            parapets or other finishing details.
        4) Locate commercial/retail uses near the sidewalk to provide high visibility
            from the street.
        5) Design development with the pedestrian in mind by including wide
            sidewalks, canopy street trees, sitting areas and clearly defined pedestrian
            routes.
        6) With large-scale mixed-use development, orient the tallest portions of the
            buildings towards the center of the site and ensure that the height of the
            buildings at the periphery are compatible with adjacent development.
        7) Minimize the visual impact of surface parking by providing either parking
            structures, rear- or side-street parking with effective landscape buffering.
        8) Segregate residential parking from commercial and office parking.
        9) Locate mixed-use development in areas of high visibility and accessibility,
            and along streets that balance vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
        10) Strategically locate potentially disruptive retail uses such as nightclubs or
            bars to avoid future conflicts with adjacent residential uses.
        11) Provide each residential use with its own private space (such as balconies,
            patios or terraces) and larger communal spaces such as lobbies, central
            gardens or courtyards.
        12) Where possible, underground or screen utilities and utility equipment or
            locate and size them to be as inconspicuous as possible.
        13) Provide appropriate bicycle parking facilities to serve diverse users of mixed-
            use developments. Bicycle parking should be highly visible and/or near the
            entrance of the building.
             Ground floor retail, orientation to street, differentiated facade
             treatment for residential uses above, and street and structured parking
             give mixed-use centers vibrant and pedestrian-oriented urban spaces.

         Industrial Areas
         Anaheim has several key industrial areas, including Anaheim Canyon, the North Central
         Industrial Area, the area west of the Santa Ana (I-5) Freeway between La Palma Avenue
         and Magnolia Avenue, and portions of The Platinum Triangle. These areas are sited to
         minimize conflicts with potentially sensitive land uses. Industrial uses can be noisy,
         require outdoor storage, create fumes, and generate truck traffic. Despite these
         characteristics, the City can still strive to make industrial areas attractive and, at the same
         time, allow for the kinds of activities inherent to industrial uses. Design policies and
         guidelines should address the obvious issues of buffers, screening and parking;
         strengthening the overall image of industrial areas through entry monumentation,
         coordinated public signage and landscaping should also be addressed. The following
         policies will also assist in improving the appearance and future of these areas.
         GOAL 9.1:
         Anaheim’s industrial areas and the buildings within them are strategically planned,
         visually distinctive and attractive, abundantly landscaped and appropriately signed.
         Policies:
                  1) Strengthen the identity of key industrial areas through entry monumentation,
                       signage, attractive landscape treatments, and a complementary range of
                       building colors and types.
                  2) Encourage individual design identity and clearly visible main entrances for
                       industrial buildings.
                  3) Avoid use of long, blank walls by breaking them up with vertical and
                       horizontal facade articulation achieved through stamping, colors, materials,
                       modulation and landscaping.
                  4) Thoroughly screen and enclose all outside storage areas through the use of
                       perimeter walls and landscape treatments.
                  5) Use abundant landscaping to minimize views of surface parking, storage and
                       service areas.
                  6) Where possible, encourage adjacent buildings to share open, landscaped
                       and/or hardscaped areas for visual relief, access and outdoor employee
                       gathering places.
                  7) Where practical, underground or screen utilities and utility equipment or
                       locate and size them to be as inconspicuous as possible.
                  8) Permit convenience retail uses, such as restaurants in proximity to industrial
                       areas for the convenience of employees and clients.

        9) Reduce the noise, traffic and visual impacts of service, delivery, parking and
            loading areas by locating them as far as practical from adjacent sensitive uses
            (e.g., residential and commercial areas), from the street, sidewalk or building
            entrances.
        10) Encourage the application of these design policies to remodels of existing
            development and develop incentive programs for their successful
            implementation.
                                                         Vertical piers, windows, color
                                                         variation and surface modulation
                                                         lend an attractive identity to

         Signage
         The primary function of signs is to identify and advertise businesses, identify community
         facilities, and direct motorists and pedestrians. However, they also have a large impact
         on the visual quality of the streets and neighborhoods. A well-coordinated sign program
         can be a positive and distinctive amenity; on the other hand, poorly regulated signs can
         contribute to a visually chaotic and cluttered streetscape. The most desirable signs
         complement a building’s style, are easily identifiable, and are visually attractive and
         interesting.
         Improvement of signage along commercial corridors is a major design priority. In older
         areas, where the signage has evolved over time, the quality and type of signs vary
         significantly. Although the size and type of signs vary depending on the scale of the
         street and properties they serve, there are some important guidelines that contribute to
         an improved streetscape, while ensuring the signs continue to serve their intended
         purpose.
         The following policies apply Citywide with the exception of areas of the City that already
         have guidelines (i.e., through specific plans).
         GOAL 10.1:
         Anaheim sign guidelines address distinctive, appropriately-scaled and/or coordinated
         signs throughout commercial, industrial and mixed-use areas.
         Policies for Arterial Corridors:
                   1) Use complementary, yet distinctive, sign styles within retail centers.
                   2) Where freestanding signs are necessary, they should be designed in a vertical
                       format with consistent lettering, color and style, capturing the architectural
                       theme of the commercial area of which they are a part.
                   3) Discourage and/or prohibit the use of pole signs, roof signs (except in
                       Downtown Mixed Use Overlay Zone), temporary lettering of window signs,
                       blinking or flashing signs and temporary signs.
                   4) Encourage high-quality signage, including wall signs, raised letter signs,
                       projecting, double-faced signs, and customized logos.
                   5) Encourage signs that complement the architecture of the building without
                       dominating it.
                   6) Along major arterial corridors, use signs that are large enough to be seen
                       from the thoroughfare. This necessitates signs of a scale larger than that of
                       pedestrian-scaled signs.

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
Policies for Pedestrian-Oriented Streets and Neighborhood Centers:
         7) Along pedestrian-oriented streets and in neighborhood centers, use signs
               that are simple, direct and distinctive, and designed at a scale easily read by
               the people walking.
         8) Integrate signs into the building’s architecture. Along smaller multi-story
               buildings, the ideal placement for signs is along the horizontal band between
               the ground-floor retail and the upper stories. On high-rise structures, signs
               can be placed directly below the roofline.
         9) Along a continuous facade of storefronts, locate wall signs at approximately
               the same height to provide a unifying, horizontal design element.
         10) Encourage pedestrian-oriented signs such as awnings, wall signs, raised
               letter signs, and projecting blade-signs.
         11) Although sign designs should be consistent in terms of scale and type within
               a particular retail center or commercial street, encourage design variation
               and distinctiveness to provide visual interest and avoid monotony.
      Attractive signs are distinctive and interesting, complementing the site and building where they are located. These
      projecting, double-faced signs, monument signs and raised-letter wall signs, are appropriately scaled to their context.
                                               Consolidating signs works well with        Temporary window signs look
                                               limited numbers and proper scale.          cluttered and unattractive.
                                             Sign clutter is created by too many
                                             contrasting styles and colors in
                                             too small an area.

         Architectural Diversity and Context
         The tremendous diversity of Anaheim is also reflected in its architectural heritage. No
         one architectural style dominates, and different areas of the City have developed at
         different times and with different building styles. Consequently, prescriptive guidelines
         about style would be inappropriate and stifle architectural creativity. Nevertheless, basic
         architectural guidelines can be written which allow design creativity while ensuring
         quality. In both commercial and residential areas, the goal is to achieve high quality and
         creative projects within the context of general design principles.
         GOAL 11.1:
         Architecture in Anaheim has diversity and creativity of design and is consistent with the
         immediate surroundings.
         Policies:
                  1) In areas of diverse character,
                      encourage project design that
                      represents architectural
                      elements of the neighborhood
                      or surrounding commercial
                      areas.
                  2) Encourage architectural
                      designs that are visually
                      stimulating and varied, yet
                      tasteful, containing rich
                      contrasts and distinctive
                      architectural elements.
                  3) Ensure that the scale,
                      materials, style and massing of
                      new development is consistent
                      with its surroundings and any
                      larger vision for an area.
                                                          New construction should be creative, yet respond to
                                                          its context. Ground-floor uses are inviting to the
                  4) Add visual richness to               pedestrian. Upper floors are distinctive and well
                      residential streets by              detailed.
                      discouraging the same
                      building elevations on
                      adjacent lots and avoiding repetitious elements and colors.

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
          5) Encourage energy and environmental efficiency – such as “Green
               Development Standards” (see Green Element) – in the design and approval
               of new projects.
                                                  Center Street Apartments fit well into their context. The
                                                  raised, gabled entrance, flanked with river rock, is
                                                  representative of the front porches of the Craftsman
                                                  Bungalow style common in the region.
         Detailed facade treatment – differing
         window styles, bays, and piers –
         reduces the scale of large, commercial
         buildings.
Public Art
The purpose of public art is to add interest, variety, and beauty to the City’s public
places. Well-designed public art creates a connection between the public and the
culture of the community by designing places that incorporate symbols that serve to
entertain and enrich urban areas.
Anaheim’s “Art in Public Places” program includes works that symbolize the City’s
agricultural past and rich heritage as well as pieces that serve to entertain and add
comfort. The City’s challenge will be to expand this successful program to include more
areas of the City and to attract artists that represent the City’s tremendous diversity.
GOAL 12.1:
Opportunities to expand the Art in Public Places program to include all areas of the City
will be explored, thereby enriching public places and strengthening the City’s identity.
Policies:
          1) Continue and expand the Arts in Public Places program by selecting suitable
               sites throughout the City that would benefit from the inclusion of public art.

           2) Encourage the incorporation of public art into large-scale private
                 development.
           3) Design public art with a diverse population in mind, from small children to
                 senior citizens to workers, families and visitors.
                                                Public art entertains, informs and serves. “Hammer Clock”
                                                (left) adds a twist to the traditional Main Street clock. The
                                                hammer symbolizes the work ethic of early blacksmiths in
                                                the original Colony, while the teetering pocket watch
                                                reminds us of the urgency of time. “Orange Crates”
                                                (above) incorporates packing crates – an enduring symbol
                                                of the City’s agricultural past – into a functional seating
                                                element, well liked by kids.
         Murals reflect historic character and traditions of
         Anaheim and add civic beauty at a reasonable cost.                   Banners provide a fairly inexpensive
                                                                              and highly visible decorative

DISTRICT-LEVEL DESIGN FEATURES
Given the unique character of Anaheim, it is appropriate to divide the City into design
districts in order to understand the design conditions of each area. Although some
policies can be implemented Citywide, others are best targeted to specific areas. Figure
CD-1, Community Design Districts, shows the City’s major design districts. A brief
description of the design features within each district is provided below.

         Downtown Revitalization
         Anaheim’s Downtown, located within the original Colony boundaries, has witnessed
         many changes over time. From a small, thriving commercial area in the early 1900s, it
         has grown to accommodate a growing population. Through the redevelopment process
         that began in the 1970s, many of the historic commercial and residential buildings were
         replaced with newer development. The result of these changes is an area of mixed
         character, both in terms of architectural styles and age of prominent buildings. Both the
         City and area residents want to create a more vibrant, pedestrian-friendly downtown that
         reflects elements of its historic past and provide design guidance to ensure that new
         development is compatible with the area’s vision.
         Guiding new development that enhances the historic character of the area and creates a
         vibrant downtown without resorting to artificial imitations of the past is a challenge. The
         architectural heritage of the commercial core is eclectic: it included Classical Revival,
         Italianate, Spanish Colonial, Mission Revival, Art Deco, among others. Guidelines that
         respect this heritage and offer an appropriate menu of choices for designers are
         appropriate. Modern designs that make historic allusions without directly copying them,
         and reflect a scale and massing conducive to pedestrians and civic uses are desirable.
         GOAL 13.1:
         Anaheim has a vibrant, distinctive and pedestrian-friendly Downtown that respects its
         historic context and provides civic, shopping, employment, and entertainment
         opportunities for residents and visitors.

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
Historic Preservation in Residential Areas of the Colony
Community design also includes preserving the past. Anaheim is the oldest established
community in Orange County and it is working to preserve its heritage. It was
established in 1857 as a 1.8 mile-square German farming colony bordered by what is
today North, South, East and West Streets. The early settlers constructed walls and
fences made from willow poles to mark the boundaries of their settlement and to keep
out herds of wild cattle. Some of these fence poles took root and became gates into the
colony. The North Gate is commemorated today at 775 North Anaheim Boulevard and
has been designated as a California State Landmark. The Green Element proposes to
restore much of this original landscaping edge of the historic Colony.
A strong grassroots effort by local citizens, in partnership with the City, resulted in the
establishment of the Anaheim Colony Historic District in 1997. In 1999, the Anaheim
Colony Historic District Preservation Plan was approved. The Plan provides voluntary
design guidelines and assistance to property owners to maintain and enhance the historic
qualities of their homes.
The original Colony survives today as the Anaheim Colony Historic District and contains
an excellent concentration of period revival architecture and early residential street
patterns and scale. The Colony contains 1,100 contributing structures including a
predominance of Craftsman Bungalows as well as Spanish Colonial, Mission, Tudor,
Prairie and Colonial Revival styles, among others. The vast majority of the homes were
built between 1910 and 1935.
The City of Anaheim, through the Neighborhood Preservation Office, provides financial
and technical assistance to owners of qualified historic homes. Owners of structures on
the list of Qualified Historic Structures may be eligible for Community Development
Block Grants (assuming income eligibility) and/or Mills Act benefits wherein property
owners enter voluntary 10-year contracts to restore
and maintain properties in return for property tax
rebates. The State Historic Building Code allows
regulatory flexibility for improvements to historic
properties as long as safety and energy concerns are
adequately addressed. Historic structures outside of
the Colony may be eligible for home improvement             This small Craftsman bungalow is one

Structures and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the

         Register.
         Both the City and local preservation groups encourage owners of historic homes to
         restore them, thereby contributing to a very special place within Anaheim. In preserving
         an entire district, the City strengthens its identity by creating a memorable district that is
         a living link to the past.

         Platinum Triangle Development
         The Platinum Triangle represents an opportunity for the City to create a mixed-use
         regional center unique to Orange County. Located at the confluence of the I-5 and SR-
         57 Freeways, traversed by a commuter railroad line, and containing Angel Stadium of
         Anaheim and the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, the area has tremendous visibility and a
         great deal of underutilized land.
         The new vision for The Platinum Triangle contains a dynamic mix of uses and upscale,
         high-density urban housing - integrated by a carefully planned network of pedestrian
         walkways, streetscape improvements and recreational spaces - that will create an urban
         environment of a scale never before seen in Orange County. The combined attraction of
         shopping, entertainment, office, hotel, residential and recreational uses will transform
         The Platinum Triangle into the new downtown of Orange County, helping the City realize
         economic benefits and providing residents, workers and visitors with one of the most
         vibrant and exciting urban places in the region. The emphasis is on quality design,
         ensured through carefully crafted design guidelines.
         GOAL 15.1:
         The Platinum Triangle will become a dynamic, mixed-use center of regional interest,
         providing retail, office, residential, employment, and entertainment opportunities.
         Policies:
                  1) Develop comprehensive, Mixed-Use Overlay Zone and Design Guidelines to
                     implement the vision for The Platinum Triangle.
                  2) Provide a mix of quality, high-density urban housing that is integrated into
                     the area through carefully maintained pedestrian streets, transit connections,
                     and arterial access.
                  3) Develop a Public Realm Landscape and Identity Program to enhance the
                     visibility and sense of arrival into The Platinum Triangle through peripheral
                     view corridors, gateways, and specialized landscaping.
                  4) Develop a strong pedestrian orientation throughout the area, including wide
                     sidewalks, pedestrian paths, gathering places, ground-floor retail, and street-
                     level landscaping.

          5) Encourage extensive office development along the highly visible periphery of
               the area to provide a quality employment center.
          6)    Develop criteria for comprehensive property management agreements for
               multiple-family residential projects to ensure proper maintenance as the area
               develops.
          7) Identify and pursue opportunities for open space areas that serve the
               recreational needs of Platinum Triangle residents and employees.
 The Platinum Triangle will be a walkable, pedestrian-friendly area for shopping, office and residential uses.
North Euclid Street
The North Euclid Street area is an entry point into the City and includes the North
Orange County Community College District’s Anaheim Campus. With access to the
Riverside (SR-91) and Santa Ana (I-5) Freeways, this highly visible area is intended to
become an attractive gateway as well as an educational and commercial activity center.
GOAL 16.1:
Enhance the North Euclid Street corridor as a major City gateway and educational
center.
Policies:
          1) Create an attractive gateway into the
               City by exploring opportunities to
               visually enhance the intersection of La
               Palma Avenue and Euclid Street
               including the planting of additional
               street trees along both streets.
          2) Enhance landscaping treatments at
               entries to residential neighborhoods as
               opportunities exist.                                     Landscaped entryways into residential
                                                                        neighborhoods add character and value to the
                                                                        neighborhood.

                  3) Encourage corridor residential and mixed-use developments pursuant to the
                      Land Use Element and related policies in the Citywide Level Design Features
                      section of this Element.
         West Anaheim
         The predominant land use in West Anaheim is single-family residential neighborhoods,
         most dating to the 1960s. Strengths of the area include a strong sense of community,
         established neighborhoods, and pride of ownership. Areas of concern include
         deteriorating strip centers, aging large residential lots, unique architectural styles in
         tracts, protection of family-friendly neighborhoods, inconsistent signage and a shortage
         of recreational facilities.
         GOAL 17.1:
         Improve West Anaheim’s residential neighborhoods and strategically locate quality retail
         development
         Policies:
                  1) Explore opportunities to incorporate West Anaheim entry monumentation at
                      secondary intersection locations.
                  2) Enhance the image of West Anaheim by continuing to implement streetscape
                      and landscape improvements on major corridors and local streets.
                  3) Consolidate retail development in prime locations and replace declining mid-
                      block commercial uses with well-designed residential uses that complement
                      existing single-family neighborhoods per the Land Use Element.
                  4) Actively work with property owners, developers and nearby businesses and
                      residents to facilitate the revitalization of West Anaheim’s arterial corridors.
                  5) Revitalize neighborhoods targeted through the Neighborhood Improvement
                      Program.
                  6) Underground utility lines where feasible along arterial highways.
         East Anaheim
         This predominantly single-family residential area is experiencing challenges associated
         with aging housing and strip retail development. Located between the Santa Ana River
         on the east, the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway to the north, the Downtown Core to the west
         and The Platinum Triangle to the south, East Anaheim will benefit from the strengthened
         identity that comes from arterial corridor improvements and neighborhood improvement
         programs.
May 2004                                                          City of Anaheim General Plan | Page CD-39

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
GOAL 18.1:
Enhance the overall design quality of East Anaheim.
Policies:
          1) Implement approved landscape and corridor improvement plans along State
              College Boulevard.
          2) Explore opportunities to create enhanced, landscaped entries into East
              Anaheim from the Orange (SR-57) and the Riverside (SR-91) Freeways.
          3) Pursue opportunities to improve and provide additional pedestrian links to
              the existing easement on the west bank of the Santa Ana River to improve
              access to open space and the Santa Ana River Regional Trail.
          4) Revitalize neighborhoods targeted through the Neighborhood Improvement
              Program.
          5) Where feasible, underground utility lines along major corridors.
          6) Continue neighborhood street tree-planting efforts on residential streets
              throughout the area.
North Central Industrial Area
The North Central Industrial Area straddles the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway, between
Lemon Street and Raymond Avenue on the north side of the freeway and between
Harbor Boulevard and East Street on the south side of the freeway, and will benefit from
targeted design enhancements and a transition of uses. As the area changes from heavy
to light industrial and cleaner uses, efforts will be made to preserve its integrity and limit
its impacts upon surrounding non-industrial uses.
GOAL 19.1:
Transition the North Central Industrial Area as a cleaner, more modern industrial center.
Policies:
          1) Strengthen the visual identity of the area by designing entry monumentation,
              enhanced intersections and landscape improvements at key entry points as
              well as pursuing opportunities to remove the area’s abandoned railroad
              tracks, along Commercial Street.
          2) Coordinate with Caltrans to explore opportunities to improve landscaping
              along adjacent segments of the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway to both buffer
              undesirable views and provide enhanced entryways.
          3) Strengthen buffers between existing residential and current/future industrial
              uses.

                  4) Improve pedestrian links between residential areas and adjacent parks (La
                      Palma and Julianna).
           Anaheim Canyon
         This 2,450-acre business center borders the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway to the north,
         between the Orange (SR-57) Freeway and Imperial Highway, and is a major employment
         center. Its highly visible location and accessibility to both the Inland Empire and Los
         Angeles County give it an added advantage. An ongoing effort of the City has been to
         reinforce the Center’s image as a high quality, attractive industrial center.
         GOAL 20.1:
         Continue to strengthen Anaheim Canyon’s image as one of the region’s most desired
         economic centers.
         Policies:
                  1) Improve and project the image of the area through continuing the
                      development of enhanced entryways at key intersections, improved
                      landscaping along the Santa Ana River and groundwater recharge basins, and
                      a coordinated sign program.
                  2) Provide ample landscaping throughout the area to encourage a professional
                      atmosphere.
                  3) Encourage building products with individual identity, distinctive signage, and
                      varied color and materials rather than long, monotonous blank walls.
                  4) Where practical, orient buildings to take advantage of the Santa Ana River as
                      a scenic and recreational amenity.
                  5) Work with the Orange County Water District to expand upon the
                      recreational and commercial of the groundwater water recharge basins
                      located in the area.
          Hill and Canyon Area
         The topography of the Hill and Canyon Area
         requires special design attention. Residents in
         this area are proud of the natural, semi-rural
         setting and have consistently expressed the
         desire to preserve open space, specimen
         trees views and vistas. Applying design
         guidelines that respect the existing
         topography can enhance views to and from
         adjacent freeways, arterials and streets.
                                                              Scenic view in the Hill and Canyon Area.

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
GOAL 21.1:
Preserve the Hill and Canyon Area’s sensitive hillside environment and the community’s
unique identity.
Policies:
         1) Reinforce the natural environment of the area through appropriate
               landscaping and the preservation of open space.
         2) Require compliance with the Scenic Corridor Overlay Zone to reinforce
               quality development standards and guidelines compatible with the hillside
               area.
         3) Place entry monument signs at key locations into and out of the Hill and
               Canyon Area to strengthen its district identity.
         4) Encourage the siting of housing development below the existing ridgelines to
               preserve unimpeded views of existing natural contours.
         5) Use grading techniques that incorporate rounded slopes or curved contours
               to minimize disturbance to the site and to blend with the existing
               topography.
         6) Where grading has occurred, revegetate primarily with drought-tolerant
               native species to control erosion and create a more environmentally sound
               condition.
         7) Work with Caltrans to achieve enhanced landscaping within the Riverside
               (SR-91) Freeway right-of-way to enhance the image of the area as viewed
               from the freeway.

         INTRODUCTION
         F     rom its beginnings in 1857 as a small German farming community, Anaheim has
               grown to one of the largest cities in the State. With a population over 330,000,
               the City is home to a diverse population, a vibrant economy and world-class tourist
         destinations. The City has taken pride in developing a positive climate for economic
         development. To this end, the City has created a responsive, business-friendly
         atmosphere and an infrastructure backbone that allows both small and large businesses
         to flourish.
         The purpose of the Economic Development Element is to guide the City in expanding
         the local economy, which provides jobs, attracts and retains businesses, supports diverse
         and vibrant commercial areas, and brings in sufficient revenue to support various local
         programs and services. To achieve a balanced and healthy economy, the Economic
         Development Element sets forth the goals and policies necessary to ensure a prosperous
         economic future. The Economic Development Element is not a State-mandated Element
         of the General Plan, but the City of Anaheim has long recognized the importance
         economic development plays in helping to ensure the quality of life within its community.
         RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
         Economic Development Element is intricately related to the Land Use, Circulation,
         Public Services and Facilities, Housing and Green Elements. A healthy economy not only
         provides the tax base for local services and infrastructure, but also affects the demand for
         a variety of land uses. A proper balance of land uses and carefully tailored General Plan
         policies help the local economy by providing the business community with a skilled
         workforce; housing, recreational, cultural and retail opportunities for employers and
         employees; and supporting infrastructure facilities and services that foster economic
         growth. It is also related to the Community Design Element as community identity
         enhances the economic vitality and marketing efforts of the City.
May 2004                                                         City of Anaheim General Plan | Page ED-1
            CITY OF ANAHEIM
ACHIEVING THE VISION
General Plans are not static documents; they are blueprints for an active future.
Following is a summary of the major economic goals the City has embraced:
    Continue to support and enhance tourism as a driving force in Anaheim’s economy.
    Retain, expand and diversify the economic base of the City.
    Attract new industries and associated employment with a business-friendly climate.
    Continue to develop a highly-skilled labor workforce connected to a strong, local
     employment base.
    Revitalize Anaheim’s major corridors to provide an attractive setting for the business
     community.
    Introduce and/or expand retail and commercial opportunities in key areas of the City.
    Make Downtown Anaheim the City’s cultural, civic, and historic center.
    Preserve and enhance the quality and image of Anaheim’s residential neighborhoods
     as a driving force in the local economy.
    Provide incentives in Redevelopment Areas to stimulate desired development.
    Continue to coordinate closely with the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce to attract
     and retain businesses in the City.
LAND USE STRATEGIES
Achieving the goals described above requires a comprehensive effort anchored by
visionary land use planning and a strong City commitment. This Economic Development
Element, linked to the policies in the Land Use Element, provides consistent and
powerful guidance for the City. In turn, the Land Use Element facilitates continued
prosperity and helps to enhance the City’s economic and fiscal health through the
following land use strategies.
                                                                     Land use patterns that reflect these
                                                                    strategies are identified on Figure LU-3
Citywide Land Use Strategies                                        of the Land Use Element.
 Redirect and consolidate commercial development at
     strategic locations and introduce mid-block residential development as an alternative
     to under-performing commercial properties.
    Assemble key parcels for expanded housing, retail and/or office opportunities.
    Encourage mixed-used development in specified areas of the City.
    Encourage the development of "cleaner", light industrial uses that promote higher
     skilled, higher income jobs in appropriately designated areas.

                                   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
         Area-Specific Land Use Strategies
          Develop appropriate regulations to facilitate the transition of The Platinum Triangle
            into a major, economic center of regional significance, which exemplifies a dynamic
            place where people live, work and visit.
           Promote the continued revitalization of Downtown Anaheim as a vibrant town center
            with major civic, cultural, retail, office and residential uses.
           Revitalize the South Anaheim Boulevard corridor as an important link between
            Downtown Anaheim, The Anaheim Resort and The Platinum Triangle with a mix of
            retail, office, employment and residential uses.
           Enhance the long-term viability of Anaheim Canyon by preserving the integrity of
            industrially-designated land uses; improving urban design standards; providing
            additional employment-generating uses, such as commercial and mixed-use
            development; and enhancing water recharge basins as visual and recreational
            amenities, where appropriate.
           Revitalize the North Euclid Street Area, including the areas around the North
            Orange County Community College campus, as a major gateway into the City,
            offering educational and employment training opportunities for Anaheim’s workforce
            and residents and new mixed-use development opportunities for the surrounding
            neighborhoods.
           Expand The Anaheim Resort to include those areas along the Harbor Boulevard
            corridor south of Orangewood Avenue to the southern City limit.
           Encourage the development of a new mixed-use village at the northwest corner of
            State College Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue.
           Pursue commercial opportunities in the Hill and Canyon Area provided by the
            additional retail demand created by the development of the Mountain Park Specific
            Plan.
           Encourage the development of quality, mid-block residential land uses and while
            concentrating future commercial uses at major intersections and other strategic
            locations in West and East Anaheim, as designated on the General Plan Land Use
            Plan.
           Preserve and enhance “Tile Mile” along State College Boulevard, the well-known
            concentration of tile and stone distributors and their associated showrooms, as a
            major regional attraction.
           Continue discussions with the Orange County Water District in an effort to explore
            the commercial viability of strategically-located groundwater recharge basins.
May 2004                                                         City of Anaheim General Plan | Page ED-3

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
COMPONENTS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Anaheim’s economic development strategies must address key issues of growth and
adaptation to ensure continued prosperity. The strategies must enable the City to grow
in ways that benefit the most residents and build on its existing dynamic base, all while
allowing the City to adapt to changes in the economy.
The City defines economic development as “attracting and supporting sustainable,
desirable growth that brings a variety of companies, investment and jobs to Anaheim.”
The components of this process include the following City efforts.
City Coordination Efforts
Economic activity and job creation are generally thought to be primarily private-sector
activities. Anaheim has always strived to maintain the right mix of land uses, planning
policies, and programs to facilitate growth. Through the years, Anaheim has updated its
General Plan, refined zoning regulations, expanded its infrastructure through capital
improvements, streamlined development processes and created new opportunities
through redevelopment tools, and expanded its services to facilitate growth. The goal of
promoting economic development is built in to the City’s governmental structure, with a
number of municipal bodies charged with furthering economic growth, including the
Redevelopment Agency, the Workforce Investment Board, and a number of City boards
and commissions. Furthermore, many City departments play a role in expanding
economic activity and promoting job growth in Anaheim. Table ED-1 identifies these
departments and identifies the responsibilities of each.
Redevelopment Activities
The City of Anaheim has maintained an active redevelopment program since the 1970s
when it first began efforts to revitalize its Downtown. The City’s redevelopment efforts
have since greatly expanded, encompassing six major project areas (see Figure ED-1) as
of 2004. As these project areas have progressed and property values increased, the
Redevelopment Agency, headed by the City Council and staffed by the Community
Development Department, has used the resulting increases in tax revenue for a variety of
public purposes, including the provision of affordable housing. The Agency coordinates
City efforts associated with industrial, retail, office and residential development within
redevelopment project areas including the provision of off-site public improvements;
financing, redevelopment assistance, site evaluation, and infrastructure analysis.

City Revenues
Economic development is addressed, in large part, through the City’s revenue stream.
Anaheim has several unique and interesting characteristics. First, compared to most
other cities in the region, a much greater proportion of its revenues come from hotel bed
taxes – known as transient occupancy taxes. These revenues are generated primarily
from the large concentration of hotels in The Anaheim Resort, home to the Anaheim
Convention Center, and encompassing The Disneyland Resort. The City also has a
municipally-owned water and electric utility, enabling it to offer competitive rates and
more localized service. City revenues are also provided through a variety of other
sources, including sales and use taxes, property taxes, fees and permit charges, business
license taxes, and motor vehicle license fees, among others.

         Business Assistance
         The City of Anaheim is oftentimes thought of as a place where the world comes to live,
         work and visit. The City accomplishes this recognition through a wide variety of services
         and public/private partnerships. The Economic Development Division coordinates and
         administers incentive programs and services for the business community. The Public
         Utilities Department provides incentives and assistance for energy conservation. The
         Workforce Center and Small Business Assistance Programs are designed to help area
         businesses stay as competitive as possible. The City works with the Anaheim Chamber of
         Commerce to actively promote business opportunities and events within the City.
         ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SETTING AND OUTLOOK
         The City of Anaheim is centrally located within a dynamic County and within one of the
         nation’s largest metropolitan regions. Home to world-class amenities, such as The
         Anaheim Resort, the Anaheim Convention Center, the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, and
         Angel Stadium of Anaheim, and accessible by major freeways and rail lines, the City of
         Anaheim is highly visible and well positioned to continue to support a robust local
         economy. As the second largest city in Orange County and one of the nation’s largest
         tourist destinations, Anaheim has a key role to play in the regional economy as well.
         City Profile
         Location: Anaheim has the advantage of being in the heart of Orange County. Bordered
         by Fullerton, Placentia, Yorba Linda, Orange, Garden Grove, Stanton, and Buena Park
         and traversed by four major freeways and a major toll road, the City of Anaheim is
         extremely well positioned to continue to take advantage of regional transportation and
         economic opportunities.
         Dynamic Region: Orange County has traditionally outperformed many neighboring
         counties in terms of economic growth and maintains the second highest number of jobs
         in California, second only to Los Angeles County. Due to a multiplicity of factors,
         including its great climate and beaches, desirable quality-of-life, and expanding
         employment, entertainment and educational centers, the region has seen strong
         economic growth rates over the last fifty years.
         Anaheim’s Economy: There are over 11,000 businesses operating within the City. A
         variety of industry types comprise Anaheim’s economy and include: services;
         manufacturing; wholesale and retail trade; construction; transportation, communications
         and utilities; finance, insurance and real estate; and mining. Compared to many cities in
         the County, Anaheim has a large manufacturing and tourist-related economic base and is
         interested in maintaining these important sectors.
May 2004                                                         City of Anaheim General Plan | Page ED-9

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
Major Employers: Many of the City’s largest employers are from the resort, hospitality,
manufacturing, and entertainment employment sectors. With over 20 million visitors
annually, this is consistent with the service-oriented nature of the local economy.
Anaheim’s Workforce: Compared to Orange County as a whole, Anaheim’s labor force is
younger and originates from larger households. This represents a large labor pool
available to local and regional employers. A major goal for the City continues to be
developing a highly skilled workforce and ensuring a strong, local employment base.
Economic Development Outlook
Promoting economic development through careful planning and business promotion has
been a key to Anaheim’s impressive growth and success. It has become a nationally
recognized city with famous amenities and dynamic companies. Even though the City is
largely built-out, new opportunities and challenges present themselves. Anaheim must
position itself to provide more jobs for its growing local labor force and adapt to changes
in the regional and national economy.
Both short and long-term trends are positive. Combining the shortage of developable
land in Central Orange County and the City’s locational and amenity advantages,
Anaheim has a strong opportunity to maximize its future economic growth. There is
strong development potential for all uses including commercial, industrial and office
development; however, the proximity of regional-serving retail centers in nearby cities
combined with limited opportunities within the City has historically meant that many
residents find shopping opportunities in neighboring cities. This represents a challenge
for the City to proactively encourage more successful retail activity– a major goal of this
Element.
In order to take advantage of development opportunities and to attract quality
employers, the City will continue its efforts to improve the skill levels of Anaheim’s
workforce through ongoing workforce education and training programs.

         GOALS & POLICIES
         To guide the City in implementing its goals of economic vitality, this Economic
         Development Element sets forth goals and policies in six key areas: 1) Business
         Retention, Growth and Attraction; 2) Redevelopment/Revitalization; 3) Workforce
         Development – Job Promotion, Training and Career Education; 4) Public Facilities and
         Community Services; 5) Housing Diversity and Affordability; and 6) Area-Specific Goals
         and Policies.
         Business Retention, Growth and Attraction
         The City of Anaheim has taken pride in developing a positive climate for economic
         development. The City has implemented many programs designed not only to make
         Anaheim a better place to live, but also a better place to do business. For example, the
         City has undertaken both capital improvement efforts - corridor beautification programs,
         extensive redevelopment activities, expansion of existing tourist amenities, and ensuring
         reliable power supplies and infrastructure upgrades. It has also experienced staff
         development programs, such as customer service training, customer surveys and
         roundtable discussions with the business community. The City also established the
         Economic Development Division and the Anaheim Workforce Center to help local
         businesses prosper.
         The prospect for office development is favorable. Anaheim has traditionally been
         competitive in terms of commercial rents - an advantage that can continue to help the
         City retain and attract business clients. Favorable trends also exist for industrial
         development for many of the same reasons. The industrial land supply in Orange County
         is limited, and industrial rents in the City have been regionally competitive. Proximity to
         major transportation systems also gives Anaheim a competitive advantage for continued
         industrial development. The future also looks bright for Anaheim’s world-renowned
         tourism industry. With room to expand in both The Anaheim Resort and The Platinum
         Triangle, tourist-related development will remain a potent economic engine for the City.
         While an important component of future development in Anaheim, significant growth in
         research and development/high technology uses will face strong competition from

         2) Maintain strong public/private partnerships between the City and the
             business community.
Redevelopment/Revitalization
In order to maintain and enhance its quality of life, the City of Anaheim has focused on
economic revitalization in a wide variety of ways. It continues to maintain an active and
comprehensive redevelopment program through the administration of six project areas.
It is working to maximize retail sales tax revenue by consolidating future commercial
development at strategic locations. It is improving the quality of its corridor retail
development by redirecting retail development to major intersections and introducing
mid-block residential uses as an alternate land use for under-performing retail projects.
By making Anaheim a more desirable place to shop and to do business, the City gains
revenue by minimizing retail sales tax “leakage” to neighboring communities.
The City is also pursuing the enhancement of key, high visibility areas. It has developed
design guidelines to implement the new visions for the Downtown Area which will serve
as the City’s cultural, civic and historic center, and will stimulate economic activity and
increase revenue to the City (see section – Area-Specific Goals and Policies at the end of
this Element). In The Anaheim Resort, the City is expanding the existing Specific Plan
boundary to include those portions within Anaheim along the Harbor Boulevard corridor
south of Orangewood Avenue to enhance the visual appeal of the area and to encourage
new development consistent with the adjacent tourist-oriented area.
GOAL 2.1:
Continue to implement the revitalization goals of the City’s redevelopment project areas
and other strategic locations.
Policies:
         1) Consolidate future retail development in premium locations.
         2) Encourage the construction of new housing opportunities identified in
             redevelopment project area plans, the Housing Element and Land Use

         Workforce Development – Job Promotion, Training and Career
         Education
         An educated and well-trained workforce is the backbone of a healthy economy. To that
         end, the City established the Anaheim Workforce Investment Board (WIB) to provide a
         broad range of workforce development services to businesses seeking employees and to
         individuals looking for work, education, training and skills upgrade. The WIB is a 33-
         member business-led board responsible for setting policy, strategic planning and
         providing oversight to the local workforce investment system, in a “one-stop” setting.
         The One-Stop system is a network of funding streams and numerous partnering agencies
         including educational institutions, colleges, non-profit groups, community based
         organizations and government agencies. One-Stop services are delivered through the
         City’s/WIB's comprehensive One-Stop center – the Anaheim Workforce Center which

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
Anaheim has seven school districts which have facilities in the City, including several
public high schools. Many of these schools have active career education programs such
as career academies, adult education and the Regional Occupation Program. Anaheim’s
business community, represented by the Chamber of Commerce, is strongly supportive
of the schools and supports school-to-work programs.
GOAL 3.1:
Expand the scope of the City’s comprehensive job-training and workforce development
programs.
Policies:
          1) Continue to support, publicize and expand the Anaheim Workforce
              Development system (One-Stop), in cooperation with the Economic
              Development Division.
          2) Support career education programs such as the Regional Occupation
              Program, career academies, internships, job shadowing, Career Speaker
              Programs, Career Day, Youth in Government Day, and other programs.
          3) Tailor job training and placement programs to all economic segments of the
              City.
          4) Continue to provide translation services and liaisons to help integrate the
              City’s non-English speaking population into the workforce.
Public Facilities and Community Services
A reliable and high quality system of public services helps promote economic
development and provide the quality of life necessary to attract and retain residents and
businesses. The City of Anaheim has prided itself on providing its residents with quality
parks, fire and police services, community facilities,
                                                                  Refer to the Public Facilities
recreation and enrichment classes, public utilities and          and Services Element for more

                                      ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
         GOAL 4.1:
         Continue to provide high quality and reliable public safety and community services and
         facilities.
         Policies:
                   1) Continue to proactively plan, publicize and implement a high-quality and
                      responsive program of public safety and community services.
                   2) Evaluate resident needs and satisfaction with public safety and community
                      services on a periodic basis.
                   3) Continue efforts to attract a greater proportion of Anaheim’s residents in
                      Community Service programs, classes and events.
                   4) Implement the goals and strategies of the Anaheim Community Services
                      Strategic Plan.
         Housing Diversity and Affordability
         A diverse and high quality housing stock is an important ingredient in the economic
         success of any community. Quality residential development not only provides strong
         neighborhoods, but also serves as home to a local pool of labor, and a convenient
         customer base for City businesses. Anaheim is addressing the issue from three
         perspectives. First, the City works to maintain a broad range of housing types and
         prices. This means high quality, single-family homes as well as affordable, livable
         multiple-family development. Second, the City is planning for more residential
         opportunities in Downtown Anaheim and The Colony and in The Platinum Triangle.
         This will not only increase new housing supplies, it will provide easier access to retail and
         employment centers due to their concentration adjacent to various transit opportunities.
         Finally, the City is continuing its efforts to rehabilitate its existing housing stock through
         Community Development Block Grant funds, other funding sources and redevelopment
         activities.
         GOAL 5.1:
         Expand housing opportunities for all economic segments of the community.
         Policies:
                   1) Expand the City’s housing rehabilitation program through the Community
                      Development Block Grant Program and other funding sources.
                   2) Evaluate and pursue incentives for providing both affordable and market rate
                      housing of all forms.
May 2004                                                           City of Anaheim General Plan | Page ED-17

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
         3) Continue efforts to target high-quality residential opportunities along major
              corridors throughout East, Central and West Anaheim.
         4) Ensure quality development through adherence to Community Design
              Element design policies and applicable zoning provisions.
Area-Specific Goals and Policies
To identify target strategies that promote economic development in specific areas of the
City, the following section is divided into five sub-areas:
Hill and Canyon Area
The primarily residential Hill and Canyon Area of the City is expected to generate
additional demand for retailers. The area’s in-place demand is currently served by a
regional retail center (The Festival), but limited leakage of retail dollars still occurs.
Projected increases in population will support the need for additional large-scale
retailers, but will not likely support the need for any additional retail centers.
GOAL 6.1:
Attract new retailers to help strengthen existing commercial centers.
Policies:
         1) Develop strategies to attract retailers to the Hill and Canyon Area and to
              capture any demand generated by future residential development.
Anaheim Canyon
Anaheim Canyon is the largest industrial area in the City, constituting approximately 60%
of Anaheim’s industrial inventory. Due to its size and diversity of employment, Anaheim
Canyon represents a very important economic engine. Stretching in an east/west
direction along the northern side of the Santa Ana River through the eastern portion of
the City, Anaheim Canyon is served by rail, the regional arterial highway system, and the
Orange (SR-57) and Riverside (SR-91) Freeways. While the predominant land use
direction of Anaheim Canyon will remain industrial, the potential exists for additional
office and research/development activity due to the area’s high visibility and easy access
from major corridors and the freeway. A mixed-use retail/office/residential node is also
designated in the vicinity of the Metrolink Station.
Challenges for the area include a shortage of vacant land, demand by non-industrial
users and desire to provide higher skill, higher wage employment opportunities.
Page ED-18 | May 2004

                                       ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
         GOAL 6.2:
         Maintain and enhance Anaheim Canyon as one of the region’s major industrial/office
         employment centers by improving the area’s visibility, vitality and image and by taking
         advantage of its transportation links.
         Policies:
                   1) Discourage land uses that compromise the integrity of the area’s industrial
                      and office park setting.
                   2) Enhance the physical appearance of Anaheim
                      Canyon through better “edge” identification,               Refer to the Community
                      entry monumentation, signage, and landscaping.            Design Element for design –
                                                                                related policies for industrial
                                                                                areas.
                   3) Improve the architectural quality of buildings
                      through façade improvements and design
                      guidelines.
                   4) Encourage strategically-located convenience retail development for the
                      benefit of workers and visitors.
                   5) Encourage additional office development along the southern edge of La
                      Palma Avenue as indicated in the Land Use Element.
                   6) Encourage mixed-use development around the Anaheim Canyon Metrolink
                      Station as indicated in the Land Use Element.
                   7) Explore opportunities to introduce retail, restaurant or entertainment uses
                      adjacent to the area’s strategically-located groundwater recharge basins.
         The Platinum Triangle
         The 807-acre Platinum Triangle, bounded by the Santa Ana (I-5) and Orange (SR-57)
         Freeways and south of the Southern California Edison easement, represents the greatest
         commercial and office expansion opportunity for the City. Its proximity to major
         amenities such as the Angel Stadium of Anaheim, the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, and
         The Anaheim Resort along with its visibility from local freeways and railways make it a
         strong candidate to become a major regional economic center. The area’s visibility,
         central location and underutilized land combine for a potential large market capture of
         office, industrial and retail development. In addition, the employment, entertainment and
         retail opportunities provided in the area, combined with the high demand for housing,
         presents tremendous opportunities for high-quality residential uses for the area’s future
         workforce and those seeking an urban, mixed-use living environment.
         The vision of The Platinum Triangle goes far beyond that of the area’s historic land use
         patterns – the area will become a vibrant, mixed-use urban center serving the entire
May 2004                                                        City of Anaheim General Plan | Page ED-19

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
region. By including a diverse mix of retail, office, entertainment and high quality
residential uses and an extensive pedestrian-oriented public space network, The Platinum
Triangle can realize its potential as an exciting urban center.
To recognize and eventually achieve the development potential of this economic center
requires a creative, proactive approach. Streamlined planning approaches, well-defined,
yet flexible, development standards and attention to design, for example, will be pursued.
GOAL 6.3:
Create a major, mixed-use regional center in The Platinum Triangle providing
employment, shopping, entertainment, and housing for residents, employees and
visitors.
Policies:
          1) Implement a creative, proactive approach in designing a strategic planning
              process for the development of The Platinum Triangle, including the
              preparation of a Mixed-Use Overlay Zone and identity programs.
          2) Encourage mixed-use and higher density development within The Platinum
              Triangle.
          3) Introduce large-scale residential development to provide a market for
              growing retail and office uses in the area.
          4) Plan for and encourage creativity in design in order to adapt to changing
              situations, circumstances and challenges that may arise as the area
              undergoes transition.
Downtown Anaheim
Another important opportunity for the City relates to the on-going revitalization of its
Downtown. Located within the Anaheim Colony Historic District, Anaheim’s Downtown
is undergoing exciting and carefully orchestrated change. The overriding goal is to
create a vibrant, comfortable downtown with a dynamic blend of civic, cultural, retail,
office and residential development while preserving and taking advantage of the historic
character of the Colony. By use of the Anaheim Colony Design Guidelines, the City is
encouraging downtown development that reflects the history and architectural character
of the area while providing residents and visitors with a pedestrian-friendly environment.
The area will offer shopping, employment and recreational opportunities. The economic
benefits of higher sales and property tax revenue will be a by-product of the Downtown’s
growing popularity and strong sense of place and history.
Page ED-20 | May 2004

                                       ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
         GOAL 6.4:
         Promote the revitalization of Downtown Anaheim as a pedestrian-oriented and bicycle-
         friendly civic town center, enhanced with diverse retail, residential and cultural
         opportunities.
         Policies:
                  1) Promote the Anaheim Colony Historic District as a destination for local
                       residents and regional visitors thereby creating a stimulus for economic
                       revitalization.
                  2) Encourage quality design through implementation of the Anaheim Colony
                       Vision, Principles, and Design Guidelines.
                  3) Encourage mixed-use development incorporating ground-floor retail and
                       high quality architecture that is consistent with the historic nature of the
                       area.
                  4) Encourage well-designed, convenient parking structures, distinctive street
                       furniture, and ample bicycle and pedestrian amenities as stimuli to
                       Downtown shopping and commercial activity.
         Regional Commercial Centers
         In addition to the regional attractions in The Platinum Triangle, The Anaheim Resort and
         Downtown Areas, Anaheim is home to Regional Commercial Centers such as the
         Anaheim Plaza in Central Anaheim and The Festival in the Hill and Canyon Area. These
         centers provide significant sales tax revenue for the City, which in turn, results in the
         improved provision of services and facilities. Other locations are designated as future
         Regional Commercial Centers in the Land Use Element (see Figure LU-4, Land Use
         Plan), but commercial opportunities on this scale are somewhat limited due to similar,
         nearby uses in adjacent cities and limited market demand. Given the valuable revenue
         that these centers generate and the limited opportunities for future centers, it is
         imperative that the City maximizes the potential of existing and planned centers and
         develops strategies to attract an on-going supply of quality retail businesses.
         GOAL 6.5:
         Maximize the potential of existing and planned Regional Commercial Centers and
         develop strategies to attract quality development.
         Policies:
                  1) Encourage the development and/or attraction of retail businesses within
                       Regional Commercial Centers which serve a regional market and maximize
                       tax revenue.
May 2004                                                         City of Anaheim General Plan | Page ED-21
             CITY OF ANAHEIM
           2) Pursue public infrastructure improvements that will support and facilitate
                development of Regional Commercial Centers.
           3) When necessary, work with owners of Regional Commercial Centers to
                develop signage programs that effectively identify and promote the centers.
           4) Continue to enhance marketing and business retention/attraction programs
                to effectively compete with neighboring cities in attracting and retaining
                regional-serving businesses.

                                           GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
         INTRODUCTION
         S
                 trategically located and traversed by five major freeways, two State highways and
                 eighteen major and primary arterial highways, the City’s mobility and overall quality
                 of life have the potential to be significantly impacted by regional growth pressures.
         Anaheim has been actively involved in the growth management process since 1991, and
         this Element represents its ongoing commitment to participate in this important regional
         effort.
         The purpose of the Growth Management Element is to ensure that growth is based on
         the City’s ability to provide adequate levels of traffic management and other public
         facilities and services pursuant to the Countywide Traffic Improvement and Growth
         Management Component of Measure M.
         OVERVIEW
         The Growth Management Element is intended to ensure that capital facilities planning
         meets the needs of current and future residents of Anaheim. It fulfills the mandates of
         Measure M – the Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Ordinance
         passed by a Countywide initiative in 1990 – which allocates sales tax revenue to local
         jurisdictions and Orange County for transportation improvements. It sets forth goals and
         policies related to growth management, and provides implementation and monitoring
         provisions.
         SCOPE AND CONTENT
         The Growth Management Element is not a State-mandated element of the General Plan,
         but is required if the City is to receive funds for transportation improvements under
         Measure M. The Element also implements applicable goals of the Orange County
         Congestion Management Plan.
May 2004                                                           City of Anaheim General Plan | Page GM-1

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER GENERAL PLAN
ELEMENTS
The Growth Management Element must be internally consistent with the other Elements
of the General Plan. The Element does not supersede any other Element, but is
intended to augment and support traffic and public facility/service goals, policies and
standards. It also reinforces development mitigation, phasing and monitoring policies
included in other General Plan Elements. The Growth Management Element is
consistent with the other General Plan Elements. For instance, the Land Use Element
maps regional public facilities and includes land use designations that guide
transportation and fiscal policy by delineating the location and intensity of the various
land uses in the City. The Circulation Element identifies the fundamental components of
the transportation system, thereby providing the basis for assessing and mitigating
growth impacts associated with traffic. The Public Services and Facilities Element and
the Green Element, which integrates conservation, open space and parks and recreation
policies, describe the planning standards that the City uses in evaluating development
proposals.
MEASURE M PROVISIONS
In 1990, Orange County voters approved Measure M – the Revised Traffic Improvement
and Growth Management Ordinance – to provide additional funds for transportation
improvements. Measure M authorized a half-cent sales tax increase for twenty years
starting in April of 1991. The monies collected are allocated to local jurisdictions for
local and regional transportation improvement and maintenance projects. To qualify for
the funds, cities must comply with the Countywide Traffic Improvement and Growth
Management component of Measure M, designed to promote cooperative and
integrated planning efforts between cities and the County.
To receive funds, every five years cities must submit a statement of compliance with the
following growth management requirements:
     •   Adopt a Growth Management Element that includes traffic levels of service
         standards, a development mitigation program, and a development phasing and
         monitoring program;
     •   Develop a seven-year Capital Improvement Program;
     •   Address a balanced approach to housing options and job opportunities;
     •   Participate in inter-jurisdictional planning efforts; and,
     •   Adopt a Transportation Demand Management Ordinance.
The Measure M-mandated Growth Management Plan distinguishes between “developed”
and “developing” communities. Developed communities are assumed to have their
public facilities in place to support development envisioned through the Land Use
Page GM-2 | May 2004

                                            GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
         Element of their General Plans, but may require new or improved transportation facilities
         to implement their Circulation Element and absorb regional impacts. These communities
         are only required to address transportation-related growth impacts. Developing
         communities are assumed to need additional public facilities to support their General
         Plan land uses, including fire, police, flood control, parks and other local needs. By this
         criterion, Anaheim is considered a developed community, with the exception of the
         eastern portion of the Hill and Canyon Area. For this reason, a section on planning
         standards for developing areas was added to this Element.
         In addition to the basic requirements
                                                             “Turnback” funds refer to the allocation of Measure
         above, local jurisdictions must also comply         M sales tax revenues to eligible local jurisdictions.
         with the following requirement to receive
         “turnback” funds:
              •   Annual reporting, which documents that the City is expending its own funds for
                  transportation improvements and not diverting said funds to other uses upon
                  receipt of Measure M monies; and,
              •   Bi-annual reporting relative to an updated Pavement Management Program and
                  Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH) consistency.
         RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
         The Growth Management Element is closely related to other multi-jurisdictional planning
         efforts addressing regional growth issues, including the State-mandated Orange County
         Congestion Management Plan, which requires every urbanized city and county of
         50,000 or more to adopt a Congestion Management Plan (CMP). Jurisdictions that do
         not adopt a CMP lose gas tax revenues. The City of Anaheim has coordinated with the
         County in the preparation of a Countywide CMP and will continue to work on its
         implementation. The Measure M-mandated Orange County Growth Management
         Element is designed to ensure that the planning and management of transportation and
         public facilities will be sufficient to meet current and projected County needs. It divides
         the County into 11 Growth Management Areas and addresses the following five policy
         areas:
              •   Development phasing;
              •   Balanced community development;
              •   Traffic levels of service;
              •   Traffic implementation plans; and,
              •   Public facility plans

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
INTER-JURISDICTIONAL PLANNING
Anaheim encompasses portions of four County Growth Management Areas as shown in
Figure GM-1, County of Orange Growth Management Areas Encompassing Anaheim.
The Inter-Jurisdictional Planning Forums develop annual GMA Transportation
Improvement Project lists with funding targets and priorities and establish the GMA
deficient intersection list and baseline traffic impact fees. Participation in these different
Inter-Jurisdictional Planning Forums (IPFs) has allowed the City to evaluate needed
transportation improvements and receive its fair share of funding from different sources
of funds.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
Consistent with the goals of the Growth Management Element to reduce traffic
congestion and ensure adequate transportation and public facilities for existing and
future residents, Anaheim has established the following growth management
implementation programs:
1. Development Mitigation Program: This program was established to ensure that all
     new development pays a share of the costs associated with public infrastructure,
     services and enhancements needed to mitigate project-related impacts. Participation
     is on a pro-rata basis and is required of all new development projects, except where
     a project’s increased level of participation exceeds its fair share.
     The mitigation program was coordinated through the Inter-Jurisdictional Planning
     Forums to determine the base amount for impact fees within the GMAs. Individual
     cities may impose higher fees if they so choose or use existing traffic mitigation fee
     programs. The Public Works Department established a City Transportation
     Improvement Fee in 1993, consistent with requirements of the Program.
2. Comprehensive Phasing Program: Cities and the County are required through
     Measure M to prepare a Comprehensive Phasing Program (CPP) to ensure that
     infrastructure is provided commensurate with development, thereby ensuring that
     development impacts are mitigated before exceeding established thresholds. The
     City fulfills the phasing provision through its project review process and Capital
     Improvement Program. The program specifies lead time for the design and
     construction of project-related transportation improvements – three years from the
     issuance of the first building permit or five years from the issuance of the first
     grading permit. In developed jurisdictions such as Anaheim where the majority of
     the City is developed, with the exception of the undeveloped portion of the Hill and
     Canyon Area, CPPs are limited to projects requiring transportation improvements.

                                        GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
            In the Hill and Canyon Area, where development is still occurring, the provisions of
            Measure M allow a Specific Plan to be substituted for a Comprehensive Phasing
            Program since it contains a Public Facilities Plan, evaluated through an
            Environmental Impact Report. Through the Specific Plan process, the requirements
            of the Comprehensive Phasing Program are, or will be, fulfilled.
         3. Performance Monitoring Program: Cities are also required to create a performance
            monitoring program to monitor compliance with the established development
            phasing program (In Anaheim’s case, a CPP or Specific Plan). The intent is to ensure
            that public facilities improvements/service enhancements or funding are provided in
            order for development to continue. If the improvements or funding are not provided,
            development should be deferred until compliance with the provisions of the Program
            is achieved. Relative to transportation improvements in developed areas, the
            Performance Monitoring Program is evaluated every two years in conjunction with
            the Congestion Management Plan (CMP). Local jurisdictions collect data and
            monitor Level of Service performance on the CMP Highway System and Master Plan
            of Arterial Highways-designated Major intersections not on the CMP Highway
            System.
            OCTA, with the assistance of the City, collects traffic counts every other year and
            evaluates Levels of Service at these major intersections and utilizes the information
            for its capital improvement planning and funding.
         4. Seven-Year Capital Improvement Program: Measure M requires local agencies to
            annually adopt a seven-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) based on a
            determination of the capital projects needed to meet and maintain adopted traffic
            level of service and performance standards.
            The City of Anaheim fulfills this requirement by including its Measure M project
            funding within its seven-year CIP, which includes a description of all capital projects
            and their projected costs for each fiscal year.
         5. Transportation Demand Management: Measure M also requires adoption of a
            Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Ordinance to promote carpools,
            vanpools, alternate work hours, park and ride facilities, telecommuting and other
            traffic reduction strategies. The model TDM Ordinance offered by Measure M
            includes a menu of facility standards and enhancements and design criteria - such as
            preferential parking for carpools, bicycle parking and shower facilities, bus stop
            improvements, and rideshare vehicle loading areas - that local jurisdictions can
            implement as development project conditions of approval. The model ordinance
            also contains optional trip reduction strategies, such as monetary incentives for
            ridesharing, on-site lunch rooms/cafeterias, on-site day care, flex-time schedules,
            and telecommuting programs.

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
    Pursuant to this requirement, the City adopted a Traffic Demand Management
    Ordinance in 1991 and subsequently amended it in 1999. The TDM requires that
    all new development incorporate these facility standards as applicable and
    appropriate in their designs to reduce total vehicle trips. The menu of facility
    standards includes providing 10% to 20% of a project’s overall parking supply be set
    aside for preferred parking for car and van pools, bicycle parking and shower
    facilities, information on transportation alternatives, rideshare vehicle loading areas,
    access to vanpool vehicles and bus stop improvements.
    The City continually evaluates and refines its transportation demand management
    programs. For example, the City has been proactive in slowing the growth of total
    vehicle trips through the establishment of mixed-use districts in strategic areas,
    encouraging transit-oriented development in close proximity to transit stops and
    adopting design guidelines that encourage quality pedestrian amenities.
6. Deficient Intersection List: As part of their Inter-Jurisdictional Planning Forums
    responsibilities, cities are required to maintain a deficient intersection list. A deficient
    intersection is defined as, “an existing deficient intersection, not meeting the
    established level of service standard, where there are seemingly no opportunities for
    making any conventional geometric improvements within the current seven-year
    Measure M Capital Improvement Program.” The intent is to account for instances
    where the causes of an intersection deficiency are
    beyond the control of a local jurisdiction (e.g.,
    caused by regional traffic impacts). The GMA                  "

    The City of Anaheim maintains a deficient intersection list for its CMP Highway and
    Master Plan of Arterial Highway systems. The City continues to monitor these
    intersections and factors them into its transportation and growth management
    planning efforts.

         Goals and Policies
         Land use, circulation, public services and infrastructure planning are directly related to
         growth management. The goals and policies included in this section will help the City to
         effectively manage growth.
         Land Use
         The General Plan land use designations and goals and
         policies have a direct effect on the City’s ability to manage
         growth. This section addresses land use as it relates to
         growth management and is intended to supplement the
         discussion of growth impacts in the Land Use Element,
         which also includes more detailed discussion of land use
         policies.
         Balancing Jobs and Housing: The City of Anaheim has
         consistently focused its efforts on providing a balanced mix
         of land uses. Its housing and redevelopment initiatives
         continue to address housing opportunities for all segments
         of the community. The City is revitalizing commercial areas
         resulting in an increase in both employment and shopping
         opportunities. The Economic Development Division of                 Introducing residential and
         the Planning Department also maintains a comprehensive              mixed-use development into

•   Comprehensive redevelopment activities for both housing and retail development
    throughout the City.
•   Transition of underutilized mid-block retail uses to new residential development in
    order to expand housing opportunities while encouraging future retail development
    at strategic locations.
•   Designation of mixed-use areas in Downtown Anaheim, The Platinum Triangle, The
    Canyon and along major transit corridors and adjoining Metrolink stops. This
    includes implementation of the City’s Transportation Demand Management
    Ordinance requiring applicable development to include plans for facility standards
    such as improved bus stops, preferential parking for carpools and adequate vehicle
    rideshare loading areas encouraging car and vanpools.
GOAL 1.1:

         GOAL 1.3:
         Establish Citywide development priorities that efficiently use existing infrastructure and
         public facilities.
         Policies:
                  1) Encourage development of vacant and underutilized infill sites where public
                       services and infrastructure are available or can be efficiently accommodated.
                  2) Focus redevelopment and/or revitalization efforts in areas conducive to
                       current or future employment and/or housing opportunities as appropriate
                       and continue to provide incentives for private investment in those areas.
                  3) Monitor infrastructure and public facilities plans for major activity centers
                       such as The Platinum Triangle, Downtown Anaheim and The Canyon and

         5) Monitor the effectiveness of the City’s Transportation Demand Management
             Ordinance and make changes as appropriate.
Circulation
Improving transportation is the primary focus of Measure M’s growth management effort.
Seven of the eight focus areas of Measure M directly relate to transportation
improvements. Combined with the Circulation Element, the following goals and policies
are intended to reduce traffic congestion and ensure adequate transportation facilities for
existing and future residents, employees and visitors of Anaheim.
GOAL 2.1:
Reduce traffic congestion on the City’s arterial highway system.
Policies:
         1) Identify capital projects and strategies to meet, maintain or improve current
             traffic Level of Service (LOS) standards through the seven-year Capital
             Improvement Program.
         2) Participate in Inter-Jurisdictional Planning Forums at the GMA level to
             monitor development with multi-jurisdictional impacts and identify and
             prioritize appropriate mitigation measures.
         3) Use the Citywide transportation model to create and monitor development
             phasing plans.
         4) Continue to maintain consistency between the City and County Master Plan
             of Arterial Highways.
         5) Promote the use of public transportation and alternative modes of
             transportation by increasing access to public transit, including Bus Rapid
             Transit, through land use planning (e.g., locating higher density residential
             projects near transportation corridors), ensuring direct and convenient
             pedestrian access to public transit stops, implementing bicycle routes,
             encouraging pedestrian-friendly developments, and supporting High
             Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes.
         6) Work with the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA), the
             development community and other key stakeholders to ensure an adequate
             mix of transit opportunities in the City.
         7) Improve traffic flow by reducing the number of curb cuts and encouraging
             driveway consolidation along arterial highways in conjunction with future
             development.

                                         GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
         GOAL 2.2:
         Evaluate the traffic-related impacts of proposed developments and/or intensification of
         existing land uses and address said impacts.
         Policies:
                  1) Continue to review development projects to ensure traffic-related impacts
                      are addressed appropriately.
                  2) Continue to identify and collect appropriate transportation improvement or
                      other infrastructure/service fees as established by the City.
                  3) Continue to coordinate with other jurisdictions through the Inter-
                      Jurisdictional Planning Forums to evaluate the major land use and
                      transportation issues within the GMAs.
                  4) Prior to issuing building permits for new development forecast to generate
                      100 or more peak hour (morning or evening) trip ends, require traffic impact
                      analyses be completed that identify arterial and intersection improvements
                      that may potentially be needed to provide not worse than LOS E along
                      Interstates/State Routes/Smart Streets (unless current operation is LOS F),
                      and not worse than LOS D along the balance of the arterials on the City’s
                      Circulation Element that are measurably
                      impacted by the new development and are
                      under the City’s jurisdiction.
                                                                        "
                                                                        Refer to the Circulation Element for
                                                                        more discussion of LOS
                  5) Require development projects that exceed           requirements within the City.
                      LOS standards beyond acceptable levels
                      to provide necessary improvements and/or funding to mitigate said impacts,
                      if determined necessary by the City.
         Planning Standards for Developing Areas
         Under the provisions of Measure M, Anaheim is considered a developed community,
         with the exception of the eastern portion of the Hill and Canyon Area. A developed
         community is one that already has the public facilities in place to support the
         development of the Land Use Element of the General Plan with the exception of new or
         improved transportation facilities needed to implement the Circulation Element or the
         regional system.
         Under Measure M standards, the eastern portion of the
         Hill and Canyon Area is classified as “developing.”
         This portion of the City contains the hilliest topography
                                                                          "
                                                                          Refer to Public Services and
         and the most extensive amount of open space                      Facilities Element and the Green
         resources and is also home to the Mountain Park                  Element for additional discussion of
                                                                          community services and planning
                                                                          standards.

         INTRODUCTION
         T       he City of Anaheim is affected by several sources of noise, including vehicular
                 traffic, entertainment facilities, sports events, commercial and industrial activity,
                 and periodic occurrences such as construction and aircraft travel. Excessive levels
         of noise can affect the physical health, psychological stability, property values, and
         economic productivity of Anaheim and its residents. The control of noise, therefore, is
         an essential component in creating a safe, compatible, and productive environment.
         ACHIEVING THE VISION
         The citizens of Anaheim understand the relationship between noise and their health and
         serenity. As a part of the visioning process that shaped this general plan update, citizens
         and City officials identified goals for the future relating to balancing land uses in the City,
         in part to minimize incompatibilities and exposure to excessive noise while providing the
         range of uses needed to maintain a high quality of life. These goals are reflected in the
         Noise Element of this General Plan.
         UNDERSTANDING NOISE
         Definitions
         The following is a list of commonly used terms and abbreviations that may be found
         within this Element or when discussing the topic of noise. This is an abbreviated glossary
         that should be reviewed prior to reading the Element. Figure N-1, Sources of Sound, is
         presented following this glossary to illustrate the level of noise generated by common
         everyday occurrences. It is important to become familiar with these definitions in order
         to better understand information contained in the Noise Element.
         •   Ambient Noise – The composite of noise from all sources near and far. In this
             context, the ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing level of
             environmental (background) noise at a given location.
May 2004                                                             City of Anaheim General Plan | Page N-1

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
•   Intrusive Noise – That noise which intrudes over and above the existing ambient
    noise at a given location. The relative intrusiveness of a sound depends upon its
    amplitude, duration, frequency and time of occurrence, and tonal or informational
    content.
•   dB (Decibel) – The unit of measure that denotes the ratio between two quantities
    that are proportional to power; the number of decibels corresponding to the ratio of
    the two amounts of power is based on a logarithmic scale.
•   dBA (A-weighted decibel) – The A-weighted decibel scale discriminates against upper
    and lower frequencies in a manner approximating the sensitivity of the human ear.
    The scale ranges from zero for the average least perceptible sound to about 130 for
    the average pain level.
•   L50 – The A-weighted sound level that is exceeded 50% of the sample time.
    Alternatively, the A-weighted sound level that is exceeded 30 minutes in a 60-
    minute period (similarly, L10, L25, etc.). These values are typically used to
    demonstrate compliance with noise restrictions included in the City noise ordinance.
•   Leq (Equivalent Energy Level) – The average acoustic energy content of noise during
    the time it lasts. The Leq of a time-varying noise and that of a steady noise are the
    same if they deliver the same acoustic energy to the ear during exposure, no matter
    what time of day they occur.
•   Ldn (Day-Night Average Level) – The average equivalent A-weighted sound level
    during a 24-hour day, obtained after the addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in
    the night from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Note: CNEL and Ldn represent daily levels
    of noise exposure averaged on an annual or daily basis, while Leq represents the
    equivalent energy noise exposure for a shorter time period, typically one hour.
    CNEL and Ldn are the metrics used in this document to describe annoyance due to
    noise and to establish land use planning criteria for noise.
•   Lmax (Maximum Energy Level) – The maximum sound level (dB) observed during a
    particular noise event. More specifically, it is the greatest root-mean-square noise
    value obtained over the measurement period.
•   CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level) – The average equivalent A-weighted
    sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after the addition of five decibels to
    sound levels in the evening from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and after the addition of
    10 decibels to sound levels in the night from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. CNEL and Ldn
    are the metrics used in this document to describe annoyance due to noise and to
    establish land use planning criteria for noise.
•   Noise Contours – Lines drawn around a noise source indicating equal levels of noise
    exposure.

                                                                            NOISE ELEMENT
         •   Vibration – Another community annoyance related to noise is vibration. As with
             noise, vibration can be described by both its amplitude and frequency. Amplitude
             may be characterized by displacement, velocity, and/or acceleration. Typically,
             particle velocity (measured in inches or millimeters per second) and/or acceleration
             (measured in gravities) are used to describe vibration.
             Vibration can be felt outdoors, but the perceived intensity of vibration impacts is
             much greater indoors, due to structural shaking. Some of the most common sources
             of vibration come from trains, transit vehicles, construction equipment, airplanes,
             and trucks. Several land uses are especially sensitive to vibration, and therefore have
             a lower vibration threshold. These uses include, but are not limited to, concert halls,
             hospitals, libraries, vibration-sensitive research or manufacturing operations,
             residential areas, schools, and offices.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DOCUMENTS
The Noise Element is a comprehensive approach towards incorporating noise control in
the planning process. It is a tool for achieving and maintaining environmental noise
levels compatible with land use. The Noise Element identifies noise sensitive land uses
and noise sources, and defines areas of noise impact. The Element establishes goals,
policies, and programs to ensure that Anaheim residents will be protected from excessive
noise.
Related General Plan Elements
The Noise Element is closely related to the Circulation and Land Use Elements. Transit
thoroughfares such as freeways, arterial highways, and railways generate the majority of
noise within the City and influence the type and intensity of development within a given
area. Likewise, land uses sensitive to noise such as schools and residences are to be
considered when determining land use patterns and planned mitigation measures related
to noise impacts. The location and amount of such noise generators and receptors are
also important considerations in the Public Services and Facilities and Green Elements.
These elements address issues such as the development of educational facilities, public
parks, and open space buffers.
Other Regulatory Documents
The intent of the Noise Element is to set goals to limit and reduce the effects of noise
intrusion and to set acceptable noise levels for varying types of land uses. To this end,
the City has the authority to set land use noise standards and place restrictions on private
activities that generate excessive or intrusive noise. However, it should be recognized
that the City does not have the authority to regulate all sources of noise within the City
and various other agencies may supercede City authority.
Federal Highway Administration
State routes and freeways that run through the City are subject to Federal funding and,
as such, are under the purview of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The
FHWA has developed noise standards that are typically used for Federally-funded
roadway projects or projects that require either Federal or Caltrans review. These noise
standards are based on Leq and L10 values and are included in Table N-1, FHWA Design

         U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
         The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issues formal requirements
         related specifically to standards for exterior noise levels along with policies for approving
         HUD-supported or assisted housing projects in high noise areas. In general, these
         requirements established three zones. These include:
              •     65 dBA Ldn or less - an acceptable zone where all projects could be approved,
              •     Exceeding 65 dBA Ldn but not exceeding 75 dBA Ldn - a normally unacceptable
                    zone where mitigation measures would be required and each project would have
                    to be individually evaluated for approval or denial. These measures must provide
                    5 dBA of attenuation above the attenuation provided by standard construction
                    required in a 65 to 70 dBA Ldn area and 10 dBA of attenuation in a 70 to 75
                    dBA Ldn area, and
              •     Exceeding 75 dBA Ldn - an unacceptable zone in which projects would not, as a
                    rule, be approved.
         Federal Railroad Administration
         The EPA is charged with the regulation of railroad noise under the Noise Control Act.

California Department of Health Services
The California Department of Health Services (DHS) Office of Noise Control studied the
correlation of noise levels and their effects on various land uses. As a result, the DHS
established four categories for judging the severity of noise intrusion on specified land
uses.
Figure N-2, Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Exposure (Exterior), presents
a land use compatibility chart for community noise prepared by the California Office of
Noise Control and adopted in this Noise Element to demonstrate land-use compatibility.
While the chart is presented in terms of the Ldn or CNEL, the City prefers the use of the
CNEL descriptor, as it is slightly more conservative (i.e., restrictive), in protecting
sensitive land uses.

It identifies “normally acceptable,” “conditionally acceptable,” “normally unacceptable,”
and “clearly unacceptable” exterior noise levels for various land uses. A “conditionally
acceptable” designation implies new construction or development should be undertaken
only after a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements for each land use is
made and needed noise insulation features are incorporated in the design. By
comparison, a “normally acceptable” designation indicates that standard construction
can occur with no special noise reduction requirements.
While this land use compatibility chart is based on a 24-hour value, the City is aware that
some land uses are not occupied on a 24-hour basis, and a descriptor (such as Ldn or
CNEL) may be overly restrictive in siting these types of sensitive land uses. Such uses
may include, but are not limited to, schools, libraries, and churches. In these cases, a
more appropriate standard would consider the time of occupancy of the land use. Here,
the City recommends the use of a 65 dBA, 12-hour Leq (Leq(12)) that includes those
hours of actual use. (If a facility is to be used in excess of 12 hours per day, the CNEL
standard should be used.)
Table N-3, State of California Interior and Exterior Noise Standards, includes the State
interior and exterior noise standards for varying land uses. It is important to note that
the exterior noise levels are to be attained in “habitable” exterior areas and need not
encompass the entirety of a property and that special consideration should be given in
the case of infill residential development located along the City’s arterial corridors or
railroad lines in order to achieve an appropriate balance between providing a quality
living environment and attractive project design.

         City of Anaheim Noise Ordinance
         The City of Anaheim has the authority to set land use noise standards and place
         restrictions on private activities that generate excessive or intrusive noise. The applicable
         standards for these activities are specified in the Anaheim Municipal Code. The
         Municipal Code limits sound levels for stationary sources of noise radiated for extended
         periods from any premises in excess of 60 decibels at the property line. Sound created
         by construction or building repair of any premises within the City is also exempt from the
         applications of the Municipal Code during the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.

Traffic sounds, sound created by emergency activities and sound created by
governmental units are exempt from the applications of the Municipal Code. To this
end, for land use planning, the City’s Noise Element has adopted the State of California
standards as included in Table N-3, State of California Interior and Exterior Noise

         GOALS AND POLICIES
         T        his section contains a brief discussion and detailed policy direction for noise
                  issues within Anaheim. The first issue, Land Use Planning and Design, concerns
                  the relationship between the design and approval of land uses and existing or
         potential noise sources. The second issue, Transportation Related Noise Sources,
         considers impacts that can be created by the operation of motor vehicles, trucks, aircraft
         and railways in the City. Non-Transportation Related Noise Sources, the third issue,
         involves noise impacts created by business or residential activities, such as air
         conditioning units, manufacturing activities, barking dogs, or community events. By
         following the policies associated with each issue, Anaheim will ensure compatible
         development, protect noise sensitive land uses, and minimize the effects of excessive and
         nuisance noise.
         Land Use Planning and Design
         Although the City is largely built-out, the growth in population, employment and tourist
         activity may generate more traffic and attract additional noise producing uses. In
         addition, some undeveloped and underdeveloped areas are designated for land uses that
         may be noise-sensitive and are located in proximity to roadways, railroads and transit
         facilities. For example, in some areas of the City, mixed-use and higher density
         residential development is encouraged in close proximity to transportation facilities to
         improve transit accessibility and, in turn, improve traffic efficiencies. In addition, some of
         these same uses are located in areas that are transitioning from potential noise-
         generating industrial uses to other uses. As a result, land use compatibility with noise is
         an important consideration in the planning and design process.
         In order to identify potential mitigation to address noise abatement strategies, noise
         evaluations should be conducted when a proposed project places sensitive land uses and
         major noise generators within close proximity to each other. The City’s Planning
         Department currently uses the project review process to identify potential noise issues

             CITY OF ANAHEIM
and works with developers or landowners to apply site planning and other design
strategies to reduce noise impacts. A developer, for example, could take advantage of
the natural shape and contours of a site to arrange buildings and other uses in a manner
that would reduce and possibly eliminate noise impacts. Examples of other site and
architectural techniques could include:
•    Increasing the distance between noise source and receiver.
•    Placing non-noise sensitive land uses such as parking lots, maintenance facilities and
     utility areas between the noise source and receiver, while maintaining aesthetic
     considerations.
•    Using non-noise sensitive structures such as garages to shield noise-sensitive areas.
•    Orienting buildings to shield outdoor spaces from a noise source.
•    Locating bedrooms in residential developments on the side of the house facing away
     from major roads.
GOAL 1.1:
Protect sensitive land uses from excessive noise through diligent planning and regulation.
Policies:
           1) Update City regulations to adopt Land Use Compatibility for Community
               Noise Exposure and California Interior and Exterior Noise Standards as
               appropriate.
           2) Continue to enforce acceptable noise standards consistent with health and
               quality of life goals and employ effective techniques of noise abatement
               through such means as a noise ordinance, building codes, and subdivision
               and zoning regulations.
           3) Consider the compatibility of proposed land uses with the noise environment
               when preparing, revising or reviewing development proposals.
           4) Require mitigation where sensitive uses are to be placed along transportation
               routes to ensure that noise levels are minimized through appropriate means
               of mitigation thereby maintaining quality of life standards.
           5) Encourage proper site planning and architecture to reduce noise impacts.
           6) Discourage the siting of sensitive uses in areas in excess of 65 dBA CNEL
               without appropriate mitigation.
           7) Require that site-specific noise studies be conducted by a qualified acoustic
               consultant utilizing acceptable methodologies while reviewing the

                       development of sensitive land uses or development that has the potential to
                       impact sensitive land uses.
         Transportation Related Noise Sources
         Anaheim contains a number of transportation-related noise sources including freeways,
         arterial highways, collector roadways, helicopter, and railroad operations. These sources
         are the major contributors of noise in Anaheim. Cost effective strategies to reduce their
         influence on the community noise environment are an essential part of the Noise
         Element. While local government has little direct control of transportation noise at the
         source, as these levels are set by State and Federal agencies, the City does have some
         control over transportation noise that exceeds State and/or Federal standards through
         the enforcement of the Municipal Code.
         The most effective method the City has to mitigate transportation noise is by reducing
         the impact of the noise onto the community through noise barriers and site design
         review. The effect of a noise barrier is critically dependent on the distance between the
         noise source and the receiver. A noise barrier effect occurs when the barrier penetrates
         the “line of sight” between the source and receiver; the greater the penetration or height
         of the barrier, the greater the noise reduction. Additional attenuation can be achieved
         depending upon the source of transportation related noise.
         Roadways
         Roadways are one of the biggest sources of noise in the City. Everyday, thousands of
         vehicles travel through and around Anaheim. Sound emanates from the vehicles’
         engines and from the tires rolling over the pavement. One way the City can control
         vehicle noise is through speed reduction. A change of just 5 miles per hour can change
         the resultant noise by approximately one to two dBA. The difference in noise associated
         with a reduction of 10 miles per hour could be roughly equivalent to reducing the traffic
         volume by one-half.
         The City also has some control over traffic-generated noise through weight limitations
         and the designation of truck routes. Medium trucks, (i.e., those with a gross vehicle
         weight between 5 and 13.25 tons) produce as much acoustical energy as approximately
         5 to 16 automobiles depending on the speed, with slower speeds demonstrating greater
         differential. Similarly, heavy trucks (i.e., those with a gross vehicle weight in excess of
         13.25 tons) produce as much acoustical energy as 10 to 60 automobiles.
         The City can further reduce traffic-generated noise by ensuring that street paving is
         maintained and bumps and dips are minimized. Poor paving causes vehicles to bounce
         and this bouncing exacerbates the noise due to the rattling of the vehicle. This is
         especially important along those routes that realize augmented volumes of truck traffic.
         Noise contours for the City’s roadways and freeways are presented in Figure N-3, Future
May 2004                                                           City of Anaheim General Plan | Page N-13

Roadway Noise Contours, and Figure N-4, Future Freeway and Railroad Noise Contours.
Future conditions consider sound levels given the buildout of land uses and the roadway
network, but do not consider sound attenuation measures such as soundwalls.
Aircraft
The City is not located within the 65 dBA CNEL contours for any commercial or private
airports, and fixed-wing aircraft are typically too high to add measurably to local noise.
However, local helicopter air traffic is commonplace throughout the City. News and
other helicopters (e.g., freeway traffic report helicopters) fly through the area, but do not
land within the City.
Helicopter use at hospitals is considered as an emergency activity and as such, is exempt
under the City Municipal Code. Fire and police helicopter use for emergency functions
also fall under this exclusion. Low-flying helicopter activity, however, has been a source
of noise complaints within the City, particularly in the Anaheim Colony, and indicates
that the siting of future heliports, regardless of their use, must be carefully reviewed for
potential noise impacts.
Railways
Another prevalent source of noise in the City is from railroad operations. The City
contains two train stations that are used by Metrolink and Amtrak for passenger rail
service. Both Metrolink and Amtrak operate out of the Anaheim Station, which is
located adjacent to the Angel Stadium of Anaheim. Metrolink also stops at the Anaheim
Canyon Station, which is situated near the intersection of North Tustin Avenue and the
Riverside (SR-91) Freeway. In addition, the City contains two railroad freight corridors.
These include the Union Pacific line located primarily along the Santa Ana (I-5) Freeway,
but diverging in the southern portions of the City, and the Burlington Northern & Santa
Fe (BN&SF) line located along Orangethorpe Avenue/ Esperanza Road.
Currently, daily train traffic produces noise that may disrupt activities in proximity to
railroad tracks. For example, trains are required to sound their horns at all at-grade
crossings. Trains may also be required to slow their speed through residential areas.
These types of noise disturbances can interfere with activities conducted on noise-
sensitive land uses.
Railroad noise is dependant on a number of factors including the number of operations
per day, the times these operations occur, the numbers of engines and railcars, the
speed, the type of rail (i.e., continuous or bolted), and whether at-grade rail crossings
exist that require engineers to sound a warning horn. Noise contours for railway
operations are presented in Figure N-3, Future Roadway Noise Contours.

         Alternative Transportation
         The City can also minimize traffic-generated noise by encouraging the construction and
         use of alternative modes of transportation such as alternative fuel vehicles, the Bus Rapid
         Transit (BRT) System, or transit oriented design (TOD) – the provision of higher density,
         mixed-use development near major rail and transit stops. Alternative transportation
         modes can emit less noise per passenger than their automotive counterparts and can
         reduce traffic congestion. Additional information on TOD and the BRT System can be
         found in the Green and Circulation Elements.
         GOAL 2.1:
         Encourage the reduction of noise from transportation-related noise sources such as
         motor vehicles, aircraft operations, and railroad movements.
         Policies:
                  1) Continue to enforce the noise standards of the State Motor Vehicle Code
                      and other State and Federal legislation pertaining to motor vehicle noise.
                  2) Employ noise mitigation practices, as necessary, when designing future
                      streets and highways, and when improvements occur along existing road
                      segments. Mitigation measures should emphasize the establishment of
                      natural buffers or setbacks between the arterial roadways and adjoining
                      noise-sensitive areas.
                  3) Require that development generating increased traffic and subsequent
                      increases in the ambient noise level adjacent to noise-sensitive land uses
                      provide appropriate mitigation measures.
                  4) Maintain roadways so that the paving is in good condition to reduce noise-
                      generating cracks, bumps, and potholes.
                  5) Require sound walls, berms and landscaping along existing and future
                      freeways and railroad rights-of-way to beautify the landscape and reduce
                      noise, where appropriate.
                  6) Encourage the construction of noise barriers by the Public Utilities
                      Commission, Southern California Regional Rail Authority, Union Pacific,
                      Burlington Northern & Santa Fe and Amtrak where residences exist next to
                      the track.
                  7) Encourage the Public Utilities Commission, Southern California Regional Rail
                      Authority, Union Pacific, Burlington Northern & Santa Fe and Amtrak to
                      minimize the level of noise produced by train movements and whistle noise
                      within the City by reducing the number of nighttime operations, improving

             vehicle system technology and developing improved sound barriers where
             residences exist next to the track.
        8) Encourage the use sound-deadening matting (as opposed to wood) leading
             to, from and between the rails where public roads cross tracks in residential
             areas.
        9) Require private heliports/helistops to comply with the City noise ordinances
             and Federal Aviation Administration standards.
        10) Participate in the planning activities of County, regional and State agencies
             relative to the location of new airports and the assessment of their impact on
             the environment of the City.
        11) Encourage the development of alternative transportation modes that
             minimize noise within residential areas.
        12) Monitor proposals for future transit systems and require noise control to be
             considered in the selection of transportation systems that may affect the City.
        13) Continue efforts to minimize the impacts from police helicopter training and
             emergency response activities through the potential relocation of helicopter
             facilities and careful consideration of flight paths.
Non-Transportation Related Noise Sources
The City currently maintains a diversity of land uses, most of which generate their own
noise. Industrial facilities generate noise through various processes that involve the use
of heavy equipment and machinery. However, even commercial facilities and residential
units can generate noise from the use of heating, ventilating, and air conditioning
(HVAC) units. Restaurants, bars, and entertainment establishments may use sound
amplification equipment that operates well into the night. Residential areas are also
subject to noise from the use of pool and spa pumps, landscape maintenance equipment,
barking dogs, etc.
Mixed-use areas that place more sensitive residential uses alongside or above
commercial uses can present their own challenges. Requiring that the commercial
component meet a residential standard could make commercial operations difficult.
Alternatively, applying a commercial standard to a mixed-use project could result in
unacceptable noise levels at the residential portion of the structure/site. Still, mixed-use
projects offer several advantages from both an air quality and transportation perspective,
and should be encouraged.
The most prominent non-transportation related noise production occurs at the three
major attraction venues in the City: The Anaheim Resort®, Angel Stadium of Anaheim,
Page N-22 | May 2004

                                                                            NOISE ELEMENT
         and the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim. These uses involve the use of delivery vehicles,
         rides and attractions, and attract thousands of people and automobiles that can create
         high levels of noise. Within the property lines of these uses, however, the noise levels
         are generally considered acceptable and appropriate to the use. Moreover, these uses
         employ large setbacks, parking buffers, and a variety of sound barriers to minimize noise
         impacts.
         The noise impacts on the area surrounding Angel Stadium of Anaheim is also limited due
         to the industrial nature of the surrounding development. However, as The Platinum
         Triangle transitions into a mixed-use center and incorporates more sensitive land uses,
         the potential for noise conflicts may rise. Any new development, therefore, will be
         required to incorporate appropriate sound mitigation measures to minimize the noise
         impacts from and to the surrounding environment.
         Another source of “non-transportation” noise comes from the operations of trucks and
         trains within the City. As previously mentioned, the operation of railroad trains and
         heavy trucks is preempted from local noise regulation while operating on public roads
         and dedicated rights-of-way. However, noise is also generated by operations (e.g.,
         idling, loading, and unloading) that occur at facilities. Once on private property, these
         sources are no longer considered preempted and the City has authority to regulate this
         noise if it “spills” into adjacent areas.
         Finally, construction in all land use zones can temporarily elevate noise. The City
         recognizes that construction is a necessity and noise control for construction needs to be
         carefully balanced. Still, various measures are available to reduce this noise when
         necessary.
         GOAL 3.1:
         Protect residents from the effects of “spill over” or nuisance noise emanating from the
         City’s activity centers.
         Policies:
                   1) Discourage new projects located in commercial or entertainment areas from
                       exceeding stationary-source noise standards at the property line of proximate
                       residential or commercial uses, as appropriate.
                   2) Prohibit new industrial uses from exceeding commercial or residential
                       stationary-source noise standards at the most proximate land uses, as
                       appropriate. (Industrial noise may spill over to proximate industrial uses so
                       long as the combined noise does not exceed the appropriate industrial
                       standards.)
                   3) Enforce standards to regulate noise from construction activities. Particular
                       emphasis shall be placed on the restriction of the hours in which work other

             CITY OF ANAHEIM
                than emergency work may occur. Discourage construction on weekends or
                holidays except in the case of construction proximate to schools where these
                operations could disturb the classroom environment.
           4) Require that construction equipment operate with mufflers and intake
                silencers no less effective than originally equipped.
           5) Encourage the use of portable noise barriers for heavy equipment operations
                performed within 100 feet of existing residences or make applicant provide
                evidence as to why the use of such barriers is infeasible.

         INTRODUCTION
         P       ublic services and facilities play an essential role in sustaining Anaheim’s quality of
                 life. The presence of high quality public services and infrastructure such as fire
                 protection, law enforcement, parks, schools, water, sewer, and storm drain
         systems significantly influence the health and viability of the City’s residential,
         commercial, and industrial communities.
         The effectiveness of these community resources is the result of careful planning,
         thoughtful decisions and the provision of adequate funding. As Anaheim continues to
         grow and mature, the public services and facilities necessary to support new
         development will need to be provided and the existing facilities will continue to require
         maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement.
         The Public Services and Facilities Element identifies the City’s goals, policies, and
         programs concerning the provision of public facilities and services, including the
         following:
         •    Fire Protection and Emergency               •   Private Utilities
              Services

             CITY OF ANAHEIM
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
The Public Services and Facilities Element is closely related to the Land Use and Growth
Management Elements. The location of existing or planned utilities, schools, fire
stations, and other municipal facilities influences the type and intensity of development
that can be supported within a given area of the City. Likewise, existing and future land
use patterns provide guidance in determining the demand for and location of future
public facilities and services. The provision of services and location and extent of public
facilities is also an important consideration in the Circulation, Green, Safety, and
Economic Development Elements.

                             PUBLIC SERVICES and FACILITIES ELEMENT
         GOALS AND POLICIES
         To plan for Anaheim’s public service and facility needs, one must first examine the
         condition of the existing infrastructure and services. By analyzing the ability of current
         resources to support present and planned development, the City can determine what
         infrastructure improvements or service enhancements will be necessary to support the
         growth envisioned in the Land Use Element of the General Plan. This section examines
         Anaheim’s current resources, such as emergency services, along with its infrastructure,
         including public facilities.
         Fire Protection and Emergency Services
         The City encompasses both a highly urbanized flat
         land area as well as a rural and suburban Hill and
         Canyon Area with varying topography and natural
         vegetation. The potential range of fire and safety
         considerations is varied. The dry vegetation,
         steep slopes and wind conditions in the Hill and
         Canyon Area create a potentially hazardous
         situation. The City has adopted fire hazard
         regulations for development in the Hill and               The Anaheim Resort® Station
         Canyon Area and fire prevention measures
         including the use of fire retardant construction materials and landscaping, slope
         maintenance and brush clearance. Further information on wildfires and related City
         policies can be found in the Safety Element.
         The Anaheim Fire Department employs both sworn and civilian personnel. Fire stations
         are strategically located to ensure an efficient demand response to all risk hazards. The
         Department staffs engine and ladder truck companies, and provides paramedic services,
         fire suppression, rescue and hazardous materials response capabilities. Figure PSF-1,
         Fire and Police Facilities Map, displays the location of the City’s current fire stations and

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
The City is also part of a regional coordination system with other firefighting agencies.
Fire units are dispatched through the Metro Cities Fire Authority. The Metro Cities Fire
Communications Center (shown on Figure PSF-1) currently serves the citizens of seven
cities: Anaheim, Fountain Valley, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Newport
Beach, and Orange. The Communication Center, commonly referred to as Metro Net, is
located in the City of Anaheim and dispatches fire and emergency medical services for
more than 1.2 million citizens residing in 188 square miles within Orange County. The
Anaheim Fire Department manages the day-to-day operations of the Center.
In addition to fire protection services, the Fire Department provides emergency rescue
and medical services to Anaheim residents and visitors. The majority of calls placed to
the Fire Department are requests for medical aid. The Fire Department maintains a
Paramedic Membership Program, which guarantees that participants pay no out-of-
pocket expenses for emergency medical services provided by the Fire Department. The
Program does not, however, cover ambulance services. Ambulance services are
provided by a private company, which coordinates closely with the Fire Department. The
Fire Department also operates several educational and training programs on a number of
issues related to fire prevention and public safety. Program topics include home fire
safety, drowning prevention, used oil recycling, and CPR.
The Fire Prevention Bureau is a code enforcement division of the Fire Department, which
consists of two principal sections – Life Safety and Environmental Protection. The Life
Safety Section conducts fire and life safety inspections, issues Fire Code permits, and
responds to citizen complaints. The Environmental Protection Section administers the
City of Anaheim Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA). As the CUPA, the
Environmental Protection Section enforces State laws and regulations regarding
hazardous materials and hazardous waste.
GOAL 1.1:
Provide sufficient staffing, equipment and facilities to ensure effective fire protection,
emergency medical and rescue services, permitting and fire inspection, and hazardous
material response services that keep pace with growth.
Policies:
         1) Maintain adequate resources to enable the Fire Department to meet
             response time standards, keep pace with growth, and provide high levels of
             service.

         Water System
         Anaheim operates its own water utility and is one of the few
         cities in Orange County that operates its own water treatment
         plant. The City is in the unique position of having the ability to
         determine the efficiency and effectiveness of its water supply.
         The City also encourages water conservation through the
         continued development and expansion of programs and
         methods. Related policies on water quality and conservation
         are found in the Green Element.
         The Public Utilities Department began supplying Anaheim
         residents with domestic water in 1879 from a single well,
         pumping plant, and a 20,000-gallon elevated redwood tank.
                                                                                    A Public Utilities

         approximately 744 miles of water mains, 61,500 active water meters and over 7,800
         fire hydrants. The system facilities also include eight water connections to the
         Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, 27 active wells, one 920 million
         gallon reservoir for untreated water, a water treatment plant, 13 reservoirs, and nine
         booster pump stations. The system also includes 17 interties, which are
         interconnections between public water systems that permit the City’s water system to
         exchange or delivery water with neighboring water systems. These exchanges generally
         take place during emergency situations such as unplanned system outages or failures.
         The City utilizes two primary sources of water supply: groundwater produced from City-
         owned wells and imported water from the MWD. The proportion received from either
         source varies each year.
         Anaheim’s water system service areas range in elevation from less than 60 feet to over
         1,200 feet above sea level. The distribution system is generally divided into two main
         geographic areas: the flatland and Hill and Canyon Areas. The flatland area
         encompasses approximately 21,000 acres situated generally north and west of the Santa

         Sewer System
         The sewer system plays a crucial role in ensuring that the community remains clean,
         healthy, and enjoyable. Although most of the sewer system is adequate for existing and
         future development, a number of areas will require additional facilities to keep pace with
         future needs. If Anaheim is to continue to grow and prosper, the City’s sewer system
         must be able to accommodate the quantity of wastes generated by residents and
         businesses.
         Sewage is collected by City collector facilities and conveyed to trunk sewers owned and
         maintained by the Orange County Sanitation District, which then treats the sewage at
         regional facilities. There are small portions of the City that receive local sewer service
         from adjacent agencies, including the Stanton County Water District and the Garden
         Grove Sanitation District.
         The existing sewer system was originally constructed during the 1950’s and 1960’s and
         was designed to meet the City’s needs as identified at that time. Since then, additional
         sewer trunks and collectors have been added to accommodate growth. Today, the City
         maintains over 500 miles of sewer lines. The current sewer system is shown in Figure
         PSF-5, Sanitary Sewer System Map.
         As shown in Figure PSF-5, Sanitary Sewer System Map, various sewer lines within the
         City are considered deficient. These deficiencies have been identified through prior
         studies and a variety of measures have been identified to address needed improvements.
         GOAL 5.1:
         Provide a safe and effective sewer system that meets the needs of the City’s residents,
         businesses, and visitors.
         Policies:
                  1) Ensure that appropriate sewer system mitigation measures are identified and
                      implemented in conjunction with new development based on the
                      recommendations of prior sewer studies and/or future sewer studies that may
                      be required by the City Engineer.
         Storm Drain System
         Anaheim encompasses approximately 50 square miles of land, much of which is paved
         and impervious to stormwater. When it rains, thousands of gallons of water, as well as
         trash, oil, and other pollutants travel through the storm drain system. The current system
         contains a number of segments that are in need of improvement. To ensure the
         continued safety and well being of the City, the capacity of its storm drainage system
         must be improved.
May 2004                                                       City of Anaheim General Plan | Page PSF-17

             CITY OF ANAHEIM
All Southern California cities, including Anaheim, have historically designed local streets and
arterial highways to serve the secondary function of transporting stormwater during periods of
peak runoff along with their primary purpose of moving vehicular traffic. As the City grew,
however, the growing expanse of impervious surfaces such as roads and parking lots left fewer
places for stormwater to soak into the ground, creating the need for additional drainage
systems. Accordingly, storm drain facilities were added beginning in the late 1950’s and early
1960’s.
Regional facilities include the Santa Ana River and other major channels such as Carbon Creek,
Anaheim-Barber City Channel, and East Garden Grove-Wintersberg Channel (the EGGW).
The EGGW is located along the coasts of Newport Beach and Huntington Beach and is not
shown on the map. Major regional drainage facilities are designed to provide protection
against major loss of life and property for a 100-year storm event. Intermediate facilities
include smaller channels and detention facilities such as the Carbon Canyon Diversion, Carbon
Canyon, Atwood, Richfield, and Southeast Anaheim Channels. The intermediate facilities are
primarily designed according to a 25-year storm standard. The regional and intermediate
facilities are owned and maintained by the Orange County Flood Control District.
Anaheim is divided into 44 distinct drainage districts that are supported by a system of
regional, intermediate, and municipal storm drainage facilities. Figure PSF-6, Existing Storm
Drain System Map, illustrates the City’s existing storm drain system, and PSF-7, Existing Storm
Drain Conditions Map, identifies those considered deficient. Drainage patterns within the City
are varied. Runoff is primarily conveyed on street surfaces as well as local storm drainage
facilities to the County’s intermediate and regional facilities. The Public Works Department
operates over 67 miles of local storm drains and facilities.
GOAL 6.1:
Maintain a storm drain system that will adequately protect and enhance the health, safety and
general welfare of residents, visitors, employees, and their property.
Policies:
          1) Improve the City’s storm drain system to address current deficiencies as well as
               long-term needs associated with future development to minimize flood damage
               and adequately convey rainfall and subsequent runoff from a 25-year frequency
               storm.
          2) Develop Anaheim’s flood control system for multi-purpose uses whenever practical
               and financially feasible (i.e., recreational, water quality/treatment, infiltration, etc.).
          3) Minimize the amount of impervious surfaces in conjunction with new development.
          4) Minimize the disturbance of natural water bodies and natural drainage systems,
               where feasible, resulting from development including roads, highways, and bridges.

         Waste Management
         The proper management of waste is crucial to the City’s health, environment, and
         economy. Solid waste collection and disposal is provided for the City of Anaheim
         through a private contractor. After the waste is collected, it is processed through a
         system that separates the recyclables. The recyclable materials are then transferred for
         immediate shipment to domestic and international markets. Household toxic waste is
         disposed of at the North Orange County Household Hazardous Waste Collection Facility
         operated by the County of Orange at 1071 North Blue Gum Street in Anaheim.
         Remaining non-recyclable waste is processed and consolidated before delivery to
         Southern California landfills.
         As landfills reach their capacities and new landfill sites become increasingly difficult to
         establish, the need to reduce solid waste generation is crucial. State law currently
         requires that local jurisdictions divert at least 50% of their solid waste from landfills
         through conservation, recycling and composting.
                                                                       Anaheim residents produce between

         Anaheim participates in over 20 programs such as residential curbside recycling to
         facilitate the diversion of waste. The City has also adopted a Source Reduction and
         Recycling Element and a Household Hazardous Waste Element as part of the Orange
         County Integrated Waste Management Plan in compliance with State law. More detailed
         information on the City’s recycling policies can be found in the Green Element.
         GOAL 7.1:
         Minimize, recycle and dispose of solid and hazardous waste in an efficient and
         environmentally sound manner.
         Policies:
                   1) Ensure that solid waste generated within the City is collected and
                       transported in a cost-effective manner that protects the public health and
                       safety.
                   2) Reduce the volume of material sent to solid waste sites in accordance with
                       State law by continuing source reduction and recycling programs and by
                       ensuring the participation of all residents and businesses.

Private Utilities
Private companies also provide private utility services that impact the City’s economy,
image, and quality of life. Companies provide natural gas, telecommunications and cable
television services. The infrastructure capacity for these utilities is expected to expand
with new development. These companies maintain infrastructure that is visible to City
residents and visitors. These facilities should be located and designed to be compatible

         Municipal Fiber Optics Infrastructure
         The Anaheim Public Utilities Department operates a fiber optics infrastructure that
         consists of a 72-mile network that interconnects Utilities and some municipal facilities
         together. The infrastructure facilitates digital radio dispatch communications, video and
         phone systems, municipal data networks, and Internet access. The network also
         interconnects electrical substations, water wells and pumping stations, and other City
         buildings.
         A recent 22-mile underground addition, acquired from a private company in 2001,
         extends the reach of the fiber optics routes into the commercial and industrial parts of
         the City. One route extends from The Anaheim Resort to a commercial district in the
         City of Orange. Future fiber optics network expansion is planned to interconnect water
         facilities and proposed electrical substations in the Hill and Canyon Area and other
         locations within the City.
         The municipal fiber optics infrastructure has spare capacity that can be utilized by
         outside entities. Therefore, the Public Utilities Department is preparing plans to market
         the extra capacity to telecommunications service providers, businesses, and educational
         and governmental institutions. This will extend the reach of fiber optics-based services
         within Anaheim and expand the telecommunications choices available throughout the
         City. The City’s fiber optics infrastructure is illustrated in Figure PSF-8, Fiber Optic
         Backbone Map.
         GOAL 9.1:
         Provide a dependable fiber optics system that meets existing and future needs.
         Policies:
                   1) Maintain and, when desirable, expand fiber optics capacity to ensure
                       Anaheim businesses and educational and governmental institutions enjoy
                       adequate high-speed communications access.
         Powerlines and Facilities Siting
         Two of the most effective means of improving the appearance of Anaheim are to place
         overhead utilities underground and screen utility devices and facilities. Considerable
         progress has been made in undergrounding overhead utilities through the City’s
         Underground Conversion Program, with over 67 circuit miles undergrounded between
         1990 and 2003. Undergrounding utilities is an important component of the City’s on-
         going corridor beautification efforts.
         In addition, utility facilities such as electrical substations and water wells should be

continues to be a City priority. Specific policies addressing the design and location of
utility devises are found in the Community Design Element.
GOAL 10.1:
Improve the City’s appearance by mitigating the visual impacts of utility equipment and
facilities.
Policies:
          1) Continue to implement the Underground Conversion Program in public
              rights-of-way and increase the number of underground utility districts, as
              appropriate.
          2) Use a combination of architectural enhancements, equipment
              undergrounding, screen walls and landscaping to reduce or eliminate
              visibility of utility equipment and facilities, whenever feasible.
School Facilities
The provision of a high quality education system significantly influences the future of
Anaheim’s children and the City itself. Education provides Anaheim children with more
than just the basic skills needed to function and participate in the community. The
education system shapes the life-long opportunities available to the City’s children and
adults alike. A wide variety of educational opportunities are essential to ensure that the
City’s residents and economy remain
healthy and competitive. Anaheim’s                In January 2003, the North Orange County Community

•     Public and Private Colleges
Anaheim is served by eleven school districts that oversee 49 elementary, 10 junior high,
and 14 high schools within City boundaries. These public schools currently educate well
over 100,000 students and offer additional educational opportunities and facilities to the
community at large. In addition, the North Orange County Community College District
recently opened a campus that provides a variety of college and continuing education

          programs. Figure PSF-9, Public Schools, Libraries, Community Centers, and Cultural
         Facilities Map, displays the locations of Anaheim’s public schools.
         As Anaheim continues to grow and attract new families, improvement of existing school
         facilities and the construction of new facilities will be necessary. The General Plan’s
         Environmental Impact Report analyzes the future educational needs of Anaheim
         residents.
         Providing public schools remains a continual challenge for school districts, primarily
         because of limited funds and availability of adequately sized sites. Although the provision
         of adequate school facilities is the responsibility of the school districts serving Anaheim,
         the City will continue to work with the various educational entities and organizations to
         identify the best school sites and quality educational opportunities. As an example, the
         City’s Green Element provides policy guidance on joint-use facilities by locating parks
         and schools adjacent to each other to take advantage of public land ownership. The
         funding of schools is under the legislative purview of the State. The California
         Educational Code (Section 17620) authorizes school districts to collect fees for the
         mitigation of new development impacts. The City ensures these fees have been collected
         by the relevant School District prior to issuing building permits for new development.
         Private education also supplements Anaheim’s public education system. Private schools
         offer residents alternatives to public schools for primary and secondary education.
         Technical and vocational schools offer students and current employees educational
         programs to develop the skills and knowledge needed to adapt to today’s work
         environment. Additional policies regarding vocational training are found in the
         Economic Development Element.
         GOAL 11.1:
         Coordinate with public and private educational entities to provide a variety of high-
         quality education and training opportunities to meet the needs of a diverse community
         and economy.
         Policies:
                   1) Continue to assist school districts in their long-range planning for school
                       facilities.
                   2) Encourage the provision of additional workforce training and development
                       resources.

         Ensuring that library facilities continue to meet
         the needs of the community is an ongoing
         challenge. Increases in service demand will
         continue due in part to future population
         growth, as well as the need to provide services
         to specific demographic groups, especially
         growing student, children, and senior
         populations in the community.

         when the Carnegie Library building, which still
         stands on the corner of Anaheim Boulevard
         and Broadway, was completed in 1908. By the
         1960’s, the City’s library needs had far
         outgrown this space. Between 1962 and
         1981, the City constructed new facilities to
         provide library services to the growing
         community. In 1964, the central Library moved
         into its current location at 500 West
         Broadway.

Community Centers and Cultural Facilities
Community centers and cultural facilities play a vital role in Anaheim’s social, cultural,
and civic activities. They provide a setting to gather, socialize, and create, expand, and
promote cultural events and activities. These multipurpose facilities serve residents of all
ages, abilities and cultural backgrounds.
The City’s Cultural Plan seeks to develop and expand the cultural and artistic
infrastructure for Anaheim residents. As part of this goal, the Cultural Plan stresses the
need for accessible meeting, workshop, classroom, storage, and event space.

Neighborhood Improvement Services
Keeping Anaheim beautiful is a top priority for the City, its residents, and its business
community. The maintenance of a clean, safe, and attractive city fosters civic pride and
enhances economic vitality. The Planning and Public Works Departments provide rapid
response to code violations, removal of unsightly graffiti, and the maintenance of streets
and sidewalks. Through the maintenance and improvement of property and public rights-
of-way, all those who live in, work in, and visit Anaheim can experience a sense of pride
and well-being.
The Planning Department’s Code Enforcement Division promotes and maintains
standards through community involvement, education and regulation to enhance
neighborhood appearance and safety. The Public Works Department maintains the
City’s streets and sidewalks in a safe and usable condition to ensure public safety,
maintain street durability, facilitate the flow of pedestrian and automobile traffic, and
provide an attractive environment. Street maintenance includes street sweeping, pothole
repairs, utility cuts, asphalt patching and resurfacing. The Public Utilities Department
operates the City’s Underground Conversion Program, which improves the City’s
aesthetics and system reliability by undergrounding overhead utility lines.
The City’s Neighborhood Improvement Program is a highly successful interdepartmental
effort dedicated to improving the livability of Anaheim’s neighborhoods. The program

         INTRODUCTION
         P      rotecting the health, safety and welfare of the community is a fundamental role of
                the City. Due to the occurrence of natural disasters such as flooding, earthquakes
                and fires in Southern California, it is increasingly important that Anaheim maintains
         programs that provide an effective response to public safety concerns. The Safety
         Element assesses natural and man-made hazards present in the community and includes
         policies to address those hazards.
         ACHIEVING THE VISION
         The Safety Element is an important policy tool that will be used to implement and
         maintain the City’s vision of Anaheim as a “safe place to live, work and play.” The
         purpose of the Safety Element is to identify potential hazards that can significantly impact
         the City; provide policies to minimize potential dangers to residents, workers, and
         visitors, and to reduce the level of property loss due to a potential disaster; and, identify
         ways to respond to crisis situations.
         This Element specifically addresses the way in which the City will respond to fire hazards,
         geologic and seismic hazards, flood hazards, and serves to address disaster
         preparedness. The Safety Element provides background information related to each
         issue and identifies risk-reduction strategies, hazard abatement measures, and potential
         hazard locations within the City that can ultimately be used while making future land use
         decisions. Included policies address ways to minimize any economic disruption and
         accelerate the City’s recovery following a disaster.
         RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DOCUMENTS
         The General Plan provides a comprehensive overview of the City’s policy approach to
         protecting public health, safety and welfare, while associated safety-related documents
         provide the regulatory mechanisms to address the social, economic and aesthetic factors
         that should be considered to respond to the community’s safety needs. Understanding
         and facilitating an ongoing relationship between the Safety Element of the General Plan

and other safety-related documents such as Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS)
Guidelines, the Anaheim Fire Department’s Hazardous Materials Area Plan, the City’s
Emergency Response Plan, the Anaheim Municipal Code, Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Mapping, and Alquist Priolo mapping will be critical
to ensure the safety of Anaheim’s residents, businesses, and visitors.
Related General Plan Elements
Critical relationships also exist between the Safety Element and other General Plan
Elements. The types and locations of land uses identified in the Land Use Element are
influenced and regulated by the locations of natural hazards, while emergency evacuation
routes and locations of critical facilities can be influenced by the goals and policies
identified in the Circulation Element. The Public Services and Facilities Element
addresses the ability of the City’s Police and Fire Departments to respond to hazards and
disasters identified in this Element. In addition, the Land Use and Green Elements
preserve natural resources that may be impacted by hazards.
Other Regulatory Documents
Federal, State, and local regulations and policies such as the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA), the California Government Code, the Uniform Building Code, and
the Anaheim Municipal Code regulate and/or influence land use and development in
Anaheim. Not only do they help to protect the health, safety, and welfare of Anaheim
residents, visitors and businesses by ensuring that proper analyses are conducted, sound
construction practices are implemented, and uses are appropriately sited within the City,
they can also help to minimize the recovery time necessary after a disaster.

         GOALS AND POLICIES

                 related to safety provisions within the City. The safety items addressed in this
                 element should be given careful consideration when new development, roads,
         parks, critical emergency facilities, infrastructure or other projects are designed.

         govern development in potentially seismically active areas.
         The CBC contains provisions to safeguard against major structural failures or loss of life
         caused by earthquakes or other geologic hazards. According to the CBC, the City of
         Anaheim is located in Seismic Zone 4, one of five zones (0-4) mapped in the CBC to
         identify areas subject to varying degrees of potential impact and frequency of large
         earthquakes. Seismic Zone 4 is potentially subject to the highest accelerations, or
         changes in speed or velocity due to seismic shaking, and has the greatest frequency of
         large earthquakes.
         Fault Zones
         Anaheim is located in an area considered to be seismically active, similar to most
         Southern California cities. Active and potentially active faults are located adjacent to
         Anaheim; however, there are no Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones within the City
         limits. Figure S-1 shows known regional earthquake faults in relation to the City
         boundaries.

Newport-Inglewood fault zone passes within
approximately seven miles of the western limits of the City. Although no onshore surface
fault rupture has taken place since 1769, the Newport-Inglewood fault zone is
considered capable of generating an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 on the Richter
Scale.
The Whittier-Elsinore fault zone is the closest major fault system to the City and one of
the largest in Southern California. The Whittier-Elsinore fault zone does not extend
inside the City boundaries, but approaches within less than one mile of the northeastern
corner of the City. The Whittier-Elsinore fault       Surface trace:

The potential for ground rupture due to fault
movement is commonly related to the seismic activity of known fault zones. Recognized
active fault zones are located outside of the City of Anaheim. Potentially active faults in
close proximity to the City are the El Modeno, Peralta Hills, and Norwalk faults (Figure
S-2), which have a low possibility of ground rupture within the City. The majority of the

that the El Modeno, Peralta Hills and Norwalk faults are not “sufficiently active” or “well
defined” enough to be subject to the provisions of the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
Zoning Act. Compared with the more active and recognized fault zones, the potential
for ground rupture due to seismic activity in the City is considered low.

         formational materials. Faulting and stream erosion are also common factors in the
         development of planes of weakness that contribute to landslide potential. In Anaheim,
         landslides have occurred in the steep slopes of the Hill and Canyon Area.
         Areas of landslide potential are shown in Figure S-2. In areas of existing land
         development, the mapped landslides may have been removed, mitigated, or altered

         Earthquake-Induced Landslides
         Earthquake-induced landslides have the potential to occur in the Hill and Canyon Area.
         Generally, these types of failures consist of rock falls, landslides, and debris flows. Areas
         having the potential for earthquake-induced landsliding generally occur in areas of
         previous landslide movement, or where topographic, geological, geotechnical, and
         subsurface water conditions indicate a potential for permanent ground displacements.
         Areas considered to have potential for earthquake-induced landsliding are shown in
         Figure S-3. It should be noted that much of the potential for earthquake-induced
         landslides has been mitigated as development has stabilized much of the Hill and Canyon
         Area.

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
Liquefaction
Liquefaction takes place when granular materials that are saturated by water lose strength
and transform from a solid to a liquid state. Liquefaction generally occurs during
significant earthquake activity, and structures located on soils such as silt or sand may
experience significant damage during an earthquake due to the instability of structural
foundations and the moving earth.
Soil liquefaction is a seismically induced form of ground failure, which has been a major
cause of earthquake damage in Southern California. During the 1971 San Fernando and
1994 Northridge earthquakes, significant damage to roads, utility pipelines, buildings
and other structures was caused by liquefaction. Research and historical data indicate
that loose, granular materials situated at depths of less than 50 feet with silt and clay
contents of less than 30% that are saturated by a relatively shallow groundwater table are
most susceptible to liquefaction. These geological and groundwater conditions exist in
parts of Southern California and Anaheim, typically in valley regions and alluviated
floodplains.
Liquefaction has the potential to impact properties within the City that are located along
the Santa Ana River as well as western portions of the City (Figure S-3). Mapped
liquefaction zones are intended to prompt more detailed, site specific, geotechnical
studies as required by the California Seismic Hazard Mapping Act. In addition, the
City’s building codes require structures in these areas to be designed to withstand the
potential impacts that could be caused by liquefaction.
Mining Activity and Oil and Gas Wells
Historically, mining activities and petroleum exploration have resulted in the creation of
open pits and wells. The approximate location of known active and abandoned mines
and quarries, as well as oil and gas wells within the City, is represented in Figure S-4. In
some cases, pits and wells may have been abandoned and backfilled with undocumented
fill materials. Existing pits and wells backfilled with undocumented materials may be
subject to differential settlement, which causes structures to shift, and often become
damaged, due to the uneven lowering of the earth. Differential settlement is closely
related to subsidence, which is the sudden sinking or gradual downward settling of the
earth’s surface with little or no horizontal movement. Subsidence can be caused by
natural geologic processes or by human activity such as subsurface mining or pumping of
oil or groundwater.

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
Urban and Wildland Fire Hazards
Fires can occur in urban environments and can also
impact unpopulated areas that may contain brush or
grasslands. The central and western portions of
Anaheim are highly urbanized and relatively built out,
and the Hill and Canyon Area is approaching its
buildout potential. As a result, the City must
continue to address the growing need to defend both
persons and property from urban and wildland fires.
In urban areas, the effectiveness of fire protection efforts is based upon several factors,
including the age of structures, efficiency of circulation routes that ultimately affect
response times and availability of water resources to combat fires. In wildland areas,
taking the proper precautions, such as the use of fire resistant building materials, a pro-
active Fire Prevention inspection program, and the development of defensible space
around structures where combustible vegetation is controlled, can protect developed
lands from fires and, therefore, reduce the potential loss of life and property.
Other factors contribute to the severity of fires including weather and winds. Specifically,
winds commonly referred to as Santa Ana winds, which occur during fire season (typically
from June to the first significant rain in November) are particularly significant. Such “fire
weather” is characterized by several days of hot dry weather and high winds, resulting in
low fuel moisture in vegetation.
One of the last major wildland fires in the Hill and Canyon Area was the “Stagecoach
Fire” in 1993, which burned 700 acres. Prior to that, the Gypsum Canyon fire occurred
in 1982 and burned 16,800 acres. In 1967, the Paseo Grande Fire, which began in
Corona, burned through portions of this area, and also burned into the Cities of Irvine,
Orange, and Villa Park. Many homes were lost in that fire and approximately 48,639
acres were burned. In 1948, the Green River fire burned 47,000 acres. This fire history
indicates that wildland fires continue to pose a threat to the Hill and Canyon Area.
The structural fire risk in the Hill and Canyon Area is estimated to be a low
probability/moderate consequence event. This means that relatively few fires occur in
well-maintained communities with a majority of owner-occupied homes having relatively
few occupants compared to the size of the structure. When a fire does occur, it is usually
confined to one room (kitchen or bedroom) and does not spread beyond the structure of
origin.

         Properties within Very High Fire Hazard Severity
         Zones have been identified by the City. As               "

                                                                  High Fire Hazard Severity Zones” refer to
         Severity Zones include the ridgeline areas and           Title 16.40 of the Anaheim Municipal Code.
         undeveloped wildland areas located east of the
         Costa Mesa (SR-55) Freeway and south of the
         Riverside (SR-91) Freeway. In addition, there is a significant amount of undeveloped
         land east of the Eastern Transportation Corridor (SR-241) to the Riverside County line.
         The Anaheim Fire Department has also classified this area as a Very High Fire Hazard
         Severity Zone.
         All other areas within the City located east of the Costa Mesa (SR-55) Freeway, and
         south of the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway, are designated as a Special Protection Area. The
         City provides safeguards to prevent devastation from fires such as routine inspections of
         homes and the surrounding areas.
         The Special Protection Area provisions emphasize the prevention and control of urban/
         wildland interface fires through the enforcement of fire regulations such as the removal of
         combustible vegetation, establishment of wet zones, and preventive building features
         such as spark arrestors on fire places.
         The current vegetation risk in the Special Protection Area is estimated to be a moderate
         probability/high consequence event. The key to effective control of a vegetation fire is a
         rapid response by local fire units and providing defensible spaces for firefighters to fight
         fires. This is especially true during fire season, when fire units may be committed to other
         fires and are unavailable to respond. To ensure adequate fire protection in times of
         major fire events, the City participates in the Standardized Emergency Management
         System (SEMS), which enhances multi-agency coordination for local and regional
         emergencies. Additional information on SEMS is provided in the section on Disaster
         Preparedness, Response and Recovery.
         Following a major earthquake, availability of water may be limited due to breaks in water
         lines caused by fault ruptures, liquefaction, or landslides. Reservoirs such as the Walnut
         Canyon reservoir could be impacted by earthquakes, which could also affect the ability to
         fight fires.
         GOAL 2.1:
         Protect the lives and property of residents, businesses owners, and visitors from the
         hazards of urban and wildland fires.
         Policies:
                   1) Minimize the exposure of residents, business owners, and visitors to the
                       impacts of urban and wildland fires.

        2) Continue to assess the need for additional greenbelts, fuel breaks, fuel
             reduction and buffer zones around communities to minimize potential
             losses.
        3) Maintain a weed abatement program to ensure clearing of dry brush areas.
        4) Continue to classify areas of varying fire hazard severity based upon the
             proximity to open wildland slope, grades, accessibility, water supply and
             building construction features.
        5) Continue to conduct long-range fire safety planning, including enforcement
             of stringent building, fire, subdivision and other Municipal Code standards,
             improved infrastructure, and mutual aid
             agreements with other public agencies and           Defensible space can be created around structures

                  vegetation modification on an ongoing basis within the Special
                  Protection Area.
             •    Develop fuel modification in naturalized canyons and hills to protect life
                  and property from wildland fires, yet leave as much of the surrounding
                  natural vegetation as appropriate.
             •    Require development to use plant materials that are compatible in color
                  and character with surrounding natural vegetation.
             •    Provide wet or irrigated zones when required.
             •    Use selective trimming and obtain permits when necessary in designated
                  areas to preserve environmentally sensitive native plants.

                  11) Continue public education efforts to inform residents, business owners and
                      visitors of fire hazards and measures to minimize the damage caused by fires
                      to life and property.
         Flood & Dam Inundation Hazards
         The potential for flooding is a safety concern
         that Anaheim continues to address. The Federal
         Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
         determined that floods are the most common
         and widespread of all natural disasters, except
         fire. Most communities in the United States
         have experienced some kind of flooding, after
         spring rains, heavy thunderstorms, or winter
         snow thaws.
         Since Anaheim is partially located in an alluvial plain, drainage stemming from the
         mountains to the north and east must cross Anaheim to reach the coast. The Santa Ana
         River flows through the eastern part of the City entering from Riverside County and the
         Prado Flood Control Basin. Drainage through the City is controlled and directed via
         storm drains, channels and the Santa Ana River.

Congress developed the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in 1968 to respond
to the elevating cost of taxpayer-funded disaster relief for flood victims and the increasing
level of damage that was caused by flooding. According to FEMA, approximately
20,000 communities across the United States, including Anaheim, participate in the
NFIP through the adoption and enforcement of floodplain management ordinances.
These ordinances help to reduce future flood damage, and in return, the NFIP makes
Federally-backed flood insurance available to homeowners, renters, and business owners
in participating communities.
Flood inundation resulting from dam failure is a potential hazard for the City. General
limits of flood hazard due to dam failure are shown on Figure S-7, Dam Inundation Map,
for the Walnut Canyon Reservoir, Carbon Canyon Dam and the Prado Dam. Walnut
Canyon Reservoir is located in the Hill and Canyon Area of the City. The reservoir
became operational in 1963, has a capacity of approximately 920 million gallons, and is
man-made with earthen dams.

         The Prado Dam and reservoir are located
         approximately 2.5 miles east of Anaheim in
         Riverside County. The Prado Dam was
         completed in 1941 and was intended to
         provide flood protection to the Lower Santa
         Ana River Basin. The existing 9,000 cubic
         feet per second (cfs) limit on controlled
         releases from the Prado Dam is based upon
         the original non-damaging capacity of the
         downstream channel. When the
         downstream channel improvements that are
         part of the United States Army Corps of
         Engineers' Santa Ana River project are
         completed, the downstream channel capacity       Prado Dam
         will increase dramatically to over 30,000 cfs.   Source: United States Army Corp of Engineers

         Plans are also underway to improve Prado
         Dam to increase its storage and release capacities. These improvements will enable the
         dam to take full advantage of the improved channel capacity downstream and will greatly
         increase the level of flood protection to communities within the Santa Ana River
         floodplain.
         The Carbon Canyon Dam is located three
         quarters of a mile south of Carbon Canyon
         Road (Route 142) and an eighth of a mile
         northeast of Rose Drive in the City of
         Brea. Construction of the dam was
         completed in 1961. Carbon Canyon Dam
         is an earth-filled dam, 2,600 feet in length
         and 99 feet in height, designed to hold
         12,000 acre feet of water, with spillways
         approximately 125 feet in width. The dam
         is owned and operated by the US Army

As indicated in the City’s Emergency Response Plan, should a
breach of Carbon Canyon Dam occur, the water released
would flow in a southerly direction to Carbon Canyon Creek.
The potential flood zone, including the full width of the
alternate flood zone, would be west to Imperial Highway, and
east to Richfield Road and Orangethorpe Avenue. Travel time
would be approximately 15 minutes. The easterly flow would
continue south to SR-91 remaining west of Richfield Road.
The westerly flow would continue between Commonwealth
Avenue on the north and Riverside (SR-91) Freeway on the
south reaching the Orange (SR-57) Freeway in approximately
30 minutes. The inundated area would widen north to
Malvern (Fullerton), west past Beach Boulevard, the flow
westerly between Artesia Boulevard on the north, and SR-91
on the south and empty into Coyote Creek just west of La
Palma. Areas in the City that are potentially affected by a
Carbon Canyon Dam failure appear to be north of SR-91.
Seiche Potential
A seiche is an earthquake generated wave
occurring in an enclosed body of water, such as a
lake, reservoir, or harbor. The period of
oscillation is dependent on the characteristics of
the containing basin’s physical dimensions, such
as surface shape and subsurface geometry.
Oscillation periods may range from a few minutes
to an hour or more. A seiche may be caused by
earthquake ground shaking. The magnitude of a
seiche is related, in part, to the magnitude of the
earthquake. A seiche can result in waves and
flooding to properties along the shores of lakes,
reservoirs, or harbors.                                Anaheim Flood of 1938

The Walnut Canyon Reservoir is an enclosed
body of water in the Hill and Canyon Area, which
could be subject to relatively strong earthquake ground shaking. There is a low to
moderate potential for seiche hazards affecting properties adjacent to the reservoir.
The following policies are intended to reduce the threat of catastrophic flood damage
through aggressive flood mitigation activities.

         Policies:
                  1) Evaluate all development proposals located in areas that are subject to
                      flooding to minimize the exposure of life and property to potential flood
                      risks.
                  2) Provide appropriate land use regulations and site development standards for
                      areas subject to flooding.
                  3) Encourage new development to maintain and enhance existing natural
                      streams, as feasible.
                  4) Continue to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program.

                      Control Board Policies and Best Management Practices (BMPs).
         Hazardous Materials and Waste
         Anaheim has many businesses that manufacture, transport, store, use and dispose of
         hazardous materials. Hundreds of miles of jet fuel lines, oil pipelines, gas lines and water
         mains also traverse the City. The City has, therefore, the potential to be affected by a
         major hazardous material emergency. The facilities depicted in Figure S-8 have the
         potential to create, or be severely impacted by, a hazardous emergency if they are
         damaged or disrupted.
         Hazardous Materials Management Program
         The Environmental Protection Section (EPS) of the Anaheim Fire Department administers
         the hazardous materials management program for the City. The EPS also administers
May 2004                                                          City of Anaheim General Plan | Page S-29
            CITY OF ANAHEIM
the regional hazardous materials response team joint powers agreement under the
Orange County-City Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Authority
(OCCHMERA). The OCCHMERA is comprised of the County of Orange and the Cities
of Anaheim, Huntington Beach, and Santa Ana. The role of the Joint Powers Authority
(JPA) is to provide prompt and efficient response to hazardous material emergencies
throughout Orange County using hazardous materials response teams from these
jurisdictions.
The City is also a Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA). As described by the State
of California, the Unified Program (UP) was created to consolidate, coordinate and make
consistent the administrative requirements, permits, inspections, and enforcement
activities for environmental and emergency management programs.
Hazardous Materials Area Plan
The Anaheim Fire Department has developed the Hazardous Materials Area Plan (Haz
Mat Area Plan) to assist agencies in their pre-emergency planning and their emergency
response role. The Plan also provides the public with information about facilities that
pose a threat or potential hazard to the community’s health and safety. The Haz Mat
Area Plan is designed to assist in the prevention or mitigation of the damage to the
health and safety of persons and the environment from the release or threatened release
of hazardous materials into the workplace or environment.
GOAL 4.1:
Decrease the risk of exposure for life, property and the environment to hazardous
materials and hazardous waste.
Policies:
          1) Follow the response procedures outlined within the Anaheim Fire
              Department’s Hazardous Materials Area Plan in the event of a hazardous
              materials emergency.
          2) Promote the proper handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials
              and hazardous waste.
          3) Encourage businesses to utilize practices and technologies that will reduce
              the generation of hazardous wastes at the source.
          4) Implement Federal, State and local regulations for the disposal, handling,
              and storage of hazardous materials.
          5) Promote the recovery and recycling of hazardous materials.

                  6) Employ effective emergency preparedness and emergency response
                      strategies to minimize the impacts to health and safety that can result from
                      hazardous materials emergencies such as spills or contamination.
                  7) Continually update maps of the City’s emergency facilities, evacuation routes
                      and hazardous areas to reflect additions or modifications.
                  8) Continue to partner with the County of Orange to provide needed programs
                      such as the Regional Household Hazardous Waste Collection Center to
                      provide disposal of household hazards at no cost to Anaheim residents and
                      participating agencies.
         Disaster Preparedness, Response and Recovery
         Advance preparation for potential disasters can prevent severe loss of life and property
         from catastrophic events. The proper preparations improve the City’s ability to respond
         to emergency situations created by catastrophic events.
         Preparation, however, is only the first step in the management of hazards and disasters.
         Once a disaster has occurred, the capability of the City to respond to the situation at
         hand affects how quickly the City can recover from impacts.
         The City of Anaheim has an emerging preparedness plan that complies with State law
         and interfaces with other cities and counties within Southern California. The plan
         outlines the operations that shall be taken in the event of a disaster. It also allows for
         coordination with other agencies in the event that Anaheim is affected by a disaster
         elsewhere. The plan addresses a warning system, emergency broadcast system (EBS),
         Emergency Operations Center (EOC), and shelter system. The plan provides a
         foundation to conduct operations and coordinate the management of critical resources
         during emergencies. It also provides the framework for which non-governmental
         agencies and organizations that have resources needed to meet emergency requirements
         are integrated into the program.
         The City of Anaheim also participates in the Standardized Emergency Management
         System (SEMS). The Governor’s Office of Emergency Services administers SEMS and
         coordinates multi-agency responses to disasters. SEMS is required by the California
         Government Code and was developed to provide a “common language” for emergency
         response personnel to request resources and equipment from other agencies. In
         addition to resource allocation, SEMS was established to minimize the duplication of
         efforts during emergency response by defining common tactics and identifying a clear
         chain of command. The SEMS program is developed to respond to incidents as they
         occur, and does not provide long-term recovery guidelines.

             CITY OF ANAHEIM
GOAL 5.1:
Minimize the risk to life and property through emergency preparedness and public
awareness.
Policies:
           1) Ensure the availability of both the Safety Element and City emergency
                preparedness plans to employers and residents of Anaheim.
           2) Coordinate disaster preparedness and recovery with other governmental
                agencies.
           3) Evaluate the adequacy of access routes to and from hazard areas relative to
                the degree of development or use (e.g. road width, road type, length of
                dead-end roads, etc.).
           4) Assess the potential for disruption to evacuation routes from landslide
                movement, fault ruptures, and failures caused by earthquakes.
           5) Appropriately locate and coordinate emergency services including fire,
                police, and ambulance services.
           6) Continue to conduct public outreach efforts to prepare the community and
                provide them with guidance on how to respond to natural disasters.
           7) Train multi-lingual personnel to assist in evacuation and other emergency
                response activities to meet the community need.
           8) Apply the procedures outlined in the Homeland Security Advisory System
                (HSAS) to prepare the City to respond to terrorist attacks.
           9) Continue to evaluate and practice preparedness through Emergency
                Operations Center (EOC) exercises.

         INTRODUCTION
         A        n efficient and effective circulation system is a fundamental need of the City and
                  its residents, businesses and visitors. Anaheim’s transportation infrastructure
                  affects the City’s quality of life in a variety of ways.
         As the County’s second largest city and home to several world-class and regional tourist
         destinations, Anaheim serves the mobility needs of over 330,000 residents and
         accommodates traffic from millions of visitors every year. The City also serves as a
         regional hub that is traversed by one interstate freeway, five State highways, two toll
         roads, two commuter rail and intercity passenger and freight rail lines. This important
         regional setting requires that the City coordinate its circulation system with State, county
         and regional transportation plans.
         ACHIEVING THE VISION
         The Circulation Element is more than the description of a transportation system – it is an
         infrastructure plan that addresses the mobility of people, goods and services, energy,
         water, sewage, storm drainage, and communications. It affects land use patterns, air
         quality, open space, habitat planning, noise, energy use, and community appearance.
         The major purpose of the Element is to design and improve a circulation system to meet
         the current and future needs of all Anaheim residents, businesses and visitors. Such a
         system should have the following four components: equity, effectiveness, efficiency and
         foresight. It should be equitable by being accessible to all economic segments of the
         City to make everyone’s lives more convenient. The system must be effective if it is to
         carry out the goals of this Element. It should be efficient by making use of existing
         infrastructure wherever practical. Finally, it should have the foresight to accommodate
         future growth and preserve important transportation routes for future planning needs.
         The Circulation Element helps achieve the Anaheim Vision by:
                 Facilitating the design and operation of arterial streets;
                 Encouraging the use of mass transit with multiple modes;
May 2004                                                               City of Anaheim General Plan | Page C-1

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
        Encouraging traffic calming strategies that enhance pedestrian safety and
         increase the livability of neighborhoods;
        Identifying linkages of bicycle and pedestrian paths in proximity to residential,
         commercial, civic, educational, recreational and institutional uses; and
        Providing for the efficient mobility of people and goods.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
State planning law not only requires that a General Plan include a Circulation Element, it
mandates that it be directly correlated to the Land Use Element. The relationship
between the Circulation and Land Use Elements is one of the most critical – the
circulation system must be able to accommodate the traffic that is generated by the
City’s Land Use Plan. The Growth Management and Public Services and Facilities
Elements are also tied to Circulation and Land Use; the policies identified in these four
Elements work together to ensure that the provision of City services and infrastructure
keeps pace with new development and subsequent changes in population and
employment. In addition, the Circulation Element is directly linked to the Economic
Development Element since the efficient movement of employees, visitors, residents and
goods throughout the City is a critical factor to strengthening Anaheim's economy.
Circulation is also linked to the Community Design Element because of its direct effect
on the City’s image and character and it is also closely related to the Noise Element
because of the potential noise impacts that can be created by many forms of
transportation.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PROGRAMS
The Circulation Element must be consistent with County and regional transportation
plans. In addition to the Orange County Congestion Management Program (CMP) and
the Orange County Transportation Authority Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH)
discussed later in this Element, circulation is also related to the Southern California
Association of Government’s (SCAG) Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and the long-
range transportation plan for Orange County, prepared by the Orange County
Transportation Authority (OCTA).
SCAG is the region’s Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) and is responsible for
establishing the overall long-term mobility policies for the movement of people and
goods in Southern California. These policies are presented in SCAG’s Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP). In order for local projects to receive State or Federal
funding, they must be consistent with the RTP.
OCTA is the County Transportation Commission (CTC) for Orange County and plans,
funds and operates transportation projects and services for the County. As the CTC, the
OCTA is responsible for producing the Long-Range Transportation Plan for the County.
Projects and programs in OCTA’s Plan are incorporated in SCAG’s RTP, making State
Page C-2 | May 2004

         and Federal funding available and resulting in consistent planning at the County,
         regional, and statewide levels.
         OCTA’s long-range transportation plan is developed in three tiers. Tier 1 is the baseline
         scenario, which includes only projects that have already been approved and are being
         implemented. Tier 2 is the “Balanced Plan,” which includes all projects in the baseline
         scenario plus other improvements that are reasonably expected to be fundable. Tier 3
         includes a needs-based element and is unconstrained by funding expectations. As the
         “Balanced Plan” considers funding expectations and includes projects that are likely to be
         constructed or implemented, this plan was utilized in the development of the Circulation
         Element to ensure consistency with regional circulation plans.

         GOALS AND POLICIES
         T       he following section identifies critical transportation issues and circulation
                 components, maps the various circulation network components, and provides
                 goals and policies that support the City’s vision of an efficient transportation
         system that serves all of Anaheim’s residents, businesses and visitors.
         Future Roadway System
         The Planned Roadway Network map, shown in Figure C-1, identifies the roadway system
         that is planned to accommodate current development and future growth established by
         the Land Use Element and necessary to maintain appropriate levels of service. It is
         important to note that the local street system, which generally serves residential
         neighborhoods and industrial areas, is not a part of or reflected in the Planned Roadway
         System map.
         Arterial Streets
         The streets reflected on the Planned Roadway Network map are classified as scenic
         expressways, smartstreets, major arterials, primary arterials, secondary arterials, and
         collector streets. These classifications are consistent with those of the OCTA Master
         Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH). The street classifications shown on the map reflect
         the planned classifications, not necessarily existing conditions. A brief description of
         each of the roadway classifications is provided below. It is important to note that there
         are some exceptions to each classification and that individual streets may have modified
         standards, as identified in the Right-of-way Exceptions Map, maintained by the Public
         Works Department, Development Services Division.
            Scenic Expressway: Divided roadways that have restricted access, serve intercity
             traffic, and provide scenic vistas. This four to six lane divided facility has a right-of -
             way that varies from a width of 106 to 148 feet. Weir Canyon and portions of Santa
             Ana Canyon Roads are both scenic expressways. In 1966, the City Council adopted
             the Santa Ana Canyon Road Access Points Map, shown in Figure C-2, limiting
May 2004                                                            City of Anaheim General Plan | Page C-5

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
    access on Santa Ana Canyon Road from Cerro Vista Road east to Weir Canyon
    Road.
   Resort Smartstreet: Divided roadways that are six or eight lanes with a typical right-
    of-way width of 120 to 166 feet. Smartstreets improve roadway traffic capacity
    through a variety of measures such as traffic signal synchronization, bus turnouts,

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
As part of the proposed SR-91 Widening Project, one general purpose lane will be
added in each direction on the SR-91, east of SR-55 to the Riverside County line. In
addition, a four to six lane elevated freeway is proposed over the SR-91 median between
SR-241 and I-15. Also proposed, potentially on a shared structure with the elevated
freeway, is the Anaheim to Ontario International Airport segment of the California-
Nevada Interstate Mag-Lev Project. It would provide reliable 15-minute travel times
between Angel Stadium and Ontario International Airport. The SR-91 Chokepoint
Project is planned to address the congestion resulting from vehicles traveling north on
the Eastern Toll Road (SR-241) not being able to enter SR-91, most notably in the
eastbound direction. This project will add auxiliary lanes on the Riverside Freeway
between SR-241 in Orange County and the Chino Valley (SR-71) Freeway in Riverside
County. The additions are intended to reduce congestion and delays occurring between
these two junctions and increase the effectiveness of the toll road.
The Costa Mesa (SR-55) Freeway is a north-south freeway, which terminates at the
Riverside Freeway within the City limits of Anaheim. The facility provides five lanes in
each direction, which are generally composed of eight mixed flow lanes and two HOV
lanes. The SR-55 facilitates regional access to the central coastal communities of Orange
County. The only interchange that serves Anaheim is Lincoln Avenue/Nohl Ranch Road.
Beach Boulevard (SR -39) is a State Route beginning at Pacific Coast Highway traveling
into Los Angeles County. This eight lane, divided arterial links Anaheim with the cities of
Huntington Beach, Westminster, Garden Grove, Stanton, Buena Park, and La Habra.
Imperial Highway is a State Route terminating at the Riverside Freeway. The portion of
Imperial Highway (SR-90) south of Orangethorpe Avenue is generally a five to six lane,
divided major arterial. It is a grade-separated highway between Orangethorpe Avenue
and Yorba Linda Boulevard.
91 Express Lanes
The 91 Express Lanes were created as a privately financed, fully automated four-lane
facility with the first variable congestion pricing system in the United States. OCTA has
since purchased and now operates these lanes. The Express lanes run in the median
lanes of SR-91 from SR-55 to the Riverside County line and consist of two lanes in each
direction. Toll costs vary to optimize traffic flow, and are typically higher during peak
hours to manage their use and maintain reliable travel times through this 10-mile
segment of congested freeway.
Eastern Transportation Corridor
In 1986, two joint powers agencies, the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency
and the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency (collectively known as the
TCA), were formed to finance and construct toll roads in Orange County. The Eastern
Transportation Corridor (SR-241) was built by this agency, connecting Eastern Anaheim

         and the Riverside Freeway with Rancho Santa Margarita at its southern terminus. The
         SR-241 also connects with other toll roads operated by the TCA, including the SR-261,
         terminating in Tustin and the SR-133, terminating in Irvine after connecting with I-5 and
         I-405 in Southern Orange County.

              Federal Transit Administration to address traffic flow along State highways
              that traverse the City.
          2) Discourage Riverside (SR-91) Freeway bypass traffic through the Hill and
              Canyon Area by working with Caltrans and OCTA to improve traffic flow on
              SR-91.
          3) Work with Caltrans to identify needed improvements to its facilities in the
              City as necessary.
          4) Work with Caltrans and adjacent jurisdictions to improve the operational
              performance of highways within and adjacent to the City.
          5) Work with Caltrans in analyzing the performance of freeway interchanges
              located in the City and seek appropriate improvements.
Level of Service (LOS) Analysis
An important standard referred to throughout this Element relates to the ability of a
roadway and/or intersection to accommodate traffic. This level of service standard may
be used to describe both existing and future traffic conditions. Level of service (LOS) is
a qualitative ranking that characterizes traffic congestion on a report card scale of A to F
with LOS A being a free-flow condition and LOS F representing extreme congestion. In
addition to the LOS definition, a traffic volume to capacity ratio (V/C ratio) is used to
provide a more quantified description of traffic conditions at intersections. This section
includes a discussion of level of service analysis for the a.m. and p.m. peak hours at key
intersections in the City.
In traffic studies, the Intersection Capacity Utilization

                                                  This Circulation Element establishes that the LOS
         should be LOS D or better for major intersections in the City. The Congestion
         Management Program (CMP) establishes that the LOS should be LOS E or better for
         CMP roadways and intersections.

                               Levels of Service Definitions
The V/C ratio can also be related to LOS definitions. For example, an intersection with a
V/C ratio exceeding 0.95 is handling traffic volumes that approach design capacity. The
V/C ratio of 0.95 corresponds to LOS E, which indicates an unacceptable level of service
at that particular intersection. The following six levels of service definitions relate traffic
conditions to traffic volumes and the design capacity of roadways and/or intersections.
LOS A (V/C ratio 0.0 - 0.60): There are no signal cycles that are fully loaded, and few are
even close to loaded. No approach phase is fully utilized by traffic and no vehicle waits
longer than one red indication. Typically, the approach appears quite open, turning
movements are easily made, and nearly all drivers find freedom of operation.
LOS B (V/C ratio 0.61 - 0.70): Stable operation is maintained. An occasional approach
phase is fully utilized and a substantial number are approaching full use. Many drivers
begin to feel somewhat restricted within groups of vehicles.
LOS C (V/C ratio 0.71 - 0.80): Stable operation continues. Full signal cycle loading is
still intermittent, but more frequent. Occasionally, drivers may have to wait through
more than one red signal indication, and backups may develop behind turning vehicles.
LOS D (V/C ratio 0.81 - 0.90): Encompasses a zone of increasing restriction approaching
instability. Delays to approaching vehicles may be substantial during short peaks within
the peak period, but enough cycles with lower demand occur to permit periodic
clearance of developing queues, thus preventing excessive backups.
LOS E (V/C ratio 0.91 - 1.00): Represents the most vehicles that any particular
intersection approach can accommodate. At capacity (V/C = 1.00), there may be long
queues of vehicles waiting upstream of the intersection and delays may be great (up to
several signal cycles).
LOS F (V/C ratio > 1.00): Represents jammed conditions. Backups from locations
downstream or on the cross street may restrict or prevent movement of vehicles out of
the approach under consideration; hence, volumes carried are not predictable. V/C
values are highly variable, because full utilization of the approach may be prevented by
outside conditions.

         Future Level of Service
         In order to understand the impacts of the General Plan Land Use Plan (see Land Use
         Element, Figure LU-4), a traffic analysis was performed to determine intersections that
         are projected to operate at an unacceptable level of service at theoretical buildout. The
         analysis also identifies a preliminary set of measures designed to decrease the congestion
         at those intersections. The traffic analysis includes all roadway and intersection
         improvements that correspond with buildout of the City's Planned Roadway Network
         (Figure C-1), and other improvements that will either mitigate each intersection to an
         acceptable level of service or will widen the intersection to its maximum feasible
         configuration. The maximum feasible configuration for an approach on a major arterial
         highway typically includes dual left-turn lanes, two or three through lanes and an

exclusive right-turn lane. The maximum feasible for an approach on a primary arterial
highway typically includes dual left-turn lanes, two or three through lanes and an
exclusive right-turn lane.
Future Peak Hour Conditions
Peak Hour Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) analysis of the Land Use Plan (see
Land Use Element, Figure LU-4) identified the following intersections that do not meet a
minimum LOS D with buildout of the Planned Roadway Network:
    Dale Street/Lincoln Avenue
    Harbor Boulevard/Ball Road
    Sportstown/Katella Avenue
    Tustin Avenue/La Palma Avenue
    Tustin Avenue/Riverside (SR-91) Freeway Westbound Ramps
    Imperial Highway/Santa Ana Canyon Road
    Weir Canyon Road/Riverside (SR-91) Freeway Eastbound Ramps
Adjustments in intersection lane geometry enable many of the intersections to function
more efficiently and raise deficient LOS grades to acceptable levels. However, one
intersection may be unable to be mitigated to acceptable levels through the maximum
feasible configuration lane geometry adjustments set forth above:
    Harbor Boulevard/Ball Road
This intersection could be improved with extraordinary improvements, including triple
left lanes or additional through lanes. It is important to note, however, that these
improvements may require additional right-of-way acquisition that could impact existing
adjacent land uses beyond what would occur through the maximum feasible
configuration.
The results of the LOS analysis reflect a theoretical buildout scenario, with only modest
reduction in peak travel demands due to TDM strategies. The following goals and
policies address mitigation of traffic impacts, land use balance, transportation demand
management, advanced transportation technology, and enhanced modal choice which, if
implemented, will improve future conditions by reducing vehicle demands and optimizing
circulation system efficiency.

             Speed Rail, Bus Rapid Transit and ARTIC.
System Maintenance
A well-planned, designed, constructed, maintained and operated street and highway
system facilitates the movement of vehicles and provides safe and convenient access to
various areas of the City. Roadways also need to be built with sufficient capacity to
accommodate long-term growth. Maintenance of mobility, safety and access are all
issues that must be considered when operating a roadway system.
GOAL 3.1:
Provide a well-maintained street system.
Policies:
         1) Maintain the street network in optimal functioning condition.

                       roadways are improved.
                   6) Give additional maintenance priority to streets with bike lanes or bike routes.
         State-Designated Scenic Highways
         The intent of the California Scenic Highway program is to enhance the State’s natural
         beauty and protect California’s economic and social resources. Scenic Highways are
         transportation corridors where visual intrusions would impact views of natural beauty
         from the highway. The Riverside (SR-91) Freeway, between SR-55 and Weir Canyon
         Road is officially designated as a Scenic Highway.
         The portion of SR-91 east of Weir Canyon is designated as an eligible Scenic Highway.
         State highways nominated for scenic designation must be included on the list of highways
         eligible for scenic designation in the State Scenic Highway System. Scenic highway
         nominations are evaluated using the following qualifications:
             The proposed scenic highway is principally within an unspoiled native habitat and
              showcases the unique aspects of the landscape.
             Existing visual intrusions do not significantly impact the scenic corridor.
             Strong local support for the proposed scenic highway designation is demonstrated.
             The length of the proposed scenic highway is not short or segmented.
         After it is determined a proposed scenic highway satisfies these qualifications, the local
         jurisdiction, with support of its citizens, must adopt a program to protect the scenic
         corridor. Figure C-3, Scenic Highways, shows the location of the Scenic Highway located
         in Anaheim.
         GOAL 4.1
         Preserve and enhance uniquely scenic or special visual resource areas along highways
         and designated State scenic routes for the enjoyment of all travelers.
         Policies:
                   1) Continue to work with Caltrans in its implementation of the State Scenic
                       Highway Program. Ensure the preservation and enhancement of scenic
                       routes through special highway design and building regulation.

        2) Consider the unique natural features of the Hill and Canyon Area when
            arterial streets and highways are improved or constructed.
        3) Landscape arterial highways in keeping with the intent of the Scenic Corridor
            Overlay Zone and the Santa Ana River Greenbelt Plan, and maintain the
            residential character of the neighborhood by avoiding interference and
            intrusion into adjacent communities.

         Transit
         The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) provides an extensive network of
         fixed-route transit service in Anaheim. In addition to the many bus routes that directly
         serve the City, many routes also traverse the periphery of the City. OCTA also operates
         three Stationlink routes in the City that provide bus connections between rail stations and
         major employment centers and residential areas. Figure C-4, Existing and Planned Bus
         Routes, reflects existing and planned bus routes in Anaheim.
         OCTA also offers several types of special needs service in addition to the fixed route
         transit service. Access Service provides demand-responsive service to the disabled with
         door-to-door travel anywhere in the County. Access service includes advance request
         service that requires one to fourteen-days notice and subscription service that covers
         pre-scheduled recurring trips. OCTA Access also provides backup service for urgent,
         unplanned medical appointments for the disabled.
         OCTA plans to implement a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) program in Orange County. BRT
         combines communications technology, traffic signal priority, specifically designed
         vehicles, rapid fare collection, and rail style stations to create a system that exhibits the
         flexibility of buses with features more typical of rail transit. A BRT demonstration project
         on Harbor Boulevard is expected to be completed first. Additional, BRT lines on Katella
         Avenue, State College Boulevard La Palma Avenue, and Beach Boulevard are planned
         following the completion of the demonstration project. These BRT routes are expected
         to improve travel time for transit users by up to 50% over existing bus service.
         As the number of trips between Orange and Riverside Counties is forecast to double
         over the next twenty years, OCTA is planning an express bus service along the Riverside
         (SR-91) Freeway corridor to accommodate the increases in travel demand. OCTA has
         worked with the Riverside Transit Agency and the Riverside County Transportation

Commission to develop a demonstration schedule for this project. The plan proposes
that eight routes originate in Riverside County and travel to major employment centers in
Orange County, including The Anaheim Canyon Business Center and The Anaheim
Resort. It is expected that an express bus will be crossing the County line along the
corridor every 7.5 minutes during peak hours when the eight proposed lines are
operating.
OCTA’s 10-year transit plan is also reflected in Figure C-4. New routes are planned for
Nohl Ranch Road and Santa Ana Canyon Road, helping to fill the transit needs of eastern
Anaheim.

         Passenger and Commuter Rail
         Travelers in Anaheim are served by two types of railroad operations – passenger rail and
         commuter rail. Commuter rail service, Metrolink, is provided by the Southern California
         Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA) and OCTA. Passenger rail service is provided by
         Amtrak.
         Passenger Rail
         Amtrak operates the Pacific Surfliner passenger train line from San Diego to San Luis
         Obispo, connecting many cities along California’s southern coast. Amtrak operates nine
         passenger trains daily in each direction along this route, providing fifteen roundtrips
         stopping at the Anaheim Station, which is just north of Angel Stadium of Anaheim. Five
         of these trains travel the length of the route, from San Diego to San Luis Obispo, while
         the remaining lines travel as far north as Downtown Los Angeles.
         Commuter Rail
         Commuter rail is a mode of inter-city travel that primarily transports people during the
         peak hours to major employment centers. As a result, it typically carries long-distance
         trips, serves stations that are several miles apart, and has high average operating speeds.
         Metrolink operates six commuter rail lines throughout Southern California, three of
         which serve the City of Anaheim. The Orange County Line, linking Downtown Los
         Angeles and Oceanside, provides commuter rail service to the Anaheim Station.
         Commuters can transfer to the 91 Line at the Fullerton Station, one stop north of the
         Anaheim station, to travel east to Riverside County or transfer to the Inland Empire-
         Orange County Line at the Orange Station, one stop south of the Anaheim Station, to
         travel to San Bernardino County. Commuters can also directly access the inter-county
         Inland Empire-Orange County Line at the Anaheim Canyon Station, which is adjacent to
         Tustin Avenue, between the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway and La Palma Avenue.
         Ridership in Fiscal Year 2001 to 2002 was 1,427,000 for the Orange County Line with
         nineteen daily trips. Current plans for future commuter rail in Orange County involve
         adding service to the existing Metrolink lines, with an expected thirty daily trips operating
         in 2020 on the Orange County Line. The Inland Empire-Orange County Line and 91
         Line are each projected to increase from nine daily trips in 2002 to twenty-one in 2020.
         The Balanced Plan, contains plans for 15-minute headways on the Orange County Line
         and 30-minute headways on the Inland Empire-Orange County Line, plus increased rail
         feeder bus service.

International Airport.
California High Speed Rail System
Established in 1996, the California High-Speed Rail Authority is charged with the
planning, designing, constructing and operating a state of the art high-speed train
system.
The proposed system stretches from San Francisco, Oakland and Sacramento in the
north -- with service to the Central Valley -- to Los Angeles and San Diego in the south,
with a proposed stop in Anaheim. With bullet trains operating at speeds up to 220
mph, the express travel time from downtown San Francisco to Los Angeles is just under
2 ½ hours. Intercity travelers (trips between metropolitan regions) along with longer-
distance commuters would enjoy the benefits of a system designed to connect with
existing rail, and to reduce aviation and highway system infrastructure demands.
Intermodal Transportation Center
Anaheim is currently seeking funding for a major intermodal transportation center in The
Platinum Triangle. The transportation center would be one of three major transportation
centers located in Southern California, along with Union Station in Los Angeles and the
Ontario International Airport in the City of Ontario. The center would expand existing
transportation infrastructure for Amtrak intercity rail, Metrolink commuter rail, Anaheim
Resort Transit shuttle service, and vehicular and bicycle modes. Six planned rail and bus
services would be added into the hub, providing seamless intermodal access to the
planned California-Nevada Super Speed Train, California High Speed Rail, Express Bus
and Bus Rapid Transit.
The intermodal transportation center would fit into the urban, mixed-use fabric planned
for The Platinum Triangle, providing a multitude of transportation options for residents,
employees and visitors of The Platinum Triangle and The Anaheim Resort.

         GOAL 6.1:
         Support the development of mass transit to enhance modal choice.
         Policies:
                  1) Support efforts to enhance intercity and commuter rail systems and services.
                  2) Pursue the development of multi-modal transit opportunities in The Platinum
                       Triangle, including the development of an Intermodal Transportation Center.
                  3) Participate in and support further study of regional and interstate rail
                       projects.
                  4) Participate in and support the California-Nevada High Speed Rail planning
                       effort.
                  5) Participate in passenger rail planning efforts.
         Bikeways
         The City of Anaheim currently has three classifications of bikeways, Class I, Class II, and
         Class III. Class I Bikeways provide for bicycle travel on right-of-way completely
         separated from the street. Class II Bikeways provide striped and signed lanes within the
         street right-of-way. Class III Bikeways are commonly signed only bike routes. Figure C-
         5, Bikeways, shows existing and planned bicycle routes. The Santa Ana River Trail is
         classified as a Class I Bikeway and connects with Orange County’s riding and hiking trails
         following the western flank of the river as it moves south to the ocean in Huntington
         Beach.
         As opportunities for acquiring lands for bikeways and recreational resources in the City
         are limited, the City will continue to look for new ways to provide more links from
         surrounding development to existing bikeways. Areas such as utility easements and
         public rights of way along flood control channels and rail lines provide alternatives to
         streets while planning new bikeways.
         Proposed Class II bikeways will require on-street parking removal. These bikeways would
         provide connections between the existing facilities and would provide greater access in
         the City.
         GOAL 7.1:
         Protect and encourage bicycle travel.
         Policies:
                  1) Provide safe, direct, and continuous bicycle routes for commuter and
                       recreational cyclists.

        2) Incorporate bicycle planning into the traditional transportation and roadway
            maintenance planning process.
        3) Support and implement bicycle routes that minimize cyclist/motorist
            conflicts.
        4) Support roadway design policies that promote attractive circulation corridors
            and safe and pleasant traveling experiences for bicyclists.
        5) Support OCTA’s program to provide bike racks on transit buses.
        6) Implement a bikeway system with linkages to routes in neighboring
            jurisdictions and regional bicycle routes.
        7) Maximize the use of easements and public rights-of-way along flood
            channels, utility corridors, rail lines and streets for bicycle and pedestrian
            paths.
        8) Connect Downtown with The Platinum Triangle for pedestrian, bicycle,
            and/or transit users.
        9) Require that new streets or developments contain adequate right of way for
            bicycle lanes, where appropriate.
        10) Where space and appropriate roadway conditions currently exist, continue to

                                                              CIRCULATION ELEMENT
         Pedestrians
         Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, trails, walkways, bridges, crosswalks, signals,
         illumination, and benches, among others. These facilities are an important part of
         Anaheim’s non-motorized transportation network. Pedestrian facilities provide a vital
         link between many other modes of travel and can make up a considerable portion of
         short-range trips made in the community. Where such facilities exist, people will be
         much more likely to make shorter trips by walking rather than by automobile. Pedestrian
         facilities also provide a vital link for commuters who use other transportation facilities
         such as buses and park and ride lots as well as those who utilize the City’s recreational
         facilities and attend City schools.
         Pedestrian circulation is accommodated by the provision of sidewalks within streets
         rights-of-way and Class 1 Bikeway rights-of-way.
         Intermodal Linkages
         The success of the City’s pedestrian, transit, and bicycle facilities relies heavily upon the
         ability of the general population to access them. Linkages between these facilities can
         foster the creation of a system that works with great synergy and could ultimately help
         alleviate the general population’s reliance upon the automobile as their primary source of
         transportation. In addition to the potential reduction in traffic that these linkages would
         encourage, the linkages could provide another option to Anaheim residents, businesses
         and visitors to navigate through the City along such linkages rather than utilizing the
         established roadway network.
         GOAL 8.1:
         Protect and encourage pedestrian travel.
         Policies:
                   1) Encourage and improve pedestrian facilities that link development to the
                        circulation network and that serve as a transition between other modes of
                        travel.
                   2) Improve pedestrian and bicycle connections from residential neighborhoods
                        to retail activity centers, employment centers, schools, parks, open space
                        areas and community centers.
                   3) Encourage barrier free accessibility for all handicapped residents, employees
                        and visitors throughout the City’s circulation system.
                   4) Support the planning of sidewalks of appropriate width to allow the provision
                        of buffers to shield non-motorized traffic from vehicles.

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
         5) Add raised, landscaped medians and bulbouts, where appropriate, to reduce
              exposure to cross traffic at street crossings.
         6) When appropriate, walkways should include pedestrian amenities such as
              shade trees and/or plantings, trash bins, benches, shelters, and directional
              kiosks.
         7) Ensure that streets and intersections are designed to provide visibility and
              safety for pedestrians.
         8) Improve pedestrian amenities adjacent to Metrolink and Amtrak stations.
         9) Enhance and encourage pedestrian amenities and recreation, retail and
              employment opportunities in mixed-use areas to enhance non-motorized
              transportation.
         10) Require commercial developments to provide specific pedestrian access
              points independent from auto entrances.
         11) Coordinate with appropriate agencies to ensure that transit stops are
              accessible to pedestrians.
Commuter Services
The City of Anaheim established the Commuter Services Office as a part of the Public
Works Department in 1989 to help meet Federal and State Clean Air Act requirements.
In an effort to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality, the Commuter Services
Office offers a wide variety of information for City of Anaheim employees interested in
bicycling, carpooling, vanpooling, public transit and rail transportation. Non-employees
that are willing to use designated routes may be able to use vanpooling services.
Park-and-Ride Facilities
There are four park-and-ride facilities for those who carpool or use public transportation
to reach their destination. Two park-and-ride facilities located adjacent to Metrolink
Stations serve rail commuters only. The Anaheim Stadium Station lot has 400 spaces
and the Anaheim Canyon Station lot has 100 spaces. Both Metrolink lots are heavily
used. The two other park-and-ride lots – the 50-space lot near Kraemer Boulevard and
La Palma Avenue and 40-space lot near State College Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue –
experience less usage.
Vanpooling
Anaheim Commuter Services offers a vanpooling program with eleven routes to and from
inland cities during the morning and evening commute. Participants in the program have

         the option of joining as part-time or full-time riders and pay rates related to distance
         traveled.
         GOAL 9.1:
         Provide carpooling and vanpooling opportunities for commuters.
         Policies:
                  1) Continue to encourage carpooling by promoting park-and-ride facilities.
                  2) Continue to encourage vanpooling for City residents and workers.
                  3) Participate in OCTA’s Rideshare program.
                  4) Cooperate with public or private providers of vanpool services and publicize
                       vanpool options to residents.
         Goods Movement
         Truck Routes
         Truck routes not only allow truck traffic to flow efficiently, they also minimize the
         possible exposure of people in sensitive areas, such as residential neighborhoods and
         schools, to safety and mobility impacts involving trucks or high noise levels that can be
         generated by truck traffic. In addition, the maintenance of roadways to preserve
         mobility, safety, efficiency and convenience on roadways within the City is also affected
         by the frequency of truck trips made on specific routes. Directing truck traffic to
         specially designated truck routes minimizes impacts that could occur on local roadways.
         Figure C-6 maps truck routes in Anaheim.
         GOAL 10.1:
         Facilitate safe surface truck movement while minimizing the impact of truck traffic on
         residential streets.
         Policies:
                  1) Monitor truck traffic to ensure that street restrictions are met and truck
                       routes can be enforced.
                  2) Reexamine truck routes as needed to ensure the safety of residents,
                       neighborhoods, pedestrians, cyclists, and other motorists.
                  3) Require sufficient on-site loading to minimize interference with traffic
                       circulation.
                  4) Restrict heavy vehicles from entering the immediate vicinity of school and
                       other institutions to minimize noise and safety impacts.

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
Freight Rail
Freight operators are the largest users of Anaheim’s current rail facilities. Burlington
Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (SPTC)
provide freight rail services in Anaheim. BNSF operates intermodal, carload freight, and
bulk unit trains through the City, with two spur lines serving industrial areas in Anaheim.
The major origins and destinations for freight moved by BNSF are San Diego and Los
Angeles. The SPTC operates the Santa Ana and West Santa Ana branches running
through the City.
Freight train movements are expected to increase on rail lines through Anaheim, with an
expected increase from 50 to 70 trains per day to 135 to 150 trains daily on BNSF’s
main transcontinental line, which runs through northern segments of the City. The
Orange North-American Trade Rail Access Corridor Authority (ONTRAC), part of the
Orange County Gateway project, will grade separate the BNSF main line in northern
Orange County. The project was developed to eliminate traffic conflicts at eleven at-
grade crossings, increase safety at rail crossings, and provide congestion relief.
The approximately seventy railroad crossings at arterial and local streets within the City
are mostly at-grade.
GOAL 10.2:
Facilitate safe rail freight movement while minimizing impacts on residents and motorists.
Policies:
         1) Support a system of freight movement that minimizes conflicts with street
              circulation.
         2) Support grade separations for major arterials at rail crossings.

                                                             CIRCULATION ELEMENT
         Aviation and Heliport Facilities
         Access to aviation facilities and services that meet the needs of Anaheim residents is also
         an important component of the City’s circulation system. Anaheim accounts for one-
         third of all aviation demand generated by Orange County. Major commercial airports that
         are used for passenger service by Anaheim residents include John Wayne Airport, Los
         Angeles International Airport, Long Beach Airport and Ontario International Airport.
         The primary local general aviation facility that serves Anaheim is Fullerton Municipal
         Airport.
         The Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) of Orange County assists local agencies to
         ensure that there are no direct conflicts with land uses, noise, or other issues that would
         impact the functionality and safety of airport and heliport operations. The ALUC requires
         that local jurisdictions’ general plans and zoning ordinances are consistent with Airport
         Environs Land Use Plans (AELUP’s ), which contain noise contours, restrictions for types
         of construction and building heights in navigable air space, as well as requirements
         impacting the establishment or construction of sensitive uses within close proximity to
         airports.
         Two AELUP planning areas extend within City boundaries in West Anaheim. Fullerton
         Municipal Airport and Los Alamitos Joint Training Base, located northwest and
         southwest of the City, respectively, are regulated by AELUP’s. In addition, the ALUC
         has established an AELUP that addresses heliport operations within cities and counties,
         which is applicable to the City of Anaheim.
         GOAL 11.1:
         Support the safe operation of aviation and heliport facilities within and in proximity to the
         City.
                  1) Ensure that reliable travel times and mode choices are provided to connect
                       Anaheim residents and businesses with aviation facilities.
                  2) Ensure that private heliports and adjacent developments are reviewed and
                       constructed in compliance with the Airport Environs Land Use Plan for
                       Heliports adopted by the Airport Land Use Commission.
                  3) Implement and maintain appropriate policies identified in the Airport
                       Environs Land Use Plan for Joint Forces Training Base Los Alamitos and
                       Fullerton Municipal Airport adopted by the Airport Land Use Commission,
                       which addresses compatible land use designations, noise issues,
                       environmental impacts and safety considerations within and adjacent to the
                       airport facility.

             CITY OF ANAHEIM
           4) Ensure that all new projects are developed in compliance with FAA
                requirements and the California Airport Land Use Planning Handbook
                developed by the State of California Department of Transportation, Division
                of Aeronautics.
Parking
Typically, on-street parking in Anaheim is permitted on secondary and local streets
unless specifically prohibited. Off-street parking requirements for various land uses are
provided in the City Zoning Code.
Parking areas are essential facilities for most types of uses. Unfortunately, the amount of
land devoted to parking can inhibit pedestrian orientation and detract from the aesthetics
of urban areas, especially if parking lots are poorly designed or situated. Parking
structures and shared parking associated with higher density mixed-use and multi use
projects can improve vehicular circulation while utilizing the land more efficiently. When
designed appropriately, parking structures are less intrusive than surface parking lots and
can lead to the development of aesthetically pleasant parking areas that are integrated
into the urban fabric.
GOAL 12.1:
Ensure adequate parking is made available to City residents, visitors, and businesses.
Policies:
           1) Assess the adequacy of existing or proposed on- and off-street parking as
                needed, especially in urban and commercial areas, to ensure that an
                adequate supply is provided.
           2) Explore strategies for the management of parking supply, which can include
                parking fees, metered on-street parking, and staggered work schedules.
           3) Develop strategies for the control of parking demand such as improved
                transit service, amenities for bicyclists, and rideshare vehicles.
           4) Develop strategies for shared parking opportunities in mixed-use and
                multiple-use development.
           5) Encourage the use of well-designed, aesthetically-enhanced parking
                structures as an alternative to large, expansive surface parking lots.
           6) Encourage businesses to provide bicycle parking facilities such as bike racks
                and lockers to promote bicycling.

         Introduction:
         The Greening of Anaheim
         A UNIQUE, COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
         T        he Green Element combines Anaheim’s Conservation, Open Space, Parks,
                  Recreation and Community Services Elements into a single, comprehensive plan
                  to add more green areas throughout the City and protect and enhance its natural
         and recreational resources. The Green Element’s philosophy is broad and inclusive. It
         seeks not only to preserve, but also to conserve. This includes vital natural resources
         such as water, energy, air, and wildlife. The Green Element also includes goals and
         policies for landscaping, enhancing the City’s corridors and its identity. By combining
         three elements into one comprehensive plan, the City recognizes that open space,
         conservation and parks are part of an integrated network of green resources.
         PURPOSE
         Anaheim‘s “green” resources include the
         vast open space and habitat areas that
         frame the eastern edge of the City, the
         various natural resources that protect
         and enhance our quality of life, the
         numerous park and recreation areas and
         trails that serve all of our residents, and
         the landscaped edges that distinguish
         Anaheim’s diverse communities and
         transportation corridors. The purpose of
         the Green Element is to build upon this
         network of resources to create a
         greener, more beautiful Anaheim. The
         City and its residents are already proud
         of its open space amenities, but it
         recognizes the need to add more local
         parks, trail networks and landscaping.

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
The Green Element is unique in that it combines two required elements of the General
Plan – Open Space and Conservation – with an optional, but important Element – Parks,
Recreation and Community Services. Realizing the importance of landscaping as a
unifying ingredient in enhancing community image, a landscape component is also
included in the Green Element.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
The Green Element is intimately related to at least three other elements of the General
Plan: Land Use, Economic Development and Community Design. The Land Use
Element designates appropriate areas for open space and recreation. A quality system of
parks and well-landscaped corridors supports the Economic Development Element goals
and policies that promote economic activity and support local businesses. Enhanced
gateways and landscaped edges help to define neighborhoods and districts, thereby
supporting the goals of the Community Design Element.
Like parks and recreation facilities, libraries and other community serving facilities
provide important community amenities for the residents of Anaheim. These vital
components of the Community Services Department are addressed in the Public Services
and Facilities Element.
ACHIEVING THE VISION
The major goals of the Anaheim Vision, related to the Green Element, include:
   Improved landscaping and enhancement of boulevards and public rights-of-way;
   Preservation of open space, ridgelines, public scenic vistas and specimen trees;
   Provision for more parks and community centers; and
   Enhanced trail network connecting City and County open space and regional trail
    systems.

         The Green Plan: Integrating
         Open Space Amenities
         PLAN OBJECTIVES
         T       he overriding purpose of the Green Element is to combine all of Anaheim’s open
                 space, conservation, recreation and landscaping resources into one
                 comprehensive, integrated document. Rather than separate these components,
         the Green Element recognizes their interrelationship and builds upon it with the inclusion
         of a “Green Plan,” as seen in Figure G-1. The objectives of the Green Plan are to:
             Expand public parks and open space amenities;
             Improve the City’s trail and bicycle network for local and regional connections;
             Beautify arterial corridors with landscape plans, edge treatments and gateways; and
             Use existing opportunities, such as easements, vacant land and the Santa Ana River
              to expand accessible open space and recreation opportunities.
         PLAN DESCRIPTION
         The Green Plan uses a variety of open space opportunities and resources to create a
         unified vision for a more beautiful, healthy city. As seen in Figure G-1, the Green Plan
         considers not only existing parks and open space, but also potential recreational
         opportunities, such as schools, utility easements, water uses, and vacant land. It also
         identifies opportunities to enhance the appearance of existing areas through enhanced
         community edges and City entryways. The emphasis of the Green Plan is not only to
         make spatial connections throughout the City through parks, trails, open space and
         landscaping but also to create connections between policies and plans that help the City
         conserve its natural and cultural resources such as water, energy and historic districts.

POLICY FOUNDATION
Like the Land Use Plan graphically displays the policy foundation of the Land Use
Element and other land use related policies of the General Plan, the Green Plan is
provided at the beginning of this Element to depict much of the policy foundation of the
Green Element and to display the locations of various “green” resources and
opportunities that contribute to making Anaheim a greener, more beautiful and healthy
community.

                                                                          GREEN ELEMENT
         Conserving Natural
         Resources
         C       onserving natural resources is a fundamental part of the Green Element, and a
                 required element of the General Plan. This section addresses the Green
                 Element’s goal of using natural resources wisely and promoting sustainable
         growth and development. By placing this section within the Green Element, the City of
         Anaheim recognizes that conservation and preservation of natural resources is the
         backbone of a City’s efforts to protect and enhance the environment. Future
         development should be balanced with the need to preserve the natural environment in
         order to ensure that current and future generations are able to enjoy the benefits of this
         important resource.
         This section addresses the important concerns of water conservation, water quality, air
         quality, biological resources, energy conservation, and waste management and recycling.
         GOALS AND POLICIES
         Natural Open Space
         A vital component of the Green Element is the comprehensive and long-range
         preservation and enhancement of open space areas. This includes open space for habitat
         preservation, outdoor recreation and water uses. Although most of the western,
         northern and southern areas of Anaheim are built out and adjoin other cities, the Hill and
         Canyon Area contains a significant amount of open space and abuts major open space
         resources, including the Chino Hills State Park, the Cleveland National Forest and the
         Santa Ana River. Another vital component of the Green Element are the existing and
         planned trails that connect these valuable resources, as discussed later in the Element
         (see Figure G-6 for trail locations).
         Hillside Development and Grading
         Natural slopes are one of the primary aesthetic resources in the Hill and Canyon Area.
         Hillsides, which are visible throughout the area, create a dramatic backdrop for
         surrounding residential neighborhoods and help define the character of the area.
May 2004                                                          City of Anaheim General Plan | Page G-7

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
Development on hillsides within the Hill and Canyon Area, where land use designations
permit, requires careful siting, grading, and design in order to minimize exposure to
hazards and to maintain and enhance the scenic quality of the area.
The Public Works Department regulates and processes applications for grading permits.
Development plans must follow the guidelines of the Land Development and Resources
Code and Zoning Code regarding grading, excavations and fills and specimen tree
removal, and must include an erosion and sediment control plan.
GOAL 1.1:
Maintain strict standards for hillside grading to preserve environmental and aesthetic
resources.
Policies:
         1) Require that infill hillside development minimize alteration of the natural
             landforms and natural vegetation.
         2) Limit grading to the amount necessary to provide stable areas for structural
             foundations, street rights-of-way, parking facilities, and other intended uses.
         3) Minimize import/export associated with grading.
         4) Grading for infill projects should be kept to an absolute minimum, with
             developments following the natural contours of the land, and prohibited in
             steep slope areas.
Ridgelines, Views and Vistas
Views and vistas in Anaheim are important visual
amenities. From most areas of Anaheim, the
contours of the Hill and Canyon Area and the
Santa Ana Mountains are visible. Other scenic
amenities such as golf courses and the Santa
Ana River also provide visual relief from the built
environment and are important visual amenities
and landmarks.

                                                        SR-241 toll road.
GOAL 2.1:
Preserve views of ridgelines, natural open space and other scenic vistas wherever
possible.
Policies:
         1) Control infill development on visually significant ridgelines, canyon edges
             and hilltops through sensitive site planning and appropriate landscaping to
             ensure development is visually unobtrusive.

                  2) Encourage development that preserves natural contours and views of existing
                       backdrop ridgelines or prominent views.
                  3) Site parks, nature centers and trails to take advantage of natural vistas.
                  4) Encourage future development and public improvements to maximize private
                       and public views of golf course fairways.
         Utility Easements
         The City of Anaheim continues to expand its trail and open space system by using the
         land under Southern California Edison (SCE) power lines. The concept is to use utility
         easements as a landscaped open space amenity for the City and integrate them into the
         City trail system.
         Three power line easements are mapped on the Green Plan (Figure G-1) with the
         ultimate goal of improving them to provide trails for recreation, bicycle and pedestrian
         uses. Linkages to existing parks, open space and other trail systems are also being
         considered.
         GOAL 3.1:
         Actively plan for the use of utility easements as recreational trails and open space
         amenities.
         Policies:
                  1) Coordinate with Southern California Edison to pursue the implementation of
                       recreational and open space amenities on utility easements.
         Recreational Water Uses
         The Santa Ana River flows into Anaheim from the northeast and hugs the northeastern
         edge of the City as it moves south to the ocean. The Santa Ana River Trail connects
         with Orange County’s riding and hiking trails and follows the river as it moves south to
         the ocean in Huntington Beach. In addition, Carbon Creek flows through the City from
         the northeast to the southwest and could become a recreational and visual amenity.
         Several water basins along the Santa Ana River are used for recreation purposes:
         Anaheim Lakes, the Miller Retarding Basin and the Five Coves area, which is located
         north of Ball Road along the western side of the river.
         As opportunities for acquiring lands for future open space and recreational resources in
         the City are limited, the City will continue to look for new ways to utilize these areas
         along the Santa Ana River and Carbon Creek to provide additional resources and to
         provide more links from surrounding development to these waterways.

GOAL 4.1:
Maximize the recreational and scenic potential of existing reservoirs, basins and
waterways.
Policies:
          1) Support the County of Orange to continue in their efforts to upgrade and
              maintain the Santa Ana River Trail.
          2) Work with the County of Orange and the Orange County Water District to
              maintain and improve the recreational and scenic resources of the Anaheim
              Lakes and Five Coves areas and other appropriate water resource areas,
              including retarding basins and reservoirs.
Water Conservation
Anaheim normally pumps most of its drinking water
(between 65% to 70%) from the local groundwater basin,
and purchases the remainder from the Metropolitan
Water District of Southern California, which obtains its
water from the Colorado River and the State Water

of responsibility to manage its water resources. The river
plays a vital role in recharging the groundwater basin. Several retention basins formed
by levees along the river help to replenish the water table. The Orange County Water

         Conservation Efforts – The City of Anaheim is actively involved in resource management.
         The municipal utility operates its own state-of-the-art Lenain Filtration Plant, and has a
         long history of promoting wise use of its water and energy resources. As one of the
         original signatories to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding Urban
         Water Conservation in California, Anaheim Public Utilities implements the MOU’s Best
         Management Practices – fourteen proven water conservation measures.
         Water Conservation
         Anaheim provides water conservation, groundwater protection and water efficiency
         programs. Its many commercial and residential water efficiency programs are linked to
         the City website where customers can ask questions or sign up for Anaheim’s many
         Advantage Services programs. Anaheim’s award-winning annual Water Awareness
         Campaign reaches out to the entire community with its valuable water conservation
         message.
         Anaheim also maintains a number of
         educational and incentive programs and
         drought-tolerant landscaping examples aimed
         at promoting water conservation. These
         include water conservation partnership
         programs with public schools, the Home
         Gardener’s Water Conservation Program, the
         rebate program that rewards customers for
         replacing old fixtures with water efficient ones,
         and the Waterwise Demonstration Garden, to
         name a few.
                                                             The Waterwise Demonstration Garden, which

GOAL 5.2:
Continue and expand Anaheim’s educational outreach and incentives programs aimed at
water conservation.
Policies:
         1) Continue to educate the public through the award-winning annual Water
             Awareness Month Campaign.
         2) Continue to offer all Anaheim public and private schools the opportunity to
             participate in the Water Conservation Poster Contest.
         3) Continue to encourage landscape projects employing water efficient
             irrigation.
         4) Maximize opportunities to install local or regional groundwater recharge
             facilities.
Water Quality
The Greening of Anaheim depends on a reliable and clean water supply. Since the City
receives almost three-fourths of its drinking water from local groundwater, it is critical to
protect this vital resource. The groundwater recharge area, located in an area that
extends north and east of the Orange (SR-57)/Riverside (SR-91) Freeway interchange, to
the Riverside Freeway and Imperial Highway interchange, is critically important because
this area accounts for two-thirds of the total groundwater recharge that occurs in all of
Orange County.
In order to protect current and future groundwater resources, the City has established a
Groundwater Protection Zone for the recharge area (Figure G-2). The purpose of the
zone is to allow the City to develop a multi-faceted approach to protecting Anaheim’s
drinking water from contamination. The primary emphasis will be to provide educational
outreach materials to inform businesses and residents how to properly manage materials
and waste.
The City also has responsibilities to address the issues associated with storm water and
urban runoff pollution. The Clean Water Act requires cities to develop Surface Water
Quality Programs to reduce the pollution from urban runoff. Businesses and
Page G-12 | May 2004

                                                                          GREEN ELEMENT
         homeowners also have certain rights and responsibilities for the proper disposal of toxic
         and environmentally degrading materials such as oil, paints, solvents and litter. The City
         publishes brochures for citizens to keep them informed on responsible management of
         waste. In addition, a Water Quality Management Plan is required of all new development
         to minimize pollutants in runoff.
         Groundwater Protection
         Groundwater protection is a Federal, State, county and city issue. It concerns local
         drinking water quality and standards, source water protection, and hazardous materials
         control. Administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Safe
         Drinking Water Act sets the standards which regional and local water districts
         implement. The Public Utilities Department of the City of Anaheim, one of the County’s
         many Community Water Systems, gets most of its supply from groundwater and
         therefore, has a vital interest in its protection.
         Anaheim’s Public Utilities Department regularly conducts Source Water Assessments for
         all of its wells. This included an inventory of Possible Contaminating Activities (PCAs),
         which are types of activities that could contaminate drinking water sources if a release
         were to occur. It was determined that the recharge area has the greatest potential for
         causing widespread contamination of the groundwater basin. In order to inform
         businesses and residents in the recharge area of the importance of groundwater
         protection, the City will develop and distribute educational materials that describe
         techniques to properly manage materials and waste to prevent negative impacts to the
         groundwater supply.
         GOAL 6.1:
         Develop a Groundwater Protection Management Program to ensure the quality of
         groundwater drinking supplies.
         Policies:
                   1) Develop and disseminate educational materials that describe the importance
                        of protecting groundwater and management techniques for the proper
                        storage and disposal of materials and waste.
                   2) Include groundwater protection educational outreach efforts with Anaheim

Storm Water and Urban Runoff Management
Related to the issue of groundwater protection is the issue of minimizing the effects of
storm water and urban runoff pollution (SWURP). Not only does storm water runoff
affect local groundwater, it has the potential to impact neighboring jurisdictions and the
region. Unlike sewage, which goes to treatment plants, urban runoff flows untreated
through the storm drain system. Anything thrown, swept or poured into the street,
gutter or a catch basin (the curbside openings that lead into the storm drain system) can
flow directly into channels, creeks, bays and ocean. The problem is particularly acute
during heavy rains, but can be a problem at any time due to the improper disposal of
products associated with business, industry, restaurants, and home, garden and
automotive maintenance.
Management of storm water runoff is a federal requirement mandated by the Santa Ana
Region of the California State Water Resources Control Board. All cities in Orange
County are required to incorporate watershed protection principles into their General
Plans and related documents. As one of Orange County’s most populous cities and
bordering its largest river, the City of Anaheim plays a key role in this process.
The Clean Water Act requires permitting under the National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES). The County of Orange serves as the principal permittee
while the Orange County Flood Control District and all incorporated municipalities are
co-permittees. The mandate requires the development and implementation of 12
distinct programs, to the “Maximum Extent Practical,” which are intended to prevent and
reduce pollution from urban runoff and storm water as these sources are considered
significant contributors of pollutants to waters of the United States. This includes, but is
not limited to, illegal discharges and illicit connections to storm drains, runoff from
construction sites, restaurants, outdoor storage sites and industrial areas.
GOAL 7.1:
Reduce urban run-off from new and existing development.
Policies:
         1) Ensure compliance with the Federal Clean Water Act requirements for
              National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits, including
              developing and requiring the development of Water Quality Management
              Plans for all new development and significant redevelopment in the City.

                   2) Continue to implement an urban runoff reduction program consistent with
                       regional and federal requirements, which includes requiring and encouraging
                       the following:
                          Increase permeable areas and install filtration controls (including grass
                           lined swales and gravel beds) and divert flow to these permeable areas to
                           allow more percolation of runoff into the ground;
                          Use natural drainage, detention ponds or infiltration pits to collect
                           runoff; and,
                          Prevent rainfall from entering material and waste storage areas and
                           pollution-laden surfaces.
                   3) Cooperate with surrounding jurisdictions and the County of Orange to
                       provide adequate storm drainage facilities.
                   4) Require new development and significant redevelopment to utilize site
                       preparation, grading and best management practices that provide erosion
                       and sediment control to prevent construction-related contaminants from
                       leaving the site and polluting waterways.
                   5) Coordinate with appropriate Federal, State, and local resource agencies on
                       development projects and construction activities affecting waterways and
                       drainages.
                   6) Provide public education information and outreach materials regarding
                       proper materials handling practices to assist residents and businesses in
                       complying with surface water quality regulations and to increase awareness
                       of potential impacts to the environment resulting from improper containment
                       or disposal practices.

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
Since the largest single source of air pollution is from motor vehicles, efforts to control
emissions from cars and trucks would go a long way towards cleaner air. This approach
is multi-faceted: adopting clean-burning fuels; improving traffic flows; and encouraging
mass transit. Efficient land use planning can also reduce air pollution by reducing vehicle
trips. Promoting mixed use and multi-use development, providing accessible retail
centers, and improving pedestrian links to commercial and recreation areas can help
reduce dependence on automobiles.
Background – The Air Quality Management District (AQMD) is the air pollution control
agency for all of Orange County and the urban portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and
San Bernardino Counties. It prepares an Air Quality Management Plan every three years,
following its mandate from the Federal Clean Air Act.
Anaheim’s Clean Air Programs – The City has been taking proactive measures through a
series of clean air programs like The Anaheim Resort Transit Fleet. With millions of
visitors per year needing to get from place to place, the City, along with the Anaheim
Transportation Network, has purchased electric buses and trams along with propane
trolleys to move visitors to and from major tourist amenities.
Emissions Reduction
Reducing emissions is a public and private responsibility. The City of Anaheim’s Public
Works Department, Traffic and Transportation Services Division has the mission of
improving the transportation infrastructure and traffic flows. Its Intelligent
Transportation Systems inform motorists through changeable message signs directing
them to the less congested roadways and available parking. The Scoot Adaptive Traffic
Control System examines real-time traffic conditions to optimize traffic signal timing.
GOAL 8.1:
Reduce locally generated emissions through improved traffic flows and construction
management practices.
Policies:
         1) Reduce vehicle emissions through traffic flow improvements, such as traffic
             signal synchronization, Intelligent Transportation Systems, the Scoot
             Adaptive Traffic Control System, and related capital improvements.
         2) Regulate construction practices, including grading, dust suppression,
             chemical management, and encourage pre-determined construction routes
             that minimize dust and particulate matter pollution.

         Reducing Vehicle Work Trips
         An important way to reduce vehicle trips is to bring different types of land uses together
         in mixed-use or multi-use developments. Rather than single-use areas separating
         housing from retail and office uses, the City has targeted key areas for a concentration of
         different uses that bring people closer to shopping, recreation, entertainment and
         employment. For example, the City is planning for such a mix of uses in The Platinum
         Triangle and the Downtown. A place which provides window shopping, restaurants,
         convenience retail, office development, and accessible parking all within comfortable
         walking distances can keep people from using their cars.
         The most land-efficient use of space is vertical mixed-use, where different uses occur on
         different levels of the same building. Horizontal mixed-use development can combine
         different uses within the same property or adjacent properties. Either way, the key idea
         is convenience and choices for the visitor or resident. A mixed-use center cannot only
         provide housing but also convenience retail, offices and recreation. Restaurant and other
         service-oriented retail uses can be provided within business parks and light industrial
         areas for the benefit of workers.
         GOAL 9.1:
         Reduce single-occupancy vehicle trips
         Policies:
                  1) Encourage alternative work schedules for public and private sector workers.
                  2) Encourage development of new commercial and industrial projects that
                      provide on-site amenities that help to lesson vehicle trips such as on-site day
                      care facilities, cafeterias, automated teller machines and bicycle storage
                      facilities.
                  3) Encourage use of vanpools and carpools by providing priority parking
                      through the project design process.
                  4) Encourage bicycle and pedestrian travel by improving the City’s trail and
                      bikeway master plan and by providing convenient links between the trail
                      system and desired destinations.
                  5) Encourage the development of commercial, office and residential uses in
                      appropriate mixed-use and multiple use settings.
         Expanding Transit Trips
         The City of Anaheim is already well-served by public transit, but is continuing to work for
         greater ridership. The Commuter Services Office, operated by the Public Works
         Department, provides information to walkers, cyclists, bus and rail users, and car and

vanpoolers. Sound land use planning complements this comprehensive approach to
public transit. The City is also encouraging mixed-use and higher density development in
the vicinity of Metrolink stops and transit corridors. In addition, carefully placed and
well-marked transit stops exist near all major tourist amenities.
GOAL 10.1:
Improve the efficiency and ridership of public transit within the City.
Policies:
          1) Continue to expand the convenience and quality of local transit service.
          2) Provide convenient connections and shuttle services from commuter rail
              stations to employment centers and entertainment venues.
          3) Work with public transit providers to ensure that transit stops are safe,
              comfortable and convenient.
          4) Continue multi-faceted efforts to inform the public about transit
              opportunities, scheduling and benefits.
          5) Provide convenient first/last mile bicycle and pedestrian connections to
              transit stops.

problem has not been a lack of commercial uses; in fact, the
City has an ample supply of land designated for such uses. The
challenge is to attract quality retail centers. With the attractive shopping alternatives
located in nearby cities, many residents have used their cars to travel to other retail
destinations.
The solution does not lie in designating more land for commercial uses, but rather to
make those areas, as desired by the City, become thriving and vibrant commercial activity
areas. The primary strategies include consolidating commercial uses into strategic
locations, particularly at the intersections of arterial corridors; encouraging new
residential development along arterial corridors that bring new residents and income to
areas served by commercial locations; utilizing various economic development and
redevelopment tools and incentives; and providing carefully-tailored design guidelines
which produce the type of quality development, mix of uses and pedestrian amenities
which will attract repeat business.

         Another strategy for reducing vehicle trips is “transit oriented development” (TOD) – the
         provision of higher density, mixed-use development near major rail and transit stops.
         These developments are designed to encourage easy access to transit and shopping
         opportunities minimizing the need for a private car. With two Metrolink Stations,
         planned Bus Rapid Transit access, among other transit alternatives, the City has ample
         opportunities to incorporate transit-oriented design.
         GOAL 11.1:
         Encourage land planning and urban design that support alternatives to the private
         automobile such as mixed-use, provision of pedestrian and bicycle amenities, and transit-
         oriented development.
         Policies:
                  1) Encourage commercial growth and the development of commercial centers
                      in accordance with the Land Use Element.
                  2) Encourage mixed-use development in accordance with the Land Use
                      Element.
                  3) Encourage retail commercial uses in or near residential areas and
                      employment centers to lessen vehicle trips.
                  4) Encourage higher densities and mixed-use development in the vicinity of
                      major rail and transit stops.
                  5) Encourage a diverse mix of retail uses within commercial centers to
                      encourage one-stop shopping.
                  6) Locate new public facilities with access to mass transit service and other
                      alternative transportation services, including rail, bus, bicycles and pedestrian
                      use.
                  7) Provide everyday opportunities to connect with nature through the
                      promotion of trails, bicycle routes, and habitat friendly landscaping.
         Efficient, Clean-burning Public Transit
         The City of Anaheim has taken innovative steps to encourage the use of electric and
         other alternative fuel vehicles. With several major tourist destinations, the City provides
         alternative fuel shuttle service for visitors. The electric transportation program has
         received an award from the Air Quality Management District in the area of Innovative
         Transportation Projects and, with increasing numbers of visitors to The Anaheim Resort,
         will continue to contribute to air quality improvements.

         4) Work with the U.S. Department of Energy to achieve a Clean City
             designation for the City of Anaheim.
Educating the Public
Anaheim has made great strides in educating the public about air quality, energy
conservation and public transit. Its City website has informative and easy to use links to
commuter services, and tips for saving electricity and conserving water.
This community education effort is supplemented by school outreach programs that aim
to teach students about protecting the environment and saving resources. Air quality
planning, however, is a complex, ongoing effort, subject to Federal, State and regional
laws and regulations, and one that Anaheim will continue to address in the future.
GOAL 13.1:
Expand citizen and business outreach programs relating to policies that improve air
quality.
Policies:
         1) Continue to update and improve the City’s transit programs and
             informational resources – both web-based and print media.
         2) Disseminate air quality educational materials to residents, businesses and
             schools.
Biological Resources
An important part of the Green Element includes natural open space that is home to
native plant and animal species. Although much of Anaheim is built out, significant open
space areas exist in the eastern portion of the City, like Deer Canyon and Oak Canyon,
where protecting biological resources is an important task. In addition, several major
parks of regional and statewide interest – the Chino Hills State Park and the Cleveland

                                                                         GREEN ELEMENT
         National Forest, are adjacent to the City and are home to a variety of plant and animal
         species.
         Conservation of Biological Resources
         The area generally south of the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway and east of the Orange (SR-
         55) Freeway falls within one of the most innovative and significant habitat protection
         plans in California – the Natural Communities Conservation Plan (NCCP). The Orange
         County Central-Coast Sub-regional NCCP was approved in July of 1996. It consists of
         37,000 acres covering portions of several cities and unincorporated areas, contains
         twelve habitat types and covers 39 sensitive plant and animal species.
         The City will continue to support regional planning efforts to conserve biological
         resources within and adjacent to the City. In addition, future development in the
         easternmost portion of the City should be sensitively integrated with the adjoining habitat
         areas.
         GOAL 14.1:
         Conserve natural habitat and protect rare, threatened and endangered species.
         Policies:
                  1) Support efforts to preserve natural habitat through continued participation in
                      the Natural Communities Conservation Plan.
         GOAL 14.2:
         Support educational outreach programs related to habitat resources and conservation
         efforts.
         Policies:
                  1) Encourage and support regional efforts to educate the public about habitat
                      resources and conservation efforts.
         GOAL 14.3:
         Ensure that future development near regional open space resources will be sensitively
         integrated into surrounding sensitive habitat areas.
         Policies:
                  1) Require new development to mitigate light and glare impacts on surrounding
                      sensitive habitat and open space areas, where appropriate.

lands throughout the State that contain regionally significant mineral resources as
mandated by State Law. According to the California Geological Survey, parts of East
Anaheim, Anaheim Canyon, and Hill and Canyon Areas are identified as being within a
Mineral Resource Zone, Class 2 (MRZ-2). Lands within this zone are determined to
have a high potential for significant mineral deposits. The City of Anaheim has three
sectors identified as containing mineral resources of regional significance. These sectors
are shown on Figure G-3, Mineral Resource Map.
   Sector D – aggregate-sand and gravel deposits located between Orangethorpe
    Avenue and La Palma Avenue.
   Sector E – aggregate-sand and gravel deposits located at the southwest corner of the
    intersection of Miraloma Avenue and North Lakeview Avenue.
   Sector F – aggregate-sand and gravel deposits located in the Warner Basin near the
    intersection of La Palma Avenue and Tustin Avenue.
The three sites listed above are developed with industrial uses; therefore, their practical
value as mineral resources is somewhat limited.

         Energy Conservation: Green Power and Saving
         Electricity
         The City has made great strides in energy conservation. Since 1894, the City has
         operated its own electric utility, which offers the lowest electricity rates in Orange
         County. The City’s growing energy conservation programs and outreach efforts are
         numerous and the City’s website offers practical advice on making homes more energy
         efficient.
         City facilities and some of Anaheim’s largest businesses voluntarily reduce energy
         demand during peak use hours (2:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.). The City maintains a 12,000-
         square foot solar array on top of the Anaheim Convention Center as well as emergency
         generators to maintain energy supply during interruptions in service.
         Energy Conservation
         As the second largest city in the County and the only one that owns its own public
         utilities, Anaheim has long recognized its special role in promoting energy conservation.
         The Anaheim Public Utilities Department has taken the lead in educating the public –
         both residents and businesses – on efficient energy use. Energy conservation is a
         comprehensive process, involving efficient use of appliances, new technologies, building
         design and construction, and the City will continue to regard it as a major policy goal.
         Anaheim’s energy conservation efforts are consistent with national and State programs.
         The United States Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency have

         Green Development Practices
         The City has taken a leading role in promoting environmentally friendly, energy-efficient
         and sustainable development by integrating its policies related to conservation, open
         space, parks and recreation and landscaping into a comprehensive Green Element. By
         further establishing and implementing policies on “green building” design and
         construction, the City serves as a model for incorporating            “Green buildings” are

         The principles of “Green Building Codes,” promulgated
         by the U.S. Department of Energy, include designing for:
            Energy efficiency – building orientation and siting can save energy by using
             renewable resources such as solar and wind power. For example, locating major
             windows and building openings away from maximum sun exposure but towards
             prevailing winds can significantly cool a building.
            Environmental impact – site design can reduce storm water run-off and landscaping
             can conserve water, improve aesthetics and cool buildings;
            Resource conservation – selection of efficient building materials, installing energy-
             saving products and reducing construction waste saves money;
            Indoor air quality – proper ventilation standards reduce the potential for exposure to
             noxious materials and improve occupants’ health; and
            Community issues – mixed use development and other development where buildings
             are sited near transit stops, public facilities, shopping and residences reduce reliance
             on automobiles; the provision of comfortable pedestrian amenities and bicycle
             storage facilities promote alternatives to the car.
         Building Performance Standards
         Green building practices and standards are a relatively recent phenomenon, but are
         becoming widespread nationally. Concerns over the unpredictability of energy prices and
         supplies have given the movement even more impetus. Energy efficient buildings not
         only save users on utility bills, but also satisfy several community goals at once – air
         quality, water conservation, urban runoff, and solid waste reduction.

         Enhancing Parks and
         Recreation Programs
         T        he City of Anaheim provides a wide variety of parks and recreation facilities.
                  Although State law does not require a Parks and Recreation Element, Anaheim
                  recognizes the importance of including such an element in its General Plan.
         The Vision
         The City owns and operates nearly 50 parks totaling almost 700 acres and two 18-hole
         golf courses. Park facilities include neighborhood, community and special use parks.
         Regional parks, owned and operated by the
         County of Orange, provide other prominent
         park opportunities in and adjacent to Anaheim.
         Despite this vast system of parks and
         recreational facilities, additional needs for new
         facilities are evident and are discussed below.
         Areas for enhancement include:
                  Providing more neighborhood and
                   community parks throughout Anaheim;              Originally named City Park, Pearson Park in

                  Providing more lighted and practice
                   athletic fields and indoor recreational facilities, such as gymnasiums, in all areas
                   of the City to meet current and future needs.
         PARK TYPES
         Parks come in all shapes and sizes, from small pocket parks to large regional parks.
         Below is a description of the types of parks found in the City.

Local Parks – Neighborhood and Community Parks
Neighborhood Parks
This is the most common type of park in Anaheim.
These are parks to which people walk or bike and are
located within the neighborhood they serve. They are
typically 5 to 15 acres in size and have a service
radius of one-half mile. Neighborhood parks are
located on separate properties and provide amenities

Community Parks
These parks serve several neighborhoods and have a
service radius of up to 2 miles, which is about the
same service radius as a high school. Their size ranges
from 15 to 50 acres, providing similar and larger
amenities than a neighborhood park including lighted
ball fields, basketball courts, tennis courts, and
community centers or large recreation buildings. Due
to their larger size, community parks are designed for
vehicular as well as pedestrian access. When possible,         Long before the Angels moved to

Mini-Parks
Often called pocket parks, these are the smallest type
of park and are usually less than five acres in size.
They often consist of passive recreational uses
(although basketball, children’s play areas and other
active uses can be included), provide little to no
parking and serve a relatively small area. George

         Nature Centers or Specialized Recreation Centers
         These facilities serve a specialized, Citywide need and tend to focus on one particular
         activity, such as a nature center or natural area, or tennis or golf complex.
         Regional Parks
         Regional parks are typically 50 acres or larger and have a wide range of amenities to
         attract a broad range of users and interests within and beyond the City limits. For such
         large-scale parks, service radii and standards can vary but they generally serve a
         population of between 50,000 to 100,000 people up to 30 miles away. There are a
         number of regional park facilities, operated by the County of Orange, located in,
         adjacent to, or near Anaheim. These facilities include:
             Yorba Regional Park – 166 acres in the eastern portion of Anaheim along the north
              side of the Santa Ana River
             Featherly Regional Park – 150 acres outside of the City limits north of the Riverside
              (SR-91) Freeway with camping, amphitheatre and nature trails
             Weir Canyon Regional Park – proposed park encompassing 2,100 acres near the
              proposed southerly extension of Weir Canyon Road in the City of Orange’s sphere-

             Santiago Oaks Regional Park – 135 acres along Santiago Creek in the City of
              Orange
             Regional Trails – nearly 30 miles of hiking, biking and equestrian trails, the longest of
              which is the over 10 mile-long Santa Ana River Trail; the majority of the other trails
              are located in the hilly areas in eastern Anaheim.
         State-Owned Open Space
         The State has acquired approximately 4,000 acres as an addition to the Chino Hills State
         Park. The area is known for its Tecate Cypress forest, of which the trees are one of the
         last remaining stands in the world. It also has an important wildlife connection which
         enables wildlife to traverse from the south side of the SR-91 Freeway into Chino Hills
         State Park.
         PARK PLANNING AREAS
         Planning parks for a city of Anaheim’s size and diversity is a challenge. For planning
         purposes, the City has traditionally been divided into three Park, Recreation and
         Community Service Areas (PRCS): West Anaheim, located west of Euclid Street; Central
         Anaheim, situated east of Euclid Street and west of the Santa Ana River; and East
         Anaheim, located east of the Santa Ana River (see Figure G-4, Existing Park Facilities).
         The criteria used to determine these planning areas include: geographic barriers, land
         use patterns, census areas, and high school attendance boundaries.

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
Anaheim’s Existing Facilities
As shown in Figure G-4, Anaheim currently owns or operates a wide variety of parks and
recreation facilities, totaling approximately 700 acres. These include:
        24 neighborhood parks
        11 community parks
        8 mini-parks
        5 nature centers
        3 specialized recreation centers
These parks feature passive uses such as picnic tables, barbecue facilities, and tot lots as
well as active uses such as ball fields and tennis courts.
East Anaheim
Much of East Anaheim’s parks are located in passive
parklands. Two nature-oriented park areas, Oak Canyon
Nature Center and the Deer Canyon Park Preserve (58
and 130 acres respectively), account for a significant
portion of the parkland in East Anaheim. The area also          The Deer Canyon Park Preserve

West Anaheim
Most of this area’s parks adjoin existing elementary
schools. They contain active community uses such as
soccer fields, softball fields and tot lots. Two of the
largest active recreational parks in Anaheim, Brookhurst
Park and Twila Reid Park, are found here. West Anaheim

Central Anaheim
This part of Anaheim has more parks than any other,
partly because it is the oldest and most intensely
developed part of the City. The three oldest parks in the
City, Pearson, La Palma and Boysen, are found here.
Several of the parks in this area reflect the historic
character and traditions of the Anaheim Colony, the
historic heart of Anaheim.                                      Located adjacent to the historic

Additional City-Owned or Operated Facilities
In addition to the variety of parks identified above, the City is also home to a variety of
City-owned or operated recreational facilities. These include:
    H.G. “Dad” Miller Golf Course – a 107-acre, 18-hole course with clubhouse and
     driving range
    Anaheim Hills Golf Course – a 174-acre, 18-hole course with driving range and club
     house; located adjacent to the Oak Canyon Nature Center
    Anaheim Tennis Center – a city owned, privately operated facility adjacent to Boysen
     Park
PARK NEEDS
One of the primary goals of the Green Element is to ensure the adequate provision of
park facilities for the current and future residents of Anaheim. As the City approaches
build-out and its projected 2030 population of nearly 400,000, acquiring and
developing new parkland and meeting Anaheim’s current standard of two acres of
parkland per 1,000 residents will pose significant challenges. To offset some of these
demands, local school districts will continue to provide additional recreation
opportunities through formal and informal joint use agreements with the City.
As land becomes increasingly scarce, new and creative ways to accomplish this goal will
need to be implemented. Through the Green Plan (Figure G-1), Green Element policies,
and their implementation, the City of Anaheim will continue its tradition of meeting the
park and recreation needs of its residents.
The Green Plan: Park Deficiency Areas
One of the key features of the Green Plan (Figure G-1) is the identification of Park
Deficiency Areas. Park Deficiency Areas reflect those areas that, due to population
pressures and limited park opportunities, are underserved by recreational facilities and
includes residential areas that are located outside of a one-half mile radius of
Neighborhood and Community Parks or one-quarter mile radius of a Mini Park.
Community Parks have a service radius of two miles and also serve Neighborhood Park
functions within a one-half mile radius. These areas are based on needs established in the
last update of the Parks and Recreation Element, demographic changes since the last
update, and future land use and employment trends described in the Land Use Element.
RECREATION PROGRAMS AND TRENDS
Recreation programs encompass all the organized recreational activities and self-
improvement courses sponsored by the City of Anaheim for people from pre-school age
to the senior years. They are located throughout the City at parks, community centers
and local schools. These include:
                                                         City of Anaheim General Plan | Page G-39

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
Programs for Pre-Schoolers – These include the Tiny Tots program, tumbling classes,
dance, science, storytelling and arts and crafts. They are offered at limited times in a few
areas.
Programs for Elementary School Children – These constitute the majority of the City
programs and are often offered in conjunction with school activities. These programs
include sports and athletics, arts and crafts, story theatre, dance, self-improvement
courses and special events.
Teen Programs – This is a crucial age group to serve. The key element of this program
has been teen clubs, oriented towards junior high students. Other programs include
excursions, self-improvement classes, sports camps and athletic programs.
Adult Programs – Adult programs include a wide variety of fitness programs, self-
improvement classes, softball leagues, tennis, soccer, volleyball and table tennis
activities. Also included are a wide variety of subjects including computer classes,
academic preparation, language courses, science, health and safety-related courses. The
amount and type of classes offered depend on instructor availability, availability of
classrooms, demand and scheduling constraints.
Senior Citizen Programs – The City of Anaheim offers a full range of senior citizen
recreation and human resources programs. The programs are offered at senior and
community centers.
GOALS AND POLICIES
Adequate Supply of Parks
The City currently maintains park dedication standards that require new development to
ensure that two acres of parkland will be developed for each 1,000 residents added by
the proposed development. Depending upon the magnitude of the residential
development, the dedication may be in the form of direct dedication of improved land,
the payment of fees in lieu of dedication, or a combination of both. The City has a park
dedication ordinance, and park dedication fees are adjusted annually. While serving as
important amenities for future development, private parks and open space amenities are
not counted toward meeting park fee credits.
To supplement its own recreational facilities, the City has also entered into joint-use
agreements with local school districts. School facilities such as gymnasiums, play
equipment, sports fields, swimming pools and classrooms play a very important role in
meeting residents’ recreation needs and are available to the public as a result of these
agreements. City golf courses, regional parks, neighboring cities’ facilities and other
specialized facilities, including the Angel Stadium of Anaheim, the Arrowhead Pond of
Anaheim, Disneyland, Disney’s California Adventure, Disney Ice and the Anaheim
Convention Center, also fill more specialized commercial recreation needs.

GOAL 18.1:
Provide sufficient indoor and outdoor park, recreation and community service
opportunities for existing and future residents and employees.
Policies:
         1) Maintain a Citywide standard of at least two acres of parkland per thousand
              residents.
         2) Locate neighborhood parks within walking distance of the surrounding
              neighborhood.
         3) Locate parks adjacent to schools, where possible, to facilitate joint-use of
              publicly owned land and facilities.
         4) Design new facilities to serve as many compatible, overlapping uses as
              possible such as baseball/softball outfields also serving as soccer fields.
         5) Develop a network of at least one 10,000 square-foot multi-use, indoor
              facility (e.g., gymnasium) per 25,000 residents.
         6) Continue to provide a variety of park types and facilities, especially dedicated
              sports fields and practice fields, that serve the diverse needs of Anaheim’s
              neighborhoods.
         7) Encourage development of park and community service facilities in areas of
              high employment concentrations to serve workers and residents alike.
         8) Consider acquiring properties adjacent to schools, properties available on an
              opportunity basis, or excess freeway rights-of-way, when available, for park
              purposes.
Broad Range of Recreational Opportunities
In a city as large as Anaheim, there is a wide range of recreational interests. In its many
parks, the City provides facilities for both organized sports and more passive uses such
as picnicking and barbecuing. Being a city with many young families and children, after
school programs, large sports fields, practice field areas and aquatic programs are in
high demand. But the City also contains a large adult population with specialized
recreation needs that include cultural programs, arts and crafts, and community events.
The design and re-design of parks is, therefore, an on-going process, and the
programming of recreational opportunities relies on using best management practices.
The key is to stay connected with residents and use pro-active planning to anticipate
changing needs.

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
GOAL 19.1:
Provide a broad range of recreation programs including fee and non-fee based sports
activities, cultural programs, arts and crafts and Citywide events.
Policies:
          1) Provide a wide variety of recreational facilities – in both active and passive
              areas of parks to satisfy diverse needs and activities.
          2) Design and redesign parks to reflect the latest recreational features,
              responsive to population trends and community needs.
          3) Continue to ensure responsive management practices that include staff
              training, efficient scheduling, and coordination with other City departments.
          4) Tailor recreation programs to serve the community and include specialized
              populations, such as pre-school and elementary school children, teens,
              senior citizens, families, young adults and those with special needs.
          5) Develop non-traditional approaches to provide supplementary services and
              programs where facility deficiencies exist (e.g., mobile programs, street
              events, entertainment, storefront operations).
          6) Continue to develop public/private partnerships to expand recreational
              programs and opportunities.
          7) Encourage the development of recreation programs aimed at serving the
              needs of businesses and employees within Anaheim.
          8) Provide disability access to all park and recreation facilities.
Park Safety, Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Parks are among the most highly desired amenities that a city can provide, and their
enjoyment depends, in large measure, on attention to detail. First and foremost, they
must be safe places to enjoy for all members of the community. This means that facilities
and equipment must be well maintained, that landscaping is carefully planned and
maintained with security in mind, that organized activities are well supervised, and that
ample lighting exists for authorized night use.
GOAL 20.1:
Vigorously maintain and upgrade Anaheim’s parks and recreation facilities to better serve
the needs of residents and workers.

Policies:
         1) Continue to promote safety through active ordinance enforcement, risk
              management reviews, improved signage, park security programs and
              neighborhood park stewardship and community-based safety programs.
         2) Continue to improve and maintain proper lighting in park facilities and fields
              without undue glare impacts on adjoining residential areas.
         3) Reduce potential for injury by careful selection of equipment and timely
              repair of facilities.
         4) Continue to conduct safety reviews of each park on a regular basis.
         5) Convert underutilized areas within existing parks to better meet the needs of
              the community.
         6) Continue to conduct regular reviews of existing public parks to determine
              maintenance needs, funding priorities, and long-term rehabilitation costs.
         7) Reduce potential for vandalism through continued police patrols,
              neighborhood watch programs, stewardship programs and public outreach.
Community Outreach
A strong parks and recreation program is one that involves the community in its
evaluation and programming. It has long been a goal of the City of Anaheim to involve
all potential users in the effective planning and implementation of its parks and recreation
program. The City periodically updates the parks and recreation and community services
sections of the General Plan and conducts Citywide needs assessments as addressed in
the Community Services Strategic Plan.
GOAL 21.1:
Conduct periodic and comprehensive community outreach efforts to improve our park
and recreation facilities.
Policies:
         1) Gather and evaluate community input on parks, recreation facilities and
              programs on a regular schedule.
         2) Reevaluate design improvements, equipment and amenities of all City parks
              as part of the periodic updating of the Green Element.
         3) Involve park users and citizens in the evaluation of park design through
              community workshops, design charettes and evaluation forms and surveys.

          CITY OF ANAHEIM
        4) Pursue efforts to communicate in different languages with, and understand
            the needs of, the City’s culturally diverse park users.
        5) Continue to create a greater sense of stewardship for parks within each
            neighborhood and community through active public involvement (e.g., “Kids
            for Parks,” public meetings, booster and service clubs) and volunteerism.
        6) Maintain active outreach efforts between public and private agencies to
            provide a broad array of services and programs.

Improving Trails to Connect
Anaheim
A        n important part of the City’s recreation program is its system of trails and
         bikeways. This system provides residents with connections to parks, natural
         open space, community facilities and the regional network of trails and bikeways.
EQUESTRIAN, RIDING AND HIKING TRAILS PLAN
The City of Anaheim updated its Equestrian,
Riding and Hiking Trails Plan with the adoption of
its Parks, Recreation and Community Services
Element in 1992. This represented a continuation
and modification of the 1976 Trails Element of
the General Plan. The current Master Plan [Figure
G-5] shows the general alignment and
classification of present and future trails,
establishes a trail hierarchy, sets forth
development standards for each class of trails, and
outlines an implementation program. It delineates
approximately 46 miles of trails for hikers,
equestrians, pedestrians and mountain bikers.
While trails are discussed in the Green Element,
bikeways are addressed in the Circulation Element.
There are five primary goals of the trail system as
                                                         The Weir Canyon Trail is one of the many
described in the Master Plan:                            Anaheim trails that connect Anaheim
                                                         residents to nature and to other recreational

             CITY OF ANAHEIM
    Link to regional trails in Orange and Riverside Counties as well as to the Cleveland
     National Forest and Chino Hills State Park;
    Implement the trail system at all planning levels to ensure appropriate dedication and
     improvement of rights-of-way; and
    Take advantage of existing rights-of-way, wherever possible, for trail development
     (i.e. flood control channels, railroad rights-of-way, and powerline easements).
Most of the trails to be completed are in the eastern portion of the Hill and Canyon
Area. There are a number of gaps in the existing trails system due to difficult terrain,
intervening development or lack of necessary dedication. It is important to fill these gaps
since they prevent completion of trail loops and give an incremental, incomplete
character to the trail system and greatly reduce its convenience. An inventory of planned
trails is provided in Table G-3.

The Master Plan will be extended to areas east of Weir Canyon Road providing direct
links to the Cleveland National Forest trail network via the Coal Canyon and Santiago
Trails and to the Riverside County riding and hiking trails via the Santa Ana River Trail.
COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN: TRAILS HIERARCHY
The Equestrian, Riding and Hiking Trails Plan is comprised of the following components:
    Regional Trails – These include major trails that are included in the Orange County

    Backbone Trails – These are major links in the overall City trail system. They provide
     access out of local areas to the trail system as a whole and, as such, will generally
     receive priority for trail capital improvements funded out of the City’s budget or
     through grants. Backbone trails may also be dedicated and developed by individual
     developers, as conditioned by the City.
    Feeder Trails – These are public trails that serve a local purpose, usually in an
     equestrian-oriented neighborhood. While not as critical as the backbone trail
     system, feeder trails do serve an important role as short loops.
     Feeder trail systems are required to be dedicated in connection with development of
     properties along the trail route. Private trails are not shown on the Equestrian,
     Riding and Hiking Trails Plan map (Figure G-5). Where private trails exist, they
     should remain under private ownership. Future private trails should be designed and
     laid out to link with the public trails system.
    Feeder Trail Overlay – This specifies areas where feeder trails for primarily equestrian
     uses should be dedicated and improved as development occurs, but where precise
     trail routes have not yet been mapped.
    Trail Heads – These are major nodes where resting and staging facilities are
     provided. Such amenities can include parking, hitching posts, water, picnic facilities,
     shade trees, trail markers and informational postings and bulletin boards.
    Trail Loops – These are the basis of the trail system in the Master Plan. The idea is
     to provide varying lengths of trail loops that allow riders to return to their point of
     departure without requiring them to double back during their trip.
    Varied Trail Segments – Trail segments should vary in terrain, difficulty and
     surrounding environment to provide users with a varied and interesting trail options.
     Some trails run along urban streets with access to shopping and community facilities,
     offering an alternative to the car or sidewalks. Other trails link, circle or run through
     open, scenic and natural areas.
    Expanded Trail System east of Weir Canyon – The trail system will be expanded in the
     area east of Weir Canyon Road as the area develops. This provides direct links to
     the Chino Hills State Park and Cleveland National Forest trail network, and links to
     Riverside County’s riding and hiking trails via the Santa Ana River Trail.
Trail Study Areas – A number of trail study areas have been identified on Figure G-5 that
depict potential trail locations that connect residents with recreational opportunities,
schools and activity centers such as Downtown, Anaheim Canyon, The Anaheim Resort
and The Platinum Triangle. The locations of these study areas are based on existing
utility easements, railroad rights-of-way and flood control channels. Although they are
mapped, the feasibility of their implementation has yet to be determined. Analysis of
these study areas will need to look at potential intergovernmental or joint use

agreements, allowable trail uses, physical obstacles such as road crossings or existing
development that interrupt trail connections, ownership constraints, and funding issues
to determine their feasibility.
GOALS AND POLICIES
Completing the Trail System
Although the City is largely built-out, there is significant development that will continue
in the eastern portion of Anaheim and focused areas in central and western Anaheim,
and the trail system will be completed as those areas develop. In addition, existing gaps
in the system need to be filled to provide the most complete and convenient trail system
possible. Beyond the planning of the system, the challenge will be to devise the best
possible program for constructing, upgrading and maintaining the system. Currently,
trail dedication and development exactions are the primary method of implementing the
Equestrian, Riding and Hiking Trails Plan. Coordination with regional bodies and filling
in trail gaps within existing public rights-of-way will also help complete the system.
GOAL 22.1:
Complete the Equestrian, Riding and Hiking Trails Plan by closing gaps in the existing
network of trails.
Policies:
          1) Obtain dedication, acquisition and development of trail rights-of-way to City
              standards in order to complete the trail network shown on the Green Plan
              and Equestrian, Riding and Hiking Trails Plan.
          2) Ensure that the trail system’s completion provides a mix of short, medium
              and long rides or hikes.
          3) Link the trail system, where feasible, with existing or future parks and other
              appropriate public areas.
          4) Link the trail system with Orange and Riverside Counties’ regional trails and
              with those in the Cleveland National Forest and Chino Hills State Park.
          5) Expand the trail system by incorporating trails and trail stops within public
              and quasi-public rights-of-way.
          6) Expand the trail system by working with the County of Orange to incorporate
              a hiking and biking trail along Carbon Creek.
          7) Coordinate with the Orange County Water District and Regional Water
              Quality Control Board to expand uses within water basins to include trails
              and trail access.
          8) Require homeowners associations to provide trail maintenance, repairs and
              insurance, where appropriate in private developments.

BEAUTIFYING THE CITY: Public
Landscaping and Street Trees
O         ne of the major goals of the Green Element is to beautify the City. Because the
          image of the City is often experienced from an automobile traveling along major
          corridors, a well-designed program of corridor landscaping and neighborhood
street trees can reinforce an attractive community image.
Cities have long realized the key role that public landscaping, including its ongoing
maintenance plays in their image. Some cities even have a City flower and an adopted
landscape palette, but few go so far as to include a landscaping component as part of
their General Plan. By including such a component in its Green Element, the City is
taking a comprehensive approach to landscape planning as a key ingredient in the
beautification of Anaheim.
This section also reinforces the role of
landscaping to enhance the community’s
image as described in the goals and policies
of the Community Design Element. The
Green Element helps provide a strong
unifying City image through policies that
support theme landscaping and street trees.
The plan supports the City’s Urban

the Green Element is to address the landscape gaps along the major corridors and
enhance City entryways and community edges with landscape improvement
recommendations.

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
In addition to creating a more aesthetically pleasing environment, landscape programs
can also improve environmental quality, reduce energy costs, and enhance the pedestrian
experience – all important goals of the Anaheim General Plan. For example, the
inclusion of canopy trees in corridor landscape programs can provide many such
benefits. They provide shade, which reduces exposure to ultraviolet light and cools
roadways, sidewalks and ambient air temperatures. By reducing temperatures, they
provide comfortable walking areas and reduce energy costs for shaded buildings.
Furthermore, canopy trees can store rainfall on their leaves and branches, reducing
overland water flow and subsequent stormwater runoff.
GOALS AND POLICIES
Public Landscaping and Street Trees
Anaheim devotes major funding to public landscaping, including medians, parkway
maintenance and street trees. The Urban Forestry Section of the Community Services
Department maintains street trees in residential, commercial and industrial areas and
maintains the Official Trees Specie List, which consists of the 25 most commonly found
parkway trees within Anaheim. The Tree Power Program, funded by the Anaheim Public
Utilities Department, provides free shade trees to private property owners with the goal
of reducing demand for electricity. The non-profit Community ReLeaf Anaheim
coordinates community partnership tree plantings within the City’s right-of-way. The
City has attained the status of “Tree City USA” every year since 1984 by the National
Arbor Day Fund and maintains a database of the condition and location of its over
70,000 public trees.
Because landscaping along public rights-of-way is one of the most effective methods of
improving community appearance and creating pleasant pedestrian-friendly
environments, the City has also made it a major aesthetic and
                                                                         Please reference the Community

creates a Citywide landscape plan at major entry points, key
intersections and corridors, where visibility is the greatest.
Powerline easements that intersect with these corridors should also be landscaped to
soften the visual impacts of the powerlines from these corridors and to provide visible
access points to those easements that are designated as open space connections on the
Green Plan (Figure C-1).
Major stretches of corridors in the City are already beautifully landscaped; the goal is to
expand this program throughout the City. Combined with efforts to underground
utilities and provide unifying streetscape elements, the City will be recognized for its
attractive and well-designed arterial corridors.

GOAL 23.1
Continue to improve and expand the City’s comprehensive tree programs.
Policies:
           1) Preserve mature street trees where practical.
           2) Evaluate and potentially modify parkway standards where appropriate.
           3) Evaluate current standards to provide larger openings and wells, where
                practical, for tree placement to accommodate future growth and to mitigate
                potential damage to sidewalks and infrastructure.
           4) Continue to pursue a variety of funding sources for the acquisition,
                accelerated maintenance and possible replacement of street trees.
           5) Continue to strengthen neighborhood and community identity by using tree
                species consistent with the City’s Official Tree Specie List.
           6) Continue to identify neighborhoods in need of additional parkway trees and
                plant them as funding becomes available.
GOAL 23.2:
Complete the City’s comprehensive program of corridor landscaping, including
entryways, medians, and parkways, to strengthen the identity of major corridors and the
City as a whole.
Policies:
           1) Develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive landscape program for
                corridors in need of landscaping improvements.
           2) Adopt landscape themes that give special identity to each corridor and
                reinforce the City’s overall image.
           3) Develop specialized landscape and design treatment for key entryways,
                intersections and powerline easements identified on the Green Plan, in
                accordance with the Community Design Element.
           4) Develop guiding policies for accommodating drought-tolerant landscaping
                (xeriscaping) where it is considered appropriate.

         Introduction
         T       he Land Use Element is a guide, or “blueprint,” for Anaheim’s future development. It
                 designates the distribution and general location of land uses, such as residential, retail,
                 industrial, open space, recreation, and public uses. The Land Use Element also addresses
         the permitted density and intensity of the various land use designations as reflected on the City’s
         General Plan Land Use Map (Figure LU-4).
         RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
         The Land Use Element and its associated General Plan Land Use Map are intended to capture
         and communicate Anaheim’s long-term vision for future development. Of all the General Plan
         elements required by State law, the Land Use Element has the broadest scope. Since it governs
         how land is to be utilized, virtually all of the issues and policies contained in other Elements
         relate in some degree to this Element.
         For example, the Circulation Element defines policies for the accommodation of vehicular trips
         generated by the population and employment associated with the various land uses permitted by
         the Land Use Element. Similarly, the location and intensity of uses prescribed by this Element
         are influenced by policies for the protection of environmental and recreational resources in the
         Green Element. The Land Use Element also furthers the goals and policies of the Housing
         Element by identifying opportunities for new residential development that include a wide range of
         densities. The Community Design Element complements the Land Use Element by providing
         policies that promote quality development and enhance community character. Specific
         redevelopment and revitalization goals and policies that further the direction of the Land Use
         Element are included in the Economic Development Element.
         RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PLANNING TOOLS
         Although the General Plan serves as the blueprint for future development, several other planning
         tools help the City implement its Vision.

Zoning
The City’s Zoning Code is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan, providing
development standards, identifying allowable land uses, and specifying other regulations. The
Zoning Code guides the use patterns, design, and improvements for development projects. By
establishing rules regarding the use of property and site development standards (e.g., building
heights and setbacks, parking standards, etc.), the Zoning Code provides detailed guidance for
development based on, and consistent with, the land use policies established within the General
Plan.
Specific Plans
Specific plans are customized regulatory documents that provide more focused guidance and
regulation, for particular areas. They generally include a land use plan, circulation plan,
infrastructure plan, development standards, design guidelines, phasing plan, financing plan, and
implementation plan.
Anaheim has 10 approved specific plans governing land use development in designated areas.
The specific plans listed below are depicted on Figure LU-1, and can be viewed at the City’s
Planning Department.

         Redevelopment Plans
         The City of Anaheim has maintained an active redevelopment program since the 1970s when it
         first began efforts to revitalize its Downtown core. The City’s redevelopment efforts have since
         greatly expanded, encompassing six major project areas as of 2003. As these project areas have
         progressed and property values increased, the Redevelopment Agency, headed by the City
         Council and staffed by the Community Development Department, has used the resulting
         increases in tax revenue for a variety of public purposes, including funding for the provision of
         affordable housing. The Agency coordinates several on-going efforts associated with industrial,
         retail, office and residential development within redevelopment project areas including the
         provision of off-site public improvements, project financing, site evaluation and infrastructure
         analysis.
         Locations of each project area and a more thorough discussion of redevelopment in Anaheim is
         addressed in the Economic Development Element.

         desired community characteristics. A “visioning” process
         consisting of several focused workshops held throughout
         the community, a community-wide Planning Rally at Angel Stadium of Anaheim, and a
         community survey of Anaheim residents was completed as a means to identify such
         characteristics.
         During the visioning process a number of community values were articulated. Those related to
         land use included:
                  A balance of jobs, housing, open space and recreational opportunities;
                  The need for quality development;
                  Attractive neighborhoods (both new and existing) that offer a wide variety of residential
                   product types appealing to the broad spectrum of people who want to live in Anaheim;
                  Protection of the integrity of single-family neighborhoods;
                  Recognizable gathering places where residents, employees and visitors can interact,
                   socialize and recreate;
                  Revitalized corridors offering a mix of land uses as an alternative to underutilized strip
                   commercial development;
                  First-class shopping and dining opportunities; and,
                  A pedestrian friendly, active Downtown that reflects the historic character of the

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
SETTING
Located in northwestern Orange County, the City of Anaheim lies          Sphere-of-Influence:
approximately 35 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles and             Established by the Local Agency
7 miles northwest of Santa Ana (see Figure LU-1). At the time of         Formation Commission

(SR-57) and Costa Mesa (SR-55) freeways; the Eastern
Transportation Corridor (SR-241); and Amtrak and Metrolink passenger train services.
The City of Anaheim is a geographically diverse community. The western and central portions of
the City are characterized by relatively flat ground that slopes gently to the southwest. This
portion of the City is also characterized by a mix of suburban and urban development and is
relatively built out. The area is home to Downtown and the Anaheim Colony Historic District,
which are located within the City’s original 1.8 square mile boundary and contains a vast majority
of Anaheim’s valued historic structures.
The eastern portion of the City extends generally along the Santa Ana River to the Riverside
County line. This part of the City includes hillside terrain and an abundance of natural resources.
Residential development in the eastern portion of Anaheim largely consists of the various hillside
communities on the south side of the Riverside Freeway that extend to the Eastern
Transportation Corridor (SR-241). Other relatively flat residential neighborhoods are located
north of the Santa Ana River and east of Imperial Highway, and generally south of the Santa Ana
River at the intersection of the Riverside (SR-91) and Costa Mesa (SR-55) Freeways. Anaheim
Canyon, a regional employment center consisting of office, industrial and commercial uses that
generally spans the north side of the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway between the Orange (SR-57)
Freeway and Imperial Highway, is also located in the eastern part of the City.
EXISTING LAND USES
Anaheim is well known for its various world-class tourist destinations, including The Anaheim
Resort, which includes The Disneyland Resort and the Anaheim Convention Center, and its
professional sports franchises/venues. However, it is also home to over 330,000 residents,
11,000 businesses, and 1,500 acres of passive and active parks and open space areas.
Various types of existing land uses are found throughout Anaheim and are categorized by uses
that can be grouped into nine broad categories: Residential, Quasi-Public/ Governmental,

                                                                              LAND USE ELEMENT
         Industrial/Manufacturing, Commercial/Office, Entertainment/Lodging, Parks/Open Space, Water
         Uses/Waterways, Agriculture/Vacant, and Other.
         Residential
         Residential land uses account for nearly half of the total land area in the City, most of which are
         devoted to single-family residential uses. Residential uses are found in nearly all areas of the
         City. A wide variety of housing types and affordability can be found throughout the City making
         it possible to provide for a diverse population both in age and income. Housing types range
         from large hillside estates to historic single-family homes, to duplexes and four-plexes, to
         multiple-family apartments and townhomes, and mixed-use developments.
         Commercial/Office
         Retail and service commercial uses in Anaheim follow the same basic pattern as most cities in
         North Orange County – that is, they are located primarily along arterial corridors. Two regional
         shopping areas are also located in the City, the Anaheim Plaza in West-Central Anaheim and The
         Festival in the Hill and Canyon Area. Office uses are generally dispersed throughout the City
         along arterial corridors and adjacent to its freeways, with small concentrations of larger-scale
         office buildings found in The Platinum Triangle and Downtown areas.
         Entertainment/Lodging
         Anaheim is known worldwide for its tourist attractions and sports/entertainment venues. These
         uses are concentrated in two adjacent areas separated by the Santa Ana (I-5) Freeway: The
         Anaheim Resort, comprised of the Anaheim Convention Center, the Disneyland Theme Park,
         Disney’s California Adventure Theme Park, Downtown Disney, and numerous hotels; and The
         Platinum Triangle, which includes the Arrowhead Pond and Angel Stadium of Anaheim. The
         Platinum Triangle is also home to a variety of restaurants, hotels and the Grove of Anaheim.
         Industrial/Manufacturing
         A critical component of Anaheim’s economic base, manufacturing and industrial uses comprise a
         significant portion of Anaheim’s land area. Much of Anaheim’s manufacturing and lighter
         industrial uses are concentrated in The Anaheim Canyon and in areas north of Angel Stadium of
         Anaheim. Some of the City’s older and heavier industrial uses are concentrated in the North
         Central Industrial Area, generally located south of the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway between Lemon
         Street and Raymond Avenue, and in the southeastern portion of Downtown along the Metrolink
         railway. Consistent with the Anaheim Vision and General Plan Land Use Map, many of the
         Downtown industrial areas are transitioning to residential uses. Additional industrial uses are
         found in other areas of the City, particularly along freeways and railroads.
         Quasi-Public/Governmental
         Quasi-public and governmental uses include a wide range of uses: governmental office buildings,
         fire and police stations, hospitals, utility buildings and substations, community centers, assembly

areas and libraries and schools, among others. Their locations are found throughout the City in
order to effectively serve the public. Quasi-public and governmental uses account for a relatively
small portion of the City’s total land area.
Parks/Open Space
Anaheim’s parks and open space account for approximately 6% or just over 1,500 acres of the
City’s total land area. These areas include sports fields, playgrounds, nature preserves, golf
courses, and other passive and active recreational uses. A more thorough discussion of
Anaheim’s existing and planned park and open space resources can be found in the Green
Element.
Water Uses/Waterways
The Santa Ana River is the most prominent water feature in Anaheim. It runs through the Hill
and Canyon Area and Anaheim Canyon alongside the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway and along the
eastern edge of The Platinum Triangle. The river provides a scenic and recreational resource for
the entire region. It also serves as the City’s primary drainage and flood control facility as well as
the primary source for groundwater recharge in the City. Two smaller, yet important drainage
and flood control facilities in western Anaheim are the Carbon Creek Channel and the
Anaheim/Barber City Channel. Another major water-related facility includes the 920-million
gallon Walnut Canyon Reservoir, located in the Hill and Canyon Area.
Flood control facilities and related goals and policies are discussed in the Safety Element; water
and drainage systems and related goals and policies are discussed in the Public Services and
Facilities Element; and water conservation and quality are addressed in the Green Element.
Agriculture/Vacant Lands
Although nearly 3,400 acres of land in Anaheim is utilized for agricultural purposes or is vacant,
very little remains that is not already entitled for future development. The primary exceptions are
the many utility easements that are envisioned to serve as trail connections, passive open space
or low intensity commercial uses. The largest portion of vacant land is found in the Mountain
Park Specific Plan area on the eastern edge of the City. The area includes 3,169 acres and is
planned for a mix of residential uses, a park, a school, a fire station and open space.

         Land Use Plan
         As required by State law, the General Plan must identify land use designations and permitted
         development intensities. General Plans are also required to include a diagram of the location of
         these uses. These components, as well as a series of planning objectives that serve as the
         foundation for the Land Use Plan (Figure LU-4), are included in this section of the Land Use
         Element.
         LAND USE DESIGNATION SYSTEM
         Land use designations are provided in order to define the amount, type, and nature of future
         development that is allowed in a given location of the City. The following section defines each of
         the land use designations shown on the Land Use Plan, as well as the density and intensity
         standards required in accordance with State law. Tables LU-2 and LU-3 provide a summary of
         the land use designations in terms of density, intensity and typical implementation zones. Figure
         LU-5 and Table LU-4 provide more detailed information for those areas of the City subject to
         special density provisions.
         Each of the General Plan land use designations is typically implemented by a defined set of
         zoning designations included in the City’s Zoning Code. The Zoning Code contains the detailed
         regulations pertaining to permitted and conditional uses, site development standards, and
         performance criteria that serve to implement many goals and policies of the General Plan.
         Each of the residential use designations includes a range of allowable densities. The maximum
         density defines the maximum number of dwelling units per gross acre at which development can
         occur within a given residentially-designated area. Any portion of a residential lot designated on
         the Land Use Map as Open Space or any other non-residential designation should not be
         included in calculating density. The determination of precise density is also influenced by site
         location, topography, the development standards contained in the Zoning Code, and other City
         policies, regulations and ordinances. These other considerations may mean that the maximum
         density established by the General Plan land use designation may not be achievable on each
         potential development site.

             CITY OF ANAHEIM
Building intensities for non-residential land uses are measured by floor area ratio (FAR). An FAR
is the ratio of total net floor area of a building to the total lot area. An FAR describes the
intensity of the use on a site and not necessarily the building height or site coverage. It does not
include the area within parking structures used for parking and circulation or open outdoor
storage areas. Figure LU-3 illustrates the concept of the FAR calculation.
Figure LU-3          Floor Area Ratio Example (FAR = 0.50)
Example: On a one-acre parcel (43,560 sq. ft.), a maximum floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.50 equates to a total
building area of 21,780 sq. ft., in either a 1, 2, or 3 story configuration (43,560 sq. ft. multiplied by 0.50 equals
21,780 sq. ft.). Note how low coverage (building footprint) varies significantly as the building height changes to
yield an identical FAR.

  Notes:
  In addition to the typical zoning designations listed above, other zones may be substituted for the typical implementation zones, provided that the overall density ranges established by the General Plan are not exceeded. Additionally, other Specific Plans or Overlay
  Zones may apply, which could further restrict maximum densities. For allowable densities within Specific Plan areas, please refer to the applicable Specific Plan.
  Since allowable uses within the Institutional land use designation vary significantly (e.g., offices, transportation facilities, libraries, community centers, fire stations, etc.), the FAR for the Institutional designation also varies significantly.

Note No. 1: The Disneyland Resort Specific Plan provides for the development of an approximate 489.7
acre international multi-day vacation designation resort including ongoing modifications to the
Disneyland theme park, the development of a new theme park, additional hotels and entertainment
areas, administrative office facilities, new public and private parking facilities, and an internal
transportation system. This development is within five planning Districts (Theme Park, Hotel, Parking,
Future Expansion and District A) and a C-R Overlay, which allows development within the Overlay to
either be consistent with the underlying Resort District or subject to the same land uses as in the
Anaheim Resort Specific Plan No. 92-2 Zone. The Disneyland Resort Specific Plan also identifies
maximum development density designations for hotel/motel development in the Hotel District (up to
5,600 hotel rooms for the entire District with up to 1,000 hotel rooms transferable to the Theme Park
District), in District A (the maximum number of units permitted would be 75 hotel/motel rooms per gross
acre or 75 hotel/motel rooms per parcel existing on June 29, 1993, whichever is greater) and the C-R
Overlay (the maximum number of units permitted on a parcel would be the following: 1) for parcels
designated Low Density – up to 50 hotel rooms per gross acre or 75 rooms, whichever is greater; and 2)
for parcels designated Medium Density – up to 75 hotel rooms per gross acre or 75 rooms, whichever is
greater; provided that for those parcels that are developed with hotel/motel rooms which exceeded the
maximum density designation, the number of rooms existing on the date of adoption of The Disneyland
Resort Specific Plan Ordinance may be rebuilt or modified at their existing density.) It should be noted
that accessory uses may be developed as well as other visitor-serving commercial/retail and restaurant
uses along with these hotel/motel uses. The Disneyland Resort Specific Plan also provides for the
development of the Anaheim GardenWalk project pursuant to the Anaheim GardenWalk Overlay at the
following density and subject to the approval of Conditional Use Permit No. 4078, as amended, to permit
the following: up to 590,265 square feet of specialty retail, restaurants, and entertainment uses,
including movie theaters; 1,628 hotel rooms/suites (including up to 500 vacation ownership units) and
278,817 square feet of hotel accessory uses; a transportation center, and 4,800 parking spaces. The
Anaheim GardenWalk Overlay encompasses District A and the portion of the Parking District (East
Parking Area)/CR Overlay south of Disney Way.

        TABLE LU-4: GENERAL PLAN DENSITY PROVISIONS FOR SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE CITY (CONTINUED)
        Note No. 2: The Anaheim Resort Specific Plan (ARSP) provides for the development of approximately 581.3 acres
        within The Anaheim Resort. The ARSP is divided into two development areas. Development Area No. 1 is referred
        to as the C-R (Commercial Recreation) District which allows for hotels, motels, convention and conference facilities,
        as well as restaurants, retail shops and entertainment facilities. Development Area No. 2 is referred to as the PR
        (Public Recreation) District which encompasses the Anaheim Convention Center and associated parking facilities
        and provides for the orderly use of City-owned property as well as the existing Anaheim Hilton Hotel.
        The C-R District includes two overlays. The Mobilehome Park (MHP) Overlay, which encompasses existing
        mobilehome parks within the C-R District, provides development standards for mobilehome parks and regulations
        and procedures to mitigate relocation concerns and adverse effects of displacement upon mobilehome owners
        when a park is converted to another land use. The Anaheim Resort Residential Overlay, which applies to focused
        areas of the Specific Plan, provides for the incorporation of residential uses into hotel developments when such
        uses are fully integrated into a minimum 300-room full-service hotel.
        The Anaheim Resort Specific Plan also identifies maximum development density designations in the C-R District.
        These designations are based upon hotel/motel development and allow up to 20% of each hotel/motel project gross
        square footage, excluding parking facilities, to be developed with integrated (i.e., included within the main
        hotel/motel complex) accessory uses. These accessory uses will reduce the otherwise maximum permitted
        hotel/motel density at the rate of one hotel/motel room per six hundred (600) gross square feet of accessory use.
        For properties proposed to be developed with permitted and conditionally permitted uses other than hotels/motels
        with accessory uses, the traffic generation characteristics of said uses shall not exceed those associated with the
        otherwise permitted hotel/motel (including accessory uses) density as determined by the City Traffic and
        Transportation Manager prior to Final Site Plan review and approval. The maximum development density for each
        of the designations are as follows:
                 Low Density: up to 50 rooms per gross acre or 75 rooms per lot or parcel, whichever is greater;
                 Low-Medium Density: up to 75 rooms per gross acre or 75 rooms per lot or parcel, whichever is greater;
                 Low-Medium Density (Modified): up to 252 rooms and 75,593 square feet of accessory uses;
                 Medium Density: up to 100 rooms per gross acre or 75 rooms per lot or parcel, whichever is greater; and,
                 Convention Center (CC) Medium Density: up to 125 rooms per gross acre with trip generation
                  characteristics mitigated to the equivalent of 100 rooms per gross acre or 75 rooms per lot or parcel,
                  whichever is greater.
        For those parcels that are developed with hotel/motel rooms which exceed the maximum density designation, the
        number of rooms existing on the date of adoption of the Anaheim Resort Specific Plan Ordinance may be rebuilt or
        modified at their existing density. For projects that are developed in accordance with the Anaheim Resort
        Residential Overlay, the maximum number of dwelling units allowed shall be less than the number of hotel rooms
        proposed and such projects shall not create infrastructure impacts greater than the subject property’s permitted
        hotel/motel density, as permitted by the property’s underlying C-R District density designation unless otherwise
        mitigated through subsequent environmental analysis.
        The maximum development density for the PR District is up to:
                 2,158,363 square feet of convention center/meeting space
                 100,000 square feet of outdoor programmable space
                 2,500 hotel rooms
                 180,000 square feet of commercial space

         Residential Designations
         Anaheim offers a wide range of housing densities and products to meet the demand of current
         and future residents with varying lifestyles. In addition to the characteristics described below, it
         should be noted that other uses may also be allowed in residential areas such as schools, parks,
         child care facilities, and other public/institutional uses that are determined to be compatible with
         and oriented towards the needs of the immediate neighborhood.
         Estate (0-1.5 dwelling units per acre)
         The Estate Density Residential designation provides for the
         development of large-lot single-family residences with a
         custom character. This category is typically implemented by
         the RH-1(SC) and RH-2(SC) zones. Typical development
         consists of single-family lots of 22,000 to 43,560 square
         feet. The permitted density range is from zero up to 1.5               This home in the Hill and Canyon

         Low Density (0-6.5 dwelling units per acre)
         The Low Density Residential designation provides for the
         development of conventional single-family detached
         houses. It is implemented by the RS-1, RS-2, RS-3 and
         RH-3 zones. Typical development consists of single-family
         lots of 5,000 to 10,000 square-feet. The permitted
         density range is from zero up to 6.5 dwelling units per

         Low-Medium Hillside (0-6.0 dwelling units per acre)
         The Low-Medium Hillside Density Residential designation
         provides for the development of both attached and
         detached single-family homes in hillside areas. The
         permitted density range is from zero up to 6 dwelling units
         per gross acre. Although the maximum density is similar
         to the Low Density Residential designation, the character
         of development can vary significantly. Lot sizes in these            This group of single-family homes is

Mixed-Use Designation
Mixed-Use
Areas designated as Mixed-Use are designed to function
differently from the typical patterns of individual, segregated
land uses. Uses and activities are designed together in an
integrated fashion to create a dynamic urban environment that
serves as the center of activity for the surrounding area. The
designation provides opportunities for an integrated mix of
residential, retail, service, entertainment and office
opportunities in a pedestrian-friendly environment. Because of
                                                                       The adaptive reuse of the

perhaps, second floors, supported by residential and/or office
uses above, is the typical pattern of vertically mixed land use. Uses may also be mixed in a
horizontal, or multi-use, pattern. For example, freestanding structures may consist of a single
use adjacent to structures with different uses on the same or adjacent parcel. Stand-alone uses
within a multi-use project need to be integrated into an overall project design and connected to
other adjoining uses by plazas, promenades, and landscaped corridors, and should include
common architectural themes and signage. Typical residential uses could include apartments,
live-work units, town homes, flats and artist-style lofts. Residential development in these areas
emphasizes quality and offers a variety of amenities. Structured parking is an essential
component in most-mixed-use developments.
The scale, size and mixture of uses in the mixed-use areas vary based upon the character of the
surrounding area. Depending upon a project’s location, the Mixed-Use designation is
implemented by one of three Zoning Code districts: the Downtown Mixed-Use Overlay; The
Platinum Triangle Mixed-Use Overlay; and, for areas outside of The Platinum Triangle or
Downtown areas, the Mixed-Use Overlay Zone.
Non-Residential Mixed-Use
The purpose of the Non-Residential Mixed-Use designation is to encourage a mix of commercial
and office uses, but prohibit residential uses in certain areas, where residential uses are not
compatible with surrounding land uses. This designation is limited to Anaheim Canyon Specific
Plan area. All uses, densities and intensities, other than residential uses, that are permitted by
the Mixed-Use designation are allowed within the Non-Residential Mixed-Use designation.
Zoning provisions for this designation are included in the Anaheim Canyon Specific Plan (SP-
2015-1).

         Public and Quasi-Public Facilities Designations
         Schools
         The Schools designation identifies existing public and larger, established private schools,
         including elementary, junior and high schools. Schools designated on the Land Use Plan are
         either existing facilities or known planned facilities. Future schools may be developed in other
         land use designations through procedures established in the Zoning Code. Trade schools or
         other job training facilities may be developed in various non-residential land use areas under the
         procedures established in the Zoning Code.
         Institutional (Up to 3.00 FAR)
         The Institutional designation includes a wide range of public and quasi-public uses, including
         government offices, transportation facilities, public or private colleges and universities, public
         utilities, hospitals, large assisted living facilities, community centers, museums and public
         libraries. To the extent possible, institutional facilities should be clustered in activity centers to
         support other similar uses and benefit from access to various modes of transportation.
         Institutional uses designated on the Land Use Plan are
         either existing facilities or known planned facilities.
         Additional uses, including assembly areas and day care
         facilities, may be developed in other land use
         designations under the procedures established in the
         Zoning Code. The maximum floor area ratio reflects
         the potential for high-rise offices used by governmental
         or quasi-public agencies. Additional intensity                       The Institutional designation covers a

         Two types of railroad operations serve travelers in
         Anaheim – passenger rail and commuter rail. The
         Southern California Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA) and
         the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA)
         provide commuter rail service via Metrolink while Amtrak
         provides passenger rail service. In addition, the
         Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) and the Southern
         Pacific Transportation Company (SPTC) provide                      Metrolink railroad running through the

         Railroads are identified on the Land Use Map because of their relationship with adjacent uses.
         While railroads provide a valuable service by transporting people and goods, they can also
         impact residential neighborhoods and other sensitive land uses due to the noise and vibration
         associated with rail activity. Strategies to improve access to these facilities and minimize their

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
potentially negative effects on sensitive uses are addressed in the Circulation and Noise
Elements.
Intermodal Transportation Center
Anaheim is pursuing a major intermodal transportation center in The Platinum Triangle. The
intermodal transportation center would fit into the urban, mixed-use environment planned for
The Platinum Triangle, providing a multitude of transportation options for residents, employees
and visitors of The Platinum Triangle and nearby Anaheim Resort area. The transportation
center would be one of three major transportation centers located in Southern California, along
with Union Station in Los Angeles and the Ontario International Airport in Ontario. The center
would expand existing transportation infrastructure for Amtrak intercity rail, Metrolink commuter
rail, Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle service, and vehicular and bicycle modes. Five planned rail
and bus services would be added into the hub, providing seamless intermodal access via the
planned California-Nevada Super Speed Train, California High Speed Rail, Express Bus and Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) systems.
Open Space and Recreation Designations
The following open space and recreation land use designations identify Anaheim’s major scenic,
wildlife and recreational features on the Land Use Map. Standards for ancillary development
within these areas are detailed in the Zoning Code and relevant Specific Plans. A comprehensive
set of policies regarding the creation, protection and enhancement of these areas is provided in
the Green Element.
Open Space
The Open Space land use designation includes those areas intended to remain in natural open
space; utility easements that will provide recreational and trail access to Anaheim’s residents;
heavily landscaped freeway remnant parcels, and land areas surrounding major water features.
Parks
The Parks designation allows for active and passive recreational uses such as parks, trails, athletic
fields, interpretive centers and golf courses.
Water Uses
The Water Uses designation applies to water bodies, such as the Santa Ana River, lakes, and
reservoirs, and other water-related uses such as flood control channels and drainage basins.
PLAN OBJECTIVES
Several objectives have been developed to guide the future development of Anaheim, including
those pertaining to several Community Policy Areas within the City. The following objectives
summarize the general land use objectives that guide the development of the Land Use Plan and
set the foundation for the Goals and Policies section of this Element. Discussion of Community
Page LU-30 | May 2004

                                                                               LAND USE ELEMENT
         Policy Areas and their respective goals and policies is found at the end of the Goals and Policies
         section.
         It is important to note that many other important and related objectives, such as beautifying
         Anaheim, keeping Anaheim a safe place, and maintaining high levels of City services, are
         addressed throughout other Elements of the General Plan.
         Objective: Plan for and accommodate projected growth
         The ability to plan for and accommodate the City’s projected growth is key to maintaining a
         stable, diversified economy, ensuring an adequate transportation system, and enhancing the
         quality of life for residents. The City uses a wide array of tools, including socioeconomic data,
         market analysis, infrastructure and transportation impact analyses and other data to help plan for
         Anaheim’s Future. The use of such tools was an important component in the preparation of this
         Element.
         Objective: Clarify land use designations
         The Geographic Information System (GIS) based format of the Land Use Plan provides specificity
         in terms of identifying and understanding the land use designation established for individual
         properties and gives the City an increased ability to analyze land use patterns and acreage,
         estimate development projections, and understand potential traffic, infrastructure, environmental
         and fiscal impacts. The objective is to provide the public with a reliable estimate of the type and
         intensity of land uses allowed on their property and on surrounding properties and to provide
         them with a general image of how an area is intended to develop.
         It is important to note that, in addition to the location and types of density and intensity
         described in the Land Use Element, policies regarding the quality of future development will be
         addressed through the Community Design Element and the Anaheim Colony Vision, Principles
         and Design Guidelines, and the Zoning Code.
         Objective: Implement the Anaheim Vision through the Land Use Plan
         In preparing this General Plan, the City, through extensive community input, developed the
         “Anaheim Vision” which provides the framework for the General Plan. Its introductory statement
         describes the City’s vision as “… a mosaic of diverse people and thriving unified neighborhoods
         joined together by beautiful, accessible open spaces and well-landscaped roadways offering
         enhanced mobility for people and goods; safe place to live, work and play; quality educational
         opportunities; engaging gathering places; world class entertainment; recreational, spiritual, and
         cultural amenities available for all; and a variety of economic opportunities for its workforce.”
         The Land Use Element, together with the other General Plan Elements, strives to implement this
         vision by:
May 2004                                                          City of Anaheim General Plan | Page LU-31

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
    Providing and enhancing the City’s image by encouraging new residential development along
     underutilized commercial corridors, concentrating and enhancing commercial uses at
     strategic intersections; creating new recognizable mixed-use areas, including the Downtown
     and The Platinum Triangle areas; protecting historic areas and residential neighborhoods
     from incompatible land uses; and protecting natural and open space resources;
    Providing a variety of residential land uses that offer diverse housing opportunities for
     Anaheim’s equally diverse population;
    Providing open space and recreational opportunities in close proximity to neighborhoods;
    Reducing traffic impacts and encouraging alternative means of transportation by identifying
     land uses that are conducive to transit use or that minimize distances between residential,
     shopping and employment centers thereby encouraging pedestrian or bicycle travel;
    Promoting economic development by intensifying development potential in economic
     centers, identifying new residential development in proximity to these centers, and by
     ensuring a well-balanced mix of employment related land uses; and
    Preserving the historic character of the Anaheim Colony by limiting higher density land uses
     in historical, single-family residential neighborhoods.
Objective: Preserve the integrity of existing single-family neighborhoods
As housing demand and land values continue to rise in Orange County, it is anticipated there will
be increasing trends toward higher density residential development. Planning for these trends
can be seen as challenging given the objective of preserving the integrity of single-family
neighborhoods, the staple of Anaheim’s character.
To address these potentially competing objectives, however, the Land Use Plan identifies new
areas for infill residential development that can be developed without compromising the integrity
of Anaheim’s established single-family neighborhoods. By strategically locating future multiple-
family development in appropriate areas coupled with additional guidance provided by the
Community Design Element aimed at enhancing the character of single-family neighborhoods
and ensuring quality multiple-family development, the Land Use Plan addresses this objective.
Objective: Revitalize neighborhood edges
Strip malls and stand-alone retail uses line many of the City’s arterial corridors and form the
edges of many neighborhoods, particularly in the western half of the City. A number of these
neighborhood edges, however, are adjacent to underutilized commercial developments that
detract from the image and character of surrounding neighborhoods. The Land Use Element
strives to revitalize neighborhood edges by introducing a residential designation, Corridor
Residential, to facilitate the conversion of the City’s underutilized commercial areas into housing
opportunity sites. Concurrently, specific goals and policies focus commercial uses at key
intersections to take advantage of the exposure and accessibility offered by such locations.
Page LU-32 | May 2004

                                                                              LAND USE ELEMENT
         Objective: Plan land uses that preserve and enhance Anaheim’s economic
         assets
         Anaheim enjoys a diversified economic base offering economic opportunities through tourism,
         entertainment, retail, office and industrial activity. The City is also home to a number of major
         economic centers, including The Anaheim Resort, The Platinum Triangle, and Anaheim Canyon.
         These areas represent key economic assets that must be preserved and enhanced for the long-
         term economic health of the City. The Land Use Element offers a variety of employment
         generating land uses in these areas to ensure their vitality.
         In The Anaheim Resort, the Commercial Recreation land use designation reflects the visitor-
         oriented nature of the area. The plan also extends this designation along Harbor Boulevard,
         south of Orangewood Avenue, to create a visible, unified entry from the City’s southern border.
         In The Platinum Triangle, a vibrant mix of higher intensity office, retail and residential land use
         designations is intended to create an extremely dynamic urban place with well-integrated
         opportunities for housing, employment, shopping, entertainment and social interaction. The
         Platinum Triangle is envisioned to become the economic center of the region with a unique
         urban appeal and identity.
         The Land Use Plan enhances Anaheim Canyon’s industrial base with limited, strategically located
         office and mixed uses that take advantage of the area’s location, visibility and access.
May 2004                                                         City of Anaheim General Plan | Page LU-33

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
Objective: Ensure compatibility between adjacent land uses
One of the primary purposes of land use planning is to ensure compatibility between adjacent
land uses. A number of uses, including industrial and commercial, are strategically located in
order to reduce the potential for conflict between these uses and residential neighborhoods.
Also, as infill development intensifies and the potential for land use conflict arise, the need for
strategic land use planning and impact mitigation increases in importance. The Land Use
Element distributes land uses to minimize these impacts and, combined with the other General
Plan elements and the Zoning Code, the potential for conflict is minimized.
Objective: Create dynamic, identifiable places
Residents and visitors enjoy communities they consider special, communities that provide a
unique identity, create a “sense of place,” enhance social interaction, and foster civic pride. The
growing popularity of revitalized downtowns, new mixed-use urban villages and walkable
neighborhoods provide ample testimony to this growing desire to create and define special
places.
The Land Use Plan provides for the creation or enhancement of many such special places. It lays
the land use foundation for making Downtown the cultural, historic and civic center of Anaheim
and creating an extremely dynamic urban place in The Platinum Triangle, with well-integrated
opportunities for housing, employment, shopping, entertainment and social interaction on a scale
never before seen in Anaheim.
The Land Use Plan alone, however, will not create these dynamic, identifiable places. Special
policies related to land use and design are essential to ensuring a high level of quality as these
places develop. The Community Policy Areas section of the Element focuses on individual areas
of Anaheim, identifies the unique places within each area, and provides policies that foster their
development. Furthermore, the Community Design Element provides more detailed goals,
policies and guidelines that will help create and enhance the special character of these places.
Objective: Take advantage of existing and proposed transit corridors while
minimizing traffic impacts
Anaheim’s freeway and transportation corridors move thousands of residents, employees and
visitors past homes and businesses every day. Accordingly, lands adjacent to these corridors
offer improved commercial and employment opportunities due to their visibility and accessibility.
The City has recognized these opportunities in the past as evidenced by Anaheim’s established
land use pattern. The Land Use Plan continues this trend and seeks to maximize opportunities
along these corridors.
The Platinum Triangle is a prime example of an area that takes advantage of its multiple
transportation opportunities. With excellent freeway access provided by the Santa Ana (I-5) and
Orange (SR-57) Freeways and the nearby Garden Grove (SR-22) Freeway, a well-developed
circulation network of arterial highways and Metrolink access adjacent to the Angel Stadium of

                                                                              LAND USE ELEMENT
         Anaheim, the area is well-served by various modes of transportation. Taking advantage of these
         transportation opportunities, as well as the area’s proximity to The Anaheim Resort, the Land
         Use Plan identifies the area as a major economic center that brings people together in an
         integrated mix of office, retail, entertainment and residential opportunities.
         Another example of an area that capitalizes on its transportation opportunities is Anaheim
         Canyon. The Anaheim Canyon Specific Plan recognizes the area’s history as an important
         industrial corridor, but it also provides for additional uses that take advantage of its current
         transportation options. The Plan provides for mixed-use development adjacent to Anaheim
         Canyon Metrolink Station and identifies office uses in strategic locations along La Palma Avenue.
         These locations also take advantage of the visibility and access to the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway.
         LAND USE BUILDOUT ANALYSIS
         Providing a blueprint for the future development of Anaheim is one of the primary purposes of
         the General Plan. The Land Use Plan, which includes areas within Anaheim’s sphere-of-
         influence, identifies 16,519 acres of residential land uses, 659 acres of residential mixed-use
         land uses, and 5,619 acres of other employment-generating land uses. Assuming a probable
         intensity for each of the land use designations, the land use plan provides for 137,954 dwelling
         units (see Table LU-5). Based on a factor of 3.3 persons per household (1.5 per household in
         mixed-use areas), the estimated build-out population of the Land Use Plan would be 407,463
         persons.
         Of the employment-generating land uses, the land use plan provides for a total of 1,121 acres of
         Neighborhood, Regional and General Commercial uses, 532 acres of office uses, and 2,684
         acres of industrial uses and 707 acres of residential and non-residential mixed mixed-use.
         Combined these land use designations would generate approximately 228,470 jobs using the
         probable intensity factors (FARs) for each non-residential land use designation (see Table LU-6).
         Additional employment opportunities will also be provided by the implementation of the
         Commercial Recreation land use designation through the Anaheim Resort, Disneyland Resort and
         Hotel Circle Plans.

Notes:
The number of dwelling units for each designation is calculated by adding the number of existing dwelling units in areas of the City that
are not anticipated to change to the number of units that are calculated by multiplying the gross acres of areas that are most likely to
change by the probable residential densities.
Dwelling units in areas not anticipated to change are the number of dwelling units in areas that are not likely to be further subdivided or
areas that have a fixed buildout capacity through a specific plan. These are determined by: 1) adding the number of parcels in areas that
are not likely to further subdivide; or 2) by referencing the number of units expected at buildout for areas addressed through specific
plans (see Table LU-1 for a list of the City’s specific plans).
The Areas of the City with Special Density Limitations, as shown on Figure LU-5 and described in Table LU-4, that are planned for
residential development are shown as a separate category on the table and include the following:

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
Goals & Policies
The following section describes land use goals and policies that, in conjunction with the
Land Use Plan and accompanying density and intensity standards, guide future land
development of the City. Goals and policies are divided into two subsections: those that
apply Citywide and those that apply to specific Community Policy Areas.
In addition to these goals and policies, it is important to note that additional land use
direction is provided through other General Plan Elements, the zoning code, and
redevelopment plans.
CITYWIDE GOALS AND POLICIES
Neighborhoods
Neighborhoods in Anaheim are a major source of pride for residents and are defined by
the quality of their homes, the diversity of their residents, the beauty of their
streetscapes, and the availability of and access to, open space and recreation
opportunities.
Most of the City’s neighborhoods provide a high quality living environment for their
residents. As neighborhoods age, however, it is important for the City to proactively
create partnerships with residents, apartment owners and other “neighborhood
stakeholders” to implement ongoing efforts in preserving the quality of life within
neighborhoods.
As stated in the Anaheim Vision, “Anaheim is a mosaic comprised of a variety of unique
neighborhoods with distinguishable character that, when viewed as a whole, create a
strong, positive image.” It is the intent of the Land Use Element and Land Use Plan to
supplement on-going land use-related programs, Zoning Code development standards,
and other General Plan policies to ensure that existing and future neighborhoods are
consistent with the Vision.

                                                                     LAND USE ELEMENT
         GOAL 1.1:
         Preserve and enhance the quality and character of Anaheim’s mosaic of unique
         neighborhoods.
         Policies:
                  1) Actively pursue development standards and design policies to preserve and
                      enhance the quality and character of Anaheim’s many neighborhoods.
                  2) Ensure that new development is designed in a manner that preserves the
                      quality of life in existing neighborhoods.
                  3) Encourage future development to provide functional public spaces that foster
                      social interaction.
                  4) Continue to implement the City’s interdepartmental neighborhood
                      improvement efforts in working with neighborhood stakeholders to create
                      and implement long term plans for the most physically and socio-
                      economically “challenged” neighborhoods.
         Housing Opportunities
         Growth projections indicate that Anaheim will grow from a population of over 330,000
         in 2004 to a population of nearly 400,000 by the year 2030. As the City continues to
         mature, there will be a need to continue to offer a wide variety of housing opportunities
         for Anaheim’s increasingly diverse community. Through the General Plan, Anaheim
         offers a wide variety of housing, including estate homes in the Hill and Canyon Area,
         suburban single-family neighborhoods throughout the City, as well as a diversity of
         multiple-family housing neighborhoods.
         Most of the General Plan policies regarding housing are addressed in the Housing
         Element. The purpose of the Housing Element is to maintain, preserve, improve and
         develop a proper balance of housing. The following Land Use Element policies identified
         in Goal 2.1 are intended to support the goals and policies of the Housing Element and
         are reflected in the Land Use Plan.
         GOAL 2.1:
         Continue to provide a variety of quality housing opportunities to address the City’s
         diverse housing needs.
         Policies:
                  1) Facilitate new residential development on vacant or underutilized infill
                      parcels.
May 2004                                                         City of Anaheim General Plan | Page LU-39

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
         2) Facilitate new residential development in The Platinum Triangle and
              Downtown.
         3) Facilitate the conversion of the City’s underutilized strip commercial areas
              into new housing opportunity sites.
         4) Encourage the development and integration of residential land uses into
              mixed-use development where appropriate.
         5) Encourage a mix of quality housing opportunities in employment-rich and
              transit accessible locations.
         6) Ensure quality development through appropriate development standards and
              by adherence to related Community Design Element policies and guidelines.
Corridors
Public perception of a community is often times influenced by the quality and character
of a City’s streetscape. While the City continues to pursue a variety of programs aimed at
enhancing the appearance of its corridors (e.g. utility undergrounding, landscape
improvements, entry monumentation, etc.), additional policies can serve to supplement
these efforts.
The following goals and policies are not an exhaustive guide to shaping the future of
Anaheim’s corridors. Rather, they focus on land use strategies only. Strategies to
improve their appearance are found in the Community Design Element; strategies to
improve their economic performance are discussed in the Economic Development
Element, and policies related to the landscaping of corridors are found in the Green
Element.
GOAL 3.1:
Pursue land uses along major corridors that enhance the City’s image and stimulate
appropriate development at strategic locations.
Policies:
         1) Designate existing underutilized mid-block commercial uses for residential
              development or other alternate land uses, where appropriate.
         2) Concentrate commercial uses at key intersections.
         3) Ensure quality development along corridors through adherence to
              established development standards and Community Design Element goals,
              policies and guidelines.

                                                                   LAND USE ELEMENT
                  4) Continue to pursue additional open space, recreation, and landscaping
                      amenities along major transportation routes.
         GOAL 3.2:
         Maximize development opportunities along transportation routes.
         Policies:
                  1) Where appropriate, designate land adjacent to freeways, proposed Bus Rapid
                      Transit stops and Metrolink stations for employment intensive land uses.
                  2) Support the development of a Bus Rapid Transit System in the City that
                      provides transit access to commercial and office development opportunities.
                  3) Encourage and provide incentives for the consolidation of parcels to create
                      development sites that are large enough to support quality development.
         Compatibility
         In a diverse City such as Anaheim, with its mix of residential, industrial, office and
         commercial land uses, achieving land use compatibility can be a delicate process. For
         instance, unless properly designed and mitigated, a number of uses, including industrial,
         commercial, and transportation facilities, can have potentially adverse effects upon
         adjacent residential neighborhoods or sensitive habitat areas. Potential impacts of
         commercial and industrial development, so important to Anaheim’s economy, must be
         balanced with the needs of residential neighborhoods. Site planning, orientation of uses
         on site and buffering between adjacent properties will all be necessary to continue to
         achieve land use compatibility in Anaheim.
         Furthermore, the utility easements and roadways that traverse the City can serve as a
         buffer between otherwise conflicting land uses, and can be used to link areas of the
         community together. In addition, Anaheim’s multi-modal transportation system, with its
         obvious benefit of moving people and goods, will need to be carefully managed in order
         to minimize impacts upon adjacent development.
         It should be noted that policies related to the integration and buffering of land uses are
         also incorporated into the Community Design Element.
         GOAL 4.1:
         Promote development that integrates with and minimizes impacts to surrounding land
         uses.
         Policies:
                  1) Ensure that land uses develop in accordance with the Land Use Plan and
                      Zoning Code in an effort to attain land use compatibility.
May 2004                                                       City of Anaheim General Plan | Page LU-41

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
         2) Promote compatible development through adherence to Community Design
             Element policies and guidelines.
         3) Ensure that developers consider and address project impacts upon
             surrounding neighborhoods during the design and development process.
         4) Require new or expanded uses to provide mitigation or buffers between
             existing uses where potential adverse impacts could occur.
         5) Discourage additional multiple-family development in existing single-family
             neighborhoods.
         6) Require landscape and/or open space buffers to maintain a natural edge for
             proposed private development directly adjacent to natural, public open
             space areas.
Creating Identifiable Places
Creating identifiable places where people can gather, shop, socialize and “people watch”
is an important ingredient in achieving the Anaheim Vision. Fortunately, identifiable
places are emerging throughout the City and will continue into the future. Downtown
has witnessed revitalization as the historic, artistic, cultural and civic center of Anaheim;
The Anaheim Resort is known throughout the United States and the world for its tourist-
related development and convention center; and it is envisioned that The Platinum
Triangle will become a thriving live, work and play destination.
Land use policies for specific places are addressed in the Community Policy Areas
section of this Element. In addition to the Land Use Element policies, the Community
Design Element and the Vision, Principles and Guidelines for The Platinum Triangle and
the Colony provide extensive policies and guidelines for creating special places.
GOAL 5.1:
Create and enhance dynamic, identifiable places for the benefit of Anaheim residents,
employees and visitors.
Policies:
         1) Encourage mixed-use and commercial development that provides:
             a) Safe, protected places for pedestrians to walk;
             b) Attractive surroundings;
             c) Opportunities for social interaction;
             d) Comfortable places to sit and relax; and
Page LU-42 | May 2004

                                                                    LAND USE ELEMENT
                     e) Interplay between the interior uses of buildings and outdoor activities,
                          such as sidewalk cafes or tastefully designed outdoor merchandise
                          displays.
                  2) Facilitate the development of residential land uses into mixed-use areas to
                     provide a consumer and employment base for commercial and office uses.
                  3) Mixed-use and commercial centers should be physically linked with adjacent
                     residential neighborhoods.
                  4) Promote development that is efficient, pedestrian-friendly, and served by a
                     variety of transportation options.
         Redevelopment and Revitalization
         As the City continues to mature and approach build-out, vacant land for new
         development will be limited and developed areas will continue to mature. Protecting and
         building upon Anaheim’s assets to capitalize on current and future growth dynamics will
         require redevelopment and revitalization strategies to enhance existing uses and bring
         new development to Anaheim. A more thorough discussion of redevelopment as an
         economic development strategy is addressed in the Economic Development Element.
         The following goal and policies are focused on land use.
         GOAL 6.1:
         Enhance the quality of life and economic vitality in Anaheim through strategic infill
         development and revitalization of existing development.
         Policies:
                  1) Continue to provide special incentives and improvement programs (e.g.,
                     density bonuses, parking requirement reductions, low interest home
                     improvements loans, Neighborhood Improvement Program, etc.) to
                     revitalize residential neighborhoods, major business corridors and
                     employment centers.
                  2) Promote the assembly of parcels to allow for more efficient development
                     patterns wherever adjacent neighborhoods are not adversely impacted.
                  3) Continue on-going code enforcement efforts to ensure acceptable property
                     maintenance standards.
                  4) Continue collaboration with the County of Orange to achieve acceptable
                     development quality within unincorporated land located in Anaheim’s
                     sphere-of-influence.
May 2004                                                        City of Anaheim General Plan | Page LU-43

             CITY OF ANAHEIM
           5) Maintain on-going relationships with businesses, property owners and
               residents to facilitate quality infill development.
Jobs-Housing Relationship
Due to the strength of the City’s economic activity centers, Anaheim has become an
increasingly “job rich” city. According to the Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG), a jurisdiction that will achieve a jobs-housing ratio of over 1.35
by the year 2025 will generally be considered “job-rich.”
Orange County is projected to have a jobs-to-housing ratio of 1.90 in 2025, becoming
the greatest job rich subregion. Consistent with that ratio, Anaheim will achieve a
projected jobs-to-housing ratio of 1.94 based on the Land Use Plan. The estimated ratio
is generally consistent with Orange County Projections-2000 (Center for Demographic
Research at California State University at Fullerton), which projects a jobs-to-housing
ratio of 2.18 for Anaheim in the year 2030.
To address the balance between jobs and housing, the Land Use Plan identifies several
strategies, many of which are discussed previously in the Housing Opportunities section
and others that are addressed in the Housing Element, to provide more housing
opportunities.
It is important to note that, given the “built-out” nature of the City, opportunities to
address jobs-housing balance are somewhat limited. The Land Use Plan identifies the
following areas where opportunities for increased residential development do exist:
     The Platinum Triangle. This area, as described later in the Community Policy Areas
      section of the Land Use Element, is intended to become a dynamic, integrated mix of
      land uses in an urban, pedestrian-friendly environment. Previous plans for the area
      also called for a mix of uses, but prohibited residential uses. The General Plan Land
      Use Plan calls for the inclusion of high-quality, high-density residential uses, in a
      mixed-use setting, to provide housing opportunities for this core employment area.
     Downtown. The Land Use Plan introduces residential                For a comprehensive
      uses in a mixed-use setting to the Downtown core area.           discussion of design policies
                                                                       and guidelines relating to The
      Residential uses will provide new opportunities for people       Platinum Triangle, Downtown,
      who are looking to live in a new, safe, pedestrian friendly      Corridor Residential Uses and
                                                                       other mixed-use areas, please

     Corridor Residential Uses. The Land Use Plan designates
      several mid-block areas along the City’s arterial streets for residential uses. These
      are intended to provide new residential opportunities to East and West Anaheim in
      lieu of underutilized mid-block commercial uses. Residential uses will be carefully
      designed to integrate with surrounding communities and adjacent commercial areas.
Page LU-44 | May 2004

                                                                     LAND USE ELEMENT
            Other Mixed-Use Areas. In addition to the Downtown and Platinum Triangle, the
             Land Use Plan identifies a handful of other mixed-use areas (e.g., North Euclid Street
             adjacent to the North Orange County Community College, adjacent to the Anaheim
             Canyon Metrolink Station, and at the intersection of State College Boulevard and
             Lincoln Avenue) located along some of the City’s major transportation corridors.
             These areas will provide for new residential uses in close proximity to employment,
             retail and/or entertainment opportunities.
         GOAL 7.1:
         Address the jobs-housing relationship by developing housing near job centers and
         transportation facilities.
         Policies:
                  1) Address the jobs-housing balance through the development of housing in
                      proximity to local job centers.
                  2) Develop housing that addresses the need of the City’s diverse employment
                      base.
                  3) Promote new residential development within Downtown, The Platinum
                      Triangle, and other mixed-use districts, in accordance with the Land Use
                      Plan.
                  4) Continue to pursue infill residential development opportunities at mid-block
                      locations along the City’s arterial streets as an alternative to underutilized
                      commercial land uses.

            CITY OF ANAHEIM
COMMUNITY POLICY AREAS
As stated in the Anaheim Vision, Anaheim is “a mosaic of diverse people and thriving
unified neighborhoods.” This section of the Land Use Element provides goals and
policies focused towards individual neighborhoods or areas of the City. As part of the
Land Use Element, these policies focus on land use issues. Together with the other
Elements of the General Plan and the Zoning Code, and ongoing neighborhood and
capital improvement programs, these goals and policies will help create, preserve and
enhance these community policy areas.
The Hill and Canyon Area
Since the 1960s, the Hill and Canyon Area has become home to thousands of hillside
residents and one of Orange County’s most desired communities. Scenic views, well-
planned residential development, access to a variety of natural, scenic and recreational
resources like the Santa Ana River, Deer Canyon Park Preserve and the Anaheim Hills
Golf Course, all contribute to the sense of pride felt by area residents. The General Plan
seeks to preserve those characteristics that make the Hill and Canyon Area a special
place and to provide current and future residents with adequate community services and
facilities. It is further intended to encourage and maintain living areas which preserve the
amenities of hillside living and retain the overall lower density, semi-rural, uncongested
character of the Santa Ana Canyon Area.
The area is also home to the Mountain Park Specific Plan area, located in Gypsum
Canyon south of the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway. This development will provide a mix of
residential uses; one school site; one neighborhood park site; and approximately 2,100
acres of open space.

                                                                   LAND USE ELEMENT
         GOAL 8.1:
         Preserve natural, scenic and recreational resources; continue to ensure residential
         neighborhoods are safe, well-maintained, places to live; and continue to provide
         necessary community services and facilities.
         Policies:
                  1) Encourage the preservation of scenic vistas and views through Green
                      Element Policies and Zoning Code development standards.
                  2) Use existing utility line easements for open space and/or trail connections
                      (enhance with landscaping where feasible).
                  3) Provide adequate passive and active park and recreational resources through
                      the goals and policies of the Green Element.
                  4) Ensure quality development through the policies and guidelines of the
                      Community Design Element and Zoning Code development standards.
                  5) Maintain and upgrade conditions of existing commercial areas to ensure that
                      they remain competitive with commercial facilities located outside the City.
                  6) Continue to work with Caltrans and OCTA to protect residential
                      neighborhoods from bypass traffic impacts associated with congested
                      conditions on the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway.
         West Anaheim
         Generally encompassing all of
         the areas located west of Euclid
         Street, West Anaheim is home
         to a variety of residential
         neighborhoods and commercial
         areas. Many of the residential
         neighborhoods continue to
         thrive as evidenced by their
         upkeep and strong resident
         pride.
         As the area’s housing stock and
         commercial areas continue to
         age, the need to revitalize
         portions of West Anaheim has
         grown. In response, the City has designated much of West Anaheim, particularly along
         its commercial corridors, as a redevelopment project area. Efforts to improve West
May 2004                                                       City of Anaheim General Plan | Page LU-47

           CITY OF ANAHEIM
Anaheim have included City-initiated commercial and residential redevelopment projects,
extensive outreach with West Anaheim stakeholders, detailed market studies, corridor
landscape programs, and neighborhood improvement programs, among others. The
General Plan and Land Use Plan recognize these efforts and provide comprehensive
policies to strengthen the character and image of West Anaheim.
GOAL 9.1:
Establish and maintain a uniquely identifiable well-balanced community that is an
attractive and safe place to live, work, visit, learn and retire, supported by quality, family-
oriented neighborhoods and businesses.
Policies:
         1) Revitalize neighborhoods targeted through the City’s Neighborhood
             Improvement Program consistent with approved improvement plans.
         2) Consolidate retail development into premium locations and replace declining
             mid-block commercial areas with residential and community-serving civic
             uses.
         3) Develop the former Lincoln Landfill into a vibrant commercial center.
         4) Provide recreation, bicycle and pedestrian circulation opportunities on
             powerline easements (e.g., the easement running north-south between
             Magnolia Avenue and Dale Street).
         5) Maintain and enforce development standards and Community Design
             Element policies and guidelines that promote high quality development.
         6) Continue to improve the local streetscape to enhance economic viability of
             the area, including the implementation of the Lincoln Avenue Master
             Landscape Plan.
         7) Preserve single-family neighborhoods and encourage residential development
             that promotes home ownership.
North Euclid Street
Generally located on both sides of Euclid Street between the Riverside (SR-91) Freeway
to the north and the Santa Ana (I-5) Freeway to the south, the north Euclid Street area
serves as a major gateway into the City. Euclid Street and La Palma Avenue serve as the
primary transportation spine and frame several multiple-family and single-family
neighborhoods.
Page LU-48 | May 2004

                                                                  LAND USE ELEMENT
         Established in 2002, the North Orange
         County Community College District’s Anaheim
         Campus is located here, just north of La Palma
         Avenue and west of Euclid Street. The College
         provides a variety of educational opportunities
         for Anaheim’s residents and workforce. As
         Anaheim’s only public college, the campus
         draws a variety of the City’s residents and
         employees, as well as those from surrounding
         communities, and serves as a potential catalyst
         for future development.
         GOAL 10.1:
         Create new development opportunities that work synergistically with the North Orange
         County Community College and that enhance the area’s image as a City gateway.
         Policies:
                  1) Promote uses around the North Orange County Community College site that
                      maximize the school’s potential as an activity center that draws students and
                      employees to the area.

East Anaheim
East Anaheim is home to several
single- and multiple-family
neighborhoods. Like West Anaheim,
many neighborhoods continue to
thrive, but some neighborhoods and
commercial areas have experienced a
decline in vitality and appearance.
The Land Use Plan encourages a mix
of residential uses along State
College Boulevard and Lincoln
Avenue to stimulate quality
residential development at mid-block
locations and retail opportunities at
key intersections. In addition, the
Land Use Plan provides for a new,
pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use
neighborhood at the northwest
corner of State College Boulevard
and Lincoln Avenue, as an alternative to existing land uses.
GOAL 11.1:
Preserve and enhance the character of East Anaheim neighborhoods and revitalize aging
multiple-family residential neighborhoods and commercial areas.
Policies:
         1) Revitalize multiple-family neighborhoods targeted through the
             Neighborhood Improvement Program.
         2) Ensure quality development and enhance the area’s image through Zoning
             Code standards and Community Design Element policies and guidelines.
         3) Convert underutilized commercial development along Lincoln Avenue and
             State College Boulevard to a mix of residential land uses.
         4) Expand the City park adjacent to Lincoln School to create an enhanced open
             space amenity along Lincoln Avenue.
         5) Pursue landscaping and entryway treatments along Lincoln Avenue between
             East Street and the eastern City limits.

         North Central Industrial Area
         Generally located between Harbor
         Boulevard and Raymond Avenue,
         straddling the Riverside (SR-91)
         Freeway, the North Central Industrial
         Area is an older, established industrial
         area and is adjacent to a residential
         neighborhood located north of La
         Palma Avenue, west of Olive Street. In
         an effort to improve the area, the City
         adopted the North Central Industrial
         Area Redevelopment Plan in .
         Older heavy industrial uses in the area
         have gradually transitioned to lighter,
         cleaner industrial uses. Addressing
         compatibility issues between
         established residential and industrial uses will remain a priority for the area.
         The potential for the continued expansion of La Palma Park will provide the City with an
         opportunity to provide surrounding residential neighborhoods with added park and
         recreational facilities. The Land Use Plan also identifies a mixed-use area along La Palma
         Avenue to take advantage of future transit opportunities.
         GOAL 12.1:
         Encourage the on-going transition of the North Central Industrial Area into a high-
         quality light industrial area that is sensitive to adjacent residential neighborhoods.
         Policies:
                   1) Pursue various neighborhood improvements (e.g., continued
                       undergrounding of utility lines, continuous sidewalks and links to nearby
                       retail centers and transit stops, additional landscaping along arterial streets,
                       enhanced entryways into neighborhoods, etc.) to improve the livability of
                       existing residential areas.

         2) Encourage the on-going transition of heavy industrial uses to “cleaner” light
              industrial uses pursuant to the Zoning Code and General Plan land use
              designations.
         3) Require development standards that provide adequate physical buffers
              between existing residential uses and expanded or future industrial uses.
         4) Support OCTA’s efforts to provide enhanced bus service along La Palma
              Avenue and intensify land uses in close proximity to Bus Rapid Transit
              stop(s).
         5) Preserve the industrial integrity of the area from encroachment of non-
              industrial uses in areas designated for industrial uses.
         6) Explore opportunities to improve pedestrian access to La Palma Park from
              the adjacent residential community to the east.

South Anaheim Boulevard serves as the
major link between Downtown, The
Platinum Triangle and The Anaheim
Resort. The City has undertaken a series
of beautification efforts to visually
enhance the area. Current land uses in
the area include a variety of residential,
commercial and industrial uses as well as
some office uses that complement the
adjacent Western Medical Center
Hospital.
In order to address the area’s
revitalization needs, the City adopted a
redevelopment plan and the South
Anaheim Boulevard Corridor Code
Overlay Zone. The Land Use Plan for
this area is consistent with the goals of
these plans.

         The Platinum Triangle
         The Platinum Triangle represents an opportunity for the City to create a vibrant, mixed-
         use regional center unique to Orange County. Served by a multitude of transportation
         options and home to
         major regional
         entertainment facilities
         like Angel Stadium of
         Anaheim and the
         Arrowhead Pond of
         Anaheim, the area has
         tremendous visibility and
         development potential.

         of uses and high-density
         urban housing -
         integrated by a carefully
         planned network of
         pedestrian walkways,
         streetscape improvements and public spaces - that will create an urban environment of a
         scale unique to Orange County. The combined attraction of shopping, entertainment,
         office, residential and recreational uses will provide residents, workers and visitors with
         one of the most vibrant and exciting urban places in the region.
         The land use designations assigned to properties within The Platinum Triangle are
         intended to afford property owners an additional layer of land use options beyond those
         provided by a property’s underlying zone designation. For example, a property which is
         zoned and utilized for industrial use but designated “Mixed Use” on the Land Use Plan
         shall not be restricted from operating, expanding or subdividing in conformance with its
         underlying industrial zone designation.
