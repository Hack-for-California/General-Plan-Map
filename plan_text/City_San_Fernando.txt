I. INTRODUCTION
A.      COMMUNITY CONTEXT
The City of San Fernando is located in the northeast section of the San Fernando Valley at
the southern foot of the San Gabriel Mountains. This compact community of 2.4 square
miles is completely surrounded by the City of Los Angeles, including the nearby
communities of Sylmar, Mission Hills and Pacoima.
San Fernando has a rich history, which can still be observed in the built environment. The
City’s roots go back to 1874 when Charles Maclay laid out a speculative township map for
“the first city of the valley,” leading to the City’s incorporation in 1911. The City’s early
development is closely related with ranching, the citrus industry, and the nearby San
Fernando Mission. Many San Fernando neighborhoods were originally developed in the early
twentieth century, with current land uses still reflecting the City’s first zoning ordinance
adopted in 1929. The City has since developed as a predominately single-family community,
with approximately 80 percent of the City’s 6,500 housing units consisting of single-family
homes, and 55 percent of the City’s households owning their homes.
The City has suffered from two major natural disasters, the 1971 Sylmar Earthquake and the
1994 Northridge Earthquake. These earthquakes caused substantial damage to the housing
stock, as well as sewers, streets, and other buildings. As a result of these disasters, combined
with the age of the City’s housing stock, San Fernando had historically placed a large focus
on redevelopment activities, including rehabilitation and production of replacement housing.
The City has also placed a renewed focus on neighborhood preservation through a
combination of code enforcement, rental housing inspection, community involvement, and
rehabilitation assistance. However, the State of California’s decision to eliminate
redevelopment agencies statewide has significantly impacted San Fernando’s ability to
continue programs that maintain, preserve, and enhance its residential neighborhoods.
While San Fernando has experienced only limited residential development over the past
several decades, the City’s population has continued to grow and change. More than 90
percent of the City’s 23,645 residents are of Latino origin, and 29 percent of the population is
under 18 years of age. The Latino population includes both recent immigrants as well as
many long time San Fernando families. The provision of adequate affordable housing,
including larger rental units and first-time homeownership opportunities for younger growing
families, is thus an important issue facing San Fernando.
With adoption of the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan in January 2005, the City has
established a well-defined plan for the revitalization of San Fernando’s three primary
corridors - North Maclay Avenue, Truman Street and San Fernando Road - while providing
significant additional opportunities for residential development. The City is evaluating
mixed-use residential development and other infill residential opportunities that have the
potential to produce hundreds of additional units on publicly and/or privately owned parcels
 
                                                                                                  
2013­2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                       1                                  INTRODUCTION 

                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                   
and underutilized parking lot sites that are located within the City’s downtown area and are
part of the greater San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan area. Furthermore, the San
Fernando Corridors Specific Plan envisions the transition of North Maclay Avenue into a
residentially-focused corridor, and provides density bonuses for the integration of residential
dwelling units within mixed-use developments within the City’s Downtown and Civic Center
areas which include the San Fernando Road and Truman Street corridors.
B.      ROLE OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
State law recognizes the vital role local governments play in the availability, adequacy and
affordability of housing.        Every jurisdiction in California is required to adopt a
comprehensive, long-term general plan to guide its physical development; the housing
element being one of the seven mandated elements of the General Plan. Housing element law
mandates that local governments adequately plan to meet the existing and projected housing
needs of all economic segments of the community. The law recognizes that in order for the
private market to adequately address housing needs and demand, local governments must
adopt land use plans and regulatory systems that provide opportunities for, and do not unduly
constrain housing development. As a result, State housing policy rests largely upon the
effective implementation of local general plans and in particular, local housing elements.
Housing Element statutes also requires the State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) to review local housing elements for compliance with State law and to
report their findings to the local government.
San Fernando’s Housing Element covers an eight-year planning period from October 15,
2013 to October 15, 2021. California’s housing element law also requires that each city and
county develop local housing programs to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing
needs for all income groups. The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
is responsible for developing and assigning these regional needs, or “RHNA”, to southern
California jurisdictions. The RHNA planning period for this Housing Element cycle is an
eight-year plan extending from January 1, 2014, through October 31, 2021.
This Housing Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on: 1) preserving and
improving housing and neighborhoods; 2) providing adequate housing sites; 3) assisting in
the provision of affordable housing; 4) removing governmental and other constraints to
housing investment; and 5) promoting fair and equal housing opportunities.
The City’s Housing Element consists of the following major components:
       An analysis of the City’s demographic, household and housing characteristics and
        related housing needs (Section II);
       A review of potential market, governmental, and infrastructure constraints to meeting
        San Fernando’s identified housing needs (Section III);
 
                                                                                                
2013­2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                      2                                INTRODUCTION 

                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                  
      An evaluation of residential sites, financial and administrative resources available to
       address the City’s housing goals (Section IV); and,
      The Housing Plan for addressing the City's identified housing needs, constraints and
       resources; including housing goals, policies and programs (Section V).
C.     DATA SOURCES
In preparing the Housing Element, various sources of information are consulted. The U.S.
Census Bureau’s decennial Census and period American Community Survey (ACS) provides
the basis for population and household characteristics. Several data sources are used to
supplement U.S. Census Bureau data, including:
      SCAG’s 2012 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) Growth Forecast and 2008
       Regional Integrated Forecast provides population, housing and employment
       projections;
      State of California Employment Development Department labor force participation
       and unemployment rate estimates;
      Household income data by type of household is derived from the Comprehensive
       Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) prepared by HUD;
      Housing market information updated through internet listings;
      Housing conditions information is obtained from recent field surveys conducted by
       the San Fernando Community Development Department’s Building and Safety
       Division;
      State of California Department of Developmental Services reports data for residents
       with developmental disabilities who are assisted at the North Los Angeles County
       Regional Center;
      Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) counts of unsheltered homeless
       individuals;
      SCAG’s 2014-2021 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) provides
       information on existing and projected housing needs;
      Lending patterns for home purchase and home improvement loans are provided
       through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) database; and,
      Information on San Fernando’s land uses and development standards are derived
       from the City’s Zoning Ordinance, and the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan.

D.       PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Opportunities for residents to provide input on housing issues and recommend strategies are
critical to the development of appropriate and effective programs to address San Fernando’s
housing needs. The City undertook a public outreach program to involve all community
stakeholders (e.g., residents, property owners, developers, affordable housing advocates, etc.)
early on in the development of its Housing Element, including:
        On Saturday, September 14, 2013, the City conducted the first of two community
         workshops on the Element update at the San Fernando Regional Pool Facility. The
         workshop was attended by seven members of the public.
        On Saturday, September 28, 2013, the second community workshop was held at Las
         Palmas Park and was attended by ten members of the public.
        On Tuesday October 15, 2013, the City conducted a Planning and Preservation
         Commission study session to review the Draft Housing Element and to receive
         additional public input.
Notification of the two community workshops was published in the local newspaper and
Spanish translation was provided at all the meetings. In addition, notices of public
workshops were sent to housing professionals and agencies and organizations serving the
City’s lower income populations and those with special needs (see Appendix A). A
summary of the public comments received is also included in Appendix A.
Upon completion of the Draft Housing Element, the document is placed in public locations
throughout the community, including City Hall, the Los Angeles County public library, and
the two community centers at Recreation Park and Las Palmas Park. In addition, the Draft
Housing Element is placed on the City’s website at www.sfcity.org/housingelement. The
Draft is also sent to the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
for review and comment. Upon receipt of input from HCD, public hearings will be held
before the Planning and Preservation Commission and City Council during adoption of the
Housing Element.
E.       RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The San Fernando General Plan is comprised of the following eight elements: Land Use;
Circulation; Housing; Conservation; Open Space; Safety; Noise and Historic Preservation.
As part of the update of the Housing Element, the other elements of the General Plan were
reviewed to ensure consistency with the policies set forth in those elements.
As required by State law, internal consistency is required among the various elements of the
General Plan, including the Housing Element. The City will maintain consistency between
the Housing Element and the other General Plan elements so that policies introduced in one

element are consistent with other elements. Whenever any element of the General Plan is
amended in the future, the Housing Element will be reviewed and modified, if necessary, to
ensure continued consistency between elements.
State law also requires that the Conservation Element (AB 162, enacted 2009) and Safety
Element (SB 1241, enacted 2012) include an analysis and policies regarding flood hazard and
management information upon revisions to the Housing Element. Although these revisions
are not related to Housing Element law, the City will ensure compliance with this
requirement by reviewing its Conservation and Safety Elements.

II. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This section of the Housing Element discusses the characteristics San Fernando’s population
and housing stock, and consists of the following sections: A) Demographic Profile; B)
Household Profile; C) Housing Stock Characteristics; and, D) Regional Housing Needs.
A.      DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE
Demographic changes, such as population growth or changes in age, can affect the type and
amount of housing that is needed in a community. This section addresses population, age,
race and ethnicity of San Fernando residents.
1.      Population Growth and Trends
Table 1 presents population growth trends in San Fernando, and compares this growth to the
City of Los Angeles and the entire County of Los Angeles. This table illustrates the high
levels of population growth experienced during the 1980s, with growth levels in San
Fernando surpassing both the City of Los Angeles and countywide averages. During the
1990s, population growth slowed dramatically throughout the region, reflective of the
impacts of the economic recession during the first half of the decade. According to the U.S.
Census Bureau, San Fernando added less than 100 people to its population in the last decade
with a population of 23,645 in 2010 .

According to the Southern California Association of Government’s (SCAG) 2012 Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP) Growth Forecast, the population of San Fernando is expected to
grow to 25,500 by 2035, an eight-percent increase from the 2010 population. SCAG’s
population projections translate to an annual growth rate of approximately 0.2 percent, which
matches the annual population growth the City experienced over the most recent two decades
(1990-2010).

2.      Age Characteristics
Housing need is often affected by the age characteristics of residents in the community.
Different age groups have different lifestyles, income levels, and family types that influence
housing needs. These housing choices evolve over time, and it is important to examine the
changes in the age structure of San Fernando residents in order to identify potential impacts
on housing needs.
Table 2 displays the age distribution of the City’s population in 2000 and 2010, and
compares this with Los Angeles County. Although the population grew by less than 100
people, the City experienced a fairly substantial shift in age characteristics. As displayed
below, 29 percent of San Fernando’s population was comprised of children under the age of
18 in 2010, which is down from 35 percent in 2000. This decrease in the proportion of young
children is consistent with statewide trends of a more stable immigrant population with lower
birth rates, and can be expected to continue in the future. Although the proportion of the
City’s population that is comprised of children declined during the last decade, it is still
higher than the countywide proportion (25 percent).
San Fernando’s share of college age adults (18-24 years) and young adults (25-44 years)
remained fairly constant, and is comparable to the presence of this age group countywide.
The City’s middle age population (45–64 years) grew significantly during the decade from
15 to 21 percent, though this age group still falls below the countywide average of 24
percent. Finally, while the proportion of senior citizens in San Fernando increased by only
one percent over the decade, the number of seniors increased by over 300. This numeric
increase may be attributed the opening of several senior housing complexes in San Fernando
since the 2000 Census.

3.       Race and Ethnicity
Table 3 displays the racial/ethnic composition of San Fernando’s population in 2000 and
2010, and compares this with the countywide distribution. Hispanic residents continue to
comprise the vast majority of the City’s population, increasing from 89 percent in 2000 to 93
percent in 2010. This increase in Hispanic residents was offset by the decline in White
residents from eight to five percent of the population. Asians, African Americans, American
Indians and “Other” races each continue to comprise less than one percent of the population.
While San Fernando has many, long time Latino families, it also serves as a place of
residence for new Latino immigrants. The 2007-2011 ACS reported that, 36 percent of the
City’s residents were foreign-born, with 37 percent of the foreign-born population entering
the United States after 2000. The 2007-2011 ACS also identifies 43 percent of the City’s
16,674 Spanish speaking persons as linguistically isolated, defined as living in a household
where no member over 14 years of age speaks English “very well”. Recent Latino
immigrants and linguistically isolated households may face greater difficulties in gaining
meaningful employment and acquiring adequate housing as they adjust to their new
surroundings. As a result, household problems such as overcrowding and overpayment may
be more likely.

4.       Employment
Evaluation of the types of jobs held by community residents provides insight into potential
earning power and the segment of the housing market into which they fall. Information on
how a community’s employment base is growing and changing can help identify potential
housing demand changes in the future.
The State Employment Development Department estimates that as of March 2013, 10,500
San Fernando residents are in the labor force, with 10.2 percent unemployment, compared to
a Countywide unemployment rate of 9.9 percent and City of Los Angeles unemployment of
11.0 percent. The 2007-2011 ACS documents the following distribution of resident
employment by occupational category:

       Production, transportation, and material moving occupations – 18 percent
       Sales and office occupations – 30 percent
       Service occupations – 18 percent
       Management, business, science, and arts occupations – 20 percent
       Natural resources, construction, and maintenance occupations – 15 percent
The SCAG Regional Integrated Forecast estimates the City’s employment base at
approximately 15,000 jobs (2008). SCAG projects a limited six-percent increase, or 900
additional jobs by year 2035, in comparison to the 11 percent job growth projected for Los
Angeles County during the same period. San Fernando’s employment base includes a diverse
mix of small businesses, retail stores, manufacturing facilities, and corporate satellite offices.
B.      HOUSEHOLD PROFILE
Household type and size, income levels, and the presence of special needs populations all
affect the type of housing needed by residents. This section details the various household
characteristics affecting housing needs in San Fernando.
1.      Household Type
A household is defined as all persons living in a housing unit. Families are a subset of
households, and include persons living together related by blood, marriage, or adoption. A
single person living alone is also a household. “Other” households are unrelated people
residing in the same dwelling unit. Group quarters, such as dormitories or convalescent
homes are not considered households.
According to the 2010 Census, 5,967 households reside in San Fernando, with an average
household size of 3.94 persons and average family size of 4.18 persons (refer to Table 4).
This represents a decrease in household size (4.07) from 2000, but well above the Los
Angeles County average household size of 2.98. Although larger households may translate
into a greater number of overcrowded households, the proportion of households living in
overcrowded conditions declined from 43 percent in 2000 (as reported by the Census) to only
15 percent between 2007 and 2011 (as reported by the ACS).
Families comprise the majority of households in San Fernando (83 percent), including
families with children (45 percent), and those without children (46 percent). During the
2000s, families without children and other non-families (unrelated roommates) grew at the
fastest rate of any household type. In contrast, the number of families with children
decreased by 13 percent and singles remained relatively constant.

2.       Household Income
Household income is one of the most important factors affecting housing opportunity and
determining a household’s ability to balance housing costs with other basic necessities of life.
Income Definitions
The State and Federal government classify household income into several groupings based
upon the relationship to the area median income (AMI) in a county, which for San Fernando
is the County of Los Angeles. The State of California utilizes the income grouping and
names presented in Table 5. However, federal housing programs utilize slightly different
income groupings and definitions, with the highest income category generally ending at 80
percent AMI. For purposes of the Housing Element, the State income definitions are used
throughout, except where specifically noted.

Income Characteristics
Between 2000 and 2007-2011, the area median income (AMI) in San Fernando grew from
$39,900 to $52,021, an increase of 30 percent. The median income level in San Fernando
remained below that of Los Angeles County ($56,266) and the City has seen an increase in
both the number and proportion of lower income (<80 percent AMI) households, and a
corresponding decrease in households earning moderate incomes and above since 2000. As
illustrated in Table 6, during the 2000s the City experienced increases in extremely low (59

Income by Household Type and Tenure
Table 7 shows the income level of San Fernando residents by household tenure. A
significantly higher percentage of renter-households (69 percent) were lower income (<80
percent AMI) compared to residents who owned their homes (50 percent). The high
incidence of lower income renter-households is of particular significance as market rents in
San Fernando currently exceed the level of affordability for lower income households. (This
issue is further evaluated in the Housing Profile section of the Needs Assessment.) The
median income of renter-households between 2007 and 2011 was $34,361 compared to
$60,244 for homeowners.

While renters were more likely to have lower incomes than owners, there is also significant
variation in income levels by household type, as presented in Table 8. Approximately 70
percent of elderly and large households in San Fernando have lower income (<80 percent
AMI), with more than one-third having extremely low incomes. About 48 percent of small
families have lower incomes.

Households in Poverty
The federal government publishes national poverty thresholds that define the minimum
income level necessary to obtain the necessities of life. For example, the 2011 U.S. poverty
threshold for a family of four was $23,021. As indicated in Table 9, approximately 16
percent of all San Fernando residents lived in poverty between 2007 and 2011, a decrease of
more than 600 persons living below the poverty line since 2000. Nearly one in four children
under the age of 18 in San Fernando is estimated to live in poverty. As a group, female-
headed households with children are most impacted by poverty, with one-fourth of this group
living in poverty.

3.      Special Needs Populations
State law recognizes that certain households have more difficulty in finding decent and
affordable housing due to special circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:
economic status, age, disability, household size and household type. Special needs
populations in San Fernando include large households, the elderly, persons with disabilities,
female-headed households, farmworkers, and the homeless. Table 10 summarizes the number
of households or persons in each of these special needs groups in the City.

Large Households
Large households consist of five or more persons and are considered a special needs
population due to the limited availability of affordable and adequately sized housing. The
lack of large units is especially evident among rental units. Large households often live in
overcrowded conditions, due to both the lack of large enough units, and insufficient income
to afford available units, which often consist of single-family homes of adequate size.
San Fernando had a total of 1,478 large households, and at 24 percent, represents the most
significant special needs group in the City. Of these large households, 43 percent are renters
and a large majority of these large renter households (70 percent) earned lower incomes
between 2007 and 2011. Based on the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy
(CHAS) Databook prepared by HUD, 81 percent of San Fernando’s large renter-households
suffer from one or more housing problems, including housing overpayment, overcrowding
and/or substandard housing conditions.
The American Community Survey (ACS) further documents the mismatch between the need
for larger rental units and the City’s supply of smaller units. The ACS identifies 772 rental
units in San Fernando with three or more bedrooms, in general, the appropriate sized unit for
a large household of five or more members. The City has approximately 636 large renter
households. Although housing options for large renter-households in the City are
numerically sufficient to meet the needs of the 1,548 large renter-households documented in
the 2007-2011 ACS, lower income large renter-households may have difficulty finding
adequately sized and affordable housing in San Fernando. This imbalance between supply of
larger units and demand from lower income large households may contribute to 20 percent of
the City’s renter-households residing in severely overcrowded conditions.
Senior Households
Approximately nine percent of San Fernando residents are over age 65, and about 18 percent
of all households are headed by seniors. Most of the City’s seniors are homeowners (77
percent), and about 17 percent of the City’s elderly live alone. Over 370 senior homeowners
live alone in San Fernando, with approximately 37 percent of elderly residents in the City
having some type of disability which may limit their mobility.
The elderly have a number of special needs including housing, transportation, health care,
and other services. Rising rents are a particular concern due to the fact that most seniors are
on fixed incomes. Of San Fernando’s approximately 265 senior renter-households, 91
percent are lower income. As shown in Table 21 (page 30), San Fernando has four senior
housing projects providing 112 rental units affordable to a mix of very low, low and
moderate income households.
For those seniors who live on their own, many have limited incomes and as a result of their
age may not be able to maintain their homes or perform minor repairs. Furthermore, the
installation of grab bars and other assistance devices in the home may be needed. The City

operates a housing rehabilitation program that assists low and moderate income homeowners
in making needed repairs. However, with the dissolution of redevelopment in California, the
City, like many other cities in the State, has lost a significant funding resource for supportive
affordable housing activities. As a result, this program is operating at a limited capacity.
The San Fernando Recreation and Community Services Division offers a number of
programs for seniors including recreational and social activities, a nutrition program,
supportive services including information and referral services, and blood pressure and
diabetes screening. Senior centers are located at San Fernando Recreation Park and Las
Palmas Park.
Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households typically have a special need for such services as childcare and
health care, among others. Female-headed households with children in particular tend to
have lower incomes, which limits their housing options and access to supportive services.
The 2007-2011 ACS reports 1,390 female-headed households in San Fernando; 769 of these
households (55 percent) had children. Of those households with children, over one-quarter
lived in poverty. These households need assistance with housing subsidies, as well as
accessible and affordable day care.
Persons with Disabilities
According to the Census, a disability is defined as a long lasting condition that impairs an
individual’s mobility, ability to work, or ability to care for oneself. Persons with disabilities
include those with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities. Disabled persons have special
housing needs because of their fixed income, shortage of affordable and accessible housing,
and higher health costs associated with their disability.
According to the 2009-2011 ACS, approximately 12 percent of San Fernando residents
(2,800 persons) have one or more disabilities. Approximately 507 residents had a hearing
difficulty, 831 had a vision difficulty, 1,089 have cognitive difficulty, 1,644 have an
ambulatory difficulty, 779 have a self-care difficulty, and 973 have difficulty with
independent living. Of the City’s senior population, approximately 37 percent have one or
more of these types of disabilities.
The living arrangements for persons with disabilities depend on the severity of the disability.
Many persons live at home in an independent environment with the help of other family
members. To maintain independent living, disabled persons may require assistance. This
can include special housing design features for the physically disabled, income support for
those who are unable to work, and in-home supportive services for persons with medical
conditions.

Developmental Disabilities: A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element
discuss the housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by Section
4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, “developmental disability” means “a disability
that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to
continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. As defined
by the California Director of Developmental Services, in consultation with the
Superintendent of Public Instruction, this term shall include mental retardation, cerebral
palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term shall also include disabling conditions found to be
closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for
individuals with mental retardation, but shall not include other handicapping conditions that
are solely physical in nature.” This definition also reflects the individual’s need for a
combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized
supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are
individually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S. Administration
on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the population that
can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. This generally equates to 355
persons in the City of San Fernando with developmental disabilities, based on the 2010
Census population. However, according to the State’s Department of Developmental
Services, as of November 2012, between 273 and 388 residents with developmental
disabilities living within the 91340 zip code (which approximates the San Fernando city
limits) were being assisted at the North Los Angeles County Regional Center. Most of these
individuals are under the age of 18 and reside in a private home with their parent of guardian
(refer Table 11).

Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are
provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living
situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.

Accessibility Accommodations: Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act impose an affirmative duty on local governments to make
reasonable accommodations (i.e. modifications or exceptions) in their zoning and other land
use regulations when such accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an
equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example, it may be a reasonable
accommodation to allow covered ramps in the setbacks of properties that have already been
developed to accommodate residents with mobility impairments. In October 2013, the City
amended the Zoning Code to establish a ministerial procedure to provide individuals with
disabilities reasonable accommodation in the application of the City's rules, policies,
practices, and procedures, as necessary, in order to ensure equal access to housing and
facilitate the development of housing for individuals with disabilities, pursuant to Federal
and State fair housing laws. The City does not require special building codes or burdensome
project review to construct, improve, or convert housing for persons with disabilities.
Residential care facilities with six or fewer persons are permitted by right in all residential
zoning districts.
Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
seasonal agricultural work. Farmworkers have special housing needs because they earn
lower incomes than many other workers and move throughout the season from one harvest to
the next.
According to the 2007-2011 ACS, 116 San Fernando residents were employed in agriculture,
forestry, fishing and hunting, or mining industries, representing approximately one percent of
the City’s labor force. Therefore, given the extremely limited presence of farmworkers in the
community and the highly urbanized character of the San Fernando Valley, the City has no
specialized housing programs targeted to this group beyond overall programs for housing
affordability.
Homeless
In January 2013, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) conducted a count
of homeless housed overnight in shelters and institutions throughout Los Angeles County, as
well as a three-day unsheltered homeless street count. Based on LAHSA’s methodology,
they estimate the Los Angeles homeless population at approximately 58,423 persons. Of that
total, 79 percent are estimated to be single individuals, while 20 percent are in families and
one percent is unaccompanied youth under age 18.
San Fernando is located in LAHSA’s Service Planning Area (SPA) 2, which encompasses
the entire San Fernando Valley. Approximately 5,258 homeless persons, or nine percent of
the County’s total homeless population, fall within the San Fernando Valley. LAHSA is
responsible for developing a continuum of care plan for all of Los Angeles County, and
establishing priority needs, services, shelter and housing by Service Planning Area.

The City of San Fernando’s homeless population is estimated at around 12 persons,
according to the 2013 LAHSA point-in-time count. According to City law enforcement
personnel, these are the “chronic” homeless that live in San Fernando in makeshift dwellings
under bridges, railroad tresses, and by the Pacoima Wash. In general, this group consists of
single men, age 20 to 55, with alcohol and/or drug dependencies. Homeless families with
children are also occasionally seen in the streets in San Fernando, some of these families may
sometimes come to the police station seeking aid. The police do what they can to place these
families in shelters.
Catholic Charities’ Loaves and Fishes is located in San Fernando and provides case
management, food, clothing, shelter referrals, and a variety of other services for the homeless
and persons at-risk of homelessness. The City is also working with the Los Angeles County
Department of Public Health and the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority to provide
additional services to homeless individuals in the City.
C.      HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
This section identifies the characteristics of San Fernando’s physical housing stock. This
includes an analysis of housing growth trends, housing conditions, lead-based paint hazards,
housing prices and rents, and housing affordability.
1.      Housing Growth
Table 12 displays housing production in the City, compared to the City of Los Angeles and
the entire County region. Between 1980 and 1990, San Fernando’s housing stock grew by
five percent, in contrast to the City and County of Los Angeles, which evidenced a growth
rate of approximately double that of San Fernando. During the 1990s, housing growth
dropped dramatically throughout the region, with San Fernando adding only 138 new units
(2% growth) the entire decade.
According to the 2010 Census, San Fernando has a housing stock of 6,506 units, representing
an increase of 574 units (or 10 percent) since 2000. The City’s dwelling unit growth rate out-
paced that of the City and County of Los Angeles during the same period. Most of this
development occurred within the City’s R-2 (Multiple Family Dwelling) and R-3 (Multiple
Family) zones and the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan areas.

2.       Housing Type and Tenure
Table 13 presents the mix of housing types in San Fernando. Unlike many urbanized
communities, single-family homes have increased in relative proportion and number over the
past two decades, from 76 percent (4,365 units) in 1990 to 80 percent (5,182 units) between
2007 and 2011. This growing number of single-family attached and detached homes is
consistent with the City’s high rate of homeownership.

Housing tenure refers to whether a housing unit is owned, rented or is vacant. Tenure is an
important indicator of the housing climate of a community, reflecting the relative cost of
housing opportunities, and the ability of residents to afford housing. Tenure also influences
residential mobility, with owner units generally evidencing lower turnover rates than rental
housing. According to the 2010 Census, 55 percent of San Fernando’s households were
homeowners, fairly consistent with 2000 levels (see Table 14). In Los Angeles County, only
48 percent of households are owner-occupied.

Vacancy Rate
A vacancy rate measures the overall housing availability in a community and is often a good
indicator of how efficiently for-sale and rental housing units are meeting the current demand
for housing. A vacancy rate of five percent for rental housing and two percent for ownership
housing is generally considered healthy and suggests that there is a balance between the
demand and supply of housing. A lower vacancy rate may indicate that households are
having difficulty in finding housing that is affordable, leading to overcrowding or households
having to pay more than they can afford. A low vacancy rate or a particularly ‘tight’ housing
market may also lead to high competition for units, raising rental and housing prices
substantially.
As measured by the 2007-2011 ACS, the citywide residential vacancy rate in San Fernando
was 4.6 percent for all housing units compared to the 2.7 percent vacancy rate in 2000. In
terms of tenure, the 2007-2011 ACS estimated that the vacancy rate was 3.8 percent for
rental units, well below the five percent considered healthy for rental housing, and less than
1.6 percent for ownership housing. These low vacancy rates indicate that a high ‘pent-up’
demand for housing exists, putting upward pressure on housing prices, and making it
increasingly difficult to find available housing in the community.
3.      Housing Age and Condition
The age of a community’s housing stock can provide an indicator of overall housing
conditions. Typically housing over 30 years in age is likely to have rehabilitation needs that
may include new plumbing, roof repairs, foundation work and other repairs. Table 15
displays the age of San Fernando’s occupied housing stock by owner/renter tenure as of the
2007-2011 ACS. As a mature community, the majority of San Fernando’s housing stock
consists of units older than 30 years of age. Among owner-occupied housing, over 80
percent of units were constructed prior to 1970, and is reflective of the community’s
numerous older single-family neighborhoods. While a lesser proportion of renter housing is
greater than 30 years in age (76 percent), this housing is typically of lesser quality
construction and suffers more wear-and-tear from tenants than owner-occupied housing. The
advanced age of the majority of San Fernando’s housing stock indicates the significant need
for continued code enforcement, property maintenance and housing rehabilitation programs

In mid-2013, the City’s Community Development Department staff conducted a citywide
windshield survey of housing conditions. Building conditions on each of the City’s 4,100+
residential parcels were rated as excellent; good; fair; poor; and vacant. As shown in Table
16, approximately one-quarter of residential structures in San Fernando exhibited signs of
deferred maintenance, with an additional eight percent identified as in poor condition and in
need of substantial rehabilitation. The survey data supports the strong need for continued
housing rehabilitation assistance, in conjunction with the City’s code enforcement and
Community Action Plan for Neighborhood Protection and Preservation (CAPP) programs,
described below.

In order to address housing conditions, the City operates a code enforcement program, as
well as an apartment inspection program and an inspection upon resale program. Owners of
properties in violation of codes are encouraged to participate in City-sponsored rehabilitation
programs.
In mid-2006, the City initiated the Community Action Plan for Neighborhood Protection and
Preservation (CAPP). CAPP is a comprehensive, multi-departmental, multi-agency approach
to identify and abate repeated illegal activity and/or nuisance behaviors and substandard
conditions at individual problem properties. A key component of CAPP involves the
designation of neighborhood focus areas and outreach to residents adversely impacted by
nuisance properties within these areas. Figure 1 provides a map of the designated
neighborhood focus areas.
Implementation of CAPP involves the following three initiatives:
        1.   Comprehensive Problem Assessment.
             The first step in implementing CAPP involves analysis of the following
             characteristics of properties in the focus area:
                 Criminal or illegal activity
                 Dilapidated structures associated with property maintenance issues
                 Illegally constructed residential units or converted garages
                 Animal control violations
                 Absentee property owners of rental property
                 Lack of proper business licenses
                 Invalid water accounts
                 Infrastructure deficiencies, improvements, repairs
        2.   In-field Intervention to Permanently Abate Nuisances at Problem
             Properties.
             This step involves team inspections of problem properties and follow-up through
             the City Prosecutor
        3.   Neighborhood-wide Improvement Measures Throughout Each Focus Area.
             This final step involves:
                 Mailing of notices throughout focus area to correct code violations
                 Public improvements
                 Graffiti removal and prevention

4.      Housing Costs and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems in a community. If
housing costs are relatively high in comparison to household income, there will be a higher
prevalence of overpayment and overcrowding. This section summarizes the cost and
affordability of the housing stock to San Fernando residents.
Rental Housing Market
With renters comprising approximately 45 percent of the City’s households, it is important to
understand the rental market in San Fernando. Rental information for San Fernando was
obtained from more than 100 listings posted on online classifieds website Craigslist
(www.craigslist.org) between May 11, 2013 and May 19, 2013. Due to the limited number
of rental vacancies within the City of San Fernando, the rent survey encompassed a broader
market area, including the communities of Pacoima, Sylmar, Mission Hills and North Hills.
Rather than formal newspaper or internet advertising, many of the smaller rental properties in
San Fernando advertise through sign postings on the property, through word of mouth or
other informal means.
As illustrated in Table 17, median rents range from $800 for a studio, $995 for a one-
bedroom, $1,298 for a two-bedroom, and $2,200 for a three-bedroom unit. Of 113 units
advertised during the survey period, three were studios, 25 were one-bedroom units, 40 were
two-bedroom units, and 45 units had three or more bedrooms. Historically, the shortage of
all types of rental housing in the community, particularly at the lower end of the market, has
resulted in a large number of illegal garage conversions being used as rentals.

Homeownership Market
Southern California, like most of the country, has experienced a significant decline in home
sales prices during the past few years. With an overall median sales price of $357,000
recorded in April 2013 by DQNews.com, Southern California home prices are 29 percent
below their peak of $505,000 in the summer of 2007, but up 43 percent from the $250,000
median sales price recorded in January 2009. The drop in the median sales price from 2007
to 2009 was overstated by the large number of discounted home foreclosures, which
comprised a significant portion of Southern California sales, particularly in the lower cost

inland areas. In contrast, homes in the upper half of the market were not selling well due in
part to the difficulty in obtaining financing for jumbo mortgages, and were thus under-
represented in the median sales price statistics. The modest recovery in sales prices since
2009 suggests a shrinking foreclosure inventory and general stabilization of credit markets.
According to RealtyTrac (www.realtytrac.com), 107 homes in the City were in the
foreclosure process as of May 2013. This represents less than two percent of the City’s
housing stock and is less than one-third of the 347 San Fernando homes in the foreclosure
process on April 2009.
As shown in Table 18, the median home price in San Fernando increased by 36 percent, from
$232,500 in March 2012 to $315,000 in March 2013. During this same time period, changes
to median home prices in neighboring jurisdictions, San Fernando Valley, and Los Angeles
County were lower.

While Table 18 provides an overview of the subregional housing sales market during March
2013, the Table 19 provides detailed information on current single-family home and
condominium listings within the San Fernando city limits in May 2013. A total of 44 single-
family homes and two condominiums were listed for-sale. Two-and three-bedroom units
were the most prevalent home sales listings, characteristic of San Fernando’s older single-
family housing stock of smaller sized units. Sales prices for two, three and four bedroom
units generally ranged from $159,900 to $425,000. The overall median single-family home
price for the 46 listings was $269,500, significantly lower than the $315,000 median sale
price recorded in March 2013.

Housing Affordability
The affordability of housing in San Fernando can be assessed by comparing market rents and
sales prices with the amount that households of different income levels can afford to pay for
housing. Compared together, this information can reveal who can afford what size and type
of housing as well as indicate the type of households that would most likely experience
overcrowding or overpayment.
Housing affordability is an important indicator of quality of life in San Fernando. If residents
pay too much for housing they will not have sufficient income for other necessities, such as
health care. Households that spend a substantial portion of their income on housing may also
be at risk of becoming homeless in the event of unexpected circumstances such as illness or
loss of employment. State law requires that the City facilitate housing opportunities that are
affordable to all economic segments of the community through adoption of provisions in the
City Code that provide the mechanism to facilitate such housing types.
The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual
household income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for Federal
housing assistance. Based on this survey, the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) developed income limits that can be used to determine the
maximum price that could be affordable to households in the upper range of their respective
income category (see Table 20). Households in the lower end of each category can afford
less by comparison than those at the upper end.

Based on the income limits for Los Angeles County in 2013 presented in Table 20 and
current real estate asking prices documented in Table 19, homeownership in San Fernando is
within the reach of some low income and most moderate income households, with the
exception of single and two-person low income households. Housing options for extremely
low and very low income households are virtually non-existent unless public assistance is
provided.
Extremely low income and very low income households cannot afford market rents in San
Fernando without subsidies or overcrowding (compare Table 17 and Table 20). Singles and
families up to four persons with low, median, and moderate incomes can generally afford the
market rents for apartments in the City. However, housing options for large households with
five or more persons with incomes over 50 percent of AMI are extremely limited.
Competition for appropriately sized rental homes may lead to an increased housing cost
burden or overcrowding among these households.
5.      Assisted Housing At-Risk of Conversion
The Housing Element is required to evaluate the potential for currently rent-restricted low
income housing units to convert to market rate housing. This section presents an inventory
of all assisted rental housing in San Fernando, including all multi-family units assisted under
Federal, State, and local programs, including HUD, State/local bond programs, density
bonus, inclusionary, and local redevelopment or direct assistance programs, and evaluates
those units at risk of conversion during the ten year, 2013-2023 at-risk period.
As illustrated in Table 21, San Fernando has facilitated the development of several residential
developments with long-term affordability covenants within its Redevelopment Project
Areas.
These projects include: two senior housing projects on Jessie Street, Las Palmas I and II on
Kalisher Street, and the senior units on Park Avenue. These rental projects provide a total of
112 affordable units, including 54 very low income units, and 58 low/moderate income units.
The City also approved two density bonus projects in 2012 that will provide 60 lower income
units during the planning period. None of these rental projects are at risk of conversion
during the planning period.

D.      EXISTING HOUSING PROBLEMS
1.      Overcrowding
The Census defines overcrowding as an average of more than one person per room in a
housing unit (excluding kitchens, porches, and hallways). The incidence of overcrowded
housing is a general measure of whether there is an available supply of adequately sized
housing units. Table 22 shows the incidence of overcrowding in San Fernando by tenure, as
measured by the 2007-2011 ACS.

                  Note: Severe overcrowding is a subset of overcrowding.
Between 2007 and 2011, there were an estimated 910 households living in overcrowded
conditions in San Fernando, representing 15 percent of all households. As Table 22 shows,
overcrowding is a more serious problem for rental households. Approximately 20 percent of
renter-households were overcrowded compared to 11 percent of owner households. In
comparison to Los Angeles County as a whole, household overcrowding levels are slightly
higher in San Fernando.
Severe overcrowding, which is defined as more than 1.5 persons per room, was especially
high among renters. Almost 177 renter-households (six percent) experienced severe
overcrowding. Overcrowding is a concern for lower-income families that often double-up in
order to afford adequately-sized units, or reside in illegally converted garages.
The 2007-2011 ACS shows a significant improvement with overcrowding conditions in the
City compared to the 2000 Census, where 44 percent of all households in the City were
overcrowded (36 percent of the owner-households and 54 percent of the renter-households).
This improvement may be attributed to actual improvements in housing conditions given the
lowered housing costs, smaller household size, and sampling errors of the ACS.

2.       Cost Burden by Household Type
The 2005-2009 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data indicates that
cost burden remains a critical need for lower income households, who are disproportionately
affected by this burden compared to other households. Affordability problems occur when
housing costs become so high in relation to income that households have to pay an excessive
proportion of their income for housing, or are unable to afford any housing and are homeless.
Table 23 provides a detailed review of households that experienced housing cost burden. A
cost burden is defined as spending over 30 percent of the household income on housing
costs; a severe housing cost burden is spending over 50 percent of the household income on
housing costs.
Among renters, the elderly were most impacted by cost burden, with nearly half of the City’s
estimated 235 elderly renters spending more than 50 percent of their income on rent. The
addition of 96 units of affordable senior rental housing since the 2000 Census will help to
address the housing affordability needs of the City’s senior renter-households. Among
homeowners, small family and elderly households experienced a fairly comparable level of
severe cost burden, ranging from 11-16 percent; however, approximately 43 percent of large
families spend more than half of their income on housing costs. These households are most
at risk of foreclosure, particularly in a declining housing market with rising interest rates.

CHAS data also provides housing cost burden information by household income and tenure.
As shown in Table 24, extremely low and very low income renter-households were most
impacted by housing cost burden.

III. HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
The provision of adequate and affordable housing can be constrained by a number of factors.
This section assesses the various governmental, market, infrastructure and environmental
factors that may serve as a potential constraint to housing development and improvement in
San Fernando.
A.      GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
1.      Land Use Controls
The San Fernando General Plan, Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances provide for a range of
residential land use designations/zones in the City:
       Low Density Residential (R-1) – up to six dwelling units per acre
       Medium Density Residential (R-2) – up to 17 dwelling units per acre
       High Density Residential (R-3) – up to 43 dwelling units per acre
In addition to these density provisions, the City has adopted a Residential Planned
Development (RPD) Overlay Zone that provides flexible development standards within the
density standards of the underlying zone district. The intent of the RPD overlay is to permit a
more efficient and aesthetic use of land through the arrangement of buildings not permitted
through the strict application of the underlying zoning’s development regulations. Providing
such flexibility in development standards can result in lowering the cost of development.
The City’s residential development standards are summarized in Table 25. The City’s
standards are fairly comparable to other Los Angeles County communities, and have not
served as a constraint to development. The cumulative effects of the City’s standards in
themselves do not serve to limit densities, although other site factors - such as small parcel
sizes or the desire to preserve an existing residential structure - often result in projects
developed at less than maximum densities. These factors are taken into consideration when
assessing the realistic development capacity of the Housing Element sites inventory in
Section IV. San Fernando has a history of providing for modified standards in support of
affordable and senior housing, and has incorporated this practice as part of the density bonus
program in the updated Housing Element. For example, the Las Palmas and Park Avenue
senior housing developments received density increases, a 50 percent reduction in parking
requirements, and increased lot coverage from 40 to 50 percent. Another seven multi-family
developments with 254 units benefited from density bonuses and related incentives since
2010. San Fernando has adopted an administrative modification process to accommodate
minor reductions in certain development standards - including residential setback and
parking dimensions. By allowing such modifications through an administrative process, the
requirement for making variance findings and conducting a public hearing is eliminated,
thereby reducing the time and cost for project processing.

 San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan
 In January 2005, the City adopted the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan for revitalization
 of the North Maclay Avenue, Truman Street, and San Fernando Road corridors. These three
 commercial arterials are currently characterized by strip commercial land uses, with the goal
 of the Specific Plan to transform these areas into distinctive districts providing for residential,
 retail, restaurant, entertainment and public uses. The vision for each of these districts can be
 described as follows:
           The Maclay District is established as a neighborhood spine for the community. It is
            planned to transition into a residentially-focused corridor that can provide new
            housing, while complementing the adjacent neighborhoods that lie behind it.
           The Downtown District is intended as a focal point of activity, concentrating civic
            and retail activity into one walkable district. Residential uses are permitted on the
            upper floors of multi-story buildings.

        The Truman/San Fernando District is established as the City’s workplace district,
         with appropriate areas for housing and limited retail. Within the larger district, the
         Mixed-Use Transition Sub-District will support development of a mix of use type,
         including residential and office uses, and limited areas of retail and services.
As illustrated in Table 26, the Specific Plan establishes generous development standards as a
means of facilitating development. Both the Downtown District and Truman/San Fernando
District provide FAR bonuses for the inclusion of residential, with a one-story height bonus
also offered in the Truman/San Fernando District

Although local density bonus procedures had not been adopted until October 2013, the City
worked with developers to grant incentives and concessions to facilitate the approval of 254
market-rate and affordable housing units since 2010 utilizing the State’s density bonus
provisions. Regulatory concessions approved in conjunction with increased density included

  2.       Provision for a Variety of Housing Types
  Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made
  available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
  development of various types of housing for all economic segments of the population. Table
  27 summarizes the housing types permitted in each of the San Fernando zoning districts,
  inclusive of the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan (SP-4) zone.

  Multi-Family Residential
  The San Fernando Zoning Code expressly permits duplexes and multiple-family dwelling
  units in the R-2 and R-3 zone districts. Since 2008, the City has approved entitlements for
  265 new affordable and market rate multi-family dwelling units. City Code Section 106-6
  provides the following definition for multiple-family dwelling:
           “a dwelling consisting of three or more dwelling units per lot, including
           townhouses, condominiums, and apartments.”

However, the City’s Zoning Code also identifies residential condominiums as requiring a
CUP in the R-2 and R-3 zones. Since 2005, the City has approved CUPs on two separate
occasions for residential condominium projects within the R-2 zone, amounting to the
approval of nine market rate residential units. Furthermore, the SP-4 Zone of the San
Fernando Corridors Specific Plan allows by-right development of multi-family residential
apartment units within the Mixed Use Transitional Sub-District, Downtown District, and
Maclay District; condominiums are permitted with the City’s approval of a parcel or tract
map. Under the Corridors Specific Plan, 76 multi-family dwellings have been approved since
2007, including two density bonus projects.
Second Dwelling Units
The passage of AB 1866 (effective July 2003) requires local governments to use a ministerial
process for second dwelling unit applications for the purpose of facilitating production of
affordable housing. AB 1866 does allow cities to impose development standards on second
dwelling units addressing issues such as building size, parking, height, setbacks, and lot
coverage.
In January 2004, the San Fernando City Council added Section 106-358 to the Zoning Code
to permit second dwelling units as an accessory use in all residential zone districts. The
maximum size of the detached second dwelling unit is 640 square feet and the unit is
required to be located to the rear of the existing primary single-family dwelling. Attached
units are also permitted, with the City Code allowing the construction of an attached unit that
is 30 percent of the floor area of the existing single-family dwelling. One additional on-site
(non-tandem) parking space is required for each bedroom in the second unit. All of the
required parking spaces for the primary single-family dwelling and the second dwelling unit
must be permanently reserved, maintained and used as accessible parking for vehicles. An
existing garage shall not be converted to a second dwelling unit unless alternate covered
parking is provided on-site that meets current zoning and building code requirements. In an
effort to increase the number of potentially affordable units, the City’s second dwelling unit
requirements do provide possible modifications to the development standards as part of a
conditional use permit approval process that may allow for the reduction in parking
standards, increase in the second dwelling unit’s building square footage and/or reduced
building setbacks.
The City requires that either the primary single-family dwelling or the second dwelling unit
to be occupied by the owner of the lot. The property owner is required to enter into a
restrictive covenant with the City, with the restrictive covenant recorded on the property to
enforce these provisions.
Second dwelling units are subject to site plan review and approval by the Community
Development Department. Since adoption of the new ministerial second unit provisions in
2004, the City has received a total of 65 applications for second units, indicative of the
demand for such units in the community. Second units are being provided in several
configurations, including above a detached garage, as a stand alone detached structure,

attached to the existing single-family home, and through conversion of an existing accessory
structure. A large number of second unit applications result from code enforcement referrals,
with staff working with property owners to remedy illegal conditions (garage conversions,
converted recreation or storage rooms, subdivided single-family dwellings, etc.) and
replacement of these un-permitted structures with legal second units.
Manufactured Housing and Mobile Home Parks
State law requires jurisdictions to permit manufactured housing as defined in Health and
Safety Code Section 18007 in any residential district where single-family detached units are
permitted subject to the same property development standards. In accordance with State law,
the City amended the Zoning Code in March 2013 to accommodate manufactured housing in
the R-1, R-2, and R-3 zones. Since 2002, the City has approved two manufactured housing
units constructed as single-family residential structures, each on an individual residential
parcel. The City also allows the development and operation of mobile home parks with a
CUP in the R-2 and R-3 districts.
Live/Work
The San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan accommodates live/work units within the Mixed
Use Transitional Sub-District, Downtown District, and Maclay District. The residential use
must be the predominant use of the premise and occupational activity is limited to a business
office or a studio, including the making of arts and crafts or other occupational activity
compatible with a residential use.
Boardinghouses
The City’s Zoning Ordinance defines “boardinghouse” as “a building where lodging and
meals are provided for compensation for five or more persons, not including a retirement
home.” Boardinghouses, which are allowed in San Fernando with approval of a CUP in the
R-3, provide a housing type that can accommodate special needs households, including
extremely low income households.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
Like boardinghouses, SROs can be a source of affordable housing for special needs
households, including extremely low income households. The City revised the Zoning
Ordinance in March 2013 to include the following definition and allow SROs with a CUP in
the C-1 and C-2 zones:
        “Single room occupancy unit (SRO)” means any building containing five or
        more guestrooms or units intended or designed to be used, or which are used,
        rented, or hired out, to be occupied, or which are occupied, for sleeping
        purposes by residents, which is also the primary residence of those residents.
        The individual units shall lack either cooking facilities or individual sanitary
 
                                                                                               
2013­2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                     39                          HOUSING CONSTRAINTS 

                                                                                               
                                                                                                   
 
                                                                                                                                  
       facilities, or both. However, for purposes of this definition, an SRO does not
       include residential care homes, senior housing projects, rooming and
       boarding houses, hotels and motels, bed and breakfast lodging, extended care
       facilities or hospitals.
SROs are subject to a number of development standards that are intended to facilitate and not
discourage the provision of safe and function units for occupants. For example, units must
be between 150 and 400 square feet and may - but are not required to - contain full or partial
kitchens or bathrooms. Each unit must have a separate closet and the facility must provide
common areas, laundry facilities, a cleaning supply room. The owner must submit a
management plan for the facility and projects with 10 or more units must provide office
space for an on-site manager. At least one parking space per unit plus one space for an on-
site manager is also required.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Community Care Facilities: The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act and
Community Care Facilities Act state that mentally, physically, developmentally disabled
persons and children and adults who require supervised care are entitled to live in normal
residential settings. To that end, State law requires that licensed family care homes, foster
homes, and group homes serving six or fewer persons be treated like single-family homes
and be allowed by right in all residential zones.
The City amended the Zoning Code in March 2013 to include the following definitions of
“community care facilities”:
       “Community care facility/Small means any facility as defined in the Health
       and Safety Code Section 1502(a), which provides nonmedical care on a 24-
       hour a day basis to six or less persons including, but not limited to persons
       with substance abuse illnesses, physically handicapped, mentally impaired,
       incompetent persons, and abused or neglected children. Small community
       care facility shall be considered a permitted us within all residential zoned
       districts.”
       “Community care facility/Large means any facility as defined in the Health
       and Safety Code Section 1502(a), which provides nonmedical care on a 24-
       hour a day basis to seven or more persons including, but not limited to
       persons with substance abuse illnesses, physically handicapped, mentally
       impaired, incompetent persons, and abused or neglected children. Large
       community care facility shall be considered a conditionally permitted use
       within all residential zoned districts.”
The R-1, R-2 and R-3 zone districts permit community care facilities/small by-right. The
Zoning Code does not subject small community care facilities to a use permit, building
standard, or regulation not otherwise required of single-family homes in the same zone, and

imposes no spacing requirements between small community care facilities; a licensed six-bed
adult residential facility is currently in operation on Jackman Avenue.
Large community care facilities (i.e., those that serve seven or more clients) are allowed with
approval of a CUP in residential zones and the C-1 and C-2 zones. These facilities are
subject to the same development standards, permit processing procedures, and findings for
approval as all other uses that require a CUP in these zones. Furthermore, there are no
spacing requirements between large community care facilities.
Although the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan does not explicitly list small community
care facilities as an allowable use, the Specific Plan includes a provision that allows the
City’s chief planning official to permit similar and compatible uses. The Zoning Code treats
small community care facilities as a regular residential use and these facilities are allowed
by-right within residential zones, including the R-2 and R-3 zones, which permit multi-
family uses. Accordingly, small community care facilities are considered similar to and
compatible with multi-family residential uses that are allowed by-right within the Specific
Plan’s Mixed Use Transitional Sub-District, Downtown District, and Maclay District.
Definition of Family: The following definition of “family” contained in the Zoning Code
does not limit housing opportunities for persons for disabilities:
        “Family” means any number of persons living together in a room comprising
        a single dwelling unit and related by blood, marriage or adoption or bearing
        the generic character of a family unit as a relatively permanent single
        household, including servants and other live-in employees, who reside therein
        as though members of the family. Any group of persons not related by blood,
        marriage or adoption but inhabiting a dwelling unit shall for the purpose of
        this chapter be considered to constitute one family if a bona fide single
        household, including servants and other live-in employees, is contained in
        such group.
Reasonable Accommodation: Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act impose an affirmative duty on local governments to make
reasonable accommodations in their zoning and other land use regulations as necessary to
afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example, it
may be a reasonable accommodation to allow covered ramps in the setbacks of properties
that have already been developed to accommodate residents with mobility impairments. San
Fernando accommodates most accessibility modifications through issuance of a building
permit. Handicapped ramps or guardrails (up to 42” in height) are permitted to intrude into
the standard setbacks required under zoning to allow first floor access for physically disabled
residents, eliminating the need for a zoning variance. Furthermore, in October 2013, the City
adopted a formal ministerial procedure for reviewing and approving requests for reasonable
accommodation under Federal and State law (City Code Chapter 106, Article VI, Division
16). Currently the City does not charge a fee for reasonable accommodation requests;

however, the ordinance states that a fee will be collected after the City studies options and a
fee is established by resolution.
Building Codes: For new construction, the City’s building code requires new housing to
comply with the 1998 amendment to the Fair Housing Act, with multi-family development
also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. New apartment
buildings are subject to requirements for unit “adaptability” on ground floor units. Adaptable
units are built for easy conversion to disabled access, such as doorway and hallway widths,
and added structural support in the bathroom to allow the addition of handrails.
Conclusion: The City has conducted a review of zoning and building code requirements,
and has not identified any barriers to the provision of accessible housing.
Transitional Housing
In compliance with State law (SB2), the City amended the Zoning Code in March 2013 to
allow transitional housing by-right within the R-1, R-2, and R-3 zones and subject to the
same permitting process and development standards as other residential uses within these
zones. The Zoning Code amendment also added the following definition:
        “Transitional housing” means housing operated under program requirements
        that call for 1) the termination of any assistance to an existing program
        recipient and 2) the subsequent recirculation of the assisted residential unit to
        another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in
        time, which point in time shall be no less than six months into the future
        (Health and Safety Code Section 50675.2(h)). Transitional housing may
        provide, but not be limited to, meals, counseling, and other services as well as
        common areas for residents. Transitional housing may be provided under all
        residential housing types. In all cases, Transitional housing shall be treated
        as a residential use under this chapter and shall be subject only to those
        restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same residential housing
        type located in the same zoning district.
Although the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan does not explicitly list transitional
housing as an allowable use, the Specific Plan includes a provision that allows the City’s
chief planning official (the Community Development Director) to permit similar and
compatible uses. The Zoning Ordinance treats transitional housing as a regular residential
use and this use is allowed by-right within residential zones, including the R-2 and R-3
zones, which permit multi-family uses. Accordingly, transitional housing is considered
similar to and compatible with multi-family residential uses that are allowed by-right within
the Specific Plan’s Mixed Use Transitional Sub-District, Downtown District, and Maclay
District. As with all residential uses, the applicant of transitional housing is required to
obtain a land use determination to ensure the proposed use is an allowable use within the
specific zoning district (including in the Specific Plan). The Community Development
Director or his or her designee will make the determination via an administrative process to

same regulations as similar uses in the same zone. This process is similar for all residential
uses.
The City also accommodates transitional housing within the M-1 and M-2 districts with
approval of a CUP.
Supportive Housing
Supportive housing links the provision of housing and social services for the homeless,
people with disabilities, and a variety of other special needs populations. The City amended
the Zoning Code in March 2013 to comply with recent changes in State law (SB2) and
accommodate supportive housing as a regular residential use within the R-1, R-2, and R-3
zones and subject to the same permitting process and development standards as other
residential uses within these zones. The City also amended the Zoning Code to include the
following definition:
         “Supportive housing” means housing with no limit on the length of stay and
         that is occupied by a target population as defined by Health and Safety Code
         Section 53260(d), as the same may be amended from time to time, and that
         provides a significant level of onsite and offsite services that assist the
         supportive housing residents in retaining the housing, improving their health
         status, maximizing their ability to live, and when possible, work in the
         community. Supportive housing shall be treated under this chapter as a
         residential use and shall be allowed as a permitted use in all residential
         zoning districts.
Although the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan does not explicitly list supportive
housing as an allowable use, the Specific Plan includes a provision that allows the City’s
chief planning official (Community Development Director) to permit similar and compatible
uses. The Zoning Ordinance treats supportive housing as a regular residential use and this
use is allowed by-right within residential zones, including the R-2 and R-3 zones, which
permit multi-family uses. Accordingly, supportive housing is considered similar to and
compatible with multi-family residential uses that are allowed by-right within the Specific
Plan’s Mixed Use Transitional Sub-District, Downtown District, and Maclay District. As
with all residential uses, the applicant of supportive housing is required to obtain a land use
determination to ensure the proposed use is an allowable use within the specific zoning
district (including in the Specific Plan). The Community Development Director or his or her
designee will make the determination via an administrative process to deem the supportive
housing (meeting SB 2 definition) as a residential use subject to the same regulations as
similar uses in the same zone. This process is similar for all residential uses.

Emergency Shelters
As discussed in homeless section of the Housing Element Needs Assessment (Section II),
there are an estimated 12 homeless persons in San Fernando. Although numerous emergency
shelters are located in the San Fernando Valley, existing shelters are all overcapacity and
there is a need for additional shelters in the area. In compliance with recent changes to state
law (SB 2), the City amended the Zoning Code in March 2013 to define and accommodate
emergency shelters with a ministerial permit. The Zoning Code includes the following
definition:
         “Emergency homeless shelter” means housing with minimal supportive
         services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months per
         calendar year or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may
         be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay. (Health and Safety
         Code Section 50801(e)). Supportive services may include, but are not limited
         to, meal preparation, an activities center, day care for homeless person’s
         children, vocational rehabilitation and other similar activities.
Pursuant to SB 2, San Fernando conducted a review of its zoning districts and determined the
M-2 (Light Industrial) Zone is most conducive to provision of an emergency homeless
shelter. The M-2 zone is characterized by industrial land uses including contractors storage
yards, manufacturing, food processing, and auto repair uses. The two primary M-2 corridors
in San Fernando include: First Street between Hubbard Street and North Maclay Avenue, just
north of the City’s bike path and the Southern Pacific Railroad right of way; and Arroyo
Avenue, between Fifth and Eighth Street, just east of the Pacoima Wash and the City’s
easterly boundary with the City of Los Angeles. Both M-2 Zone corridors are accessible to
public transit. M-2 zoned properties located along First Street are within walking distance of
the Sylmar/San Fernando Metrolink Station located at Hubbard and First Street, providing
access to light rail and bus transportation services. The M-2 Arroyo Avenue corridor is
within walking distance of bus stops located on Glenoaks Boulevard and Foothill Boulevard,
two major vehicular thoroughfares providing access between the City and the neighboring
communities of Sylmar and Pacoima.
The M-2 zone spans over 98 acres on 78 parcels, including more than 24 acres on 12 vacant
parcels. A review of potential underutilized sites within the M-2 zone identified between 25
underutilized properties with improvement values reported to be less than half the reported
land value indicating that the properties are feasible for either redevelopment or potential
conversion of existing structures to shelter use. Therefore, the City’s vacant and
underutilized M-2 parcels have more than adequate capacity to accommodate to City’s
estimated unsheltered need of 12 homeless persons and at least one year-round emergency
shelter.
The City allows emergency shelters in the M-2 Zone with approval of a ministerial permit
that is subject to the same development and operational standards as other permitted uses in

the zone. The City’s M-2 development standards are appropriate to facilitate emergency
shelters, and can be summarized as follows:
       Minimum lot size: 10,000 square feet
       Maximum lot coverage: 60 percent
       Maximum height: 45 feet
       Minimum lot width: 75 feet
       Setbacks: 10 foot front, side and rear
       Walls: 8 foot where property abuts residential, 6 foot otherwise
       Landscaping: Min 10 foot front landscaping; 15% of total lot shall be landscaped.
       Storage: No outside storage permitted
In addition to application of M-2 development standards, pursuant to SB 2, the City adopted
the following written, objective standards to regulate the following aspects of emergency
shelters to enhance compatibility:
       Maximum Number of Persons/Beds. The shelter for the homeless shall contain a
        maximum of 30 beds and shall serve no more than 30 homeless persons.
       Lighting. Adequate external lighting shall be provided for security purposes. The
        lighting shall be stationary, directed away from adjacent properties and public rights-
        of-way, and of an intensity compatible with the neighborhood.
       Laundry Facilities. The development shall provide laundry facilities adequate for the
        number of residents.
       Common Facilities. The development may provide supportive services for homeless
        residents, including but not limited to: central cooking and dining room(s), recreation
        room, counseling center, child care facilities, and other support services.
       Security. Parking facilities shall be designed to provide security for residents, visitors,
        and employees.
       Landscaping. On-site landscaping shall be installed and maintained pursuant to the
        standards outlined in Section 106-833.
       On-Site Parking. On-site parking for homeless shelters shall be subject to
        requirements for similarly zoned industrial uses as set forth in Section 106-822(d)(1).
       Outdoor Activity. For the purposes of noise abatement in surrounding residential
        zoning districts, outdoor activities may only be conducted between the hours of 8:00
        a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
       Concentration of Uses. No more than one shelter for the homeless shall be permitted
        within a radius of 300 feet from another such shelter.
       Refuse. Homeless shelters shall provide a trash storage area as required pursuant to
        Section 106-897(1) through Section 106-897(3).

       Health and Safety Standards. The shelter for the homeless must comply with all
        standards set forth in Title 25 of the California Administrative Code (Part 1, Chapter
        F, Subchapter 12, Section 7972).
       Shelter Provider. The agency or organization operating the shelter shall comply with
        the following requirements:
            o Temporary shelter shall be available to residents for no more than six months
                if no alternative housing is available.
            o Staff and services shall be provided to assist residents to obtain permanent
                shelter and income. Such services shall be available at no cost to all residents
                of a provider’s shelter or shelters.
            o The provider shall not discriminate in any services provided.
            o The provider shall not require participation by residents in any religious or
                philosophical ritual, service, meeting or rite as a condition of eligibility.
            o The provider shall have a written management plan including, as applicable,
                provisions for staff training, neighborhood outreach, security, screening of
                residents to insure compatibility with services provided at the facility, and for
                training, counseling, and treatment programs for residents.”
Farm Employee Housing
Because there is a very limited presence of farmworkers in the community, the City has not
identified a need for specialized farmworker housing beyond overall programs for housing
affordability. According to the 2007-2011 ACS, 116 San Fernando residents were employed
in agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, or mining industries, representing approximately
one percent of the City’s labor force. The City allows agricultural uses within the M-1 and
M-2 zones; however, agriculture is not the primary intent of these zones and therefore the
farmworker housing provisions of the California Employee Housing Act are not applicable.
Employee Housing
Under the Employee Housing Act, any employee housing providing accommodations for six
or fewer employees shall be deemed a single-family structure with a residential land use
designation. The City will amend the Zoning Code to address the provision of employee
housing.
3.      Site Improvements
As an entirely urbanized community, all of the necessary infrastructure systems in San
Fernando are already in place, and are generally sufficient to accommodate the level of
development that occurs in the City. One exception is the City’s aging water conveyance
system, which is being replaced on an ongoing basis through payment of a Capital Facility
Water charge on new development. The City actively maintains public improvements in

association with new development, such reconstruction of older streets, curbs, gutters and
sidewalks, in association with the construction of new private facilities.
Local streets comprise the majority of the residential street network in San Fernando, in
contrast to major and secondary arterial streets. The City’s standards for local streets right-of-
way is 60 feet, with a curb-to-curb pavement width of 36 to 40 feet, having two lanes, and
on-street parallel parking on both sides of the street. Within portions of the San Fernando
Corridors Specific Plan, a Pedestrian Oriented Corridor roadway classification has been
established to accommodate pedestrian use while meeting the demands of local traffic. This
is accomplished through various traffic calming techniques and reducing travel lanes to one
in each direction.
4.       Development Fees
Various fees and improvements are charged by the City to cover costs of processing permits
and providing services and facilities, such as utilities, schools and infrastructure. Almost all
of these fees are charged on a prorata share system, based on the magnitude of the project’s
impact or the extent of benefit that will be derived.
Table 28 shows the list of fees charged for a typical residential development in San
Fernando. In addition, there may be other fees assessed depending on the circumstances of
the development. For example, the building may need to pay an inspection fee for sidewalks,
curbs and gutters if their installation is needed. In order to lower the cost associated with
building affordable housing, the City provides for reduced fees and modified development
standards. For example, in December 2012, the City approved $250,000 in funding
assistance for the Harding Street Affordable Housing Project to facilitate an application for
Los Angeles County HOME Funds to develop a 29-unit affordable apartment building. The
local funding assistance package offered by the City included $25,000 in waived building
permit and water connection fees in addition to $225,000 in partial funding for required off-
site street and wastewater collection system improvements.
The City also charges two Capital Facility Fees: one for the sewer system, and one for the
water system. The Capital Facility Sewer Charge is necessary so that the City can pay its
share of upgrading the Hyperion Treatment Plant to increase its capacity. The Capital
Facility Water Charge is necessary so that the City can replace its old, substandard water
conveyance system.

As a means of further assessing the cost that fees contribute to development in San Fernando,
the City has calculated total Planning, Building and Public Works fees associated with three
common types of residential development in the community: a two-unit duplex, a 37-unit
condominium development, and a 20-unit apartment building.
As indicated in Table 29, per-unit fees for a prototypical duplex run $11,222, whereas
prototypical fees run $19,677 per condominium unit and $7,145 per apartment unit. The City
typically was able to use a Class 32 Categorical Exemption for infill development under
CEQA, reducing the costs associated with preparation of an environmental document.
Residential development fees constitute well under five percent of the estimated per-unit
development cost.
A 2012 National Impact Fees Survey (www.impactfees.com) surveyed 37 jurisdictions in
California, including two in Los Angeles County (Long Beach and Lancaster). The study
reports average impact fees of $31,014 per single-family unit and $18,807 per multi-family
unit in California. The City of San Fernando’s development impact fees and taxes are well
below the statewide average, constitute a relatively minor proportion of total development

5.      Local Processing and Permit Procedures
The evaluation and review process required by City procedures contributes to the cost of
housing in that holding costs incurred by developers are ultimately reflected in the unit's
selling price. One way to reduce housing costs is to reduce the time for processing permits.
As a small city with limited development, San Fernando does not experience the backlogs in
development typical in many larger jurisdictions. In most cases, even when Planning and
Preservation Commission or City Council review is required, approval can be obtained in
about three months. Small projects, such as single-family units, may receive over-the-counter
approval with a simple site plan. Residential Planned Development (RPD) Projects are
required to submit a conceptual site plan for preliminary review by the Community
Development Department planning staff in order to assist the applicant in developing more
precise plans as part of the CUP application to be reviewed by Planning and Preservation
Commission. In addition, the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan provides for multi-
family residential development as a permitted use within the SP-4 Zones’ Mixed Use
Transition Sub-District, Downtown District, and Maclay District.
The development review process in the City of San Fernando is governed by three levels of
decision-making bodies: the Community Development Department, the Planning and
Preservation Commission, and the City Council.
Single-family, multi-family, and mixed-use residential projects are reviewed by the
Community Development Department through the Site Plan Review process using applicable
development standards, design guidelines, and the City’s General Plan. The Community
Development Department reviews development proposals for land-use applicability,
environmental impacts, aesthetic value, architectural style, and landscape to ensure a quality
physical and environmental design. Any required environmental assessment is conducted
concurrent with the planning analysis.
San Fernando’s citywide Design Guidelines provide clear examples of the quality and type of
design that is recommended for all development in the City, including single-family, multi-
family, and mixed-use residential projects. The City encourages property owners and design
professionals to incorporate the guidelines into the design of a project. The application of
design review is processed concurrently with other project entitlements, if any, and does not
add time to the review process. Additionally, projects approved with minor modifications
related to setbacks, landscaping requirements, parking totals and parking stall dimensions can
be checked for compliance by staff and generally do not require subsequent review by the
Commission, and/or Council.
The Planning and Preservation Commission reviews all discretionary projects that require an
entitlement for a variance, CUP, subdivision, and/or specific plan. The Commission acts both
as an advisory body to the City Council as well as a final decision making body.

The typical review process for a single-family residence usually consists of an “over-the-
counter” plan check with the Community Development Department in which plans are
checked for compliance with applicable codes, development standards, and design
guidelines. From there, a property owner brings their plans to the Building & Safety
Division for submittal of the plans into plan check. For smaller projects, such as residential
remodels and accessory structures, the Building & Safety Supervisor may be able to provide
an “over-the-counter” plan check and a property owner would be able to obtain their building
permits the same day.
For all new residential projects and some significant residential remodel projects, a property
owner will leave their plans with the Building & Safety Division for plan check. Depending
on the quality and completeness of plans submitted for plan check, the entire process could
take as little as 10 days but may take longer if subsequent plan checks are required. Average
processing times for plan check/building permits in the City of San Fernando are
comparatively shorter than the neighboring City of Los Angeles.
When a residential development proposes to deviate from applicable codes, a discretionary
entitlement such as a variance may be required. The Planning Commission acts on these
requests and processing times would be an additional two months longer than the Site Plan
Review and plan check times noted above. However, minor accommodations to certain
development standards may be accommodated through the Modification process regarding
setbacks, parking dimensions/totals, and landscaping requirements. These modifications can
significantly reduce processing times and eliminate the requirement for making variance
findings and conducting a public hearing.
In summary, San Fernando’s processing and permit procedures are streamlined in
comparison to many jurisdictions, and do not serve as a constraint to development.
6.      Building Code
San Fernando contracts for services with the Los Angeles City Fire Department, and is hence
required to adopt the building codes adopted by the City of Los Angeles. These building
codes are based on the 2011 version of the California Building Code, along with all required
updates. The California Building Code establishes construction standards necessary to
protect public health, safety and welfare, and the local enforcement of these codes does not
unduly constrain development of housing.
The building codes have been amended since the Northridge Earthquake (1994) to include
additional seismic safety provisions for residences (e.g. a requirement for shear walls).
Although this adds to the initial cost of housing, it is considered necessary to the health and
safety of the residents, and also makes homeowners’ insurance easier to obtain.
The City of Los Angeles adopted the International Building Code (IBC), as required of all
jurisdictions in California. San Fernando has in turn adopted the 2011 edition of the City of
Los Angeles’ building codes with amendments to the administrative section of the code to

meet the City’s requirements. While the IBC will bring California building codes into
consistency with the rest of the country, changes from the prior State Building Code are
anticipated to moderately increase the costs of development in the San Fernando.
In terms of the local enforcement of the City’s Building Code, San Fernando maintains an
annual Apartment Inspection Program as a means of maintaining the habitable condition of
rental units. Through the CAPP program, the City implements targeted code enforcement in
conjunction with comprehensive neighborhood revitalization activities. The City conducts
the sensitive enforcement of its residential code by providing multiple written notices of code
violations to property owners and allowing sufficient time for compliance. Code violation
cases are also referred to the City’s Planning and Building and Safety Divisions in order to
facilitate correction of building code violations.
B.       MARKET CONSTRAINTS
1.       Availability of Financing
The availability of financing in a community depends on a number of factors, including the
type of lending institutions active in the community and the lending practices of those
institutions. Through analysis of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data on the
disposition of residential loan applications, an assessment can be made of the availability of
residential financing within a community.
Residential lending activity in San Fernando has declined sharply since preparation of the
2008-2014 Housing Element. The number of applications for conventional home purchase
loans declined from 745 in 2005 to 126 in 2011, reflecting the significant changes to
mortgage lending practices since the housing market crash of 2008. Table 30 provides
information on the status of home purchase, refinance and home improvement loan
applications in both San Fernando and Los Angeles County as a whole. As illustrated by this
table, at 74 percent, the home loan approval rates in San Fernando were slightly above the 71
percent approval rate countywide. Denial rates were identical within the San Fernando and
countywide (15 percent), but the City’s fallout rate was lower than the county’s (11 percent
vs. 14 percent). The City’s approval rate for refinance loans was slightly lower compared to
the countywide approval rate for these types of loans (60 percent vs. 65 percent). Only 14
households applied for home improvement loans in 2011.

2.       Price of Land
The availability and price of land represents a significant market constraint to housing
production throughout most of southern California.                                The former San Fernando
Redevelopment Agency played an important role in both land assembly and write-down in
support of affordable housing. In June 2010, the former Redevelopment Agency obtained an
appraisal for a 0.34-acre parcel located at 1422 San Fernando Road within the Mixed-Use
Transition Sub-District of the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan. The appraisal, which
took into account comparable commercial properties sold or listed for sale between
December 2009 and June 2010, established an appraised value of $900,000, or $60 per
square foot of land. Pursuant to the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan, the City intends
to facilitate redevelopment within the San Fernando Downtown on surface parking lots that
would provide for mixed-use projects with new residential units, new public parking
facilities, and commercial floor space.
Although construction and home purchase financing markets have constricted in recent years,
resulting in reduced demand for new residential construction, the cost of raw, developable
land still comprises a significant portion of overall housing costs. For this reason, developers
often seek City approval for the largest number of units allowed on a given parcel. This
allows the developer to distribute land and site development costs over a larger number of
units to be sold or rented.

3.       Development Costs
A major cost associated with the development of housing is the cost of building materials,
labor, and site preparation. The City reviewed the proforma for a recently-approved
affordable housing development to obtain an estimate of current development costs. The
total development cost for the 20-unit Mid-Celis Apartments, inclusive of permit processing,
inspections, site preparation, construction, and labor, was $412,172 per unit.
A reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials (above a minimum
acceptability for health, safety, and adequate performance) can result in lower development
costs. As part of the density bonus ordinance, the City could allow for affordable units to be
smaller in size (maintaining the same number of bedrooms) and have different features and
interior finishes than market rate units, provided all project units were comparable in
construction quality and exterior design. Another factor related to construction costs is the
number of units built at one time. As that number increases, overall costs generally decrease
as builders are able to take advantage of the benefits of economies of scale.
C.       ENVIRONMENTAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS
1.       Environmental Hazards
The primary environmental hazard in San Fernando impacting development is earthquake
risk. An Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone has been designated in the western portion of
the City around the San Fernando Fault, requiring special building considerations. Detailed
geologic investigations are required prior to development within the Special Studies Zone to
confirm the absence any active faults or fault branches. In addition to the San Fernando
Fault, the potentially active Verdugo Fault is located directly south of the City’s boundaries.
The Verdugo Fault is within a secondary zone where similar studies are required by the City
for all critical facilities, and high rise or complex buildings.
Portions of San Fernando would be subject to inundation if water breached the Pacoima
Dam. The City adopted a Pacoima Dam Evacuation Contingency Plan in 1985, establishing
procedures for the efficient evacuation of all people for potential inundation areas.
2.       Public Services and Facilities 
As a completely urbanized community, the City of San Fernando already has in place all of
the necessary infrastructure to support future development. All land designated for
residential use is served by sewer and water lines, streets, storm drains, telephone, electrical,
and gas lines. However, as an older community, much of the City's infrastructure is aging
and will require improvements or replacement over time. The City is replacing the water
conveyance system on an ongoing basis so that the existing capacity will be maintained.

Water and Sewer Service
The City of San Fernando Water Production Division is responsible for the operation and
maintenance of the City’s four water wells, three booster pump stations, four reservoirs, and
two pressure regulation stations. Local water supplies are drawn from the City’s wells
located in the Sylmar basin. This groundwater basin has been adjudicated, and the City of
San Fernando is limited in the amount of draw that it can safely extract from the basin
annually, as determined by a court appointed Watermaster. The City’s current allotted draw
from the basin is 3,405 acre-feet per year, which represents approximately 95 percent of the
City’s total water demand. The remaining five percent is in the form of imported water
purchased from the Metropolitan Water District (MWD), which supplements the local
ground water supplies. The current storage capacity for potable water in the City of San
Fernando is approximately 8.9 million gallons, with peak day demand of approximately 7.3
million gallons, or 82 percent of total storage capacity, as of 2008.
Sewer lines in San Fernando are maintained by the City’s Public Works Department, Sewer
Maintenance Division. The treatment and disposal of effluent is currently being provided
under contract with the City of Los Angeles at the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation
Plant located in Van Nuys (in the San Fernando Valley’s Sepulveda Basin). The Tillman
Reclamation Plant has a current treatment capacity of 80 million gallons per day (mgd).
The Environmental Impact Report (EIR) prepared for the City’s Downtown Developments
project in 2008 concluded that water supply, water storage, and wastewater treatment
facilities had adequate capacity to accommodate 261 to 272 new dwelling units and between
55,000 and 64,000 square feet of additional commercial space without mitigation measures.
Because the City’s residential sites inventory relies on existing land use designations and
zoning, it can be assumed that existing water supply, water storage, and wastewater treatment
facilities have adequate capacity to accommodate the City’s RHNA of 217 dwelling units
over the 2014-2021 RHNA period.
Senate Bill 1087 (enacted 2006) requires that water and sewer service providers develop
written policies that grant priority to proposed development that includes housing affordable
to lower income households. The legislation also prohibits water and sewer providers from
denying or conditioning the approval of development that includes housing affordable to
lower-income households, unless specific written findings are made. The City will provide a
copy of the adopted Housing Element to the MWD and City of Los Angeles within 30 days
of adoption. The City will also continue to coordinate with the MWD and City of Los
Angeles to ensure affordable housing developments receive priority water and sewer service
provision.

IV. HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
The following section presents the resources available for the development, rehabilitation and
preservation of housing in San Fernando. The section begins with an overview of the
availability of residential sites for future housing development and the adequacy of these
sites to address the City’s identified share of future housing needs. This section also presents
the financial resources available to support in the provision of affordable housing in the
community. The final part of the section is an overview of energy conservation and green
building resources available to the City and its residents.
A.       LAND RESOURCES
1.       Future Housing Needs (2014-2021)
In accordance with Government Code Section 65584, projected housing needs for each city
and county in the Southern California region are prepared by the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) under a process known as the Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA). SCAG’s Regional Council adopted the final RHNA in October 2012.
The RHNA for the fifth cycle of the Housing Element update covers the period of January 1,
2014 to October 31, 2021.
The RHNA process began with an update of the population, employment and household
forecasts for both the region as a whole and for each county. These forecasts were largely
derived from Department of Finance (DOF) population and employment forecasts and
modified by regional demographic and modeling efforts by SCAG. SCAG then
disaggregated the regional and county forecasts to each jurisdiction and estimated the number
of dwelling units needed to achieve a regional target vacancy rates and to account for
projected housing demolitions. Finally, SCAG distributed the total housing needed in each
jurisdiction by income category (very low, low, moderate and upper income).
To avoid the over concentration of new lower-income households in jurisdictions with higher
proportions of existing lower-income households (as required by State law), SCAG adjusted
the percentage of households in each income category for each jurisdiction.
In October 2012, SCAG adopted the final RHNA growth needs for each of Los Angeles
County’s cities plus the unincorporated area. The total housing growth need for the City of
San Fernando during the 2014-2021 RHNA planning period is 217 units. This total is
distributed by income category as shown in Table 31. While not explicitly addressed in the
RHNA, State law [Government Code Section 65583(a)(1)] now requires the Housing
Element to estimate the future needs of extremely low income households. As provided by
State law, the extremely low income need is estimated to be 50 percent of the very low
income category, or 28 units during this planning period.

                  (28 units)
2.      Future Housing Potential
State law mandates that a jurisdiction provide sufficient land to accommodate a variety of
housing opportunities for all economic segments of the community. California Government
Code Section 65583(a)(3) requires housing elements to contain an “inventory of land suitable
for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for
redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services
to these sites.” Compliance with this requirement is measured by the jurisdiction’s ability in
providing adequate land with adequate density and appropriate development standards to
accommodate the RHNA.
The City of San Fernando has adequate land capacity to meet the needs of all income groups
through the 2014-2021 RHNA period. The City intends to accommodate the RHNA on sites
that are under construction but will be occupied after January 1, 2014, can accommodate
second dwelling units, or can be developed or redeveloped with multi-family residential uses.
Projects Approved
In 2012, the City approved entitlements for two multi-family developments. To facilitate
these projects, the City supported developer applications for HOME funds and approved
density bonuses and rezones from industrial to multi-family residential. The Fermoore
Apartments at 1501 and 1529 First Street (APNs: 2520-011-038, -041, and -042) will include
84 moderate income units. The Harding Apartments at 112, 116, and 124 Harding Avenue
(APNs: 2520-017-002, -003, and -004) will include 29 very low income units. Both projects
are currently seeking tax credits and gap financing, and are anticipated to be constructed and
occupied after January 1, 2014.
Second Dwelling Units
San Fernando has facilitated infill development within its single-family residential
neighborhoods through provisions for second-dwelling units. As previously discussed in
Section III, the City’s second-dwelling unit regulations include: a ministerial approval
process; allowance for both attached and detached units; unit sizes up to 640 square feet for
detached units and 30 percent of the single-family unit size for attached units; and parking of
one space per bedroom. As a means of facilitating and encouraging second units, the City
also provides for modification of second-dwelling unit standards through a conditional use
 
                                                                                                              
2014­2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                              57                               HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES 

                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                     
permit process, including reduction in parking, increased second-dwelling unit square
footage, and/or reduced building setbacks.
Since adoption of the second-dwelling unit ordinance in 2004, San Fernando has received 64
site plan review applications, or an average of eight applications per year. While the City has
not denied any of these applications, nine were withdrawn by the applicants, resulting in
issuance of building permits for 55 second units. Given an average historical issuance of
nearly seven second unit building permits per year since 2004, it is assumed that 55
additional second dwelling units could be realistically developed during the 2014-2021
RHNA period.
Second dwelling units are considered an important source of “below market” housing
pursuant to Government Code Section 65852.150. Moderate income households can afford a
wide range of market-rate rental housing product in San Fernando (refer to Table 17 and
Table 20); therefore, second dwelling units are considered to be a suitable “below market”
housing option for lower income households.
Residential Sites Inventory
In addition to the units under construction and anticipated second dwelling units, Table 32
and Figure 3 identifies 25 residential sites that consist of 62 parcels and 14.8 acres of land to
accommodate the 2014-2021 RHNA. The sites are either undeveloped or contain minimal
improvements in poor condition. The City owns 21 parcels (7.0 acres) and the County owns
another six (1.5 acres). The remaining 35 parcels (6.3 acres) in the inventory have private
owners. Most of the parcels are located in the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan area
(SP-4 land use designation and zone) and can accommodate mixed use development at up to
43 units per acre. The other parcels are designated High Density Residential (HDR) and
zoned R-3, which allow up to 43 units per acre.
All of the sites are suitable for lower income housing because the maximum allowable
density is greater than 20 du/ac; the default lower income density for San Fernando per
Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B). However, based on past development
experience and local market conditions, the City has determined that sites larger than 1.25
acres are the most suitable to accommodate lower income housing. Sites that are smaller
1.25 acres in size but larger than 0.75 acre could potentially accommodate lower income
housing; however, moderate income housing is most likely to occur on these sites. For the
purposes of this analysis, sites that are smaller than 0.75 acre are assumed to be adequate to
accommodate above moderate income housing.

3.      Adequacy of Land Inventory to Accommodate RHNA 
When the City’s land inventory, including building permits for units with occupancy
anticipated after January 1, 2014, anticipated second dwelling units, and available residential
sites, provides a potential capacity for approximately 694 units. However, taking into
account that not all of the mixed use sites will be redeveloped with a residential component,
this Housing Element assumes a 50 percent reduction in the capacity for the mixed use
properties. This reduction would lower the development potential on the sites inventory to
478 units, adequate to accommodate the City’s RHNA for the planning period. Compared to
the RHNA, there is a surplus of 153 lower income sites, 85 moderate income sites, and 23
above moderate sites for this planning period (Table 33). As discussed in Section III
(Constraints), there are no infrastructure deficiencies that would preclude development of
these sites. Section V (Housing Action Plan) contains Program 5 to encourage and facilitate
the development of affordable housing units during the current planning period.

In summary, San Fernando has provided more than adequate sites to fulfill its regional
housing needs by income category. In addition to providing appropriate zoning and
development standards, the City will further encourage and facilitate production of affordable
units on these sites through regulatory incentives such as density bonuses and direct financial
assistance as funding becomes available.
4.      Availability of Infrastructure and Public Services 
As a completely urbanized community, the City of San Fernando has already in place all of
the necessary infrastructure to support future development. All land designated for
residential use is served by sewer and water lines, streets, storm drains, and telephone,
electrical, and gas lines. However, as an older community, much of the City's infrastructure
is aging and will require improvements or replacement over time. The City is replacing the

water conveyance system on an ongoing basis in conjunction with new development projects
so that the existing capacity will be maintained.
SB 1087, effective January 2006, requires water and sewer providers to grant priority for
service allocations to proposed developments that include units affordable to lower income
households. Pursuant to these statutes, upon adoption of its Housing Element, San Fernando
will immediately deliver the Element to local water and sewer providers, along with a
summary of its regional housing needs allocation.
B.      FINANCIAL RESOURCES 
There are a variety of potential funding sources available for housing activities in San
Fernando. Due to both the high cost of developing and preserving housing, and limitations
on both the amount and uses of funds, a variety of funding sources may be required. The
State’s dissolution of the San Fernando’s Redevelopment Agency in 2012 eliminated the
City’s primary source of affordable housing funding. Other funding resources available for
affordable housing development are highly limited.
Table 34 lists the potential funding sources that are available for housing activities. They are
divided into five categories including: Federal, State, county, local and private resources.

C.         OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
Establishment and enforcement of energy and water conservation standards, as well as
continuing programs and establishing new programs aimed at efficiency awareness, are key
factors in reducing energy and water consumption. Some conservation measures require a
higher up-front cost, but result in a net savings over the life of the improvement from reduced
energy and/or water consumption. In large part, utility bill reductions through energy and
water savings can be realized through the incorporation of energy conserving design features.
1.         Active Energy Efficiency Programs 
While the City does not directly offer energy-efficient programs, it serves as an information

2.      Building and Site Design Conservation
Conventional building construction, use and demolition along with the manufacturing of
building materials have multiple negative impacts on the environment. A rise in
environmental consciousness has led to the development of various building and site designs
that promote conservation. This includes site design standards associated with the
orientation of the building, installation of solar panels, and so forth.
In California, the Green Building Order challenges the State government to demonstrate
leadership by becoming a model of energy and resource efficiency at State-owned buildings.
This has been achieved through attainment of Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design (LEED) certification. Some local jurisdictions have taken this certification as an
opportunity to further promote a green building program.
LEED is an internationally recognized green building certification system that provides
different levels of certification in terms of energy efficiency. In summary, it is a third-party
verification that a building was designed and built using strategies aimed at improving
performance across the following metrics: energy savings, water efficiency, CO2 emissions
reduction, improved indoor environmental quality, and stewardship of resources and
sensitivity to their impacts.
There are four levels of progressive certification, based on the total number of points earned
within each of the LEED categories noted above, as follows: Certified; Silver; Gold; and
Platinum.
A total of six performance measures are utilized to review and promote a whole-building
approach to sustainability:
       Sustainable Site Development
       Water Efficiency
       Energy and Atmosphere
       Materials and Resources
       Indoor Environmental Quality

       Innovation and Design
While this is a relatively new concept and certification process, the City has several
participants in the LEED program, including affordable special needs projects. It is the
developer’s goal to generate enough energy to power all common areas including the
community center and all hallways.
It is the City’s intent to facilitate the permitting process for commercial and residential
property owners wishing to pursue a LEED certification.
Glazing
Energy efficient window glazing resists heat flow. The strategic placement of such windows
can reduce energy consumption for more efficient interior climate control. Glazed windows
on south-facing walls allow for passive solar heating by allowing direct sunlight to enter a
room and warm the space. Because the windows minimize heat flow, this warmth remains in
the building. The sun is higher in the sky during the summer. Therefore, less direct sunlight
enters the building during these months than in winter. Also, during winter weather, the
glazing minimizes the amount of heat that is transferred directly through the window to the
cooler air outside. Typically, avoidance of window placement on the west side of a building
will minimize the overheating effects of direct afternoon sun.
Landscaping
Strategically placed vegetation can help regulate the amount of direct sunlight on windows,
as well as reduce indirect heating from concrete and other hardscape materials. The
incorporation of deciduous trees and vines in landscaping plans along the south and west
facing sides of buildings can buffer the heating effects of direct sun light in summer, while
allowing winter sun light to warm the building. The use of native or low-water use plants
and efficient irrigation, such as drip systems, can minimize water needs for outside
landscaping. Automatic irrigation systems that incorporate time clocks with multiple stations
can offer options for varying water needs.
Building Design
There are several variables in the design of a building that impacts the energy efficiency of
the structure. The building orientation, placement and specification on windows, and design
of details, such as exterior overhead structures and roof overhangs, can affect the passive
solar performance of a building. These measures reduce the need for energy-consuming
heating and cooling system use. The installation of over-head structures such as eaves,
arbors, and roof overhangs can reduce the amount of direct sunlight that passes through
windows, thus preventing overheating. An arbor directly above a south-facing window can
limit solar access in the summer and allow for passive heating in winter when combined with
deciduous vines.

Cooling/Heating Systems
There are several energy-saving alternatives to using traditional energy sources for cooling
and heating systems that can reduce the cost of housing. Attic ventilation systems allow
rising heat to escape the building. This type of system, such as a whole-house fan, can create
an air circulation pattern that encourages the movement of cooler air to circulate through a
building with the use of traditional energy sources. Solar heating systems for swimming pool
facilities reduce energy costs. Hot water solar panels can provide solar-heated domestic
water with minimal use of flow restrictors on all hot water faucets and showerheads.
Weatherization Techniques
Weatherization techniques such as insulation, caulking, and weather-stripping can reduce
energy use for air-conditioning up to 55 percent and for heating as much as 40 percent.
These techniques help to seal a dwelling unit to guard against heat gain in the summer and
prevent heat loss in the winter. Other comfortable benefits include noise and dust reduction.
Efficient Use of Appliances
Most households contain a variety of appliances. Regardless of the types present, appliances
can be used in ways that increase their energy efficiency. Elimination of unnecessary and/or
older appliances and proper maintenance and use of the stoves, ovens, clothes dryers, clothes
washers, dishwashers, refrigerators, and other major appliances will keep energy costs to a
minimum.
Efficient Use of Lighting
Costs of lighting a home can be reduced through the purchase of efficient light bulbs that
produce the most lumens per watt. New fluorescent bulb fixtures can greatly improve
lighting levels while reducing energy costs. Compact fluorescent bulbs replace existing
incandescent bulbs in average fixtures. These compact fluorescent bulbs are 10 times more
efficient and last longer than regular incandescent bulbs. Time clocks, photocell sensors, and
motion sensors for security lights and areas where lights might be left on otherwise can make
a significant reduction in lighting usage.
Load Management
The time and day when power is used can be as important as how much power is used.
Power plants must have enough generating capacity to meet the highest level of consumer
demand for electricity. Peak demands for electricity occur on summer afternoons and
coincide with higher costs for electric generation. Therefore, reduction use of appliances
during these peak load hours can reduce the need for new power plants just to meet unusually
high power demands and will reduce overall energy costs.

V. HOUSING PLAN
Sections II, III, and IV of the Housing Element establish the housing needs, opportunities and
constraints in San Fernando. This Plan sets forth the City’s goals, policies and programs to
address identified housing needs.
A.      GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS 
This section of the Housing Element sets forth the goals, policies and programs the City
intends to implement in order to address housing needs, and constitutes San Fernando’s
Housing Plan. Housing programs include both programs currently in operation in the City,
as well as new programs developed in response to the analysis of housing needs, constraints,
and opportunities. The Housing Program Implementation Table 35 located at the end of this
section summarizes the 2013-2021 goals for each program, as well as program funding
sources and time frame for implementation. Table 36 summarizes San Fernando’s quantified
objectives for new construction, rehabilitation and preservation for the 2013-2021 planning
period.

                structures/sites that are substandard or in disrepair.
Implementing Programs
1. Residential Rehabilitation Program: The City’s Single-family Rehabilitation Loan
Program for lower and moderate income (up to 120 percent of AMI) residential property
owners has historically provided up to $50,000 per loan to perform major rehabilitation,
general property repairs, seismic retrofit, and code deficiency repairs. Once properties are
brought up to code, funds may also be used for bedroom additions to address household
overcrowding. As part of the rehabilitation program, the City has also offered Single-family
Emergency Rehabilitation Grants. These are for emergency repairs for health and safety
related issues reserved for lower income (80 percent of AMI) households. As the primary
focus of the City’s rehabilitation program is the correction of building code violations, there
is close coordination between the City’s code enforcement activities and rehabilitation
programs.
The State’s dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency effectively crippled the City’s ability
to continue the Residential Rehabilitation Program. The City will allocate a portion of the
“boomerang” funds allowed through the Department of Finance meet-and-confer process to
the continuation of this program. The City will also seek to establish partnerships with other
public agencies and non-profit organizations to obtain funding for residential rehabilitation
activities during the planning period.
        2013-2021 Objectives:
         Subject to available funding, assist 20 households during the planning period.
           Seek partnerships with public agencies and non-profit organizations that provide
            rehabilitation assistance. Support affordable housing providers in their funding
            applications for acquisition/rehabilitation activities, such as providing letter of
            support or consistency finding with the City’s General Plan.
           Promote energy efficiency programs offered by utility companies on City website
            and public counters; in 2014, add links to websites of utility companies and
            update annually.
           Annually research State and Federal funds available for housing rehabilitation
            assistance and pursue funding if feasible and appropriate.

2. Neighborhood Preservation and Revitalization Program (CAPP): In mid-2006, the
City initiated a new program entitled Community Action Plan for Neighborhood Protection
and Preservation (CAPP). CAPP utilizes a comprehensive approach to identifying and
abating illegal activity, nuisance behaviors, and substandard physical conditions at individual
problem properties. CAPP involves the designation of neighborhood focus areas and
outreach to residents adversely impacted by nuisance properties within these areas (refer to
Figure 1 in the Needs Assessment for the current CAPP Focus Areas).
The City conducts the sensitive enforcement of its residential codes by conducting outreach
and education on property maintenance issues, providing multiple written notices of code
violations to property owners, and allowing sufficient time for compliance. Illegal dwelling
units are frequently encountered as part of CAPP code enforcement activities. Code
enforcement staff continues to work with applicants to obtain proper permits to address
overcrowding problems and ensure that the construction and occupancy of second dwelling
units is legal and safe. Code violation cases are directly referred to the City’s Planning and
Building and Safety Divisions.
        2013-2021 Objectives:
         Continue to implement CAPP within designated Focus Areas.
           Annually report to City Council on the status of the program.
3. Housing Inspection Programs: The City has initiated a multi-family residential
inspection program, allocating the City’s Building and Safety Supervisor and Community
Preservation staff time for program implementation. The program is focused on improving
the overall quality of the housing stock, and focuses on apartments with three or more units,
encompassing over 1,000 of the City’s housing units. The inspection program utilizes
HUD’s Housing Quality Standards (HQS) as the basis for evaluating housing conditions.
Similar to CAPP, identified code violations under the Apartment Inspection Program are
directly referred to the City’s housing rehabilitation program coordinator. In addition, the
City requires inspection of an ownership housing unit dwelling prior to re-sale.
        2013-2021 Objectives:
         Complete inspections of approximately 200 apartment units on an annual basis.
           Complete inspection of ownership housing units prior to resale.
           Conduct outreach and education efforts on the City’s housing inspection programs
            annually.
           Provide City Council with annual program status reports.
4. Lead Based Paint Awareness: San Fernando is one of 10 cities selected by the Los
Angeles County Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPB) for primary
prevention activities. Community outreach about lead poisoning will be programmed in

seeking other funding sources.
       2013-2021 Objectives:
        Continue to remediate lead cases through the City’s residential rehabilitation
            programs.
           Annually coordinate with LA County and Pacoima Beautiful regarding funding
            and programs.
           Host or conduct a lead based paint seminar every other year during the planning
            period, subject to available funding.
GOAL 2.0:       Provide a Range of Housing Types to Meet Community Needs
Policy 2.1:     Provide adequate housing sites to facilitate the development of a range of
                residential development types in San Fernando that fulfill regional housing
                needs. Assist residential developers in identifying sites through dissemination
                of the sites inventory.
Policy 2.2:     Provide opportunities for mixed use and infill housing development in the
                City’s Corridor Specific Plan Areas as part of the City’s overall revitalization
                strategy.
Policy 2.3:     Provide affordable housing opportunities for San Fernando’s lower income
                population, including extremely low income households, and households with
                special needs (such as seniors and persons with disabilities, including persons
                with developmental disabilities).
Policy 2.4:     Encourage developers to include rental housing that is large enough to
                accommodate large households and provide zoning incentives, such as
                through the density bonus ordinance, to facilitate family housing
                development.
Policy 2.5:     Utilize zoning tools, including density bonus, to provide affordable units
                within market rate developments.
Policy 2.6:     Facilitate infill development on small parcels by allowing for modified
                development standards where multi-family projects include the preservation
                of an existing historic property. Provide property tax incentives for

Implementing Programs
5. Facilitate Affordable and Special Needs Housing Development: Affordable and
special needs housing developments face a number of hurdles, including financing,
development codes and standards, and in some cases, public opposition. The City can
encourage and facilitate affordable and special needs housing through financial assistance,
removal of regulatory constraints, and administrative support. With limited funding, the City
will rely on the following actions to encourage affordable and special needs housing
production during the planning period:
      Collaborate with Affordable Housing Developers: Affordable and special needs
       housing developers work to develop, conserve and promote rental and ownership
       affordable housing. Particularly in relation to senior housing and housing for persons
       with disabilities (including persons with developmental disabilities), the developer is
       often, but not always, a local organization interested in developing affordable
       housing. The affordable and special needs housing developer is often involved with
       what is called "assisted housing", where some type of government assistance (tax-
       exempt bonds or tax credits) is provided to keep rents affordable. An affordable or
       special needs housing developer can help meet the goals for additional housing by
       implementing or assisting with the implementation of programs described in this
       Housing Element. The City will continue to collaborate with affordable and special
       needs housing developers to identify potential sites, write letters of support to help
       secure governmental and private-sector funding, and offer technical assistance related
       to the application of State density bonus provisions.
      Regulatory Concessions and Incentives: The City will continue to work with
       developers on a case-by-case basis to provide regulatory concessions and incentives
       to assist with the development of affordable and senior housing. In a relatively small
       city like San Fernando, this is the most effective method of assisting developers, as
       each individual project can be analyzed to determine which concessions and
       incentives would be the most beneficial to the project’s feasibility. State-mandated
       regulatory concessions and incentives could include, but are not limited to, density
       bonuses, parking reductions, fee reductions or deferral, expedited permit processing,
       and modified or waived development standards. Any requested concessions or
       incentives would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis while simultaneously working
       to ensure the project is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.
      Transit-Oriented Development: Much of the City’s future residential development
       potential is located within the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan area. To
       facilitate development in the Corridors Specific Plan area, the City will be working to

      establish Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) standards in the vicinity of the
      Sylmar-San Fernando Metrolink Station, located along First Street and North
      Hubbard Avenue. In 2013, the City received a planning grant to develop a TOD
      overlay zone in the vicinity of the Metrolink Station that would facilitate the
      development of additional housing stock. This planning effort will establish
      appropriate development standards for TOD projects and develop incentives for
      affordable housing and housing for persons with special needs (such as seniors,
      persons with disabilities, including developmental disabilities). The City will also
      pursue funding from State and Federal programs to make infrastructure improvements
      in the area.
     New Funding Sources: Dissolution of the City’s Redevelopment Agency by the State
      in 2012 eliminated the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund (LMIHF), formerly
      the City’s primary mechanism for providing direct funding support of affordable and
      special needs housing development. The City will actively pursue County, State,
      Federal and private funding sources as a means of leveraging local funds and
      maximizing assistance, with a goal of securing at least three new funding sources.
      2013-2021 Objectives:
       On an ongoing basis, maintain contact information for affordable and special
          needs housing developers for the purposes of soliciting their involvement in
          development projects in San Fernando.
         Participate with affordable and special needs housing developers to review
          available Federal and State financing subsidies and apply as feasible on an annual
          basis.
         On an ongoing basis, assist and support developers of housing for lower income
          households, especially housing for extremely low income households and persons
          with special needs (such as seniors, large families, persons with disabilities,
          including persons with developmental disabilities), with site identification,
          supporting applications, conducting pre-application meetings, assisting with
          design and site requirements, and providing State-mandated regulatory incentives
          and concessions.
         Collaborate with developers of affordable and special needs housing over the
          planning period to facilitate the construction of 195 affordable units over the
          planning period (10 extremely low income, 30 very low income, 55 low income,
          and 100 moderate income units).
         Complete TOD overlay in 2016 with incentives for affordable housing and
          housing for persons with special needs (including persons with
          disabilities/developmental disabilities).
6. Conservation of Existing and Future Affordable Units: The City’s former
Redevelopment Agency assisted in the development of 172 deed-restricted affordable lower
and moderate income units within seven different multifamily rental housing developments
 
                                                                                             
2013­2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                    77                                HOUSING PLAN 

                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                   
since 1996 (see Table 21). None of these projects are at risk of converting to market rents by
2023. Another 113 affordable units within two developments are slated for construction
during the 2013-2021 planning period.
        2013-2021 Objectives: Monitor the status of the existing and future affordable rental
        housing stock in San Fernando. The City will work with property owners, interest
        groups and the State and Federal governments to implement the following actions on
        an ongoing basis to conserve its affordable housing stock:
           Monitor Units: On an ongoing basis maintain contact with providers and owners
            to monitor the status of existing and future affordable units.
           Work with Potential Purchasers: If units are discovered to be at risk of
            converting to market rate during the planning period, where feasible, provide
            technical assistance to public and non-profit agencies interested in purchasing
            and/or managing the at-risk units.
           Tenant Education: The California legislature extended the noticing requirement
            of at-risk units opting out of lower income use restrictions to one year. Should a
            property owner pursue conversion of the units to market rate, the City will ensure
            that tenants were properly noticed and informed of their rights.
7. Monitor Residential Capacity: City staff will monitor the consumption of residential
acreage to ensure an adequate inventory is available to meet the City’s RHNA obligations.
To ensure sufficient residential capacity is maintained to accommodate the RHNA, the City
will develop and implement a formal ongoing (project-by-project) evaluation procedure
pursuant to Government Code Section 65863. The City’s development application tracking
software will notify staff when an application has been submitted for development of a
property included in the residential sites inventory (Table 32). Should an approval of
development result in a reduction of capacity below the residential capacity needed to
accommodate the remaining need for lower income households, the City will identify and, if
necessary, rezone sufficient sites to accommodate the shortfall and ensure “no net loss” in
capacity to accommodate the RHNA.
        2013-2021 Objective:
         Develop and implement a formal evaluation procedure pursuant to Government
            Code Section 65863 by January 1, 2015.
           Monitor the City’s continued ability to meet its RHNA as part of the City’s annual
            report to HCD on Housing Element implementation.
8. Removal of Governmental Constraints: State law requires that Housing Elements
address, and where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental constraints to the
maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. The City will continue to monitor
its development process and zoning regulations to identify and remove constraints to the
development of housing.

The City will also continue to monitor federal and State legislation that could impact housing
and comment on, support, or oppose proposed changes or additions to existing legislation, as
well as support new legislation when appropriate. Special attention will be given by the City
in the minimizing of governmental constraints to the development, improvement, and
maintenance of housing.
        2013-2021 Objectives:
         On an ongoing basis, monitor changes in State and Federal laws and revise City
            policies, programs, and regulations as necessary and appropriate.
GOAL 3.0:       Assist Lower Income Tenants in Finding the Appropriate Resources to
                Allow them to Remain in the Community
Policy 3.1:     Take positive steps to ensure all segments of the population are aware of their
                rights and responsibilities regarding fair housing.
Policy 3.2:     Assist in settling disputes between tenants and landlords.
Policy 3.3:     Assist residents in locating providers of housing services.
Policy 3.4:     Maintain a housing service directory that provides referrals for rental
                assistance, local affordable housing projects, senior housing, housing legal
                assistance, fair housing, homeownership assistance, and rehabilitation, and
                disseminate information to the public.
Implementing Programs
9. Housing Choice Voucher Rental Assistance Program: The Housing Choice Voucher
program extends rental subsidies to very low income households, providing a voucher to pay
the difference between the fair market rent (FMR) as established by HUD and what a tenant
can afford to pay (i.e. 30 percent of household income). The voucher allows a tenant to
choose housing that costs above the payment standard, providing the tenant pays the extra
cost. The Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles (HaCOLA) coordinates Housing
Choice Voucher rental assistance on behalf of the City. An average of 34 San Fernando
residents received Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance annually between 2008 and
2012, with 79 additional residents on the waiting list as of July 2013. HUD requires that 75
percent of new admissions be limited to extremely low income households (30 percent AMI).
Given the significant gap between market rents and what these extremely low and very low
income households can afford to pay for housing, Housing Choice Vouchers play a critical
role in allowing such households to remain in the community, and is a key program to
address the needs of extremely low and very low income households.

        2013-2021 Objectives:
         Continue to support HaCOLA’s administration of the Housing Choice Vouchers
            Program and assist an average of approximately 35 extremely low and very low
            income households annually during the planning period.
           Encourage landlords to accept Housing Choice Vouchers.
           Prepare bilingual HaCOLA program contact information for prospective landlords
            and tenants.
           Support the IVHA’s applications for additional voucher allocations and efforts to
            maintain and expand voucher use in the City.
10. Fair Housing Program: The City currently contracts with the Fair Housing Council of
San Fernando Valley (FHCSFV) to provide fair housing and tenant/landlord information to
residents. Services include: investigation of discrimination complaints; community outreach
and education; and counseling and referrals to other agencies when individuals may have
been victims of discrimination. The FHC conducts several workshops each year in the San
Fernando Valley for tenants, and separately for landlords/owners to discuss fair housing
rights and responsibilities. Landlord/tenant counseling services involves informing landlords
and tenants of their rights and responsibilities under the California Civil Code and mediating
conflicts between tenants and landlords. They also offer free apartment manager trainings in
English and Spanish at their offices.
The City monitors and attempts to minimize discriminatory housing practices with the
assistance of the FHC. The City advertises the availability of fair housing services by
posting bi-lingual fair housing brochures at public counters, including at recreation and
senior centers. Furthermore, the City has accommodated FHC workshops and City staff refer
potential fair housing issues to the FHC.
        2013-2021 Objectives:
         Annually contract with a fair housing service provider to promote open housing
            practices for residents, and to facilitate communication between tenants and
            landlords.
           Continue to disseminate bi-lingual fair housing brochures in a variety of public
            locations, including City Hall, San Fernando Recreation Park community center,
            Las Palmas Park community center, and the local County library, and provide
            enhanced outreach through coordination of fair housing education with existing
            community events.

GOAL 4.0:      Provide Opportunities for Lower and Moderate Income Households to
               Become First-Time Homebuyers
Policy 4.1:    Provide information and referral about homebuyer assistance programs
               available through the County, State, and private lenders to existing and
               potential residents.
Policy 4.2:    Promote homebuyer education seminars offered through the Los Angeles
               County Community Development Commission.
Policy 4.3:    Provide homebuyer assistance to lower and moderate income purchasers in
               City-assisted developments, when feasible.

               informational handouts at the Community Development Department public
               counter.
Implementing Programs
11. Homeownership Programs: Prospective lower and moderate income San Fernando
homeowners have access to three County-run first-time homebuyer programs:
      Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC): This program enables lower and moderate
       income first-time homebuyers to receive a Federal income tax credit of up to 15
       percent of the annual mortgage interest paid. The MCC reduces Federal income tax,
       increases take-home pay, and increases the qualifying loan amount for homebuyers.
       Program assistance is available only to income-eligible persons and families who
       have not owned a home in the last three years. The property must be a single-family
       detached home, condominium, or townhouse.
      Home Ownership Program (HOP): The Los Angeles County Community
       Development Commission (CDC) administers the County’s Home Ownership
       Program (HOP), offering up to $60,000 in deferred payment, zero percent interest
       loans for downpayment and closing cost assistance for lower income households.
       San Fernando is a participating jurisdiction in the HOP program, and has for-sale
       housing stock that falls within the sales price maximums. This program can be used
       in conjunction with the Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC). Prospective participants
       must attend eight hours of homebuyer counseling.
      Southern California Home Financing Authority (SCHFA): SCHFA offers a mortgage
       revenue bond program that issues 30-year mortgage revenue funds at below-market
       interest rates. To be eligible for the program, the buyer must be a first-time
       homebuyer whose income may not exceed 120 percent of the Los Angeles County
       median income. The program also provides downpayment and closing cost assistance
       in the form of a gift equivalent to four percent of the first loan amount.

APPENDIX A: PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
SUMMARY
Government Code Section 65583(c)(8) requires that local governments make “a diligent
effort…to achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community in the
development of the housing element." Public participation played an important role in the
formulation and refinement of the City’s housing goals and policies and in the development
of a Land Use Plan, which determines the extent and density of future residential
development in the community.
City residents had several opportunities to recommend strategies, review, and comment on
the Housing Element. Two Community Workshops were held prior to completion of the draft
Housing Element and the draft document was presented to the Planning Commission at a
noticed public meeting prior to transmittal of the document to the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD).
Meeting notices were posted on the City’s website, and notification was published in the
local newspaper in advance of the workshops/meetings. Copies of the draft Element were
made available for review at City Hall and were posted on the City website, and notices were
sent directly to agencies that serve the City’s special needs populations and to others who
requested to receive such notification. These service providers and interested parties included
organizations that represent the housing interest groups. Table A-1 provides a summary of
public comments while Table A-2 includes the public notification distribution list.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this
Housing Element update.

APPENDIX B: REVIEW OF PAST
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Under State Housing Element law, communities are required to assess the achievements
under their adopted housing programs as part of the periodic update to their housing
elements. These results should be quantified where possible (e.g. the number of units
rehabilitated), but may be qualitative where necessary (e.g. mitigation of governmental
constraints). The results should then be compared with what was projected or planned in the
earlier element. Where significant shortfalls exist between what was planned and what was
achieved, the reasons for such differences must be discussed.
The City of San Fernando 2008-2014 Housing Element sets forth a series of housing
programs with related objectives for the following areas:
         Housing and Neighborhood Conditions
         Development of New Affordable Housing
         Tenant Assistance
         Homeownership
This section reviews the City’s progress to date in implementing these housing programs and
their continued appropriateness for the 2013-2021 Housing Element. Table B-1 compares
quantified objectives and accomplishments during the 2008-2014 planning period (through
end of 2012); however, new construction objectives are reported for the RHNA cycle, which
started in 2006. Table B-2 summarizes the City’s housing program accomplishments,
followed by a review of its quantified objectives. The results of this analysis will provide the
basis for developing the comprehensive housing program strategy presented in Part C of this
section.

information on the development history of
San Fernando and the legal basis for historic
preservation.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS AND
REGULATIONS
Coordination between the Historic
Preservation Element and the other elements
of the General Plan is essential. The
integration of historic preservation issues
into other elements such as land use and
housing is necessary to avoid incompatible
goals between the elements. Land use and
zoning regulations should be compatible
with and promote the preservation of
historic properties. A review of the City’s
General Plan and Zoning Code was
conducted to determine their compatibility
with historic preservation. Further
information on this review is available in the
Existing Conditions Report: Historic
Preservation in the City of San Fernando
prepared by Historic Resources Group in
December 2003.
A number of solutions are available to
make the zoning code more compatible
with historic preservation. The zoning
code may be amended to make special
exceptions for historic properties to be
used in ways not permitted under the
current code. Parking restrictions can be
waived for owners of historic properties.
Coordination between the zoning code and
Historic Preservation Element is essential
so that the two are not in conflict.

To implement the program, the local
government is required to adopt enabling
legislation.
Mills Act contracts offer several advantages
to property owners. Participation of the
property owner is voluntary. In areas where
land value represents a large portion of the
market value, such as high-density
commercial and residential districts, the
Mills Act method of valuation adjusts the
property tax to reflect the actual use of the
site. This results in a property tax reduction.
In the event the property is sold, the Mills
Act contract continues and the reduced
property tax is passed on to a new owner.
The City of San Fernando does not currently
participate in the Mills Act program. This
Historic Preservation Element recommends
that the City implement this program in
order to contribute to the revitalization of
residential neighborhoods and commercial
districts and to solidify San Fernando’s
commitment to historic preservation.

definition of a “qualified historical building

building, site, structure, object, district or
collection of structures, and their associated
sites, deemed of importance to the history,
architecture or culture of an area by an
appropriate local, state or federal
governmental jurisdiction.” (Cal. Code
Regs. tit. 24, § 8-218.) Qualified historical
buildings or properties include buildings or
properties listed in or determined eligible for
listing in official historical registers or
inventories, such as the National Register of
Historic Places, California Register of
Historical Resources, State Historical
Landmarks, and State Points of Historical
Interest.
In addition, local buildings or properties
listed or determined eligible for listing on
officially adopted City registers, inventories,
or surveys of historical or architecturally
significant sites, places or landmarks
constitute qualified historical buildings or
properties under the SHBC. Property
owners should work with the Community

project planning process to determine if their
building or property is recognized as a
qualified historical building or property.

conditions, individual property owners, may

SAN FERNANDO HISTORIC PRESERVATION ELEMENT WORKPLAN
Priority List: Policy Implementation
This workplan is designed to prioritize the policies listed in the Goals and Objectives sections and synthesize
that information into a workable five-year program. Policies that advance one objective in the plan often
support other objectives and the program as a whole. To make these connections visible and explicit, policies
have been cross-referenced in this section. The columns labeled “Related Objective(s)” and “Related Goals”
list these cross-references.
Establishing and maintaining a comprehensive historic preservation program requires both one-time actions,
such as adopting a new historic preservation ordinance, and annual activities, such as celebrating Historic
Preservation Week. These recommended policies are listed separately to emphasize differences in
implementation. Table 1 lists one-time actions according to priority. Table 2 lists those actions that should be
implemented annually or on a continuing basis.
Adopting a new historic preservation ordinance, obtaining Certified Local Government status, and establishing
a historical resources inventory are identified as three critical priorities. Because these actions each require
careful research, specific planning, and phased implementation of their own, an approach to implementing these
policies is presented below as a series of steps.

Glossary
Character-defining features are those physical aspects of a property’s design and form
which identify it as belonging to a specific time and place. Design, materials, form, and
style of decorative features and spaces, both interior and exterior, make up the character-
defining features of a building.
A comprehensive survey includes a historic context statement, photographs,
architectural descriptions, statements of significance for all eligible properties, analysis,
and recommendations.
Designation is the act of recognizing, labeling, or listing a property as being historic.
Properties in the City may be designated at the federal level as a National Historic
Landmark or in the National Register of Historic Places, at the state level in the
California Register of Historical Resources or as a California Historical Landmark or
California Point of Interest, or as a historic site by the San Fernando City Council. A
designation formally establishes that a building or site has significance.
Historic context is the area or domain within which a property has historic significance.
Historic contexts allow for an understanding of how the property is a part of an important
historic development or event.
Historical resources include properties that meet the criteria for significance. They may
be designated but also may be eligible for designation and not formally listed.
A historical resources inventory lists by address all properties in a city that have been
evaluated through historical resources surveys or other evaluations, including those
properties that have been identified as non-historic. “Status codes” developed by the
State Office of Historic Preservation are frequently used to categorize properties listed in
the inventory and their significance or non-significance.
Historic significance is the reason why a property should be considered historic.
Establishing historic significance is important because it demonstrates that the
determination that a building is historic is based in sound reasoning. An argument for
historic significance must be based upon legally established criteria such as those
required for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, the California Register of
Historical Resources, or a local landmark program.
Integrity is the authenticity of a property’s historic identity, evidenced by the survival of
physical characteristics and materials that existed during the property’s historic or pre-
historic period of significance.
A “qualified historical building or property” under the State Historical Building Code
is “any building, site, structure, object, district or collection of structures, and their
associated sites, deemed of importance to the history, architecture or culture of an area by
an appropriate local, state or federal governmental jurisdiction.” (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 24,
§ 8-218.)
City of San Fernando Historic Preservation Element, April 5, 2005                             49

A reconnaissance survey provides preliminary information about potential historic
resources, but does not include a historic context statement or evaluations of significance.
The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines are the standards used in the
preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, or reconstruction of a historic property. The Standards
delineate accepted treatments for the protection and rehabilitation of materials.

           Dear Colleagues,
           As State Historic Preservation Officer, I am pleased to announce that the Office of Historic
           Preservation has implemented revised status codes effective immediately and request that they
           be used as appropriate in documentation that is submitted to the Office through any of the
           programs OHP administers. Because the status codes are used to reflect the application of
           California Register and local criteria as well as designations or eligibility for the California and
           National Registers, the name “California Historical Resource Status Codes” replaces the term
           “National Register Status Codes.”
           Years ago the Office of Historic Preservation devised the National Register Status Codes to
           classify resources in the state’s inventory which had been identified through a regulatory
           process or local government survey. The California Environmental Quality Act requires state
           and local public agencies to identify the environmental impacts of proposed discretionary
           activities or projects on historical resources. By definition, under CEQA, resources listed in or
           determined to be eligible for listing in the California Register are recognized as part of the
           environment, as are resources identified as significant in a survey or in the state inventory with
           status codes 1-5. Unfortunately, the codes were never revised to reflect eligibility or listing in the
           California Register, which was established in 1998. As a consequence, local governments and
           other agencies that have relied on the status codes in making environmental review and local
           land use planning decisions have had incomplete information.
           Highlights of Status Codes Revision
               x     Under the broad definition for status code 1, “Properties listed in the National Register
                     (NR) or the California Register (CR),” 1D and 1S will continue to signify National
                     Register listing as they have in the past. Additions of 1CD, 1CS, and 1CL will denote
                     resources listed on the California Register by the State Historical Resources
                     Commission, paralleling formal listing on the National Register by the Keeper. Because
                     properties listed in or formally determined eligible for listing in the NR are automatically
                     listed in the California Register, there is no need to assign dual codes.
               x     The definition of status code 2 will be broadened to “Properties determined eligible for
                     listing in the National Register (NR) or the California Register (CR).” Just as 2s were
                     previously used and will continue to be used to identify resources formally determined
                     eligible for the National Register through a regulatory process, 2Cs will identify
                     resources formally determined eligible for the California Register by the State Historical
                     Resources Commission.
               x     The parallel between the resources identified through a survey as appearing eligible for
                     the National Register and those which appear eligible for the California Register are
                     reflected in the 3 codes which are broadly defined as “Appears eligible for National
                     Register (NR) or California Register (CR) through Survey Evaluation.”
               x     Formerly, 4s were assigned through surveys to properties that had the potential, if some
                     circumstance or event was to happen in the future, to become eligible for the National
                     Register. Thus by definition, resources identified as 4s were not eligible for the National
                     Register. Yet under CEQA, they were presumed to be historical resources. OHP will be

                                                                                                   2
        converting all former 4s to either a 7N or 7N1, whichever is appropriate, to signify that
        these resources need to be reevaluated using current standards and applying both
        National Register and California Register criteria. Henceforth, a status code of 4 will be
        broadly defined as “Appears eligible for National Register (NR) or California Register
        (CR) through other evaluation,” and will be used to denote those state owned properties
        evaluated pursuant to Public Resources Code §5024.
    x   To facilitate their CEQA reviews and other land use planning decisions, local
        governments asked for codes that more clearly reflected locally significant
        properties that are not eligible for either NR or CR. The 5 status codes are
        broadly defined as “Properties Recognized as Historically Significant by Local
        Government.” Status codes 5S3 and 5D3, formerly used to identify properties that were
        not eligible for the California Register, National Register or local listing but warranted
        special consideration in local planning, will be converted to 6L, “Determined ineligible for
        local listing or designation through local government review process; may warrant
        special consideration in local planning.”
    x   Users of the California Historic Resource Status Codes should keep in mind that the
        status codes are broad indicators which, in many cases, serve as a starting place for
        further consideration and evaluations. For example, the broad definition of status code 6
        is “Not Eligible for Listing or Designation as specified.” Several of the 6 status codes
        denote only that a resource was evaluated and determined ineligible for the National
        Register through a regulatory process; as the resource was not evaluated for the
        California Register or local significance, it may still warrant consideration under CEQA or
        at a local level.
    x   Similarly, resources given a status code 7, have either not been evaluated for the
        National Register (NR) or the California Register (CR) or need revaluation. It can not be
        assumed that they are not historic resources.
When the status codes were first created, complex elaborations on the code groups resulted in
nearly 150 individual codes. Many were ambiguously defined; others were never even used.
OHP will consolidate groups of closely related codes and convert them to the relevant revised
code. Technical assistance bulletins and other published materials will be updated to reflect the
revised codes and note which former codes have been converted.
We believe that implementation of the California Historical Resource Status Codes (HR Status
Codes) will simplify and clarify the identification, evaluation, and understanding of the
significance of California’s historic resources and will better promote their recognition and
preservation. We thank you for your support in these endeavors.
