a series of three connected documents that will
guide future conservation and change in the city.
The Ventura Vision set the stage for this plan and
enumerated four overarching principles that were
affirmed by the community to guide Ventura into
the future:
     •  Reach broadly and deeply into the
        community.
     •  Build on existing cultural, natural, and
        economic assets.
     •  Emphasize and encourage connections
        within the community.
     •  Work proactively and collaboratively to
        achieve the community’s shared vision.
The final piece of the trilogy is a form-based
Development Code. This code represents a new
approach to zoning that prioritizes the
appearance of development, while still ensuring
that neighboring land uses are compatible and
appropriate.
The General Plan will be put into action through
the Development Code and a variety of other
mechanisms, such as a mobility plan, specific
plans, community plans, and capital improvement
projects that will together shape the future of
Ventura.       The General Plan purposefully
anticipates the Code focusing on the districts,
corridors, and neighborhood centers where future
change will be most pronounced.

open space. Although a number of programs are
in place to protect coastal and watershed
ecosystems and to maintain and preserve
existing open lands, some natural features in and
around the city have been compromised by the
impacts of human activity.
As in many communities across the nation,
concern is growing in Ventura about human
impacts on natural resources.          The historic
spread of local development has given rise to
grassroots efforts aimed at preserving Ventura’s
viable agricultural land, open space, and hillsides.
The 1995 Save Our Agricultural Resources
initiative (see Appendix B) and the 2001 Hillside
Voter Participation Area (Appendix C) measure
require voter approval before the city can expand
into open space areas. The Ventura Hillsides
Conservancy formed in 2003 seeks to preserve
local hillsides, canyons, and open space.

Hillsides
The hills of the Transverse Range rise 1,200 feet
above Ventura, providing an important visual
backdrop that frames the City. Not only do these
hills provide residents and visitors with scenic
vistas, they are also part of a larger integrated
ecosystem comprised by the hillsides, coastal
areas, rivers and barrancas that together provide
a rich habitat for many species. It is vital to the
community that these hillsides that lie outside the
city limits (with a County land use designation of
either Open Space or Agriculture), are protected
and preserved.
These hillsides, by definition, are coterminous
with the Hillside Voter Participation Area, and
comprise the Hillside Open Space community as
depicted on the General Plan Diagram (page 3-
22). Because the Hillside Voter Participation
Area measure prohibits the extension of City
urban services to the hillsides through 2030
without voter approval, the General Plan Diagram
identifies the hillsides affected by the measure
with a Planning Designation of Open Space. The
full text and map of the Hillside Voter Participation
Area appears in Appendix C (as required by the
act).     This chapter calls working with land
conservation organizations to establish a Ventura
hillsides preserve, and Chapter 6, Our Active
Community, contains actions to work with the
County to create public trails in the hillsides.

Footnotes for Table 3-2:
Growth estimates for the Arundell community consider the likely development of the 75-acre McGrath property with a mix of uses and development of
other vacant lands. Growth estimates for the North Bank area consider the possibility of a large retailer in that area. Estimates of growth in the SOI/Other
Infill sites are based on the following general assumptions: (a) 101/126 Orchard site will develop similarly to a project recently proposed for that site; (b)
Wells/Saticoy sites will develop in accordance with ongoing planning efforts for those areas; (c) the Pierpont area will develop generally in accordance with
a conceptual project recently considered by the City; (d) Second Units will be added at a rate of 15/year; (e) roughly half of underutilized lands identified in
the Housing Element will be re-developed over the next 20 years; (f) all vacant lands outside the districts and corridors will be developed in accordance
with the proposed planning designations. Planned and Pending Developments based upon the City's 2004 Pending Projects list. Building areas do not
include self storage facilities.
The following potential projects not included in the 2004 Planned and Pending Developments list have been included in the future development totals: (1)
150,000 square feet of industrial development in the North Bank area; (2) 165,000 square feet of retail development along Wells Road in the Saticoy area;
(3) 50,000 square feet of office development on a 3.5-acre site along Ralston Drive. The Auto Center industrial project is included in the North Bank
district; the other two projects are included in the "vacant" category. The square footage associated with these projects has been added to the projections
of future growth to provide a conservative analysis of possible future impacts.
Together Table 3-2 and Figure 3-1, Infill Areas, offer a sense of how
much growth Ventura might experience by 2025, and a picture of
where such change is likely to occur. Precisely how and when
development happens and what resources are conserved will be
determined by the actions presented in the ten chapters of the
General Plan, and by the specific land development standards. This
plan is one of many tools the City will use to control where and how
any future development takes place.

   Figure 3-4. The Transect
   Transect: a system of ordering human habitats in a range from the most natural to the most urban. For convenience, the Transect is divided into six
   zones which describe the physical character of place at any scale, according to the intensity of land use and urbanism. The T-Zones are T1 Natural, T2
   Rural, T3 Sub-Urban, T4 General Urban, T5 Urban Center, and T6 Urban Core.
   Natural Zone (T1): consists of lands approximating or reverting to a wilderness condition, includes lands unsuitable for settlement due to topography,
   hydrology, or vegetation.
   Rural Zone (T2): consists of lands in open or cultivated state or sparsely settled. These may include woodlands, agricultural lands, grasslands and
   irrigable deserts.
   Sub-Urban Zone (T3): though similar in density to conventional suburban residential areas, differs by its superior connectivity and by allowing home
   occupations. It is typically adjacent to other urban T-zones. This zone is naturalistic in its planting. Blocks may be large and the roads irregular to
   accommodate site conditions.
   General Urban (T4): has a denser and primary residential urban fabric. Mixed-use is usually confined to certain corner locations. This zone has a wide
   range of building types: singles, side yard and rowhouses. Setbacks and street tree settings are variable.
   Urban Center (T5): is the equivalent of the main street area. This zone includes mixed-use building types that accommodate retail, offices and dwellings,
   including rowhouses and apartments. This zone is a tight network of streets and blocks with wide sidewalks, steady street tree planting and buildings set
   close to the frontages.
   Urban Core (T6): is the equivalent of a downtown. It contains the densest urbanism – the tallest buildings and the greatest variety of uses, particularly
   unique ones such as financial districts and important civic buildings. This zone is the least naturalistic of all the zones; street trees are formally arranged
   or non-existent.

                          Plan which areas, if any, should be possible
                          expansion areas. These areas were identified
                          because they embody opportunities for achieving
                          a variety of community vision objectives that may
                          not be feasible within existing city limits. The
                          community further went on to agree upon a set of
                          rules about how these areas should be planned.
                          These areas were analyzed in the environmental
                          impact report prepared for this General Plan, and
                          a “long term potential expansion strategy” will be
                          formulated to guide the process of prioritizing any
                          potential future expansion areas to fulfill General
                          Plan objectives that may not be able to be
                          achieved by our “Infill First” approach. Should

Metrolink and Amtrak need to be linked to each

agreement between the City and the Ventura
County Transportation Commission calls for

best way to integrate all of these services is
with a major multi-modal transit center that also
accommodates potential additional future
alternative transportation modes.
SCAT buses are equipped with wheelchair lifts
and adjustable steps to ensure access for all
riders. SCAT also offers discounted fares for
seniors and disabled riders, as well as dial-a-
ride service. However, seniors and mobility-
impaired persons also desire frequent fixed-
route service in smaller vehicles, and all riders
need upgraded amenities at a number of stops.

                          The Automobile and Types of Roadways
                          The most basic component of the mobility
                          system is the thoroughfare, used not only by
                          people who drive, but also by people who ride
                          the bus, bike and walk. Thoroughfares
                          encompass sidewalks, bicycle lanes, travel
                          lanes, and are the most utilized means of travel
                          in Ventura. This system is organized into the
                          following classifications: local thoroughfares,
                          collectors, and arterials (see Figure 4-3,
                          Roadway Classification Plan – also known as
                          “Circulation Plan”).
                          Local Thoroughfares
                          Local thoroughfares provide mobility within
                          neighborhoods and are generally not shown on
                          the Roadway Classification Plan.          Local
                          thoroughfares include alleys, lanes, and “yield”
                          streets.
                          Collectors
                          Collectors serve as links between local
                          thoroughfares. Collectors may front residential
                          and neighborhood-serving commercial uses.
                          Collectors can be configured as boulevards,
                          avenues, streets, and main streets.
                          Arterials
                          Arterials are the primary mechanism for cross-
                          town travel and serve the major centers of
                          activity. These roads typically carry a high
                          proportion of the total urban area travel.

                          Storm Drainage
                          Storm runoff travels from the hills above Ventura
                          through the City until it is absorbed into the
                          ground or reaches the Ventura River, the Santa
                          Clara River, or the Pacific Ocean. To convey the
                          occasional high flows associated with storms, the
                          Ventura County Flood Control District oversees
                          about 20 natural or concrete lined barrancas that
                          serve as the major drainage courses for local
                          watersheds. The City has about 20 miles of off-
                          street drain system designed to convey runoff
                          from all but the most severe of storms, in which
                          case water also runs off via city streets.

                          watercourses that are not already lined with
                          concrete as natural flood channels can help
                          reduce peak flows by limiting water velocity.
                          Incorporating natural features into drainage
                          systems rather than hard treatment devices also
                          can improve water quality and reduce
                          maintenance costs. The policies and actions in
                          this chapter seek to prevent increases in future
                          storm water impacts by incorporating natural
                          drainage and flood control features such as
                          wildlife ponds and wetlands – instead of cement
                          retention basins – into the storm drain system
                          where possible. Such less intensive approaches
                          not only cost less, but they also preserve
                          environmental resources and protect water
                          quality.

these privileges. The city offers 34 developed
parks, 45 miles of linear park and trail network,
stellar beaches, specialized play and sports
facilities and programs, communitywide events,
senior and youth activities, and two 18-hole
tournament class public golf courses. Figure 6-1
at the end of this chapter shows the locations of
various public facilities in the city.
The City is committed to ensuring that its citizens
have ample access to high quality spaces for
leisure and active recreation. The City’s adopted
standard of 10 acres per 1,000 residents has
created far more park area than would be
possible under the basic State level of 3 acres
per 1,000, and also tops the more ambitious
National Park and Recreation Association
benchmarks for specific park types (see Table 6-
1). The City continues to create customized
facilities like the Community Park (approved by
the voters pursuant to SOAR) to expand
opportunities for local residents to enjoy healthy,
active lifestyles.

7. OUR HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITY
Our goal is to build effective community
partnerships that protect and improve the
social well-being and security of all our
citizens.
Community Wellness
Keeping the small town feel of Ventura depends
on working together as a community to look out
for the well being of all residents, especially those
most at risk. Community wellness requires
comprehensive preventative care, as well as
careful preparation for and response to dangers
within the built environment and to risks posed by
natural processes (see Figure 7-1).
Adequate shelter, sufficient medical services,
walkable neighborhoods, and proper nutrition
create an essential foundation for a healthy
community. Reducing as much as possible the
threat to people and property from earthquakes,
landslides, floods, and fires further enhance the
collective wellness of the city. In addition, a
healthy Ventura community requires thorough
protection from crime, and freedom from
pollution, unwanted noise, and the threat of
hazardous materials.

                                  Red Mountain and Country Club Faults. Areas
                                  closest to these faults are most likely to

                                  of an earthquake. Liquefaction during an
                                  earthquake is most likely to occur in areas with
                                  loose, granular soils where the water table lies
                                  within 50 feet of the surface. As the soil liquefies,
                                  buildings and other objects may tilt or sink.

                                  type and groundwater depth. The hills north of
                                  Poli Street/Foothill Road have experienced many
                                  historic landslides and are prone to future

                                  Program limits development in the area to
                                  minimize dangers from landsliding, erosion,
                                  flooding, and fire, and to retain natural and scenic

               Fire and Emergency Response
               The Ventura Fire Department responds to fire,
               medical, and disaster calls from six stations in the
               city. The Department’s goal is to reach the scene
               within 4 minutes 90% of the time.               The
               Department has a reciprocal agreement with the
               County Fire Protection District to ensure that
               Ventura residents receive the swiftest service
               possible. The Department also has a
               responsibility to provide disaster preparedness for
               the City. Particular fire department concerns in
               the City include:
               •   the need for reliable and sustainable source
                   of fire service revenue,
               •   lengthy response times to areas farthest from

                          Ventura Police response to crimes in progress or
                          alarm soundings averages less than six minutes,
                          and less than sixteen minutes for most other
                          calls. While the local crime rate is slightly higher
                          than State average, the Department hopes to
                          better engage the community in policing efforts to
                          lower crime levels. As part of a Strategic Planning
                          Process, the Department has established the
                          following goals:
                          •    reduce crime and the fear of crime
                          •    improve the quality of life in neighborhoods
                          •    enhance community and police partnerships
                          •    develop personnel
                          •    continued accountability
                          One-time grant funding has helped add officers
                          dedicated to community crime prevention, gang
                          control, and youth mentoring programs. As these
                          grants end the City must face the challenge of
                          funding these services. Actions in this Chapter
                          seek to improve the full range of police services
                          to maximize community safety by increasing
                          staffing, outreach efforts, and public access to
                          police services.

Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials include medical and
industrial     wastes,     pesticides,  herbicides,
radioactive materials, and combustible fuels.
Improper use, storage, transport, or disposal of
these materials may result in harm to humans,
surface or ground water degradation, air pollution,
fire, or explosion. Most of the several hundred
facilities in Ventura that use or store hazardous
materials lie along Ventura Avenue or in the
Arundell industrial district.
The Fire Department maintains a team specially
trained and equipped to respond to hazardous
materials emergencies. Additional equipment
and personnel for large-scale hazardous
materials incidents is available from the County
Fire Protection District, the City of Oxnard, and
the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center in
Port Hueneme.
The Westside and North Avenue neighborhoods
include about 30 brownfields: sites that may
possess contaminated soils but also have
potential for reuse. Cleanup of these sites will
make them more attractive for redevelopment
that can improve the neighborhoods and
generate employment and tax revenue. The City
has established a Brownfield Assessment
Demonstration Pilot Program to fund site
assessments and initiate remediation. The
policies and actions in this chapter intend to
minimize the risk of adverse health effects of
hazardous materials by regulating their location
and seeking funding for cleanup of brownfield
sites to encourage their reuse.

At a more fundamental level, the ideas of what
constitutes a library and how it fits the patterns of
a learning community need to be reexamined.
Integration with school libraries, including the
Ventura College Learning Center, is a top priority
for this reevaluation, as embodied in the policies
and actions in this chapter.
City and Community Programs
Traditional classroom settings alone cannot
provide the complete set of educational skills and
experience needed by people of all ages. The
City provides a variety of learning opportunities,
including youth and adult art programs,
environmental education, adaptive recreation
programs, youth after-school activities, and
summer camps. Community organizations also
provide a range of classes and experiences,
including tours, museums, lectures, and hands-on
activities. Expanding venues for such activities
and promoting participation in them are key
challenges.

Focused attention should be paid to making our
public decision-making processes easier to
understand and participate in. Citizens have little
time or patience for complicated planning and
entitlement processes that drag on for years. By
establishing clearer rules and public processes
for applying them, the policies and actions in this
chapter will enable more citizens to feel that they
will be heard and their contributions valued. By
involving a wider range of the community in
clearly setting Ventura’s planning goals and
standards of quality, we can devote more time to
achieving those goals and less time wrangling
over specific proposals.
Ventura also needs to reestablish places for civic
discourse.      While the City will continue to
encourage the use of our beautiful City Hall for its
historic role of government by and for the people,
we also need a hierarchy of civic spaces citywide
that are strategically located in neighborhood
centers and accessible by pedestrians (see
Chapter Three, Action 3.8). Every neighborhood
should have access to a physical location
designated for public gathering and civic
purposes.
Our long-range vision is to build an ethic and a
fabric of robust civic engagement – what De
Toqueville called “the habits of the heart.” His
phrase evokes what the Ventura Vision called
“direct engagement in public affairs” through
“participation, hard work and collaboration . . .
sustaining Ventura as an exceptional place.” The

                                                   ORDINANCE NO. 95-33
               AN ORDINANCE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF SAN BUENAVENTURA ADOPTING
               AN ORDINANCE AMENDING THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN WITH RESPECT TO THE
               PRESERVATION OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS.
       The people of the City of San Buenaventura do hereby ordain as follows:
Section 1. Findings and Purpose.
       A.      The protection of existing agricultural and watershed lands is of critical importance to present and future
residents of the City of San Buenaventura (City of Ventura). Agriculture has been and remains the major contributor to
the economy of the City and County of Ventura, creating employment for many people, directly and indirectly, and
generating substantial tax revenues for the City.
       B.      In particular, the City of Ventura and surrounding area, with its unique combination of soils, micro-climate
and hydrology, has become one of the finest growing regions in the world. Vegetable and fruit production from the County
of Ventura and in particular production from the soils and silt from the Santa Clara and Ventura rivers have achieved
international acclaim, enhancing the City’s economy and reputation.
       C.      Uncontrolled urban encroachment into agricultural and watershed areas will impair agriculture and threaten
the public health, safety and welfare by causing increased traffic congestion, associated air pollution, and potentially
serious water problems, such as pollution, depletion, and sedimentation of available water resources. Such urban
encroachment would eventually result in both the unnecessary, expensive extension of public services and facilities and
inevitable conflicts between urban and agricultural uses.
       D.      The unique character of the City of Ventura and quality of life of City residents depend on the protection of a
substantial amount of open space lands. The protection of such lands not only ensures the continued viability of
agriculture, but also protects the available water supply and contributes to flood control and the protection of wildlife,
environmentally sensitive areas, and irreplaceable natural resources.
August 8, 2005                                                                                         2005 Ventura General Plan
                                                                                                                             B-1

A P P E N D I X      B
            E.     The Resolution by which the City of Ventura adopted its Comprehensive Plan on August 28, 1989,
   Resolution No. 89-103, at page 4, contains in part the following “mitigation measures” in recognition of the importance of
   preserving agriculture resources:
                   “Any potential significant adverse impacts are mitigated by substantially limiting the amount of
            agricultural land converted from an agricultural land use designation limiting the amount of prime
            farmland converted, and by making the various agricultural land areas designated for potential
            development subject to conditions which narrowly limit the possible land use.”
            F.     The Comprehensive Plan sets out as Objective 4 (at II-9) the desire to:
            “Continue to preserve agricultural and other open space lands within the City’s Planning Area.”
   And, the Comprehensive Plan describes as the first Goal of its Resource Element (at II-3) the objective to:
            “Preserve agricultural and open space lands as a desirable means of shaping the City’s internal and
            external form and size, and of serving the needs of residents.”
            G.     The purpose of this initiative is to ensure that the Goals and Objectives of the Comprehensive Plan are
   inviolable by transitory short-term political decisions and that agricultural, watershed and open space lands are not
   prematurely or unnecessarily converted to other non-agricultural or non-open space uses without public debate and a vote
   of the people. Accordingly, the initiative ensures that until December 31, 2030, the general plan provisions governing
   agricultural land use designation and intent may not be change except by vote of the people. In addition, the initiative
   provides that any lands designated as “Agriculture Use”, referring to both “Agricultural Use (not to be reconsidered until
   after the Year 2010” and Agricultural/Institutional” on the City of Ventura’s General Plan “Land Use Plan Map” adopted by
   the City Council by Resolution 89-103 on August 28, 1989, as amended through February 1, 1995, will remain designated
   as Agricultural Use until December 31, 2030, unless the land is redesignated to another land use category by vote of the
   people, or redesignated by the City Council for the City of San Buenaventura pursuant to the procedures set forth in this
   initiative.
   August 8, 2005                                                                                          2005 Ventura General Plan
                                                                                                                                 B-2

A P P
          H.      This initiative allows the City Council to redesignate agriculture lands only if certain if certain findings can be
   made, including (among other things) that the land is proven to be unsuitable for any form of agriculture and redesignation
   is necessary to avoid an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation.
   Section 2. General Plan Amendment.
   The Agricultural Lands Preservation Initiative hereby reaffirms and readopts until December 31, 2030, The “Agricultural
   Use” designations as defined in the City of San Buenaventura Comprehensive Plan adopted August 28, 1989, as
   amended through February 1, 1995, at pages III-25 and III-26, with the modification that the “target date” is extended from
   2010 until after December 31, 2030.
          The following terminology shall replace the current “Agricultural Use” designation defined at page III-25 of The
   Plan:
          Agricultural Use
          The Agricultural Use (not to be reconsidered until after the Year 2030) category identifies those lands
          that are designated for agricultural use on the Land Use Plan Map.
          The target date of 2030 associated with the Agricultural Use designation indicates a review date after
          which agriculturally designated lands may be reconsidered for urban uses. However, during the life
          of this plan as amended by initiative, it is intended that only agricultural uses are permitted on these
          lands, except as such lands may be appropriate to public open space and recreational usage.
          Furthermore, any updates to this Plan are not intended to imply that development would necessarily
          be appropriate at hat time.
          In addition, the initiative hereby reaffirms and readopts until December 31, 2030, the “Agricultural” designations set
   forth on the of the City of Ventura Comprehensive Plan “Land Use Plan Map” adopted by the City Council on August 28,
   1989, as amended through February 1, 1995, which map is incorporated herein by reference, modified, as appropriate, to
   delete the reference year 2010 and replace it with the reference year 2030.

          Finally, the text of the Amendment Procedures of the City of Ventura Comprehensive Plan adopted August 28,
   1989, as amended through February 1, 1995, (at XI-I) shall be amended to add a new subsection which provides:
          Limitation on General Plan Amendments Relating to “Agricultural Use”
          a)      Until December 31, 2030, the provisions and designations governing the intent for lands designated
                  “Agricultural Use” of the Land Use Element and Resource Element adopted on August 28, 1989, as
                  amended through February 1, 1995, shall not be amended unless such amendment is approved by vote of
                  the people.
          b)      All those lands designated as “Agricultural Use” in the City of Ventura Comprehensive Plan “Land Use Plan
                  Map” adopted by the City Council on August 28, 1989 as amended through February 1, 1995, shall remain
                  so designated until December 31, 2030 unless redesignated to another general plan land use category by
                  vote of the people, or redesignated by the City Council pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsections c)
                  or d), below.
          c)      Except as provided in subsection d), below, land designated as “Agricultural Use” may be redesignated by
                  the City Council to a land use other than “Agricultural Use” as defined by the Comprehensive Plan adopted
                  by the City Council on August 28, 1989, as amended through February 1, 1995, only if the City Council
                  makes all of the following findings supported by the evidence:
                  i)      The land is immediately adjacent to areas developed in a manner comparable to the proposed use;
                  ii)     Adequate public services and facilities are available and have the capacity and capability to
                          accommodate the proposed use;
                  iii)    The proposed use is compatible with agricultural uses, does not interfere with accepted agricultural
                          practices, and does not adversely affect the stability of land use patterns in the area;
                  iv)     The land proposed for redesignation has not been used for agricultural purposes in the past 2 years
                          and is unusable for agriculture due to its topography, drainage, flooding, adverse soil conditions or
                          other physical reasons; and
   August 8, 2005                                                                                            2005 Ventura General Plan
                                                                                                                                  B-4

                                              S  A V E    O U R   A G R I C U L T U R A L     R E S O U R C E S    ( S O A R   )
              v)      The land proposed for redesignation pursuant to this subsection (c) does not exceed 40 acres for any
                      one landowner in any calendar year, and one landowner may not obtain redesignation in the
                      Comprehensive Plan of “Agricultural Use” land pursuant to this subsection (c) more often than every
                      other year. Landowners with any unity of interest are considered one landowner for purposes of this
                      limitation.
       d)     Land designated as “Agricultural Use” on the Land Use Plan Map may be redesignated to another land use
              category by the City Council if each of the following conditions are satisfied:
              i)      The City Council makes a finding that the application of the provisions of Section 2 (a) would
                      constitute an unconstitutional taking of the landowners’ property; and
              ii)     In permitting the redesignation, the City Council allows additional land uses only to the extent
                      necessary to avoid said unconstitutional taking of the landowner’s property.
       e)     Approval by a vote of the people is accomplished when a Comprehensive Plan amendment is placed on the
              ballot through any procedure provided for in the Election Code, and a majority of the voters vote in favor of
              it. Whenever the City Council adopts an amendment requiring approval by a vote of the people pursuant to
              the provisions of this subsection, the City Council’s action shall have no effect until after such a vote is held
              and a majority of the voters vote in favor of it. The City Council shall follow the provisions of the Election
              Code in all matters pertaining to such an election.
Section 3. Implementation.
       A.     Upon the effective date of this initiative, the initiative shall be deemed inserted in the City of Ventura’s
Comprehensive Plan as an amendment thereof; except, that if the four amendments of the mandatory elements of the
general plan permitted by state law for any given calendar year have already been utilized in 1995, prior to the effective
date of this initiative, this Comprehensive Plan amendment shall be deemed inserted in the City’s General Plan on
January 1, 1996. At such time as this Comprehensive Plan amendment is deemed inserted in the City’s Comprehensive
Plan (hereinafter, the “insertion date”) any provisions of the City’s Zoning Ordinance inconsistent with that amendment
shall not be enforced to the extent of the inconsistency. Within 180 days of the insertion date, the City shall complete

   as amended through February 1, 1995, or to the City of Ventura’s Land Use Plan Map as amended through February 1,
   1995 which conflict with the initiative. Except as provided in Section 4 below, upon the specific plans, tentative or final
   subdivision maps, parcel maps, conditional use permits, building permits or other ministerial or discretionary entitlements
   for use not yet approved or issued shall not be approved or issued unless consistent with the policies and provisions of

Ventura Hillside Voter Participation Measure
        The people of the City of San Buenaventura do ordain as follows:
Section 1. Title
        This measure shall be known as the Ventura Hillside Voter Participation Measure.
Section 2. Purpose
        The overall purpose of this measure is to allow City voters to participate in the review process relating to non-exempt
development projects that may be proposed in a certain portion of the “Hillside Area” of the City as defined in the City’s
Comprehensive Plan Update to the Year 2010 (hereafter the “Comprehensive Plan”). The portion of the Hillside Area under
consideration lies generally north of the City, constitutes an area approximately 9108 acres in size, and is further depicted as
the “Hillside Voter Participation Area” indicated in Exhibit “A” attached hereto and made a part hereof. The proposed Hillside
Voter Participation Area (also referred to from time to time hereafter as “HVP Area” or “HVPA”) is outside the Ventura City
limits, but it is within the “Planning Area” of the City of San Buenaventura as further indicated on Exhibit “A.” The
Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map currently designates the properties within the proposed Hillside Voter Participation Area
as “Hillside Planned Residential” or “HPR” rather than “Agricultural” and, therefore, these properties are not subject to the
Save Our Agricultural Resources (“SOAR”) Initiative adopted by the voters in 1995.
        In the recent past, some property owners within the proposed Hillside Voter Participation Area have publicly
presented initial proposals to develop those properties with a combination of residential uses and open space and
recreational areas proposed to include, among other things, hiking and equestrian trails for use by the public. In the course
of public meetings and informational workshops discussing these proposals, it has become apparent that there is a high level
of public concern over potential issues of scenic resource protection, open space and recreational opportunities,
infrastructure needs, traffic circulation, and other development-related issues arising from any proposed changes in the use
of this important part of the City’s Planning Area. This measure, in recognition of this heightened public concern, is intended
to provide the electorate of the City of San Buenaventura with an opportunity to vote on the approval of any such
development proposals or any similar proposals to extend urban services to the Hillside Voter Participation Area or develop
property in the Hillside Voter Participation Area with urbanized land uses.
August 8, 2005                                                                                          2005 Ventura General Plan
                                                                                                                              C-1

A  P P E N D I X    C
        More particularly, this measure proposes to amend the Comprehensive Plan of the City of San Buenaventura by
adding a requirement that approvals for extensions of “urban services” (defined in the City’s Hillside Management Program
as the provision of domestic water and sewers) or any proposed “urbanized uses of land” (as defined herein) in the Hillside
Voter Participation Area cannot be granted without prior approval by a majority vote of the electorate.
Section 3. Comprehensive Plan Amendment
        The following text shall be inserted into the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan at page 111-8 thereof:
Hillside Voter Participation Area
The electorate of the City of Ventura has adopted a Hillside Voter Participation Area (Ventura HVP Area). Its purpose,
principles, implementation procedures, and methodologies for amendment are set forth in this Comprehensive Plan
amendment.
A.      PURPOSE
The City of Ventura Hillside Area, with its unique topography, viewsheds, watershed lands; its unique microclimate and
hydrology, and its diversity of plant and wildlife resources, is one of the finest scenic resources in the Southern California
region. The Comprehensive Plan recognizes the unique and important qualities and potential of the Hillside Area in, among
other provisions, the declaration of specialized Objectives and Policies for the Hillside Area in the Resources Element of the
Plan and the Plan’s requirements for continuing operation of, and compliance with, the City’s Hillside Management Program.
This Comprehensive Plan amendment is intended to provide for an increased level of public awareness and participation in
the development review process applicable to that portion of the Hillside Area described and depicted in Exhibit “A” as the
“Hillside Voter Participation Area.” It is further intended to provide assurance to the public that any proposed development in
the Hillside Voter Participation Area appropriately takes into account the Area’s unique combination of viewshed, watershed,
open space, scenic area, and environmentally sensitive habitat, and that agricultural, viewshed, watershed, and open space
lands in the Hillside Voter Participation Area are not converted to urban or other non-open space uses without public
discussion and a vote of the people. Increasing citizen participation in the development review process through the
establishment of a Hillside Voter Participation Area enhances the City’s sense of community, allows for development unique
to the City of Ventura, and promotes the efficient use of the City’s infrastructure.

More specifically, this Comprehensive Plan amendment is intended to provide an opportunity for the public to be involved in
insuring that any development projects proposed in the Hillside Voter Participation Area, shall, at a minimum:
         1.      Maintain the scenic character of the hillsides in areas of future development, by preserving significant natural
landmarks and scenic ridgelines and slopes.
         2.      Provide increased recreational opportunities for existing and future hillside and other City residents, by
improving access to existing parks and establishing additional parks or open, non-developed areas in conjunction with future
hillside development.
         3.      Maximize public access to hillside open space and recreation areas, by establishing a system of linear parks
and hiking trails along scenic ridges and barrancas.
         4.      Minimize the impact of hillside development on sensitive natural habitats and historical or archaeological
resources.
B.       PRINCIPLES
Inappropriate urban encroachment into Hillside open space, viewshed, watershed, scenic areas, and biological resource
areas would have the potential to impact sensitive environmental areas, unwarrantedly intrude on open space, diminish the
quality of life and threaten the public health, safety and welfare by leading to increased traffic congestion, associated air
pollution, erosion, alteration of sensitive lands in watershed areas and causing potentially serious water problems, such as
pollution, depletion and sedimentation of available water resources not only for the City of Ventura, but for its jurisdictional
neighbors. Inappropriate urban encroachment could further result in the unwarranted extension of public services and
facilities into sensitive areas.
The unique character of the City of Ventura and quality of life of City residents depends on the appropriate protection of the
Hillside Area’s substantial amount of open space, viewshed, watershed, scenic resources, and biological resources. The
increased public awareness and involvement in the fate of such lands through the implementation of this Comprehensive
Plan amendment will provide the public a special opportunity to assure that future generations of Ventura citizens will not be
deprived of the benefits of access to a viable water supply, flood and erosion control, protection of viewsheds, wildlife,
environmentally sensitive areas, open space and recreational areas, and irreplaceable natural resources.

C. IMPLEMENTATION
        (1)    There is hereby established a Ventura Hillside Voter Participation Area (Ventura HVP Area). The Ventura HVP
Area is that portion of the Hillside Area delineated and depicted in Exhibit “A” of this Comprehensive Plan amendment
(hereafter, the “HVP Area Map”). As shown on the HVP Area Map, the southern boundary of the HVP Area generally follows
the northern segment of the City’s incorporated limit as established by the Local Agency Formation Commission for the City
of Ventura, except as the HVP boundary line runs northerly of some small residential lots on or near Foothill Road west of
Arroyo Verde Park as further depicted on Exhibit “A.” East of Harmon Barranca, the HVP Area boundary generally follows
the alignment of Foothill Road eastward to the boundary of the City’s Planning Area. The northerly boundary of the HVP
Area continues, generally, as the northern boundary of the City’s Planning Area. The westerly boundary of the HVP Area
alternately follows the City limit boundary or Sphere of Influence boundary easterly of the North Avenue area. The foregoing
narrative description is intended to be general in nature and all of the foregoing is more particularly depicted and described
in Exhibit “A’
Insofar as the HVP Area boundary described and depicted in this Comprehensive Plan amendment, including Exhibit “A”
hereto, is said or shown to be coterminous with either the City’s incorporated limit or the City’s Sphere of Influence boundary,
or with the boundary of the City’s Planning Area, such references are intended to be, and shall be construed to be, the
location of the City limit boundary or Sphere of Influence boundary or boundary of the City’s Planning Area. as applicable, as
each of those boundaries are established for the City of Ventura as of January 1, 2001. Although the HVP Area boundary is
established, in part, in generally the same location as the City limit boundary, or in some instances, the Sphere of Influence
boundary, the establishment of the HVP Area boundary is not intended to and shall in no way inhibit the Local Agency
Formation Commission from changing or altering the City limit boundary or Sphere of Influence boundary in accordance with
State law. The boundary of the HVP Area, although incidentally coterminous as of one point in time with the City limit
boundary or Sphere of Influence boundary or boundary of the City’s Planning Area, is independent from these boundaries in
legal significance and purpose. While the City limit boundary or Sphere of Influence boundary may be, from time to time,
altered by the Local Agency Formation Commission, or the boundary of the City’s Planning Area may be changed, the HVP
Area boundary shall not be changed except as provided herein.
        (2) Until December 31, 2030, the City of Ventura shall not extend urban services into, and shall not authorize
urbanized uses of land within, the Ventura Hillside Voter Participation Area unless otherwise authorized by a vote of the
people, except for the purpose of construction of public potable water facilities, public parks or other city government facilities
or as otherwise provided or excepted herein. Upon the effective date of this Hillside Voter Participation Area Comprehensive

Plan amendment, the City and its departments, boards, commissions, officers and employees shall not grant, or by inaction
allow to be approved by operation of law, any Comprehensive Plan amendment, rezoning, specific plan, subdivision map,
conditional use permit, building permit or any other ministerial or discretionary entitlement, which is inconsistent with the
purposes of this Comprehensive Plan amendment, unless in accordance with the amendment procedures of Section 4 of this
Comprehensive Plan amendment.
        (3) “Urbanized uses of land” shall mean any development that would require the establishment of new community
sewer systems or the significant expansion of existing community sewer systems; or, would result in the creation of
residential densities greater than one primary residential unit per 40 acres in area; or, would result in the establishment of
commercial or industrial uses that are neither agriculturally-related nor related to the production of mineral resources.
        (4)    The Land Use Map is amended to reflect the existence of the Ventura Hillside Voter Participation Area as
generally described in paragraph (1) above and as depicted in Exhibit “A,” attached hereto.
        (5) The Hillside Voter Participation Area, as defined herein, may not be amended, altered, revoked or otherwise
changed prior to December 31, 2030, except by vote of the people or by the City Council pursuant to the procedures set
forth in Section 4 of this Comprehensive Plan amendment. For purposes of this Ordinance, approval by a vote of the people
is accomplished when a Comprehensive Plan amendment is placed on the ballot through any procedure provided for in the
Election Code, and a majority of the voters vote in favor of it. Whenever the City Council adopts an amendment requiring
approval by a vote of the people pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the City Council’s action shall have no effect
until after such a vote is held and a majority of the voters vote in favor of it. The City Council shall follow the provisions of the
Election Code in all matters pertaining to such an election.
Section 4. Changes to Area: Procedures.
        Until December 31, 2030, the foregoing Purposes, Principles and Implementation provisions of this Comprehensive
Plan amendment, and the Hillside Voter Participation Area may be amended only by a vote of the people commenced
pursuant to the initiative process by the public, or pursuant to the procedures set forth below:
        A. The City Council may amend the boundary of the Hillside Voter Participation Area depicted on Exhibit “A” if it finds
such amendment to be in the public interest, provided that the amended boundary enlarges said Hillside Voter Participation
Area established by this Comprehensive Plan amendment.

       B.     The City Council, following at least one public hearing for presentation by an applicant and the public, and after
compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, may amend the Hillside Voter Participation Area described herein,
based on substantial evidence in the record, if the City Council makes each of the following findings:
              (1)     Application of the provisions of subsections (A) or (B) of the amendment procedures set forth in this
              Section 4 are unworkable and failure to amend the Hillside Voter Participation Area would constitute an
              unconstitutional taking of a landowner’s property for which compensation would be required or would deprive
              the landowner of a vested right; and
              (2)     The amendment and associated land use designations will allow additional land uses only to the
              minimum extent necessary to avoid said
               unconstitutional taking of the landowner’s property or to give effect to the vested right.
       C.     The City Council, following at least one public hearing for presentations by an applicant and the public, and
after compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, may place any amendment to the Hillside Voter Participation
Area or the provisions of this Comprehensive Plan amendment on the ballot pursuant to the mechanisms provided by state
law.
       D.     The Comprehensive Plan may be reorganized and individual provisions, including the provisions of this
ordinance, maybe renumbered or reordered in the course of ongoing updates of the Comprehensive Plan in accordance with
the requirements of state law.
Section 5. No Changes to Save Our Agricultural Resources Initiative
       Any restrictions imposed upon the City of San Buenaventura limiting the City’s ability to redesignate, or allow

       The people of the City of San Buenaventura do ordain as follows:
Section 1. Title
       This measure shall be known as the Ventura Community Park SOAR Amendment.
Section 2. Purpose
       The purpose of this measure is to allow the City to develop a Community Park on a parcel of property located at
       the northwest corner of the intersection of Kimball Road and Telephone Road. The subject property, which is
       approximately 100 acres in size, is further described in Exhibit “A,” attached hereto and made a part hereof, and is
       hereafter referred to as the “Property.” Most of the Property is outside the Ventura City limits but within the
       “Planning Area” of the City of San Buenaventura and therefore covered by the City’s Comprehensive Plan Update
       to the Year 2010 (hereafter the “Comprehensive Plan”). The Property is currently designated “Agricultural” under
       the Comprehensive Plan and, therefore, also subject to the 1995 Save Our Agricultural Resources (“SOAR”)
       Initiative.
       The City is proposing to develop the Property with community-oriented public park facilities that may include,
       among other things, athletic fields, an aquatic facility, a community center and other related buildings and
       structures for use by the public. If this measure is approved, the City may also construct and operate a fire station
       on a portion of the Property.
       This initiative proposes to amend the Comprehensive Plan of the City of San Buenaventura, by changing the
       designation of the Property in the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Plan Map from “Agricultural” (or “A”) to “Parks”
       (or “P”). This will allow the City of San Buenaventura to potentially develop the Property with a Community Park
       without being restricted by the SOAR Initiative.

Section 3. Comprehensive Plan Amendment
       Part A.
       The following paragraph titled “Parks Uses” is hereby added to the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan,
       more particularly, to the provisions of the Serra Community Intent and Rationale Statement on page III-96, to read
       as follows:
       “Parks Uses: The Parks Land Use Plan designation is applied to an approximately 100-acre site at the northwest
       corner of Kimball Road and Telephone Road for the purpose of developing a multi-purpose community-oriented
       public park on this site. It is further intended that this site should be zoned to the “P” (Parks) zone if and when it is
       annexed to the City. Design Review should be carried out by the City's Planning Commission prior to the
       development of any Recreation Services use types on the site to assure that the range of community park uses
       potentially permitted on the site by the "P" zone are well integrated on the site and compatible with adjacent land
       uses.”
       Part B.
       The Property is deleted from the discussion of “Agricultural Uses” in the Serra Community provisions of the Land
       Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan. To that end, the final paragraph with the heading “Agricultural Use”
       beginning at the bottom of page III-95 and ending at the top of page III-96 is hereby revised to read as follows:
       “Agricultural Use: A 297-acre area between Telephone Road and the Southern Pacific Railroad and a 172-acre
       area between Bristol Road and the Santa Clara River are designated Agricultural Use, not to be reconsidered until
       after the Year 2010, to preserve their existing agricultural character.”
       Part C.
       The Land Use Plan Map incorporated in the Comprehensive Plan is hereby amended, and official copies thereof
       shall be revised by City staff, to reflect the foregoing amendments to the text of the Land Use Element.

Section 4. Zoning
       Upon annexation to the City of San Buenaventura, the zoning classification for the Property shall be “P” (Parks)
       and the Official Zoning District Map incorporated in the Zoning Ordinance shall, by this Measure, be amended, and
       official copies thereof shall be revised by City staff, to reflect the foregoing zone change to the Property.
Section 5. Save Open-Space and Agricultural Resources
       Any restrictions imposed upon the City of San Buenaventura limiting the City’s ability to redesignate, or allow
       development of, property designated “Agricultural” that are in effect on the day that this Initiative is approved by the
       voters shall remain in full force and effect except as to the Property. The City of San Buenaventura may allow
       development of a community park on the Property in accordance with this ordinance.
Section 6. Interpretation
       This ordinance shall be broadly construed in order to achieve the purposes stated in this ordinance. It is the intent
       of the voters that the provisions of this ordinance shall be interpreted by the City of San Buenaventura and others
       in a manner that facilitates the development of a community park on the Property in accordance with the purposes
       of this ordinance.
Section 7. Insertion Date
       Part A. Upon the effective date of this ordinance, Part A and Part B of Section 3 of this ordinance shall be deemed
       inserted in the Comprehensive Plan and the Land Use Map referred to in Part C of Section 3 shall be deemed
       amended even though the reprinting may not occur until it can be carried out by the staff of the City of San
       Buenaventura.
       Part B. The Comprehensive Plan in effect at the time the City Council decided to place this measure on the ballot,
       and the Comprehensive Plan as amended by this ordinance, comprise an integrated, internally consistent and
       compatible statement of policies for the City of San Buenaventura.

        The people of the City of San Buenaventura do ordain as follows:
Section 1. Title
        This ordinance shall be known as the First Assembly of God Land Initiative.
Section 2. Purpose
        The purpose of this ordinance is to allow the First Assembly of God (hereafter “Church”) to develop a property
located at the northwest corner of the intersection of Montgomery Avenue and Northbank Drive. Such property is 25.59
acres and is further described in Exhibit A, attached hereto and made a part hereof, and is hereafter referred to as
“Property”. The Church wishes to develop the Property in accordance with City of San Buenaventura Ordinance No 95-33
(commonly known as “SOAR”) guidelines for a sanctuary, related Church buildings, and athletic fields for use by the
community of San Buenaventura.
        Since the Property is within the sphere of influence of the City of San Buenaventura, this ordinance (1) amends the
Comprehensive Plan Update to the Year 2010 (hereafter the “General Plan”) of the City of San Buenaventura, and (2)
prezones the Property to the R-1 Single Family zone with a subzone of R-1-1AC. This will allow the City of San
Buenaventura to annex the Property with a restricted land use that is compatible with the Church’s development of the
Property.
Section 3. General Plan Amendment
        Part A.
        The second paragraph under the heading “Residential Uses” appearing on page III-94 of the General Plan
describes the areas that may be used for low-density, single family homes in the Serra Community area of the City of San
Buenaventura. The single family use (designated as SF in the General Plan) is the most restrictive land use that will allow
the Church to build a sanctuary, related church buildings, and athletic fields. Section 4 of this initiative will further restrict
the Property by pre-zoning the Property and requiring a minimum of one acre for each parcel. This will make the Property
unattractive for single family development but still acceptable for the Church sanctuary, related Church buildings, and
athletic fields.       This ordinance adds the Church’s 25.59 acre parcel to the SF land use.

       The second paragraph under the heading “Residential Uses” appearing on page III-94 of the General Plan is
hereby amended to read as follows:
“The SF category is applied to an approximately 3-acre site at the southeast corner of Henderson and Petit Avenue, a 1.7-
acre site southerly of Darling Road extended, and a 25.59-acre site located at the northwest corner of Montgomery
Avenue and Northbank Drive.”
       Part B.
       The final paragraph with the heading “Agricultural Use” beginning at the bottom of page III-95 and ending at the top
of page III-96 of the General Plan describes that portion of the Serra Community area of the City of San Buenaventura
which may only be used for agricultural uses. This ordinance deletes the Church’s 25.59 acre parcel from the agricultural
use category.
       The final paragraph with the heading “Agricultural Use” beginning at the bottom of page III-95 and ending at the top
of page III-96 of the General Plan is hereby amended to read as follows:
“Agricultural Use: A 100-acre site at the northwest corner of Kimball Road and Telephone, a 297-acre area between
Telephone Road and the Southern Pacific Railroad except for the 25.59-acre site located at the northwest corner of
Montgomery Avenue and Northbank Drive, and a 172-acre area between Bristol Road and the Santa Clara River are
designated Agricultural Use, not to be reconsidered until after the Year 2010, to preserve their existing agricultural
character.”
       Part C.
       The map of the Land Use Plan contained in the General Plan shall be redrafted to reflect the foregoing
amendments.

Section 4. Zoning
        The most restrictive zoning in the City of San Buenaventura which will allow the Church to build a sanctuary,
related Church buildings, and athletic fields on the Property is an R-1 Single Family zone with a subzone of R-1-1AC. The
R-1-1AC subzone restricts the Property by requiring a minimum of one acre for each parcel. This will make the Property
unattractive for single family development but still acceptable for the Church’s sanctuary, related Church buildings, and
athletic fields.
        Therefore, upon annexation of the Property to the City of San Buenaventura the zoning designation for the
Property shall be the R-1 Single Family zone with a subzone of R-1-1AC.
Section 5. Save Open-Space and Agricultural Resources
        Any restrictions imposed upon he City of San Buenaventura limiting the City’s ability to annex property and allow
development of such property shall remain in full force and effect except as to the 25.59-acres of the Property.
Section 6. Construction
        This ordinance shall be broadly construed in order to achieve the purposes stated in this ordinance. It is the intent
of the voters that the provisions of this ordinance shall be interpreted by the City of San Buenaventura and others in a
manner that facilitates the development of the Property in accordance with the purposes of this ordinance.
Section 7. Insertion Date
        Part A. Upon the effective date of this ordinance, Part A and Part B of Section 3 of this ordinance shall be deemed
inserted in the General Plan and the Land Use Map referred to in Part C of Section 3 shall be deemed amended even
though the reprinting may not occur until deemed convenient by the City of San Buenaventura.

       Part B. The General Plan in effect at the time the Notice of Intention to circulate this initiative was submitted to the
City Clerk of the City of San Buenaventura, and the General Plan as amended by this ordinance, comprise an integrated,
internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the City of San Buenaventura. In order to ensure that the
General Plan remains an integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies and to ensure that the
actions of the voters in enacting this ordinance are given effect, any provision of the General Plan that is adopted between
the Notice of Intention and the effective date of this ordinance, to the extent that such provision is inconsistent with this
ordinance, shall be amended as soon as possible and in the manner and time required by state law to ensure consistency
between such provision and Section 3 of this ordinance. In the alternative, such interim-enacted inconsistent provisions
shall be repealed.
Section 8. Amendment or Repeal
       Section 3 and Section 4 of this ordinance may be amended or repealed only by the voters of the City of San
Buenaventura at an election held in accordance with state law.

The 2005 Ventura General Plan envisions a new direction to protect and preserve its citizens' quality of life. This direction is based on the recognition
that zoning and land development, as practiced for the past several decades, has not served our citizens, our city, or our environment as well as it
should.
Currently, the two most successful movements created to alleviate this situation are "Smart Growth" and "New Urbanism." Smart Growth is a
government initiated approach against sprawl that addresses underlying policy from the top-down, and is primarily marketed by government and
similar agencies. New Urbanism is a grass roots, market response to outdated zoning and land use policy as it impacts development and the physical
properties of the public realm. Its chief advocates are architects and town designers.
Smart Growth grew out of early New Urbanist work, and both are concerned with the real outcomes of the built environment and how it affects
communities environmentally, economically, culturally, and socially.
The Ahwahnee Principles and the Charter for the New Urbanism, listed below, were created early on as "constitutions" that governed these
movements. Both are valuable tools that Ventura would be wise to include in it's 21st Century Tool Kit to understand and solve long-standing
problems associated with growth and change.
AHWAHNEE PRINCIPLES
 Preamble:
  Existing patterns of urban and suburban development seriously impair our quality of life. The symptoms are: more congestion and air
  pollution resulting from our increased dependence on automobiles, the loss of precious open space, the need for costly improvements
  to roads and public services, the inequitable distribution of economic resources, and the loss of a sense of community. By drawing
  upon the best from the past and the present, we can plan communities that will more successfully serve the needs of those who live
  and work within them. Such planning should adhere to certain fundamental principles.
Community Principles
     1. All planning should be in the form of complete and integrated communities containing housing, shops, work places, schools, parks and civic
         facilities essential to the daily life of the residents.
August 8, 2005                                                                                                                   2005 Ventura General Plan
                                                                                                                                                        G-1
     S T
2 1        C   E N T U R Y       T  O O L    K  I T
    2. Community size should be designed so that housing, jobs, daily needs and other activities are within easy walking distance of each other.
    3. As many activities as possible should be located within easy walking distance of transit stops.
    4. A community should contain a diversity of housing types to enable citizens from a wide range of economic levels and age groups to live
        within its boundaries.
    5. Businesses within the community should provide a range of job types for the community's residents.
    6. The location and character of the community should be consistent with a larger transit network.
    7. The community should have a center focus that combines commercial, civic, cultural and recreational uses.
    8. The community should contain an ample supply of specialized open space in the form of squares, greens and parks whose frequent use is
        encouraged through placement and design.
    9. Public spaces should be designed to encourage the attention and presence of people at all hours of the day and night.
    10. Each community or cluster of communities should have a well-defined edge, such as agricultural greenbelts or wildlife corridors, permanently
        protected from development.
    11. Streets, pedestrian paths and bike paths should contribute to a system of fully-connected and interesting routes to all destinations. Their design
        should encourage pedestrian and bicycle use by being small and spatially defined by buildings, trees and lighting; and by discouraging high
        speed traffic.
    12. Wherever possible, the natural terrain, drainage and vegetation of the community should be preserved with superior examples contained within
        parks or greenbelts.
    13. The community design should help conserve resources and minimize waste.
    14. Communities should provide for the efficient use of water through the use of natural drainage, drought tolerant landscaping and recycling.
    15. The street orientation, the placement of buildings and the use of shading should contribute to the energy efficiency of the community.
Regional Principles
    1.  The regional land-use planning structure should be integrated within a larger transportation network built around transit rather than freeways.
    2.  Regions should be bounded by and provide a continuous system of greenbelt/wildlife corridors to be determined by natural conditions.
    3.  Regional institutions and services (government, stadiums, museums, etc.) should be located in the urban core.
    4.  Materials and methods of construction should be specific to the region, exhibiting a continuity of history and culture and compatibility with
        the climate to encourage the development of local character and community identity.
Implementation Principles
    1. The general plan should be updated to incorporate the above principles.
    2. Rather than allowing developer-initiated, piecemeal development, local governments should take charge of the planning process. General
        plans should designate where new growth, infill or redevelopment will be allowed to occur.

     3. Prior to any development, a specific plan should be prepared based on these planning principles.
     4. Plans should be developed through an open process and participants in the process should be provided visual models of all planning proposals.
CONGRESS FOR THE NEW URBANISM
THE CONGRESS FOR THE NEW URBANISM views disinvestment in central cities, the spread of placeless sprawl, increasing separation by
race and income, environmental deterioration, loss of agricultural lands and wilderness, and the erosion of society’s built heritage as one
interrelated community building challenge.
WE STAND for the restoration of existing urban centers and towns within coherent metropolitan regions, the reconfiguration of sprawling
suburbs into communities of real neighborhoods and diverse districts, the conservation of natural environments, and the preservation of
our built legacy.
WE RECOGNIZE that physical solutions by themselves will not solve social and economic problems, but neither can economic vitality,
community stability, and environmental health be sustained without a coherent supportive physical framework.
WE ADVOCATE the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles: neighborhoods should be
diverse in use and population; communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car; cities and towns should
be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions; urban places should be framed by
architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history, climate, ecology, and building practice.
WE REPRESENT a broad-based citizenry, composed of public and private sector leaders, community activists, and multidisciplinary
professionals. We are committed to reestablishing the relationship between the art of building and the making of community, through
citizen-based participatory planning and design.
WE DEDICATE ourselves to reclaiming our homes, blocks, streets, parks, neighborhoods, districts, towns, cities, regions, and
environment.
We assert the following principles to guide public policy, development practice, urban planning, and design:

The region: Metropolis, city, and town
1.   Metropolitan regions are finite places with geographic boundaries derived from topography, watersheds, coastlines, farmlands,
     regional parks, and river basins. The metropolis is made of multiple centers that are cities, towns, and villages, each with its own
     identifiable center and edges.
2.   The metropolitan region is a fundamental economic unit of the contemporary world. Governmental cooperation, public policy,
     physical planning, and economic strategies must reflect this new reality.
3.   The metropolis has a necessary and fragile relationship to its agrarian hinterland and natural landscapes. The relationship is
     environmental, economic, and cultural. Farmland and nature are as important to the metropolis as the garden is to the house.
4.   Development patterns should not blur or eradicate the edges of the metropolis. Infill development within existing urban areas
     conserves environmental resources, economic investment, and social fabric, while reclaiming marginal and abandoned areas.
     Metropolitan regions should develop strategies to encourage such infill development over peripheral expansion.
5.   Where appropriate, new development contiguous to urban boundaries should be organized as neighborhoods and districts, and be
     integrated with the existing urban pattern. Noncontiguous development should be organized as towns and villages with their own
     urban edges, and planned for a jobs/housing balance, not as bedroom suburbs.
6.   The development and redevelopment of towns and cities should respect historical patterns, precedents, and boundaries.
7.   Cities and towns should bring into proximity a broad spectrum of public and private uses to support a regional economy that
     benefits people of all incomes. Affordable housing should be distributed throughout the region to match job opportunities and to
     avoid concentrations of poverty.
8.   The physical organization of the region should be supported by a framework of transportation alternatives. Transit, pedestrian, and
     bicycle systems should maximize access and mobility throughout the region while reducing dependence upon the automobile.
9.   Revenues and resources can be shared more cooperatively among the municipalities and centers within regions to avoid
     destructive competition for tax base and to promote rational coordination of transportation, recreation, public services, housing, and
     community institutions.

The neighborhood, the district, and the corridor
1.  The neighborhood, the district, and the corridor are the essential elements of development and redevelopment in the metropolis.
    They form identifiable areas that encourage citizens to take responsibility for their maintenance and evolution.
2.  Neighborhoods should be compact, pedestrian-friendly, and mixed-use. Districts generally emphasize a special single use, and
    should follow the principles of neighborhood design when possible. Corridors are regional connectors of neighborhoods and
    districts; they range from boulevards and rail lines to rivers and parkways.
3.  Many activities of daily living should occur within walking distance, allowing independence to those who do not drive, especially the
    elderly and the young. Interconnected networks of streets should be designed to encourage walking, reduce the number and
    length of automobile trips, and conserve energy.
4.  Within neighborhoods, a broad range of housing types and price levels can bring people of diverse ages, races, and incomes into
    daily interaction, strengthening the personal and civic bonds essential to an authentic community.
5.  Transit corridors, when properly planned and coordinated, can help organize metropolitan structure and revitalize urban centers. In
    contrast, highway corridors should not displace investment from existing centers.
6.  Appropriate building densities and land uses should be within walking distance of transit stops, permitting public transit to become a
    viable alternative to the automobile.
7.  Concentrations of civic, institutional, and commercial activity should be embedded in neighborhoods, and districts, not isolated in
    remote, single-use complexes. Schools should be sized and located to enable children to walk or bicycle to them.
8.  The economic health and harmonious evolution of neighborhoods, districts, and corridors can be improved through graphic urban
    design codes that serve as predictable guides for change.
9.  A range of parks, from tot-lots and village greens to ball fields and community gardens, should be distributed within neighborhoods.

The block, the street, and the building
1.   A primary task of all urban architecture and landscape design is the physical definition of streets and public spaces as places of
     shared use.
2.   Individual architectural projects should be seamlessly linked to their surroundings. This issue transcends style.
3.   The revitalization of urban places depends on safety and security. The design of streets and buildings should reinforce safe
     environments, but not at the expense of accessibility and openness.
4.   In the contemporary metropolis, development must adequately accommodate automobiles. It should do so in ways that respect the
     pedestrian and the form of public space.
5.   Streets and squares should be safe, comfortable, and interesting to the pedestrian. Properly configured, they encourage walking
     and enable neighbors to know each other and protect their communities.
6.   Architecture and landscape design should grow from local climate, topography, history, and building practice.
7.   Civic buildings and public gathering places require important sites to reinforce community identity and the culture of democracy.
     They deserve distinctive form, because their role is different from that of other buildings and places that constitute the fabric of the
     city.
8.   All buildings should provide their inhabitants with a clear sense of location, weather and time. Natural methods of heating and
     cooling can be more resource-efficient than mechanical systems.
9.   Preservation and renewal of historic buildings, districts, and landscapes affirm the continuity and evolution of urban society.
