Introduction
INTRODUCTION
Need for a General Plan
With a rich history, Holtville is a growing community with a bright future. Located in eastern Imperial County
and incorporated in 1908, the City of Holtville encompasses approximately 1 square mile. In 2015, the City of
Holtville had an estimated population of 6,246 (California Department of Finance (DOF)). The Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG) projects that the city’s population will grow modestly, to 6,600
by 2020 and 7,300 by 2035. State Route 115, which serves eastern Imperial County, runs through the City of
Holtville at an east/west orientation and functions as the town’s main arterial. The city is situated approximately
12 miles east of the City of El Centro and 15 miles north of the US/Mexico border. Holtville is one of the least
populated cities in Imperial County and, according to the California Department of Finance, between 2000 and
2015, experienced the second slowest growth rate among jurisdictions in the county with an average annual
growth rate of 0.8 percent. This Plan will ensure that new development is consistent with the community’s
vision for the future and that adequate urban services are available and built utilizing current sustainability
techniques. This General Plan establishes a blueprint for stimulating new economic growth, revitalizing older
areas, assuring public safety, finding new uses for underutilized land, and enhancing the amenities and cultural
resources that ensure Holtville remains resilient over time. By implementing the programs identified in this
General Plan, Holtville can achieve its vision for its future.
Holtville Planning Area
The Holtville planning area is located in the Imperial Valley near tourist, trade, and travel center of the
southwestern United States. Minutes north of Mexico’s border, the City is 120 miles east of San Diego, 225
southeast of Los Angeles, and 10 miles northeast of Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. Figure I-1 shows
Holtville’s regional location.
History of the Community
The introduction of a reliable water source to the Imperial Valley in the late 1800s is critical to understanding
Holtville today. Decades of speculation regarding the Colorado Desert Valley’s agricultural potential eventually
lead to approval of the region’s first irrigation project in 1900. On May 14, 1901, water was diverted from the
Colorado River into the Salton Basin, establishing the agricultural industry in Imperial Valley that resulted in a
population boom for the region. By 1904, the need to transport goods and persons into the region lead to
construction of a Southern Pacific railway branch line extending from present day Niland to Calexico. Fifteen
years later, the San Diego and Arizona railway connected the Imperial Valley to the Pacific Coast. In order to
facilitate economic development and foster growth, lands associated with the Imperial Valley were separated
from San Diego County and organized into present day Imperial County in 1907.
The City of Holtville, or Holton as it was first called, was founded by W.F. Holt, a banker from Missouri who
moved to the west for health reasons. Holt had a vision of what the Imperial Valley would become, and in the
process he was the first to envision a town east of the Alamo River. On June 20, 1908 the city of Holtville was
incorporated.
Today the developed portions of Holtville remain on the east side of the Alamo River, which serves as a natural
border on the south and west portions of the City. Holtville is a multi-cultural community with a rich agricultural
history as land within the City limits is surrounded by thousands of acres of agricultural land. Holtville is known
as the “Carrot Capital of the World” and to celebrate this status the City hosts an annual Carrot Festival. The
City’s agricultural roots are largely responsible for the character of development within Holtville today as its
economic base, housing needs, and population are derived from this industry.

Vision for the Future of Holtville
Holtville’s Vision of the Future is to build upon the foundation of its resilient past. The General Plan is an
expression of what the community wants to maintain and become over the next 20 years.
    Holtville is a well-defined community intending to build upon its traditional neighborhood patterns and assets. It is a
    community with a high-quality of life in which residents feel safe living and working. The safe atmosphere is maintained
    through an environment where community members know and regularly interact with their neighbors. Personal interaction
    and neighborly engagement is the fabric that holds the City of Holtville together. As a result, residents are well-informed,
    civic minded, and active in the decision making process; equipped to meet the challenges of the day; and eager to plan for
    Holtville’s bright future.
    Holtville strives to provide and maintain residential opportunities that meet the needs of all residents. Affordable
    ownership and rental opportunities are sufficient as the City’s policies and goals to encourage and promote a variety of
    housing types, including new and innovative designs while maintaining standards, safety, and quality environments. The
    City actively works with residents to maintain their properties in order to beautify and promote Holtville as a great place
    to work and live.
    With a rich agricultural history, the City works to protect surrounding agricultural land for its economic and aesthetic
    value. In addition, Holtville takes pride in its natural resources, such as the Alamo River Corridor, and preserves and
    enhances these areas for the enjoyment of residents and visitors.

     The City’s circulation network, which includes roadways, alleyways, bikeways, and pedestrian walkways, are well
     maintained and provide efficient and safe movement of people within Holtville. The pedestrian and bicycle network is
     frequently used by residents and links the community’s public and recreational area, including schools and parks, with
     residential and business areas.
Together, these statements form the community’s vision for the future of Holtville and are the basis for the
goals and policies contained in this General Plan.
Purpose of the General Plan
California law requires each city to adopt a comprehensive, long-term General Plan to guide the physical
development of the incorporated area and land outside municipal boundaries the bears a relationship to its
planning activities. In essence, a city’s General Plan serves as the blueprint for future growth and development.
As a blueprint for the future, the plan must contain policies and programs designed to provide decision makers
with a solid basis for decisions related to land use and development. The City of Holtville intends for these
policies to facilitate better, faster, and cost effective implementation tools to build a healthier, equitable,
resilient, and economically vibrant future for its citizens.
In accordance to State law, the General Plan is the City’s primary document to regulate land use. Consequently,
the Zoning Code, Specific Plans, and the individual public and private development proposal that implement
the General Plan must be consistent with the Plan goals, policies, and standards. The Holtville General Plan
addresses many issues that are directly related to and influence land use decisions. In addition to land use, State
law requires the Plan to address circulation, housing, conservation of natural resources, preservation of open
space, noise environment, and protection of public safety (Section 65302 of the California Government Code).
In addition to these required ‘elements,’ or topics, this Plan incorporates an integrated approach to enabling
healthier and more resilient communities by weaving active transportation and accessibility topics throughout
each element to the extent that they apply to Holtville.
Organization and Use of the Plan
The General Plan consists of a Land Use Policy Map, an Introduction, and the following six elements, or
chapters, which together fulfill the State requirement for a General Plan:
         Land Use
         Housing
         Circulation
         Conservation/Open Space
         Safety
         Noise
State mandated Conservation and Open Space Elements have been combined in the Holtville General Plan.
Additionally, in accordance with State Law, the Housing Element was updated in 2016 for the planning period
of 2017-2022, and was approved by the California Department of Housing and Community Development. For
this reason, the Housing Element is in a slightly different format for the rest of the elements. The Housing
Element will be updated again in 2021, or as required by law.

Introduction
While each General Plan element is independent, all the elements inform each other to comprise the General
Plan. All elements of the General Plan are interrelated by context or place, and certain goals and policies of one
element may also address issues that are primary subject of the other elements. This integration of overlapping
issues and policies provides a strong basis for implementation of plans and programs and achievement of
community goals. Organizing issues within the elements by context or place, from Holtville’s agricultural edge
to its downtown center, provides a collaborative and interrelated basis to achieve sustainable development
goals. As the basic building block of Holtville is its inherently sustainable neighborhood patterns, characterized
by walkability, mixed-use development, and mixed-income housing. Walkability is a function of compactness
and density. This plan is focused on promoting infill development, streetscapes, and public spaces in order to
build Holtville into a more desirable place to live.
Table I-1 illustrates the relationship between the six elements of the Holtville General Plan and the seven State-
mandated general plan elements.

The elements, with associated Implementation Programs, will help the City achieve its vision for the future.
The elements are organized according to the following format: 1) Introduction; 2) Issues, Goals and Policies;
3) Land Use Plan, and 4) Implementation Program.
The Introduction of each element describes the focus and the purpose of the element. The Introduction also
identifies other plans and programs outside of the General Plan that may be used to achieve specific General
Plan goals. The relationship of the element to other General Plan elements is also specified in the Introduction.
The Issues, Goals and Policies section of each element contains a description of identified planning issues,
goals, and policies related to the element topic. The issues, goals, and policies are based on input received from
the community, members of the Planning Commission and City Council and City staff.
The issues represent the needs, concerns or desire addressed by the General Plan. The goals are overall
statements of community desires and consist of broad statements of purpose or direction. The policies serve
as guides to the City Council, Planning Commission, other City commissions and boards, and City staff in
reviewing development proposals and making other decisions that affect the future growth and development
of Holtville.
Each element also contains a Plan section. The Plan section offers an overview of the City’s course of action
to implement the identified goals and policies. For example, the Land Use Element contains a “Land Use Plan”

indicating the types and intensities of land use permitted in the City. The Circulation Element contains a
“Circulation Plan” describing the overall circulation system required to meet the future needs of Holtville.
Wherever possible, the Plan contains illustrative maps, diagrams, and tables.
Each element also contains an Implementation Program that identifies specific actions to achieve the goals,
policies, and plan identified in each General Plan element. The Implementation Programs are reviewed and
revised periodically to update specific actions, schedules, responsible parties, and measures to ensure that
General Plan goals, policies, and plans are implemented.
The Glossary is an appendix of the General Plan (Appendix A) and provides a set of definitions for technical
terms used in the Plan.
The organization of the General Plan allows user to turn to the section that interests them and quickly obtain
a perspective of City policies on the subject. However, General Plan users should realize that the policies in the
various elements are interrelated and should be examined comprehensively. Policies are presented as written
statements, tables, diagrams, and maps. All of these policy components must be considered together when
making planning decisions.
Community Participation in t he General Plan Program
Public participation played an important role in the Holtville General Plan update. Because the General Plan
reflects community goals, citizen input was essential in identifying issues and formulating goals. The City of
Holtville held two Planning Commission/City Council joint study sessions and two public hearings to ensure
public participation in the General Plan preparation process.
Since public participation has been identified as an important feature of the community’s vision for the future,
the City will continue to encourage members of the public to participate in governmental activities.
Direction to the Future
The direction established by the General Plan represents a combination of community values and actions
designed to achieve the vision for the future allowing the City to take advantage of opportunities to achieve its
goals. The policies and plans in the Elements and the Implementation Program provide guidance for addressing
changing conditions and specific actions to optimize community potential.

Land Use Element
LAND USE ELEMENT
Introduction
The Land Use Element is a guide to how land will be used within the City of Holtville and affects many of the
issues addressed in the other General Plan elements. The Land Use Element identifies the type and location of
future land uses within the City. The specific land uses and their location within the community in turn affect
the remaining General Plan elements. For example, the location and type of land uses outlined in the Land Use
Element affect the circulation system described in the Circulation Element, and the open space facilities
identified in the Land Use Element are directly related to the Conservation Element and Open Space Element
policies. The land uses identified in the Land Use Element also reflect the community’s goals for its future form
and character.
Purpose of the Land Use Element
As a city, state law requires that Holtville prepare and adopt a General Plan as a tool to manage growth and
development. The Land Use Element is a mandatory element or chapter of the General Plan.
The purpose of the Land Use Element is to describe present and planned land use activity which has been
designed to achieve the community’s long-range goals for the future. The Land Use Element identifies the
proposed general distribution, location, and extent of land uses such as residential, commercial, industrial,
community facility, agriculture, and open space and recreation. The element consists of text, maps, and
diagrams which outline the future lands uses within the City and how these uses are integrated with the other
General Plan elements and policies. The Land Use Policy Map is a particularly important feature of the element,
since it shows the location and type of development within the City. The Element also describes the intensity
or density of development planned for the community. The Land Use Element also addresses the relationship
between development and environmental quality, potential hazards, and social and economic objectives.
The Land Use Element of the Holtville General Plan represents the City’s desire for long-range changes and
enhancements of land uses. The Element organizes land uses to create a future in which the traditional character
of the City is preserved and enhanced by new development. Finally, the goals and policies contained in this
Element establish the constitutional framework for future land use planning and decision making in Holtville.
Scope and Content of the Land Use Element
This Element present the City’s goals and policies regarding land use for the long-term growth development
and revitalization of the City. The Land Use Element contains text describing land use growth and policies,
land use descriptions, a Land Use Policy Map, and a summary of the land use distribution identified on the
policy map. In addition, the issues of development along the Alamo River, provision of public facilities, and
education are also discussed.
Related Plans and Programs
There are a number of related plans and programs that are considered in the formulation, adoption, and
implementation of local land us policy. Related plans and programs are both local and regional in nature.
Regional planning agencies, such as the South California Association of Governments (SCAG), recognize that
planning issues extend beyond the boundaries of individual cities. Efforts to address regional planning issues
such as air quality, transportation, affordable housing, habitat conservation, and sustainability have informed
the related sections in this plan. The form and distribution of development in Holtville are affected by regional
plans. Relevant local and regional plans related to the Land Use Element are discussed briefly in the following
sections.

California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Guidelines
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by the state legislature in response to a public
mandate for thorough environmental analysis of projects that might affect the environment. The provisions of
the law and environmental review procedure are described in the CEQA Statutes and the CEQA Guidelines
which were amended in 2016. Implementation of CEQA ensures that during the decision making stage of
development, City officials and the general public will be able to assess the environmental impacts associated
with private and public development projects.
SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is the regional association of governments for
a seven county area, including Imperial County. As a regional government, SCAG has prepared a Regional
Comprehensive Plan and Guide that responds directly to federal and state planning requirements. The Plan
constitutes the base on which local governments ensure consistency of their plans with applicable regional plans
under CEQA. The SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide includes a number of core, ancillary, and
bridge chapters that address regional issues such as: growth management, regional transportation, air quality,
hazardous waste management, water quality, housing, open space and conservation, water resources, energy,
and integrated solid waste management. The Land Use Element is consistent with land use policies found in
the SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide.
SCAG Growth Management Plan
The SCAG Growth Management Plan recommends methods to direct regional growth to minimize traffic
congestion and better protect environmental quality. The goals of the Growth Management Plan include
balancing jobs and housing. While SCAG has no authority to mandate implementation of its Growth
Management Plan, principal goals have implications for the land use composition of Holtville. The SCAG goals
are generally reflected throughout all of the General Plan elements, including the Land Use Element.
Imperial County Air Pollution Control District
The Imperial County Air Pollution Control District mandates a variety of measures to improve air quality. As
part of its responsibility to protect the public health and property from the damaging effects of air pollution it
shall be the duty of the Air Pollution Control Officer to review and advise the appropriate planning authorities
within the District on all new construction or changes in land use which the Air Pollution Control Officer
believes could become a source of air pollution problems.
Imperial County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
The County of Imperial approved an amended Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan for all Imperial County
airport in June of 1996. The Plan sets forth the criteria and policies that the Imperial County Land Use
Commission use to assess the compatibility between the primary airports in the County and proposed land use
development in the areas surrounding them. Additionally, the Plan provided guidance for commission review
of new airports and heliports proposed for construction in the County.
Imperial County General Plan
Adopted in 1993, the Imperial County General Plan consists of ten Elements entitled Land Use, Housing,
Circulation and Scenic Highways, Noise, Seismic and Public Safety, Agricultural, Conservation and Open Space,
Geothermal/Alternative Energy and Transmission, Water, and Parks & Recreation. Also included in the
General Plan is a Land Use Map designating various land use categories which identify locations, and describes
the type and anticipated maximum allowable density of ultimate development.

City of Holtville Zoning Ordinance
Holtville adopted its revised Zoning Ordinance in 2000, and in 2009 it adopted its Downtown Master Plan,
Design Guidelines, and Form-Based Code. These updates are intended to encourage more sustainable
development and create a visual identity that is unique and fitting for the City. Form-based codes address the
relationship between private lots and blocks and the public streets and parks, the form, mass, scale, and types
of buildings in relation to one another. These are used to promote mixed-use and more walkable places. The
Zoning Ordinance is the primary implementation tool for the Land Use Element. Together, the Zoning
Ordinance and Zoning Map identify specific types of land use, intensity of use, and development and
performance standards applicable to specific areas and parcels of land within the City.
City of Holtville Service Area Plan
Holtville recently adopted its Service Area Plan for the entire planning area with the General Plan and Housing
Element updates in 2017. The Service Area Plan identifies demand for public services and facilities based on
population and housing growth projections for the year 2030 and anticipated phasing of development within
the planning area. The Plan provides an analysis of existing public services and facilities of the City, and indicates
how the demand created by future development within the planning area will be met.
City of Holtville Redevelopment Plan Successor Agency
In order to improve economic and physical conditions in Holtville, the City formed the Holtville
Redevelopment Agency in 1989. On January 31, 2012, pursuant to 2011 Assembly Bill X1 26, redevelopment
agencies in California were dissolved. The Successor Agency to the Holtville Redevelopment Agency was
created to handle dissolution activities from that point forward.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Land Use Element relates very closely to all of the other General Plan elements. This element establishes
the planned land use pattern for Holtville based on the historic formation of the City and the community's
vision of the future. Alternatively, the other General Plan elements ensure that the public safety is ensured, and
that the unique qualities of Holtville are safeguarded and enhanced.
For example, the Housing Element of the General Plan provides the basis for establishing housing stock that
meets the affordability requirements and other special needs of the community. The Circulation Element
provides a Circulation Plan to accommodate increased traffic from planned development. The use of alternative
transportation modes and reduction of automobile trips are addressed in the Circulation Element to meet the
transportation demands from new development, and to mitigate the impact of development on regional air
quality and traffic conditions.
A number of the areas are designated for parks and open space on the Land Use Policy Map for recreational
and aesthetic purposes. The Open Space and Conservation Elements provide policy and plans to maintain and
enhance existing parks and recreational facilities and to develop new facilities to meet new demand from
population growth. These Elements are also designed to protect natural resources.
The Safety and Noise Elements ensure that planned land uses identified in the Land Use Element are
compatible and will not result in public safety hazards or exposure of people to excessive noise.
Since the last comprehensive update of Holtville’s General Plan in 2003, scientific consensus has emerged that
human activities are generating gases such as carbon dioxide and methane more quickly than the earth’s natural
systems can absorb them. The Land Use Element policies are intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
which create a blanket around the earth that allows light to pass through but traps heat at the surface, preventing

its escape into space. Models predict that this “greenhouse effect” will lead to anywhere from a 2-10 degree
Fahrenheit temperature increase over the next 100 years.
For Holtvile, changes in the earth’s temperature will have impacts that could include:
        Warmer weather associated with increased heat waves
        Wetter weather with an increase in annual rainfall of 20% to 30%, leading to more serious storm events
        Decrease in the Sierra snow pack that will affect fresh water availability
        Increase in insect-borne diseases
In 2006, the State of California passed Assembly Bill 32, committing California to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. Holtville’s policy directives to achieve these goals are:
        Mobility policies deemphasizing automobiles and emphasizing other modes of transportation
        Land Use policies related to transit supported development in downtown
        Public Facility policies to collaborate with the School District to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
        Public Facility and Conservation policies on Green Buildings and energy conservation
        Community character policies and regulations related to high performance infrastructure programs to
         support sustainable development
        Housing Element policies promoting infll housing development
        Parks and Recreation Element policies supporting linear park and natural land along the Alamo River
        Participate in regional planning efforts related to climate change adaptation

Land Use Element
Issues, Goals, and Policies
The Land Use Element addresses the use of land developed within the community. The Element focuses on
how vacant land will be allowed to develop, as well as how certain developed land may be redeveloped for
other use. These planning policies and goals are intended to promote more sustainable development
patterns that lead to a more socially equitable, environmentally just and economically balanced City.
Sustainability is generally defined as the ability to meet the needs of the current generation without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. In practical terms, a sustainable
approach reduces resource consumption, avoids pollution, develops in harmony with the environment, and
helps people live healthier lives. This chapter highlights the importance of sustainability principles in
building the City’s future and to provide guidance for its continued resiliency over the next 100-years.
Fortunately, the City was in large part planned and developed over a century ago when energy and resource
conservation was paramount to survival. Then the automobile was a new form of transportation with fossil
fuels being prohibitively expensive for widespread use. Resilient for over a century, its walkable pattern was
set with the original Holton Inter- Urban Railroad spur that provided its regional access. As our nation
again shifts away from predominately auto-oriented transportation use, the City’s historic pattern allows
for it to be well positioned for a more sustainable future. Its complete, compact, and connected traditional
community pattern is the basic building block of the City’s ability to build more sustainably, see Figure
LU-2. This is characterized by its inherent walkability, mixed-use development, and mixed-income housing,
which is a function of its range from large to small lots, and existing and planned density.
FIGURE LU-2.         WALKABLE AND SUSTAINABLE PATTERN
The majority of existing and planned growth is located within a compact and walkable half-mile radius, a 10-minute
walking distance, of the center Holt Park located in the center of Holtville and its transit center.

Seven major issues are addressed in the goals, policies and implementation actions of the Land Use Element.
These major issues include: I) balancing land uses within the planning area to ensure that development occurs
in appropriate areas and provides a mixture of land uses, including employment generating uses beyond
agricultural industries; 2) managed growth that ensures compatible development; 3) promoting infill
development in the downtown area; 4) continued enhancement and protection the Alamo River corridor; 5)
ensuring that an adequate level of public services and facilities is provided; 6) ensuring that adequate public
education facilities are provided to meet the needs of residents; and 7) promoting a sustainable and healthy
community for Holtville’s citizens.
Balance of Land Uses
The City was founded as the agri-business center of eastern Imperial Valley. Holtville is characterized as a
complete, compact, and connected community with a redeveloping downtown in its center, surrounded by
quiet residential neighborhoods containing a mixture of modest sized and priced housing units, and working
agricultural land and Alamo River forming its well-defined edge. The City's agricultural activities and related
industrial uses provide its major employment base, but this agricultural base can be dramatically affected by
regional and global market forces. As a result, Holtville must encourage a more diverse and resilient economy.
While the City requires a variety of agricultural and non-agricultural commercial and industrial uses to support
the needs of the existing community, these non-residential land uses must be compatible with the existing
community, while allowing for the development of a diverse and stable economic base.
Land Use Goal 1:           Develop a balanced land use pattern that provides a complete range of housing and
                           employment opportunities, from its agricultural industry edge to its mixed-use center,
                           to ensure that revenue generation matches the City's responsibility for provision and
                           maintenance of public services and facilities.
Policy 1.1:                Encourage the development of a broad range of industrial and manufacturing
                           activities that are economically feasible, environmentally acceptable, and provide
                           employment in an attractive and convenient manner.
Policy 1.2:                Promote and encourage Holtville as an ideal location for agricultural as well as a
                           regional recreation center, and emerging technology industries hub not dependent
                           upon high-volumes of traffic.
Policy 1.3:                Preserve planned industrial areas by preventing the intrusion of incompatible land
                           uses.
Policy 1.4:                Provide incentives for development of currently vacant mixed-use, commercial and
                           industrial lands within the City to best utilize existing resources and services.
Policy 1.5:                Maintain the City’s adequate transportation facilities and systems to maintain its
                           effective and efficient movement of people and goods.
Managed Growth
While much of the planning area within the City limits is developed and future growth is focused on infilling
vacant parcels in downtown, there is a substantial amount of vacant or agricultural land located within the City's
Sphere of Influence that will be developed in the future. How and when these edge areas are ultimately
developed will have a great impact on the City, affecting issues such as the provision of public services, the
economic well-being of the community, as well as the compatibility of new development with the existing
community. Ensuring that land is not developed until the appropriate time when adequate public services and
facilities can be economically provided is an important factor of planning for the development of these vacant

Land Use Element
and rural edge areas. Until annexed, development within the Sphere of Influence is guided by the Urban Area
land use classification of the 2008 Imperial County General Plan. The Urban Area classification requires review
of all new development by appropriate County departments to ensure adequate public services exist to serve
the proposed project. In addition, the infill development of existing urbanized areas is the primary growth area.
As a result, both new and infill development need to be managed and directed so that they complement and
enhance the existing community pattern.
Land Use Goal 2:            Manage desirable and compatible land use development.
Policy 2.1:                 Assure that new development and infill development is compatible with existing
                            development patterns.
Policy 2.2:                 Encourage the elimination of incompatible, inconsistent, and conflicting land uses.
Policy 2.3:                 Utilize the CEQA review process to analyze the potential impacts of new
                            development in order to address and/or mitigate adverse environmental conditions.
Policy 2.4:                 Coordinate with the County to ensure that development under their jurisdiction (prior
                            to annexation) is consistent and compatible with the City's General Plan.
Policy 2.5:                 Require and Support annexations as a process for extending City services for new
                            developments that are contiguous to the City.
Policy 2.6:                 Encourage development of properties with similar development patterns, such as lot
                            sizes and land uses that are adjacent and contiguous to the City.
Policy 2.7:                 Discourage projects that propose large expanses of undeveloped property between
                            the development and the City, except existing developments that may be determined
                            to be a positive City benefit, such as the Barbara Worth Country Club to the east and
                            the Orchard Subdivision, a Disadvantage Unincorporated Community to the south.
Policy 2.8:                 Encourage annexations and developments that positively benefit the City's long-term
                            ability to finance, maintain, and operate facilities, and discourage those projects that
                            do not provide a positive benefit to the City.
Policy 2.9:                 Allow for agricultural land uses within the City limits for areas that may become
                            annexed but are not immediately developed.
Downtown Infill Development
The center of the City's commercial area is a mix of newly constructed and rehabilitated buildings with vacant
parcels and structures ready for infill development. Holtville’s future growth is focused on downtown. The
Downtown Project Area’s zoning, Downtown Code (chapter 17.41) is in place to implement mixed-use, small
lot infill development. The restoration of downtown with infill development is intended to rehabilitate and
utilize existing infrastructure, including water, sewer, and transportation. This focus protects the state’s natural
and working lands, including agricultural land, lands of cultural and historic significance, wetlands, and
wildlands, as well as enabling the city to develop in a more sustainable manner that limits sprawl and minimizes
costs to taxpayer. In terms of resiliency, which is defined as interconnecting dynamic systems to adapt better
to natural or economic shocks, the economic viability of the downtown area warrants serious and dedicated
attention by the City as well as its citizens. This focus is intended to provide new housing, basic retail, as well
as wholesale and business services, which will shift residents from being forced to secure these services from
surrounding jurisdictions, resulting in economic losses to Holtville.

Land Use Goal 3:           Support and enable downtown mixed-use developments that complement economic,
                           housing, and General Plan goals.
Policy 3.1:                Encourage land uses that support and generate retail sales in the downtown.
Policy 3.2:                Focus on infill growth to reduce transportation carbon emissions through promoting
                           alternatives to driving (e.g., walking, biking, transit, and car sharing).
Policy 3.3:                Encourage an attractive downtown sense-of-place providing an appropriate
                           architectural character and patterns conducive to a small, rural, town.
Alamo River Development
To the south, southwest, and west, the City is bordered and separated from the unincorporated areas by the
Alamo River. This creates a natural buffer between the City and adjacent land uses, but also constrains future
development in these directions. The river area is designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) to be a flood area, land uses are limited, but the area does have the potential for innovative open space
and recreational opportunities, provided that any proposed use is not in conflict with Imperial Irrigation District
(IID) requirements.
Land Use Goal 4:           Protect riparian and wetland habitats of the Alamo River to be transformed into a
                           cultural, recreational, and economic attraction beneficial to the region.
Policy 4.1:                Develop a Master Plan that identified major recreational/preservation use and
                           compatible uses for the river corridor, while addressing the concerns and regulatory
                           requirements of various affected agencies and parties.
Policy 4.2:                Collaborate with local service organizations, developers, lID, Regional Water Quality
                           Control Board (RWQCB), and others to support a multi-use concept for riparian
                           corridors that incorporates open space, aesthetic, habitat and wildlife corridor values,
                           while addressing social, cultural, flood control and recreation needs.
Policy 4.3:                Seek funding from federal, state, and other sources to assist in the development of
                           this recreational corridor.
Policy 4.4:                Annex additional land along the Alamo River for open space as opportunities occur.
Policy 4.5:                Require an appropriately sized buffer or setback on each side of a riparian corridor
                           and wetland. Development shall be prohibited within established setback areas for
                           these riparian corridors, creeks, stream, wetland, ponds, and waterways.
Provision of Public Services
The continued development of Holtville will result in an increase of population and their need for expanded
public services and facilities. Based on recent trends, the number of Holtville schoolchildren is expected to
remain stable, with growth occurring in the number of older adults. It is also likely that Holtville will become
even more ethnically diverse in the future. As these demographic shifts continue, and as public budgets continue
to be constrained, public services will need to adapt. With new development adding pressure on existing
circulation networks, landfills, sewer and water systems, air quality and water quality, as well as other standard
City services, Holtville anticipates the need to more sustainably address the disposal of hazardous and non-
hazardous waste, the exchange of water and other resources, and other standard city services needed by existing
and new citizens.

Education
Holtville is committed to the education of its residents. Students in the planning area attend five schools within
the Holtville Unified School District. Most school facilities are over 40 years old and in urgent need of
renovation and repair. The City is dedicated to maintaining and improving the quality of its educational
opportunities and facilities currently available to the community.
Land Use Goal 6:          Work with the Holtville Unified School District to ensure that a level of public
                          education is provided that meets community educational needs.

Sustainability and Resiliency
With its traditional neighborhood development pattern, Holtville embodies a baseline commitment to a more
sustainable and resilient city for its citizens. Building upon its history as a walkable and healthy community,
Holtville is committed to a more sustainable future with high-performance infrastructure policies and programs.
Focusing on resiliency is to define the interconnecting and dynamic city systems that is able to then adapt and
reconnect in response to natural or economic shocks. This requires flexibility and adaptability, which is the
purpose for enable mixed-use downtown so as to not be overly dependent upon agriculture for commerce and
greenfield land annexations for new housing.
Land Use Goal 7:          Maintain and accommodate for the development of a mix of land uses that meet the
                          diverse needs of residents, businesses, with places to live, work, shop, be culturally
                          enriched, and engage in healthy lifestyles.
Policy 7.1:               Review the General Plan’s residential and commercial capacities every five years and
                          modify, as necessary, to reflect the impacts, evolving market conditions, and
                          consistency with community values after new development has occurred.
Policy 7.2:               Allocate sufficient land use densities to support the development of businesses
                          offering jobs matched to the education and skills of the city’s residents and housing
                          affordability to employees of local businesses, thereby reducing commutes to and
                          from outside of the city.
Policy 7.3:               Enable high-performance building and infrastructure technologies to support
                          sustainable and resilient development to include infill, adaptive reuse, and transit-
                          oriented with innovative techniques to conserve water and energy.
Policy 7.4:               Encourage the expansion of telecommunications infrastructure.
Policy 7.5:               Locate the City’s highest density housing in the center of downtown within a
                          comfortable walking distance to employment hubs, schools, public facilities, and
                          alternative transportation facilities, such as bus and bicycle.
Policy 7.6:               Link transportation facilities and high-performance infrastructure improvements to
                          recreational uses, job centers, commercial nodes, and social services, such as Holt
                          Park and its related community centers in the center of Holtville.

Land Use Element
Land Use Plan
Holtville’s land use decisions are based on the desire to balance its land uses that enable high-quality places
where citizen’s live, work, play, learn, shop, worship, and recreate. Future growth is carefully managed through
a land use planning process intended to provide an attractive community that contains a range of agricultural
and non-agricultural based employment opportunities, revitalize its downtown, as well as provide high-quality
recreational opportunities and public services and facilities to serve existing and future residents and businesses
in a more sustainable manner.
The Land Use Plan describes a long-term approach that builds upon the community's traditional town plan in
an agricultural regional context. The Land Use Plan is structured to addresses the issues identified in the
previous section of this Element. The goals and policies described in the previous section provide the basis for
the Plan and are supported by approaches to maintain an advantageous balance among land uses, control and
direct growth, promote downtown infill development, enhance and protect the Alamo River corridor, provide
adequate public services and facilities, and build for a long-term resiliency using 21st century sustainability
techniques.
Balance of Land Uses
The variety of land uses within Holtville affects the important balance between the generation of public
revenues and the provision of public facilities and services. Enabling, achieving and maintaining a balance of
land uses can ensure fiscal stability as the market and economies shift that creates a complete. Promoting a
variety of non-agriculturally based commercial and industrial uses nearer downtown, and its transit hub, is
intended to bring balance to and stabilize the economic base of the community.
The majority of the unincorporated area is currently under agricultural production and has historically defined
the City. The majority of the incorporated portion of the planning area is mostly developed, with vacant and
underutilized lots most located downtown. As a result, future growth will be a careful balance of downtown
infill with areas outside of the current City limits. The Land Use Plan identifies the land uses for these areas
which will create a land use composition that provides a balance between the generation of public revenues and
the cost of providing public facilities and services.
Implementation of the Land Use Plan will also assist in creating a more sustainable balance between the number
of jobs and housing units within the planning area’s natural and built setting. A balance between jobs and
housing allows some people to live and work within the same community. This results in a reduction of traffic,
thereby reducing the level of air pollution and improving the quality of life for the community. The City will
implement the Land Use Plan to assure that a balance of land uses occurs, maintaining fiscal stability and an
improved jobs/housing balance understanding the long-term financial burden of operating and maintaining
public facilities.
Land Use Classification System
The Land Use Policy Map (Figure LU-3) illustrates the various types and distribution of land uses planned for
Holtville (Figure LU-3A is of SOI area, and Figure LU-3B is of City area). The land use classification system
is presented in Table LU-I and includes eleven (11) land use designations. These land use designations identify
the types and nature of development allowed in particular locations depicted on the Land Use Policy Map.
The residential categories include five (5) designations that allow for a range of housing types and densities.
The non-residential categories include a variety of designations, such as commercial, industrial, and agriculture
to promote a wide range of revenue- and employment-generating businesses. Other non-residential
designations include community facilities (schools), open space/recreation and wetlands to provide for public
uses, recreation, wetlands, and open space.

Land Use Element
Land Use Density and Intensity
This Element uses certain terminology to describe the 5 residential land use designations. The term density is
used for residential land uses and refers to the population and development capacity of residential land. Density
is described in terms of number of single dwelling units per one (1) gross acre of land (du/gross acre). Figure
LU-4 depicts the calculation of density.
FIGURE LU-4.          CALCULATING DENSITY
 Average Lot square footage: 8,400 sf
 Average Lot dimensions: 60’ wide x 140’ depth
 One (1) Acre: 43,560 sf
 One (1) Unit per Avg. Lot: 5.2 du/gross acre
 (8,400 sf % 43,560 = 5.16 rounded up to 5.2)
 One (1) Unit per Avg. Lot: 5.2 du/gross acre (LOT A)
 Two (2) Units per Lot: 10.4 du/ac (LOT B)
 Four (2) Units per Lot: 20.7 du/ac (max. du/ac)
Development intensity, which applies to non-residential uses, refers to the extent of development on a parcel of
land or lot (i.e., the total building square footage, building height, the floor area ratio, and/or the percent of Jot
coverage). Intensity is often used to describe non-residential development levels; but, in a broader sense,
intensity is also used to express overall levels of both residential and non-residential development types. In this
Element, floor area ratio and building square footage are used as measures of non-residential development
intensity.
Floor area ratio (FAR) represents the ratio between the total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot and the
total area of that lot. The FAR controls the intensity of use on a parcel of land. FAR is determined by dividing
the gross floor area of all buildings on a parcel by the land area of that parcel. For example, a 20,000 square
foot building on a 40,000 square foot parcel yields a FAR of 0.50: I. A 0.50: I FAR allows a single story building
which covers most of the parcel, or a two- story building with reduced lot coverage. Figure LU-5 depicts the
calculation of FAR.

FIGURE LU-5.         CALCULATING FLOOR AREA RATIO (FAR)
 In a Zone District with a maximum FAR of 0.5, the maximum allowable floor area of a building covering a 40,000 sf
Lot would be 20,000 sf. – FAR is gross building area on net lot area.
Land Use Designations
State General Plan law requires that the Land Use Element indicate the maximum densities and intensities
permitted within the Land Use Plan. The land use designations shown on the Figure LU-3 Land Use Policy
Map are described in detail in this Element. Table LU-1 lists each of the land use designations shown on the
Land Use Policy Map and provides a corresponding indication of maximum density or intensity of development.
Maximum allowable development on individual parcels of land is governed by these measures of density or
intensity. The table also includes the average overall level of development within each land use designation
within the planning area. These average levels of development represent an anticipated overall density and
intensity of development for the planning area and are, therefore, less than the absolute maximum allowed for
an individual parcel of land. For various reasons, many parcels in the community have not been developed to
their maximum density or intensity and, in the future, maximum development as described in this Element can
be expected to occur only on a limited number of parcels.
The overall future development of the City is anticipated to occur at the average level of density or intensity
indicated in Table LU-1. Development at an intensity or density near the maximum level can occur only where
projects offer exceptional design quality, important public amenities or benefits, or other factors that promote
important goals and policies of the General Plan.

Open Space and Recreational Designation
Open Space/Recreation (OS-R): The Open Space/Recreation designation provides for open space uses that
preserve natural and scenic resources, allow the managed production of resources, and provide recreational
opportunities, and also allows for public facilities. The determination of site-specific uses is based on more
detailed studies during review of applications. This designation allows a maximum of 0.05 dwelling units per
gross acre of land. The maximum intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 0.1:1.
Wetlands Designation
Wetlands (W): The Wetlands designation provides for the conservation and protection of groundwater
aquifer, water bodies, and water courses, which include reservoirs, rivers, and streams located throughout the
Alamo River basin and the region. Wetlands supports a predominance of hydrophytes, plants whose habitat is
water or very wet laces and its substratum is predominately undrained hydric soil. Ephemeral or perennial
streams are present and contribute to the identified biological functions of a wetland in the local drainage
system. No development is allowed in this designation.
Development Capacity
The Land Use Plan for Holtville includes average levels of residential and non-residential development, where
all land in the planning area is developed according to the Plan. The average levels of development establish a
capacity for the Land Use Plan that is expressed as estimates of total dwelling units, total population, and total
square footage of non-residential development in the future.
Table LU-2 summarizes the development capacity of the Land Use Plan. This table provides a breakdown of
land uses for purposes of identifying the estimated development capacity within Holtville. The degree to which
the estimated capacity exceeds projected population is referred to as "overage". Some overage is desirable to
make allowances for inevitable small pockets of undevelopable land, to allow for difficulty in recognizing
development trends in completely vacant areas, to allow for unforeseen need for public utilities, and to
recognize that some owners will maintain their land in an undeveloped slate beyond the time span of the Plan.
The City of Holtville has adequate land available within the City and its sphere of influence to accommodate
projected growth for the year 2026 and beyond.

Managed Growth
The City of Holtville has the potential to experience both incremental growth Downtown and larger master
planned development within its undeveloped Sphere of Influence. To ensure that new development in
undeveloped land, infill development in developed areas, and protection of natural land is compatible with
existing development and that adequate levels of public service and facilities are provided, the planning area
should continue to be managed through the variety of policies, plans, ordinances, processes, and programs.
For the undeveloped areas, the City’s Service Area Plan addresses the provisions of public services and facilities
within the City and Sphere of Influence. The Service Area Plan also identifies areas within the planning area
which are likely to experience growth within the next 20 years. This phasing plan allows the City to plan for the
future expansion of public services and facilities to meet future demand. The City will continue to implement
the Service Area Plan and review development proposals for consistency with the Plan to ensure that they will
not result in the premature development of land or inadequate provision of public services and facilities.
The City's Zoning Ordinance provides another means to ensure that future growth is compatible with existing
development. Standards for development contained in the Zoning Ordinance, such as allowed uses, setbacks,
parking and landscaping, are designed to promote compatibility between uses. To manage undeveloped lands,
the A-1 Agricultural Zone allows for the continued use of land for agricultural production once it has been
annexed into the City, serving as a means to control and direct the rate of growth within the City limits. In
addition to the Zoning Ordinance, the City Subdivision Ordinance is an important regulation tool to control the
subdivision of land in preparation for development. To ensure the compatibility of future growth, Holtville will
review and amend, when necessary, its Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Ordinance to ensure that they are
consistent with new state legislation and court decisions and provide protection for the community.
Discretionary Project Reviews, such as Rezones and Use-Permits, will be evaluated under the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to identify potential environmental impacts that may occur if the project
was implemented, including negative impacts to existing development. By identifying these potential impacts,
the City will be able to determine whether it is in the best interests of the community to approve or deny a
project, or require mitigation measures.
Downtown Infill Development
The downtown area of Holtville is the focus area for the community’s future growth. Mixed-use, transit-
supported, infill development in the exiting downtown is the preferred growth scenario, see Figure LU-6
Preferred Infill Development Growth Scenario below. In response to shifting regional economic conditions
that have resulted in merchants relocating to outlying commercial centers, or going out of business altogether,
the City’s zoning has enable mixed-use development to be located downtown. Enabling mixed-use and higher
housing densities in a walkable, transit-supported, compact downtown is intended to achieve sustainable
development goals at the local, regional, and State levels. Improving the image of the downtown area requires
attracting and retaining commercial businesses and attached and detached residential housing in a compatible
scale and materials with its context and serve the community's needs in a downtown pattern. The addition of
housing in the center of Holtville is intended to assure more people are able to access businesses and maintain
their long-term success.
This General Plan has identified the downtown planning area as the targets the area for infill development.
Programs include improving the physical appearance of the downtown to encourage businesses and residents
to utilize and bring new life to the area. Assistance to businesses, such as low interest loans and storefront
improvement programs, is intended to attract new business and assist in their long-term success. This focus
reflects the outcomes of the City’s Economic Development and City Master Plan (2008) and related 2009
Zoning Ordinance and General Plan Land Use Map up (City Council Resolution 09-15) update to create a
Downtown Project Area zone using the innovative Form-Based Coding techniques. This zoning chapter

establishes development standards for downtown properties specifically to help preserve and protect the
existing, historic, and unique character of the downtown. It requires new development to complement the
existing built environment in order for downtown to continue being Holtville’s pedestrian-oriented shopping,
dining, entertainment, and living center.

Alamo River Development
The appropriate use of the Alamo River area will provide for the protection and enjoyment of this natural
resource, as well as provide for recreational and economic benefits to the community. The Alamo River
Recreation Trail (under construction) provides a half-mile trail for hikers, bikers, trail runners and equestrians
to recreate along the Alamo River. The creation of a Master Plan once the area is annexed to the City will
provide for the opportunity to coordinate with other agencies including the Imperial Irrigation District (IID)
and Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) to determine a development plan that would provide for
the protection of sensitive resources, while allowing for the economic development of appropriate portions of
the area. Implementation of downtown infill development will also assist in the development of the Alamo
River area to help reduce the number of vacant lots within the incorporated area.
Provision of Public Services
Sufficient levels of public services and facilities are necessary to protect the public and the quality of life for the
community. The City's Service Area Plan addresses the provision of administrative, law enforcement, fire
protection, transportation, parks and recreation, library, drainage, water, and waste water treatment and
collection. The City will continue to implement the Service Area Plan to ensure that adopted levels of service

growth manner.
Public Education
The Holtville Unified School District consists of one high school, one intermediate school, two elementary
schools, and one continuation school. The School District provides K-12 facilities and services for the City of
Holtville and surrounding unincorporated areas. All schools are at capacity with an approximate enrollment of
1615 students. In 2016, the District stated that its enrollment is stabilizing after several years of decline and
volatile enrollment swings of the past. This is expected to continue as a positive Economic Outlook Report
from the State of California Legislative Analyst Office in 2016 portends a positive funding climate for public
education in the State.
The Holtville Unified School District has prepared plans for making improvements to all District schools,
including improving the electrical system and plumbing, and upgrading infrastructure to accommodate
increased technology in classrooms. However, implementation of these plans is dependent upon availability of
funding. Holtville supports efforts by the school district to obtain these funds by ensuring that development
fees according to SB 50 are collected during the development review process in order to improve educational
facilities and provide a better learning environment for City children. In addition, when appropriate, the City
will work with the District in identifying potential locations for new schools and facilities.
Sustainability and Resiliency
The collection of these planning policies are intended to promote livable communities and smart growth in
future development. These are based on focusing new development on downtown infill areas in a robust grid
street pattern that promotes mixed-use, walkable and transit-supported development patterns, see Figure C-2
Street Pattern. As well as referencing an innovative set of implementation tools, see Table LU-5 Sustainable
and Resilient Community Matrix, to build a more resiliency and sustainable city. This set of high-performance
infrastructure program tools address energy and water conservation techniques and are outlined at both the lot
and city-wide scale. These are intended to provide guidance to interconnect infrastructure networks with land
use planning techniques that promote adaptability, which form the basis of a more resilient and sustainable city.

Circulation Element
CIRCULATION ELEMENT
Introduction
Situated north of the Interstate 8 freeway, Holtville is comprised largely of local streets. California State Route
115, known as East and West Fifth (5th) Street, was the original east-west interstate artery connecting California
and Arizona. The construction of Interstate 8 (approximately 2.5 miles south of and parallel to SR 115) in the
1960s bypassed Holtville and became the major east-west interstate artery, carrying approximately 11,500
motorized vehicles as of 2012. While a state highway facility, SR 115 now serves more regional and local traffic
as is demonstrated in its relatively low traffic volume of less than 7,000 motorized vehicles as of 2012.
The City is built on a traditional block-level grid system with the majority of buildings, parks, schools, and other
uses on or north of 5th Street with more industrial development located south of 5th Street adding parks,
housing, and jobs. Local streets generally consist of wide travel/parking lanes with relatively narrow sidewalks
and parkway strips. Most streets are designed primarily for travel by motor vehicles with a new focus on
accommodating pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The City’s 2016 Complete Streets Plan is integrated into
this element in order to facilitate healthier mobility options, decreasing the urban heat island effect, and lowering
maintenance costs for the City.
Historically, regional railways have serviced Holtville; however, the Inter-Urban Railroad is abandoned.
Imperial Valley Transit operates a bus service system that serve Holtville with its primary transit hub located at
Holt Park. In addition, while the Holtville Airstrip is located to the east of the City (outside the planning area),
it remains an important part of Holtville's circulation system and future. In addition to its transportation system,
the City also operates and maintains an extensive water distribution and wastewater system that serves the
community.
A guide the continued development and improvement of the circulation system to support existing and planned
development identified in the Land Use Element, this element is essentially an infrastructure plan addressing
the circulation of people, goods, energy, water, sewage, storm drainage, and communications. This Circulation
Element is interconnected with the housing, open-space, noise and safety elements, and affects Holtville’s
physical, social, and economic environment in the follow ways:
Physical: The interconnected grid-pattern circulation system is one of the chief generators and form giver of
Holtville’s physical development and livability. Holtville’s traditionally laid out streets and blocks location,
design, and constituent modes have major impacts on affecting local air quality, plant and animal habitats,
environmental noise, energy use, community appearance, and other environmental components.
Social: The circulation system is a primary determinant of the pattern of human settlement. It has a major impact
on the areas and activities it serves, on community cohesion, and on the quality of human life. A tremendous
value of Holtville’s interconnected circulation system is its ease of access to all segments of the population,
including the disadvantaged, the young, the poor, the elderly, and the disabled.
Economic: The economic activities normally require circulation for materials, products, ideas, and employees,
thus the viability of the community’s economy is directly affected by the circulation element. The efficiency of
a community’s circulation system can either contribute to or adversely affect its economy.
The development of additional land in the future will increase the demand for local and regional roadway
improvements and construction. Assembly Bill 1358, the Complete Streets Act of 2008, requires circulation
elements plan for a multi-modal transportation network that meets the needs of all modes and users. This
element establishes acceptable roadway service levels and identifies Complete Street improvements. The use of
other modes of transportation such as transit, walking, and bicycling is promoted in this element to reduce the
demand for transportation system improvements and to impacts to air quality.

Purpose of the Circulation Element
The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide a safe, efficient, and adequate circulation system for the
City. State planning law requires:
".... to plan for a balanced, multimodal transportation network that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads,
and highways for safe and convenient travel in a manner that is suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context
of the general plan."
To meet this purpose, the Circulation Element addresses the circulation improvements needed to provide
adequate capacity with a variety of multimodal options supporting land use policies identifying Holtville’s urban
(downtown), suburban (neighborhoods), and rural (agriculture) context. The Element establishes a hierarchy
of transportation routes with typical development standards described for each roadway category in context.
This circulation element policies, plans, and programs are intended to:
              Coordinate the transportation and circulation system with planned land uses;
              Promote the safe and efficient transport of goods and the safe and effective movement of all
               segments of the population;
              Make efficient use of existing transportation facilities; and
              Protect environmental quality and promote the wise and equitable use of economic and natural
               resources.
The State Guidelines indicate that the Circulation Element should address all facets of circulation including
streets and highways, transportation corridors, public transit, railroads, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, and
commercial, general, and military airports. The Holtville Circulation Element fulfills state requirements with
this plan to provide effective circulation facilities and public utilities supporting the desired community
development outcomes.

Circulation Element
Scope and Content of the Circulation Element
This element contains goals, policies, and implementation programs to improve overall circulation in Holtville.
For vehicular transportation, a hierarchical roadway network is established with designated roadway types and
design standards. The roadway types are linked to anticipated traffic levels, and acceptable levels of service are
established to determine when capacity improvements are necessary. These are also linked to the hierarchy of
planned development intensity and characteristics, such as downtown streets having more urban characteristics
than edge of town roads.
Alternative transportation modes are also emphasized in this element. These transit, bicycle and pedestrian
facilities are intended to reduce citizen’s dependency on the automobile and thereby improve environmental,
economic, and social quality. This will mean in the near future, Measuring Level of Stress for bicyclist and
Vehicle Miles Travelled to measure Greenhouse Gas Emissions in relationship to Climate Action Planning will
be important to future mobility planning efforts.
The local circulation network is linked with the regional system. This element focuses on Holtville’s
participation in regional programs to alleviate traffic congestion and construct capacity improvements. The
circulation system is interconnected to the complexities of the City’s water, wastewater, and drainage systems,
which are addressed in the Circulation Element.
Related Plans and Programs
There are several existing plans and programs prepared by various agencies that are directly applicable to the
aims and objectives of the Circulation Element. Plans and programs related to the Circulation Element include
the following:
Southern California Association of Governments Plans and Programs (SCAG)
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is responsible for the regional planning in
Southern California. SCAG has prepared long range growth and development plans for the Southern California
region since the early 1970s as part of the ongoing Development Guide Program. This program provides a
framework for coordinating local and regional decisions regarding future development and growth. An
important component of this process is the preparation of growth forecast policies at intervals ranging from
three to five years. The adopted growth forecast policies become the basis for SCAG's functional plans
(transportation, housing, air and water) for the region. The population totals and growth distribution are used
in planning the future capacity of highways and transit systems.
On April 7, 2016, SCAG’s Regional Council adopted the 2016 Regional Transportation Plan / Sustainable
Communities Strategy (RTP/SCS), a plan that represents the vision for Southern California’s future, including
policies, strategies, and projects for advancing the region’s mobility, economy and sustainability through 2040
as set forth in SB 375. SCAG concluded that State established per-capita greenhouse gas emission reduction
targets of 8 percent by 2020 and 13 percent by 2035 had been met and/or exceeded. The California Air
Resources Board (ARB) approved this conclusion in June 2016 by their Executive Order G-16-066, specifying
that SCAG’s adopted SCS would, if implemented, achieve 2020 and 2035 greenhouse gas emission reduction
targets established by the State. The RTP/SCS plan recommends ways to redirect the region’s growth and its
principal goals (such as improved jobs/housing balance, sustainable communities, and greenhouse gas
reduction) are being implemented through this general plan.
Circulation Element of the Imperial County General Plan
The Circulation Element of the Imperial County General Plan contains the most recent information about the
transportation needs of the County and the various modes available to meet the identified needs. A Circulation
and Scenic Highways Plan is contained in the County Circulation Element to ensure adequate capacity on

County roads and regional routes serving unincorporated areas of the County. To ensure that improvements
to the County circulation system correspond with new development, the Circulation Element addresses the
phasing of roadway improvements and financing alternatives.
Imperial County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
The County of Imperial approved an amended Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan for all Imperial County
airports in June of 1996. The Plan sets forth the criteria and policies that the Imperial County Land Use
Commission uses to assess the compatibility between the primary airports in the County and proposed land
use development in the areas surrounding them. Additionally, the Plan provides guidance for commission
review of new airports and heliports proposed for construction in the County. Although the Holtville Airstrip
is located outside of the planning area, the airstrip has been identified as a possible location for an international
cargo airport for the Southern California region.
Imperial County Transit Plan
The Imperial County Transit Short Range Transit Plan was adopted in 2012 by the Imperial County
Transportation Commission. The Imperial County Transportation Commission was established under Senate
Bill 607 which was approved by the California Legislature and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2009. As
a county transportation commission, ICTC member agencies are enabled to exercise basic initiative and
leadership in the transportation planning and programming process throughout Imperial Valley. The plan
prioritizes access to medical and social services, higher education facilities, employment, basic mobility, and
other economic development activities, and transit alternatives for citizens.
Imperial County Air Pollution Control District- Air Quality Attainment Plan and State Implementation
Plan for PM-10 in the Imperial Valley
The Imperial County Air Pollution Control District - Air Quality Attainment Plan (AQAP) mandates a variety
of measures to improve air quality. To comply with the AQAP, the Land Use Element organizes land uses in
relation to the circulation system, promotes commercial and industrial land uses with convenient access to
transportation, and provides a balanced Land Use Plan that promotes a favorable relationship between jobs
and housing. In addition, the Imperial County Air Pollution Control District implements the State
Implementation Plan for Fine Particulate Matter (PM-10) in the Imperial Valley. The State Implementation
Plan regulates a variety of uses that may contribute to increased levels of PM-I 0 within Imperial Valley.
Water Element of the Imperial County General Plan
The purpose of the Water Element of the County General Plan is to identify and analyze the types of water
resources within the Imperial County and to establish goals and policies to preserve and enhance water
availability and quality. Implementation of the policies of the Water Element will assure that water resources
are conserved and utilized to enhance long-term availability, while providing for current supplies and demands.
In addition, the Water Element facilitates the improved use and distribution of water in Impe1ial County,
including the extension of current water conservation programs.
City of Holtville Service Area Plan
A Service Area Plan (SAP) identifies the existing and projected demand for public facilities and services within
the respective service areas of the public agencies. It discusses the means and financing for extending facilities
and/or services into areas proposed to be annexed to the agency within the time frame of the analysis. A SAP
is required for cities in California in accordance with the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government
Reorganization Act of 2000.

Circulation Element
The City of Holtville (City) is home to over 6,000 residents. Undeveloped land within the city’s boundaries is
zoned for residential, commercial, public, and industrial uses. Land within the City’s SOI is also available for
development; however, there are currently no immediate plans for development projects within the SOI, or
expansion of the SOI. The City of Holtville General Plan guides new growth and development and is currently
being updated along with the City’s Housing Element, including land use revisions necessary to meet the City’s
housing obligations.
This SAP outlines the City’s existing public services and facilities, estimates the current and future anticipated
demand for such facilities and services, and describes how necessary facilities and services will or may be
developed and extended to meet demands. The SAP is intended to demonstrate the City’s intent and ability to
provide adequate services to the SOI boundaries at the time of annexation. An approximate 20-year planning
horizon is used to forecast growth, and the estimated demands and provision to meet demands are based on
population projections for the year 2035.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
Planned development identified in the Land Use Element is the basis for determining future road
improvements; therefore, the Land Use Element is directly linked to the Circulation Element. For example, the
circulation policies and plans identify the improvements to the roadway system that will be required in order to
serve traffic generated by the uses permitted in the Land Use Element. In addition, the Circulation Element
promotes alternative transportation modes to minimize the regional impacts of planned local development.
The Noise Element contains policies and plans aimed to ease the adverse effects of noise on the community
that are directly attributable to the future transportation plans contained in the Circulation Element. Noise
exposure will be a key consideration when locating and designing new development along arterials and other
transportation related noise sources. In addition, policies and plans contained in the Safety Element addressing
transportation related hazards are complementary to policies and plans contained in the Circulation Element.

Issues, goals, and policies
Holtville has a well-connected circulation system with sufficient network capacity to support vehicular, public
transit, bicycle, and pedestrian components. A safe and convenient circulation system operation supports the
variety of land uses in the community. Holtville’s stable population, well-connected circulation system, and
goals to build towards a more sustainable future are in alignment with Caltrans state and regional goals to
preserve transportation corridors for future system improvements.
This includes coordination of transportation system management plans that achieve the maximum use of
existing and proposed infrastructure. In addition, to promote the efficient use of public funds and minimize
delays on local roadways, infrastructure improvements related to the circulation system, such as water, sewer,
and median landscaping should be coordinated with roadway improvements.
Three major issues are addressed by the goals, policies, and plans of the Circulation Element. These major
issues include: 1) providing a network of context-sensitive roadways; 2) supporting active transportation
networks of travel modes that include access transit, bicycle and pedestrian facilities; 3) coordination and
support of regional transportation improvements; and 4) the coordination of roadway, sewer and water
infrastructure improvements.
Context-Sensitive Roadway Network
Safe and convenient access to activities in the community can be provided by a well-designed local roadway
system that responds and supports is land use context. The City’s existing "grid" system is a convenient and
easy-to-traverse network of local roadways. These roadways are sensitive, or respond to, to their context.
Downtown, with both local roads and highways, is the most connected, with the neighborhoods being
connected by local roads, and the region connected by regional highways and arterials.
Circulation Goal 1:        Provide and maintain a safe circulation system that facilitates the efficient movement
                           of people and goods by land use context.
Policy 1.1:                Continue to implement Complete Street roadway standards and classifications that
                           address traffic levels, safety, cost, and efficiency.
Policy 1.2:                Cooperate with the County of Imperial to integrate the two jurisdictions' roadway
                           systems, standards, and classifications.
Policy 1.3:                Require new projects to provide and maintain circulation roadways and
                           improvements that meet City engineering, design, and landscaping standards, desired
                           levels of service, as well as in response to its context.
Policy 1.4:                Implement the City’s Capital Improvement Program and its Project List by including
                           reconstruction, repair, and maintenance for all City streets, alleys, and medians on an
                           ongoing, well planned basis.
Policy 1.5:                Continue to work with residents and property owners to ensure gutters and sidewalks
                           are clean and well-maintained.
Policy 1.6:                Continue coordination with regional agencies such as SCAG, Caltrans, and Imperial
                           County Transit to ensure that citywide circulation concerns are adequately addressed.
Policy 1.7:                Coordinate with the Holtville Union School District to ensure the safety of school
                           children accessing school and its drop-off and pick-up zones.

Policy 1.8:                Ensure that roadways are maintained and developed in accordance with City
                           standards.
Active Transportation
Active transportation network includes transit and bicycle and pedestrian facilities as referenced in the City’s
Complete Streets Plan. City cooperation with other public and private agencies is important to ensure a variety
of safe and convenient alternative modes of travel accessible to all segments of the population. Access to active
transportation modes of travel is particularly important to certain segments of the population such as seniors,
youth, and the disabled.
To improve safety, connectivity, and accessibility for pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit users alike
may require a balance of prioritization and how the roadway is designed so the roadway functions and meets
the needs of all roadway users for all hours of the day rather than just motorists for one to two hours of the
day. For example, if the capacity threshold of a travel lane during the peak hour was 1,500 Average Daily Trips
(ADT) and for one hour of the day it exceeded that 1,500 ADT by 1 to 100 vehicles but the other 23 hours of
the day it was below that threshold, it might be a good policy decision not to widen the roadway because of
one hour or a hundred vehicles that could be spread over the adjacent hours. This phenomenon is called “peak
hour spreading” whereby excess demand for one hour is served by the adjacent hours.
Some congestion and queuing maybe experienced for a short period of time but will dissipate. In addition, since
the City has a well-designed grid system that is also overdesigned for the vehicle volumes, there is excess
capacity on many of the streets. The Holtville Complete Streets plan provides active transportation choices, such
as walking and biking, also provide significant public health benefits. Reductions in adverse health outcomes
are attributable to an increase in walking or biking with the health benefits resulting from emission reductions.
Circulation Goal 2:        Promote active modes of transportation network.
Policy 2.1:                Implement the City’s Complete Streets Plan in order to maintain a safe and accessible
                           bicycle and pedestrian network that links public, civic, and recreational activity areas.
Policy 2.2:                Review progress and determine Complete Street project priorities during annual
                           budget preparation or when funding categories become available through grants.
Policy 2.3:                Cooperate with local and regional agencies and organizations to provide accessible,
                           efficient, affordable, and reliable transit.
Regional Circulation Improvements
Efficient movement of people and goods within a region is an important part of economic development and
quality of life in Holtville. Traffic congestion in Holtville is directly influenced by an overall transportation
network for the region. In addition, the potential for expanded use of the Holtville Airstrip is located in the
planning area can affect Holtville residents.
Circulation Goal 3:        Support efforts to improve the regional transportation system to enhance movement
                           of people and goods in the Holtville area.
Policy 3.1:                Coordinate with Caltrans and the Imperial County Transportation Commission for
                           realignment of SR 115 southwest of Holtville to avoid undesirable impacts to Orchard
                           Road and Fifth Street resulting from the northern extension of SR 7.

                           “Rail-to-Trails” transformation along the Holton Inter-Urban Railroad.
Infrastructure Improvements
Utility infrastructure, such as water and sewer lines and drainage facilities, are often located within circulation
network rights-of-way. Where necessary and feasible, extension and improvement of these facilities should
occur in concert with scheduled and funded Capital Improvement roadway construction and maintenance.
Additional infrastructure improvements should also be coordinated with roadway improvement projects, such
as Complete Street facilities.
Circulation Goal 4:        Provide additional infrastructure and rights-of-way improvements that support an
                           accessible and efficient local circulation system.
Policy 4.1:                Promote efficiency, coordinate infrastructure and rights-of-way improvements with
                           roadway development and maintenance projects.
Policy 4.2:                Acquire the ultimate right-of-way for roadways during early stages of development,
                           include adequate space for planned sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and/or multiuse paths.
Policy 4.3:                Public Works staff shall incorporate appropriate traffic calming and Complete Streets
                           considerations, such as gateways monuments and crossings, during design of City

Circulation Element
Circulation Plan
The City is supported by a diverse circulation system with vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle components. This
section of the element establishes the Circulation Plan. The Plan summarizes the approach to ensure safe and
convenient operation of the circulation system and identifies improvements required to accommodate traffic
from planned development.
Vehicular transportation (automobiles and trucks) is presently the primary mode of travel and a Circulation
Master Plan is established with hierarchical roadway designations, physical design standards for the roadway
designations, and service standards. The Circulation Master Plan includes regional roadways and anticipated
regional traffic levels. The use of alternative modes of transportation, such as buses, paratransit, and bicycles,
is promoted to reduce dependency on vehicular transportation.
The City has adopted a Complete Street Plan and program to establish pedestrian and bicycle routes that will
provide connections between public activity centers and residential neighborhoods and businesses. In addition,
roadway segments are designed to promote pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods.
The Plan is based on issues, goals, and policies identified in the previous section. The Circulation Element
Implementation Program, contained in the following section of this Element, is an extension of the Circulation
Plan and contains specific programs to coordinate planned development with vehicular and non-vehicular
circulation improvements.
Roadway Network Types
As outlined in the Land Use Element, Holtville’s interconnected network of streets is the framework for its
more sustainable development future. Figure C-2 Current Streets Pattern clearly depicts this network pattern.
This existing pattern is considered a best practices model for building mixed-use, walkable, urban to rural
development patterns in the future.
The City’s Circulation Element Street Classifications, Figure C-3, are based on a hierarchical network of
roadways that transition from regionally connected, wider, highest speed highways and Arterials to narrower,
lower speed Collectors entering the downtown area, and to the narrowest, lowest speed Local Streets, Alleys,
and Bike Paths in the neighborhoods. Considered the center area of the City and its major destination, the
intersection of SR-115 and Holt Avenue is controlled by a four-way stop and is intended to be reconfigured as
a Complete Street downtown economic hub, as depicted in Figure C-1. All other intersections in Holtville arc
either uncontrolled or controlled by a two-way stop signs.
The street sections in the City’s 2005 Standard Street Details and Specifications, as well as in Figures C-4
through C-6 below, provide cross section details for all standard and Complete Street classifications. Holtville's
roadway system is classified into the following categories and sub-categories based on context. Interrelated to
the Land Use Designations structure, these facilities are generally arranged in the following context-sensitive
manner: From wider and higher speed Edge Areas roadways; Transitioning to narrower and slower speed General
areas, and; Into the narrowest and slowest speed Center Areas roadways:
Edge Area Roadways:
        Arterial Street: Moves regional traffic between major traffic generators. 100’ - 84’ wide ROW
         o    Major Arterial: Assigned to regional thoroughfares, 4 - 6 lanes with divided median or turning

Performance Criteria
The performance of streets and roadways is typically measured by comparing the level of traffic to documented
standards for the type of street based on classification, number of lanes, and width. Imperial County has
developed standards for roadway capacity that are applicable to conditions in the City of Holtville. These
roadway performance standards are shown in Table C-1.

In traffic engineering methodology, roadway levels of service (LOS) are typically rated from LOS A to LOS F,
see Table C-2 LOS Definitions by Delay Time. LOS A indicates light traffic conditions, in which drivers have
a great deal of freedom to maneuver and little interference from other drivers. LOS F indicates a situation

where the traffic relying on a particular facility is beyond the capacity of the facility, with significant delays and
queues. A minimum performance standard of LOS C is considered to be consistent with the roadway
conditions in smaller cities and rural areas.

In general, traffic volumes of 15,000 vehicles per day (vpd) are considered acceptable for a three lane section
(two travel lanes with a center turn lane), while traffic volumes between 15,000 and 25,000 vpd are worth
analyzing, and over 25,000 vpd typically require 4 or 5 travel lanes. The AADT along SR 115 is 6,500. This
would suggest that the theoretical capacity of this corridor is three times higher than the current volume. As
volumes decrease, “road diets” can be used to reallocate underutilized vehicular lane area to other modes,
including facilities for cycling, walking, and transit. Other recommended improvements such as increased
connectivity, improved pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and better transit service will also reduce volumes.
While the transportation profession often evaluates “daily” volumes to size roadways, historically peak hour
volumes are also another consideration to determine the number of lanes. Daily volume thresholds are
developed from assumptions based on the percentage of traffic during the day in the peak hour. However,
sizing roadways based on one or two peak hours of the day may not be the best utilization of financial resources,
create the safest roadway for all roadway users, or allow for the most choices in mobility along the corridor.
There is a national trend in the reduction of vehicle miles travelled (VMT). Holtville is no exception. SR 115
has seen dramatic reductions in traffic since the installation of I-8 and has been said to be further declining
along the corridor. Even though these numbers are declining, reductions through other means are still required
to be able to reallocate vehicle space to other uses without adversely impacting vehicle level of service. Granted
the State of California is removing Level of Service as an environmental impact evaluation as part of the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions reductions in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is necessary. VMT are
associated with higher emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHG) and congestion. Therefore,
reduced VMT provide environmental, safety, and economic benefits. Reductions in VMT can be achieved
through smarter land use choices that reduce the need to drive, alternatives to driving such as public transit,
walking and biking, and pricing policies that discourage single-occupant vehicle trips. Higher density, mixed-
use, and transit-oriented development can all reduce the need for driving by providing access to destinations in
close proximity. A walkable, bike-able and transit-supported city, Holtville’s Complete Streets plan further
implements a reduction in VMT.
In 2008, California adopted Senate Bill (SB) 375, which directs the state’s 18 regional metropolitan planning
organizations (MPOs) to develop regional transportation plans that meet per capita GHG emission reduction

targets through the integration of transportation and land use planning. The reductions are to be achieved
through implementation of a sustainable communities’ strategy (SCS) developed as part of the regional
transportation plan. Targets have been set for 2020 and 2035. The state’s four largest MPOs and several smaller
MPOs have developed SCSs that show compliance with the targets.
The per capita GHG emission reduction targets for the state’s MPOs range from 1 percent increase to an 8
percent decrease by 2020 and 1 percent increase to a 16 percent decrease in 2035. Holtville’s Complete Streets
plan enables it to achieve these state reduction targets.
Future Roadway Conditions
Holtville's Service Area Plan states that all streets in the City are expected to meet or exceed LOS C performance
standard in the Year 2036. Therefore, the street system is expected to be adequate for Year 2036 conditions.
While the overall street system is expected to meet existing transportation performance standards for Year 2020
conditions, the following street improvements were recommended in the Service Area Plan:
        Installation of a traffic signal (if warranted) at the intersection of SR-115 and Holt Avenue.
        Provision of new collector and local streets to serve new development.
While traffic conditions beyond the Year 2036 are difficult to foresee, the next major roadway improvement
that is needed in the Holtville area is a new arterial Complete Street roadway running south of and parallel to
SR-115, as referenced in Holtville’s Complete Streets Plan.
Safe Drop-Off and Pick-Up Zones
Perhaps the greatest source of safety concerns and congestion within Holtville is in the immediate vicinity of
local schools in the early morning and afternoon hours. School children often have to compete with vehicles
to cross streets in order to get to, or leave from school, putting them at an undesirable level of risk. The City
has adopted a program to work with the Holtville Unified School District, the Police Department, and parents
to identify ways to reduce the risk to school children and relieve traffic around local schools by designating Safe
Drop-Off and Pick-Up Zones as well as other alternatives such as staggered class times so that the number of
children arriving at school and awaiting pick-up at any given time is reduced.
Holtville’s Complete Streets Plan has projects that addresses Safe Routes to School issues, which is a national
movement. The concept is to increase the number of children who walk or bicycle to school by funding
projects that remove the barriers that currently prevent them from doing so. Those barriers include lack of
infrastructure, unsafe infrastructure, lack of programs that promote walking and bicycling through
education/encouragement programs aimed at children, parents, and the community.
There are two separate Safe Routes to School Programs administered by Caltrans, one is State funded, SR2S,
and the other Federal, SRTS. Holtville is consistent with the goals and objectives of these programs.
Alternative Transportation
Promotion of alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, bicycling, and pedestrian circulation is
a key component of the Circulation Plan. Use of alternative modes of transportation produces a number of
benefits for the community including reduced traffic, need for costly roadway improvement projects, and less
impact to air quality.

Circulation Element
Transit
Imperial County Transit offers inter-city bus service with regular stops in Holtville, including ADA Para-transit
service that includes a lift equipped van to serve physically or mentally disabled residents. While not large or
dense enough to warrant a fixed right-of-way intra-city transit system, new transit technology is available via
car sharing networks and taxi cabs are providing services to citizens. While the City does not currently have an
intra-city public transit system, this will become an important consideration as the City develops and a necessity
when the City approaches build out of the planning area. As Holtville grows into the 21st Century, the City will
continue to cooperate with local and regional agencies and organizations to provide efficient, affordable, and
reliable transit.
Pedestrian Circulation Network
The pedestrian circulation network consists of sidewalks adjacent to City streets, as well as within parks. On
some streets, pedestrian usage is limited because of automobile circulation. These issues are being addressed in
City’s Complete Street Plan. All new developments are required to provide adequate sidewalks or other
pedestrian walkways to facilitate the movement of pedestrians around Holtville. A pedestrian loop is planned
in the Complete Street Plan, circumnavigating downtown via linking the local schools and parks along West
and East 5th Street and West and East 7th Street.
The framework of this network is based primarily on the Alamo River recreational trail, linking Van Der Linden
Field, Earl Walker County Park, and Holt Inter-Urban Railroad potential Rails-to-Trails facilities. In addition,
West 7th Street main connection between Holtville High School, Holtville Middle School, Emmett S. Finley
Elementary School, Mack Park and Holtville Recreational Park is another primary network connection. And,
Holt Avenue links Van Der Linden Field, Holt Park, City Library and Recreation Park form south to north.
Bikeway System
Bicycle riding is another effective and desirable alternative form of transportation that may become more
popular in the future. In the City, distances are reasonably short, and with the exception of the hot summer
months, bicycling is a feasible mode of transportation and should be encouraged. In 2016, the City adopted a
Bicycle Master Plan with its Complete Streets plan, originally adopted in 2001, that establishes a system of
designated bikeway paths within the planning area, which are depicted in Figure C-7.
The system consists of three different classes of bikeways. Class I bikeways are pathways that serve the exclusive
use of bicycles and pedestrians, whereas a Class II bikeways are typically bike lanes established within the paved
area of roadways through identifiable pavement striping or markings and signage. Class III bikeways are bike
routes intended to provide continuity to the bikeway system. Bike routes are established along through routes
not served by Class I or Class II bikeways, or to connect discontinuous segments of normal bike lanes. Class
III bikeways are shared facilities, either with motor vehicles on the street or with pedestrians on sidewalks. Class
IV bikeways are separate lanes and shown in Figures C-4-C6. The Protected Bikeways Act of 2014 (Assembly
Bill 1193) established Class IV Bikeways, also referred to as separated bikeways or cycle tracks. Holtville's
Bicycle Master Plan is consistent with the Imperial County and El Centro Bicycle Master Plans and provides
links to ensure continuity in the regional bicycle system. The City continues to update when necessary and
implement the Bicycle Master Plan.

Regional Circulation Improvements
Economic development and quality of life in Holtville is partially dependent upon efficient and safe movement
of people and goods within the Imperial Valley. Currently, Holtville is experiencing increased traffic along
Orchard Road and SR-115, within the City, due to the opening of the new Calexico East Port of Entry at the
U.S./Mexico border. In addition, the potential for expanding the Holtville Airstrip to accommodate
international air cargo could affect Holtville residents. Figure C-8 displays these proposed regional circulation
improvements.
State Route 115 Realignment
SR-115 is primarily a north south route that currently bisects the City of Holtville. The state highway is
important in facilitating interregional agricultural goods movement and also provides intraregional travel
between various cities in Imperial County.
The Calexico East Port of Entry (POE) between the United States and Mexico handles all of the commercial
and agricultural goods movement between Mexico and Imperial County. Caltrans and the Imperial County
Transportation Commission (ICTC) plan to connect the new POE to I-8, via a new state highway, SR-7.
However, currently there is no direct connection to the state highway system north of I-8 in this area.
The Circulation and Scenic Highway Element of the 2008 Imperial County Transportation Plan includes a plan
for a new four-lane north/south expressway connecting I-8 to Evan Hewes Highway/SR-115. If realignment
were not completed to ensure efficient access to SR-115 from SR-7, vehicles would continue to use Orchard
Road and SR-I 15, which traverses the City of Holtville along Fifth Street. Over the next several years, the City
could experience an increase of truck traffic, placing residents at increased risk of noise, air pollution, and
hazards associated with the increased traffic volume.
The City continues to coordinate with Caltrans and the ICTC to realign the State Route (SR) 115 to bypass
Holtville. The realignment of SR 115 will reduce transportation related noise and hazards on Fifth Street, as
well as provide a more efficient transportation system for the region.
Cargo Airport
The Southern California region has limited capacity to efficiently manage the distribution of worldwide goods
and without an additional cargo airport, will not be able to meet the region's projected need. The Holtville
Airstrip has been identified as a potential site for a new international cargo airport to meet this need. The site
has numerous benefits: 1) it minimizes capital expenditure and maximizes economic/financial feasibility; 2) the
timeline to expand/improve an existing facility would be significantly shorter than developing a new greenfield
site; and 3) it uses an existing airport already approved by the FAA. The City cooperates with efforts to
transform the Holtville Airstrip into an international cargo airport.

Circulation Element
Railways
The Union Pacific Railroad, formerly called the Southern Pacific Railroad, serves the Los Angeles area and
northward in California and the balance of the U.S. eastward. The former Holton Inter- Urban Railroad spur,
which connected Holtville to El Centro, is located within the Holtville planning area. Neither railway is currently
in operation and have been abandoned with its owners selling its right-of-way with the possibility of a rails-to-
trails program in long-term future. If new railways are developed within the planning area, the City will
cooperate with railway operators to ensure safety at grade crossings, land use compatibility along the proposed
rail lines, and ensure that existing development is protected from noise generated from railroad operations by
enforcing standards identified in the Noise Element. However, none are identified as this time.
Infrastructure Improvements
Water and sewer infrastructure and drainage facilities are often located within circulation system rights-of-way.
Therefore, the Circulation Plan evaluates the existing condition and capacity of these facilities, as well as future
demand that will occur with new development in the planning area to ensure that extension and improvement
of these facilities can occur in concert with scheduled and funded roadway construction and maintenance.
Water Service
Holtville's water system is owned and operated by the City. As of 2017, the City provided water to its customers
by means of approximately 1,500 service connections. The City operates one water treatment plant to produce
approximately 1.5 million gallons of potable water per day and maintains one elevated reservoir at the water
treatment plant to maintain water system pressure. The City's water supply comes from the Imperial Irrigation
District (IID), which imports water from the Colorado River via the All-American Canal and associated
facilities. The City maintains the three raw water storage ponds, which contain up to 11.3 million gallons of
water. At the water treatment plant, a 2.7 million gallons’ storage tank was constructed in 2010; a 1.5 million
gallons’ clear water tank was reconstructed in 2012. Together, the 4.2 million gallons of treated water storage
capacity provides substantial redundancy for fire and domestic flow requirements.
The City continues monitor the capacity of its water treatment and delivery facilities as necessary. In addition,
the City updates and works to identify funding sources to implement necessary improvements to existing water
delivery facilities. The City or project proponents are required to provide piping to new development and/or
pay fees to facilitate necessary expansion of water treatment and piping facilities where appropriate.
Sewer Services
The City of Holtville provides wastewater collection and treatment for the incorporated city and service to
adjacent unincorporated areas. The City’s sewer collection system, 94,800 feet of gravity and force sewer mains,
serves the majority of its residential, commercial, and industrial population base within the City limits. The
collection system is laid out along the City's established roadway grid with most of the collection lines located
in service alleys between the main south-to-north trending streets. The Barbara Worth Country Club (BWCC)
development maintains its own collection system and wastewater from the BWCC is treated by the City. A
wastewater rate study completed in 2012 estimates just under 2,000 residential and business connections to the
wastewater system (City of Holtville 2012c). The collection system also extends outside the City's boundary to
serve a small residential development within the City's sphere of influence.
The collection system generally flows by gravity to the northwest corner of the community and continues to
flow approximately three miles outside of the City limits to the wastewater treatment plant. The Holtville
Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), owned and operated by the City, and is located approximately 3 miles
northwest of city limits at 1250 Kamm Road on the Alamo River. The City owns and operates two wastewater
pumping stations (lift stations) within its collection system. A third wastewater pump station located within

the city’s SOI is owned and operated by the County of Imperial Public Works Department. The treated
effluent is discharged into the Pear Drain, a tributary of the Alamo River, which drains into the Salton Sea. The
WWTP’s current average flow is 0.56 mgd. The current permitted discharge flow is 0.85 mgd.
The Water/Waste Water Division staff conducts regular preventive maintenance and inspection of the
collection system. The entire system is inspected over a four-year period, with approximately 25 percent of the
system covered each year. And, since 2009, the WWTP has been operating under a Cease and Desist Order
(CDO) issued, at the City’s request, by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board-Colorado River
Basin Region (RWQCB) for violation of priority pollutant limits until such time as the City completes
improvements to the WWTP. The final design of the WWTP improvements was prepared in August 2013. The
improvement project, with a projected cost (in 2015) of $15 million, was certified by the Border Environmental
Cooperation Commission (BECC) on Feb. 24, 2014. The project is sponsored by the City of Holtville and
funded by a combination of loans and grants from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, the North American
Development Bank-Border Water Infrastructure Program, and the City of Holtville. The City Council awarded
a contract for the improvements on July 13, 2015 and the project is scheduled to be completed by 2017.
The City continues to identify funding sources to implement sewer facilities improvements identified in the
2017 Service Area Plan. In addition, the City or project proponents are required to provide sewer piping
facilities to service new development and/or pay fees to facilitate improvement of the City's sewer facilities.
Storm Drainage Facilities
On a regional level, Hoover Dam and several other dams, including Imperial Dam have been built along the
Colorado River to provide an effective and efficient flood management water storage system. On a local level,
within the City, the majority of Holtville’s runoff from rainfall is captured in street gutters and conducted
through a network of open and enclosed concrete or earthen channels to be discharged into the Alamo River.
These drainage facilities are located both partially underground and above ground.
The main east-west drainage channels in the city are owned and operated by the IID. This drainage system is
located within IID easements and was originally intended and designed for the purpose of draining adjacent
farmlands. The City and the IID generally require developers of property adjacent to existing open drainage
facilities to place them underground as new development occurs. Private stormwater detention systems were
constructed in association with private development and are privately maintained.
Flood-prone areas are in a wide band on either side of the Alamo River and in the eastern portion of the
city. Most of the potential flood areas around the Alamo River are designated for open space park uses;
however, new development could potentially be located within a flood plain susceptible to a 100 -year
flood event. To qualify for federal flood insurance, the City must identify flood hazard areas an d
implement a system of protective controls. Holtville is in the process of studying the feasibility of
participating in the National Flood Insurance Program, which is administered by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). The program provides federal flood insurance and federally financed loans
for property owners in flood-prone areas.
The City maintains and improves all drainage and flood control facilities to be sure that they function as
required. In addition, on a project-by-project basis, the City continues to mitigate or disallow new development
that causes the City's drainage system to exceed design capacity, unless mitigation steps are implemented by the
developer. The City, as described in the Safety Element, continues to identify and evaluate hazardous flood
locations and inform the public and developers proposing projects within these areas. In addition, in
coordination with emergency service providers and the Holtville Unified School District, the City promotes
programs that educate the public about flood hazards and methods to reduce the risk of flood losses.

Beautification Program and Gateways
Travel along City roadways is typically the first experience a visitor to Holtville has with the community. For
this reason, City gateway entrances, roadways, alleys, and medians should be well designed, maintained, and
landscaped. In the Complete Streets Plan, a ceremonial entrance gateway projects have been identified at key
entry points into the City, see Figure C-9. To ensure improved quality of life for Holtville residents and a
positive impression and perception among visitors, the City has adopted a roadway beautification program with
the following objectives:
          Establish attractive and inviting gateway entrances to the City in order to form the basis for positive
           impressions and perceptions of the community;
          Coordinate public/private partnerships to create entrances to local businesses and residential
           developments that announce arrival and set a tone for the part of the City that they introduce;
          Pave and maintain all City alleyways; and
          Develop and implement a landscaping program that includes tree planting on medians and sidewalks
           of prominent community roadways.

Conservation/Open Space Element
CONSERV ATION/OPEN SP ACE ELEMENT
Introduction
Holtville is surrounded by fertile agricultural land. In addition, there are several parks and open spaces, as well
as numerous community and historical resources important to residents of Holtville. The Conservation/Open
Space Element focuses on the protection and enhancement of these agricultural, open space, and natural and
historic resources to ensure a high quality living environment in Holtville.
Purpose of the Conservation/Open Space Element
The Holtville Conservation/Open Space Element meets the State requirements for Conservation and Open
Space Elements as defined in Sections 65302(d) and 6530l(c) of the Government Code. According to these
requirements, the Conservation Element must contain goals and policies to protect and maintain natural
resources such as water, soils, wildlife, and minerals, and prevent wasteful resource exploitation, degradation,
and destruction. The Open Space Element must contain goals and policies to manage open space areas,
including undeveloped lands and outdoor recreation areas. Specifically, the Open Space Element must address
several open space categories such as those used for the preservation of natural resources and managed
production of resources, as well as open space maintained for public health and safety reasons. This last category
of open space is addressed in the Safety Element. Additionally, while air quality is not a state-mandated element,
air quality is included in the Conservation/Open Space Element to address reducing emissions and pollutant
levels through stationary source, mobile source, transportation and land use control, and energy conservation
measures. Because the subjects required to be addressed under the Conservation Element and Open Space
Element overlap substantially, the two elements have been combined for this Plan.
Scope and Content of the Conservation/Open Space Element
The Conservation/Open Space Element expresses community goals to protect environmental and historic
resources and open space. Resources addressed in this element include: a) natural resources and open space; b)
agricultural and soils conservation; c) parks and recreation; d) community and historic resources; e) water supply
and quality; f) air quality; g) energy conservation; and h) waste disposal and recycling.
Related Plans and Programs
There are a number of existing plans and programs that directly relate to the Conservation/Open Space
Element. These plans and programs have been enacted through federal, State and local action, and are
administered by agencies and special districts. Federal laws pertaining to the protection of significant resources
include the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the National Environmental Policy Act. Other related plans
and programs are described below.
Federal Endangered Species Act
The Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA), administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, applies to
federally listed species and habitat occupied by federally listed species. Federally listed species are most likely to
occur within riparian habitat areas in the City’s floodplains. ESA Section 9 forbids specified acts that directly
or indirectly harm listed species. Section 9 also prohibits "taking" any species of wildlife or fish listed as
endangered. These restrictions apply to all federal agencies and all person’s subject to United States jurisdiction.
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and California Department of Fish and Game
Both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and California Department of Fish and Game have regulations to
protect wildlife resources. Special permits are required for the alteration, dredging, or any activity in a lake or
stream, as well as other activities that may affect fish and game habitat. Both agencies also regulate impacts to

sensitive plant and animal species as described above. Future development in Holtville that has the potential to
affect wildlife habitat will be subject to the regulations of both of these federal and State agencies.
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
Under the NPDES storm water permit issued to the City of Holtville, all development and significant infill
development must be implemented with runoff pollution control measures known as Best Management
Practices (BMPs). Proposed development projects (both public and private) within Holtville must incorporate
structural and non-structural BMPs to preclude significant water quality impact from non-point source
pollutants.
California Environmental Quality Act
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by the state legislature in response to a public
mandate for thorough environmental analysis of projects impacting the environment. The provisions of the
law and environmental review procedures are described in the CEQA statutes and CEQA Guidelines updated
in 2016. CEQA will continue to be instrumental in ensuring that the environmental impacts associated with
local development projects are appropriately assessed and mitigated.
California Endangered Species Act
The California Endangered Species Act (CESA) generally parallels the main provisions of the Federal
Endangered Species Act and is administered by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). CESA
prohibits the "taking" of listed species except as otherwise provided in State law. Any future development or
infill development in Holtville that has the potential to affect wildlife will be subject to the restrictions contained
in the CESA.
Mills Act
The Mills Act is a California State law allowing cities to enter into agreements with the owners of historic
structures to encourage preservation of historic resources. Such agreements involve the City entering into a
contract with a property owner to change how the County Assessor calculates taxes on their property in
exchange for the continued preservation of the property by the property owner. The adjusted property taxes
are recalculated using a formula in the Mills Act and Revenue and Taxation Code.
Regional Transportation Plan and Improvement Program
The Southern California Association of Governments has adopted a Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and
a Regional Transportation Improvement Program to implement the projects and programs listed in the RTP.
These plans work together to help improve vehicular traffic within the region and thereby reduce air pollution.
SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is the regional association of governments for
a seven county area, including Imperial County. As a regional government, SCAG has prepared a Regional
Comprehensive Plan and Guide that responds directly to federal and state planning requirements. The Plan
constitutes the base on which local governments ensure consistency of their plans with applicable regional plans
under CEQA. The SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide includes a number of core, ancillary, and
bridge chapters that address regional issues such as: growth management, regional transportation, air quality,
hazardous waste management, water quality, housing, open space and conservation, water resources, energy,
and integrated solid waste management. The Conservation/Open Space Element is consistent with land use
policies found in the SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide.

SCAG Growth Management Plan
The SCAG Growth Management Plan recommends methods to direct regional growth to minimize traffic
congestion and better protect environmental quality. While SCAG has no authority to mandate implementation
of its Growth Management Plan, principal goals have implications for the land use composition of Holtville.
The SCAG goals are generally reflected throughout all of the General Plan elements, including the
Conservation/Open Space Element.
County of Imperial General Plan
The Agricultural Element of the Imperial County General Plan emphasizes the importance of the agricultural
industry to the County’s economic health and stability. The Element identifies existing agricultural resources
and opportunities for conservation of farmland.
Alamo River Wetlands Project
The goal of the Alamo River Wetlands Project is to reduce the amount of pollutants that reach the Salton Sea
via the Alamo River. The Alamo River acquires nutrients and heavy metals from sewage, and nutrients, silt,
selenium and pesticides from agricultural drainage. Development is under way of the 31-acre wetlands complex
located on the Alamo River east of State Route (SR) 115 on unincorporated land owned by the City. The project
is sponsored by the Salton Sea Authority with development impact fees, with state and federal grant funding
estimated in 2012 at $2,852,000.
The total water surface area at this site would be 13.4 acres, which would hold 77.6 acre–feet of water and
would have a maximum design flow rate of 6 cubic feet per second. The wetland would provide significant
improvement to the visual quality of the area which is in close proximity to the City. The wetland would be an
important step in improving the quality of water flowing in the Alamo River, a principal tributary to the Salton
Sea, it would have research value, and it would provide new habitat in the Salton Basin.
City of Holtville Zoning Ordinance
The Zoning Ordinance is the primary implementation tool for maintaining open space identified in the Land
Use and Conservation/Open Space Elements. Together, the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map identify
specific types of land use, intensity of use, and development and performance standards applicable to specific
areas and parcels of land within the City.
City of Holtville Service Area Plan
The Service Area Plan (SAP) outlines the city’s existing public services and facilities, estimates the current and
future anticipated demand for such facilities and services, and describes how necessary facilities and services
will or may be developed and extended to meet demands. The SAP is intended to demonstrate the City’s intent
and ability to provide adequate services to the SOI boundaries at the time of annexation. An approximate 20-
year planning horizon is used to forecast growth, and the estimated demands and provision to meet demands
are based on population projections for the year 2035.
The 2017 SAP identifies the existing and projected demand for public facilities and services within the
respective service areas of the public agencies. SAPs are required whenever an agency proposes a revision of
its service area, its sphere of influence (SOI) boundaries, or land uses within the SOI. The SAP shall therefore
discuss the means and financing for extending facilities and/or services into areas proposed to be annexed to
the agency within the time frame of the analysis. The SAP also includes sections on financing, including a
discussion of the financial resources available to the City, and on governance and management, which discusses
the City’s authority and scope of governance, and describes its governance structure and principles.

Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Land Use Element provides a planned land use pattern with the following general land use designation
categories: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Community Facilities. The more specific Public - Parks and
Other Governmental designations are applied to public and private land that is intended for conservation, open
space, and recreational uses. These designations apply to areas that have recreational value and/or public safety
concerns, such as flood control basins. The Safety Element relates to the Conservation/Open Space Element
in that it identifies hazard-prone areas such as flood prone areas that would require mitigation prior to allowing

Conservation/Open Space Element
Issues, goals, and policies
Holtville contains valuable resources that include agricultural land, wetlands, historic resources, and water
supply. Conservation and enhancement of these assets can be accomplished by addressing certain issues
affecting the City. Holtville’s inherently walkable, bikable, and transit supported mobility choices built within
its development pattern provide reduces air pollution and energy consumption rates by conserving resources
and open space. Seven major issues are addressed by the goals, policies, plan, and implementation program in
the Conservation/Open Space Element. These major issues include: 1) natural resources and open space; 2)
agricultural resources; 3) parks and recreation; 4) water supply and quality; 5) air quality; 6) energy; 7) waste
disposal and recycling, and; 8) high-performance sustainability facilities. Each issue and the related goals and
policies are included in this section of the Conservation/Open Space Element.
Natural Resources and Open Space
Natural and cultural resources located in or adjacent to Holtville include the Alamo River Corridor, historic
and archaeological sites, and geothermal resources, which provide aesthetic, social, economic, or other benefits
to the community. To preserve these resources for future generations and preserve the quality of life in the
community, these important resources need to be properly managed and protected. A Conservation Easement
Area is comprised of privately owned land whose land owner can devote the land’s rights for a purpose of
conservation while retaining ownership of the remainder of the rights. In ceding a right, the landowner "eases"
it to another entity, such as the City Parks and Recreation Department, community land bank, or land trust.
Conservation/
Open Space Goal 1:         Promote the conservation of natural, historic, cultural, and open space resources so
                           that existing and future residents can continue to enjoy the many benefits of these
                           resources.
Policy 1.1:                Cooperate with regional, State, and federal agencies to enhance, preserve, and protect
                           the Alamo River corridor as a primary open space, recreational, and conservation area.
Policy 1.2:                Protect important natural resources in accordance with local, state, and federal
                           resource protection regulations and programs.
Policy 1.3:                Complete the 31-acre wetlands complex located on the Alamo River east of State
                           Route (SR) 115 on unincorporated land owned by the City.
Policy 1.4:                Support the development and production of regional geothermal resources.
Policy 1.5:                Identify, maintain, and protect places of unique historic and archaeological value.
Policy 1.6:                Discourage development of areas that are subject to natural hazards.
Policy 1.7:                Utilize natural resources and open spaces to provide more sustainable approaches to
                           site and regional water resource management techniques.
Policy 1.8:                Identify a Conservation Easement Area to conserve the native habitat of sensitive
                           plants and animals through the continued dedication of open space easements, or
                           other means. The Conservation Easement Area is comprised of open space
                           easements, identified in land owners deeds, and are intended to reduce potential
                           indirect impacts to sensitive biological resources that may result from recreational or
                           other human activities.

Agricultural Resources
Imperial Valley is one of the world's most agriculturally productive regions. The economic base of the County
and Holtville is tied primarily to that productivity. Much of the farmland surrounding the City is considered
Prime Farmland, among the highest quality in the County, see Figure COS-3 Important Farmland. Because of
the economic, social, historic, and visual benefits of the surrounding farmland, this important resource must be
protected and well-managed for its vital importance to Holtville.
Conservation/
Open Space Goal 2:        Protect agricultural resources for their numerous benefits to the community and the
                          region.

                          gardens/farms, that minimize the incompatibility of agricultural activities with urban
                          development.
Policy 2.4:               Maintain buffers between agricultural production and urban development.
Policy 2.5:               Promote infill and higher density development within the City limits to minimize
                          expansion into surrounding farmland that would conflict with existing and future
                          residential development.
Policy 2.6:               Direct urbanization toward vacant lands that are not located adjacent to prime
                          agricultural lands or into agricultural areas that are of lower quality.
Parks and Recreation
The primary recreational open space for the City is currently provided by City-owned, operated, and managed
parks, as well as parks located on schools maintained by the Holtville Unified School District. These parks
provide valuable recreational opportunities and are gathering spaces for the community. Maintenance of these
parks and tying them into the regional parks and trails system are important responsibilities for the City.
Conservation/
Open Space Goal 3:        Provide and maintain a variety of parks and recreational opportunities for all segments
                          of the community.
Policy 3.1:               Ensure that new development provides additional parkland and recreation
                          opportunities.
Policy 3.2:               Protect, preserve, and maintain Holt Park, Explorer Park, Holtville Skate Park, Earl
                          Walker Park, Samaha Park, and Mack Park as public open space dedicated primarily
                          for recreational uses.
Policy 3.3:               Coordinate with other local and regional agencies to provide, maintain and improve
                          parkland, trails, and recreational opportunities in Holtville.

                            and Alamo river access,
Water Supply and Quality
A safe and adequate water supply is essential to Holtville's urban and agricultural activities. To protect the
public safety, and the economic viability of the community, the supply and quality of the City's water resources
need to be properly managed and protected.
Conservation/
Open Space Goal 4:          Conserve and protect water resources to ensure the economic viability of the
                            community.
Policy 4.1:                 Support and protect priority water supply rights for agricultural and municipal uses
                            within Imperial Valley.

                            and improvement of the water quality and quantity from the Colorado River.
Policy 4.3:                 Promote water conservation by encouraging the use of reclaimed water, promoting
                            the use of water efficient landscaping and requiring development to utilize water
                            conservation measures.
Policy 4.4:                 Ensure the quality of waste water going from Holtville’s Treatment Facility meets all
                            treatment standards.
Policy 4.5:                 Implement a program to identify and cap all artesian wells within the planning area to
                            prevent them from limiting wastewater treatment capacity and degrading water
                            quality.
Air Quality
Holtville is located in the Salton Sea Air Basin. Air quality in this basin does not presently meet state and federal
standards. Cooperation among all agencies in the basin is necessary to achieve desired improvements to air
quality. Holtville can participate and contribute its share in those efforts by proper planning for land use,
transportation, and energy use.
Conservation/
Open Space Goal 5:          Protect and improve air quality in the Salton Sea Air Basin.
Policy 5.1:                 Cooperate with the Southern California Association of Governments, the Air

Policy 5.4:                Cooperate with agricultural users to identify ways to reduce air quality impacts
                           associated with dust and pesticides.
Energy
Holtville is located within a hot, arid climatic region. Summer months’ experience heat and high humidity, while
winter months are cool and dry. Both heating and cooling are essential for a comfortable living environment.
Many of Holtville’s single-family detached homes are relatively old and do not have proper insulation, leading
to inefficient use of energy and increased energy costs. Future infill attached buildings are more energy efficient
than detached buildings and will result in a less of an increase in demand for energy used for the operation of
businesses, homes, and automobiles than new development with City services extended. In addition, to reduce
pollution and ensure that there are energy sources for future generations, conservation methods need to be
implemented.
Conservation/
Open Space Goal 6:         Promote energy conservation and efficiency.
Policy 6.1:                Encourage the implementation and use of renewal energy resources, such as
                           geothermal, solar, and wind.
Policy 6.2:                Inventory areas available for the management or utilization of natural resources, such
                           as wind energy generation, hydroelectric power, geothermal power, and large-scale
                           solar power.
Policy 6.3:                Inventory energy conservation opportunities, including transportation economies,
                           land use patterns, and residential, commercial, and industrial conservation programs.
Policy 6.4:                Promote the incorporation of energy conserving buildings in new infill development.
Policy 6.5:                Promote weatherization and rehabilitation activities that will help existing projects
                           meet minimum energy conservation requirements.
Policy 6.6:                Educate residents and business owners about opportunities to conserve energy in
                           their homes and businesses.
Policy 6.7:                Promote energy efficiency and clean energy projects that include low-income
                           weatherization, wind generated, and solar programs.
Waste Disposal and Recycling
The City of Holtville does not maintain any solid waste facilities, vehicles, or equipment. Collection and hauling
services are contracted to a private entity, CR&R Environmental Services Inc., which transports Holtville’s
solid waste to a regional solid waste facility. Holtville residents and businesses are provided three separate refuse
containers for regular trash, recyclables, and green waste. Recycling is important in order to conserve natural
resources and limit the impacts to landfill capacity. City residents and businesses carry the full cost of solid
waste collection and disposal services through a monthly fee. Regional services are provided by the Imperial
Valley Resource Management Agency (IVRMA), a joint powers authority formed in 2000 to divert solid and
hazardous waste generated within the Imperial Valley in accordance with AB 939
Conservation/
Open Space Goal 7:         Work effectively with IVRMA to ensure an adequate level of service for solid waste
                           disposal and reduction of solid waste through recycling in Holtville.

Conservation/Open Space Plan
Holtville's history is linked to the agricultural industry. The City has several buildings and structures that serve
as important symbols of the community's culture and heritage. In addition, the open space areas along the
Alamo River Corridor are important recreational and biological resource areas. The Conservation/Open Space
Plan establishes an approach for the balanced use, management, and conservation of these unique resources.
The six conservation and open space issue areas identified in the Issues, Goals and Policies section are the
focus of this Plan. The related goals and policies are the basis of the Plan and are supported by approaches to
protect and enhance natural resources. The Conservation/Open Space Implementation Program is an
extension of this Plan and contains specific programs to achieve the City’s goals related to conservation and
open space.
Natural Resources
The conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources is the history of Holtville. The prevention,
control and correction of the erosion of soils is of great importance. This element identifies the City’s natural
resources, including the sustainability of its natural soils and agricultural land systems. The location, extent of
different types of soils are identified in Figure COS-2. And, the types of farmland soils, include Prime
Farmland, are identified in Figure COS-3.
Due to the high level of urbanization and agricultural activities in Holtville, there are few areas of native
vegetation and sensitive biological resources remaining. The remaining "natural areas" exist mostly along the
Alamo River Corridor, irrigation canal rights-of-way, and other lowland areas that potentially support riparian
vegetation. This habitat may be used by a variety of wildlife species for food, water, escape cover, nesting,
migration and dispersal corridors, and thermal cover.
The greatest potential for sensitive habitat and other biological resources exists along the Alamo River.
However, the Alamo River acquires nutrient and heavy metals from sewage and nutrients, silt, selenium, and
pesticides from agricultural drainage. As shown in Figure COS-4, these areas have been preserved as Open
Space by the City. Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and associated State and
federal regulations, the City continues to assess development proposals for potential impacts to significant
natural resources and habitat.

Agricultural Resources
Imperial Valley is and has been the center of one of the world's most agriculturally productive regions. The
economic base of the Valley has historically developed through agriculture industry and continues to be tied to
this productivity. In Holtville, most of the commercial and industrial activity has been related to agriculture and
agricultural services (e.g. processing, packing, equipment sales and service, etc.).
The City recognizes the many inherent benefits of maintaining agricultural land uses. Agriculture provides a
variety of job opportunities, helps preserve the community's rural character, and maintains visual open space.
Therefore, the City feels that the viability of the agricultural industry should be preserved. Even as industrial
and other developments become increasingly important to the local economy, the conservation and protection
of farm lands is of vital interest to the general welfare of the public and future generations.
While land within the Holtville's existing city limits is primarily comprised of urban and built-up areas, the
planning area and is comprised of mostly Prime Farmland or Farmland of Statewide importance.
Agricultural land surrounding the City is undoubtedly subject to development pressures and conflicts in land
uses. As urban development approaches these areas, land value increases, resulting in higher tax assessments.
Adjacent urbanization affects the quality of farm lands requiring greater costs to maintain prime production.
The City also encourages the preservation of these farmlands of importance by implementing policies in the
Land Use Element to direct and control growth. While agricultural lands within the planning area will eventually
be converted to urban use. Furthermore, the eventual conversion of these lands can be delayed by locating new
urban development adjacent to and within existing City boundaries; avoiding ‘greenfield’ development into
agricultural lands; and using existing urbanized land more efficiently through infill, higher density development,
and revitalization of existing urban areas.

Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Types
City owned, operated, and managed parks provide 13.96 acres of recreational open space for Holtville residents.
These parks include: Holt Park, Ralph Samaha Park, and Mack Park. In addition to these parks, the Holtville
Unified School District owns and operates several local parks that are frequently used by Holtville residents
during non-school hours. Holtville's Parks, Recreation, and Open Space system is classified into the following
categories and sub-categories based on context, see Figure COS-1. Interrelated to the Land Use Element
Designations and Circulation Element Roadway Network Types structure, these facilities are arranged in the
following context-sensitive manner: From more natural and rural open spaces in the Edge Areas recreational
areas and trails; Transitioning to more formal ball fields and recreational sport facilities General areas, and; In the
most formal, ceremonial space City square and plazas in the Center Area.
Edge Area Parks:
Earl Walker Park: (under construction) Located adjacent to Earl Hewes Highway, between the highway and
the Alamo River. Previously a County park, the City Council acquired the 40-acre site in 2008. Currently, it is
used as an open space park in association with the Alamo River Trail which connects the site to the Explorer
Skate Park to the northeast.
Alamo River Recreational Trail – A recently completed one-half mile hiking trail along the Alamo River,
known as the Pete Mellinger Alamo River Trail. The City designates the land along the river as open space,
see Figure COS-4. When these areas are annexed to the City, an Alamo River Corridor Master Plan will be
prepared.
Holtville Wetlands – Development is under way of the 31-acre wetlands complex located on the Alamo River
east of State Route (SR) 115 on unincorporated land owned by the City. The project is sponsored by the Salton
Sea Authority with state and federal grant funding.
General Area Parks:
Mack Park: This Park is located north of 7th Street, east of the middle school and consists of approximately
5.7 acres. The park serves both as a recreational family park and a sports arena park, primarily for baseball
games.
Explorer Park – Located south of 4th Street between Cedar Avenue and Holt Avenue along the Alamo River.
The park is approximately one-half acres.
Holtville Skate Park – Located adjacent to Explorer Park. The park consists of a 10,000-square-foot skate
park.
In addition to the developed parks and open space, the Holtville Unified School District owns and operates
playgrounds and ballfields that are frequently available for use by Holtville residents during non-school hours.
Central Area Parks:
Holt Park: This Park is located at the center of the City and consists of 4.13 acres encompassing one full city
block to form a traditional Square. The park site is also the location of City Hall and the Fire Department. It is
a well maintained, spacious, and centrally located park used for a variety of functions, such as ceremonial
events and celebrations. It is the City’s most urban park type.
Ralph Samalta Park: This Park is located between 6th and 7th Streets, east of Holtville Avenue. Adjacent to
this open space park is a City pool and City library. The park consists of 4.13 acres and comprises
approximately 70 percent of a city block. The primary function of this park is to allow for active sporting
activities such as soccer, baseball, and football.

Water Supply and Water Quality
The Imperial Irrigation District (IID) supplies water to Holtville from the Colorado River via the canals and
facilities of the Imperial Irrigation District (IID). According to the IID, Imperial Valley’s agricultural industry
is estimated to use 98 percent of the region's water supply. The City owns and operates a water treatment plant
that provides clarification, filtration, and disinfection of water from the Colorado River.
Although Colorado River water is generally of good quality, the amount of dissolved solids (primarily salt) is
very high. The City has little control over the quality of the water supplied to it, since the quality is primarily
determined by land uses located along the Colorado River outside the State of California.
California has consistently exceeded its yearly allocation of 4.4 million acre feet from the Colorado River by
20 percent over the past several years. Although the long-term supply of water to Holtville is fairly well
protected by various laws and agreements over rights to the Colorado River, the State's overdraft potentially
jeopardizes this long-term supply. As a result of California consistently exceeding this allotment, the IID has
initiated many water conservation programs in Imperial County and participated in various programs in
cooperation with governmental agencies.
In 1988, a Water Conservation Agreement was forged between the IID and the Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California (MWD). The agreement provides for the implementation of water conservation projects,
which are funded by the MWD. In return, MWD is eligible to divert additional water that is equivalent to the
amount of water conserved. The water conservation projects implemented through the agreement primarily
focus on increasing the efficiency of the IID’s water conveyance system and conserving water in agricultural
operations.
More recently, the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) has entered into negotiations with the San Diego County
Water Authority (SDCWA) for the transfer of conserved water from the Imperial Valley to the San Diego
region. Under the proposed water transfer, IID and its agricultural customers will conserve water and sell it to
the SDCWA for at least 45 years. In addition, the SDCWA will pay the costs of conserving water incurred to
Imperial Valley farmers plus an incentive to encourage participation. The numerous negative impacts on the
Salton Sea related to the transfer and concerns about the potential impact to the local economy must be
mitigated as part of any potential agreement.
Due to the pollutants carried by the Alamo River increase the degradation of the Salton Sea, a portion of
wetlands located to the east of SR-115 and north of Zenos Road is being restored as the Alamo River Wetlands
Project. The intent is to reduce pollutants and improve quality of water discharged from the Alamo. As shown
in Figure COS-4, these areas have been preserved as Open Space by the City.
Sustaining a reliable supply of water to Holtville in the long run is an important concern. Although California
has a guaranteed priority use of the Colorado River water, there will not be enough water to serve the needs of
the projected population growth and development within California and the adjoining states in the future. While
it appears that law protects the long-term supply, and that water resources are presently abundant, the future
climatic and population growth factors affecting water use are unpredictable.
The City of Holtville promotes water conservation by residents, businesses, agriculture, and government to
reduce overall demand for water in accordance with California's "4.4 Plan"; an ongoing effort to reduce the
State’s use of Colorado River water to 4.4 million acre-feet per year, California’s entitled amount. Additionally,
the City coordinates water quality and supply programs with responsible water agencies.
In addition to maintaining an adequate supply of water, the City of Holtville reduces pollutants in urban runoff
to improve water quality through participation in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) program. According to the City’s NPDES permit, all new development projects and substantial

rehabilitation projects are required to incorporate Best Management Practices (BMPs). Implementation of
BMPs will enhance surface and ground water quality in the planning area. Additionally, the City has
implemented a program to identify funding for, and make improvements to the City's wastewater treatment
plant that are necessary for the plant to become compliant with its NPDES permit.
Another factor impacting local water quality and the capacity of the wastewater treatment facility is the presence
of numerous free flowing artesian wells within the planning area, which now flow into the wastewater treatment
plant. The City has implemented a program to identify and cap or divert the flow of these artesian wells. Once
located, the City will map these wells and periodically evaluate progress toward capping or diverting them so
that they do not reduce water quality or wastewater treatment capacity.
Air Quality
Holtville is located within the Salton Sea Air Basin (see Figure COS-5), which covers all of Imperial County
and parts of western Riverside County. The air basin is a non-attainment area for the State Ambient Air Quality
Standards for ozone and inhalable particulate matter (PM).
Particulate matter is a major air pollutant consisting of tiny solid or liquid particles of soot, dust, smoke, fumes,
or mists. The size of the particles (10 microns or smaller) allows them to enter the air sacs deep in the lungs
where they may be deposited, resulting in adverse health effects. PM also causes visibility reduction. Particulate
matter is generated by wind blowing dry soils, particularly during the late fall, and during dust storms of winter
and early spring. Agricultural burning and cultivation practices contribute most of the airborne dust in the
Holtville area. Some agricultural practices that generate dust are regulated, including: leaving cultivated fields
vacant and open to blowing winds, burning of crop residues to clear fields for new cultivation, and crop dusting
for fertilization and pest control.
Since agriculture contributes to the air quality issues in the region, the majority of the Imperial Valley Air
Pollution Control District regulations relate to control of agricultural operations to reduce air pollution. In an
effort to reduce dust and particulate matter levels, the City supports the Imperial County Air Pollution
District(APCD) in the implementation of its regulations to control agricultural operations and works closely
with the APCD to mitigate environmental concerns.
Because the population and average density of development are very low, there is comparatively little air
pollution from vehicular activity in the Holtville Area. In order to keep the low levels of air pollutants generated
from vehicles in the future, the City integrates air quality planning with land use and transportation planning.
Future geothermal energy production in Imperial County may generate a significant amount of air pollutants.
The non-condensable gases that could be emitted from cooling towers would be primarily carbon dioxide, but
could include hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia, methane, and hydrogen. Dissolved in
precipitation, these products are highly corrosive to living tissue and to exposed metals and common surface
coatings such as paints and plastics.
In order to protect the air quality in the Imperial Valley, the City continues to cooperate with the Imperial
Valley Air Pollution Control District and Southern California Association of Governments in their efforts to
implement the regional Air Quality Management Plan.

Energy
Energy requirements and pollutants associated with the generation of energy can be reduced through innovative
architectural design, building construction, structural orientation, and landscaping. The City recommends the
following methods be used to help create sustainable buildings that consume less fossil fuel:
         Optimize building siting and orientation to take advantage of shading provided by natural vegetation,
          reduce summer heat gain, provide shelter from winter winds, and capture summer breezes;
         Design buildings to optimize natural lighting, provide for task lighting, and specify high- efficiency
          electric lighting; and
         Encourage private and public projects to exceed Title 24 standards.
The relationship between project design and future energy requirements are considered when reviewing
proposals for new development. The City promotes energy conservation by implementing State Title 24 energy
performance requirements through building codes.
The Imperial Valley contains natural geothermal resources that can be used to generate moderate amounts of
electricity and is one alternative to fossil fuel electricity generation. Thermal water of sufficient temperature for
direct heat application underlies the Salton Trough at shallow depths. Distributed throughout the Trough are
areas of hotter fluids suitable for electrical generation. The City supports the development and production of
regional geothermal resources.
Waste Disposal and Recycling
The City of Holtville does not maintain any solid waste facilities, vehicles, or equipment. Collection and hauling
services are contracted to a private entity, CR&R Environmental Services Inc., which transports Holtville’s
solid waste to a regional solid waste facility. The nearest facility is the Holtville Solid Waste Site at 2678 Whitlock
Road, north of Norrish Road. CR&R also operates its own recycling facility in El Centro. Holtville residents
and businesses are provided three separate refuse containers for regular trash, recyclables, and green waste.
It is City policy to comply with the state’s Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939) to reduce waste
going to the landfill. This General Plan identifies the need to encourage the recycling of waste resources through
membership with Imperial County and its seven cities in the Imperial Valley Resource Management Agency
(IVRMA), a joint powers authority formed in 2000 to divert solid and hazardous waste generated within the
Imperial Valley in accordance with AB 939. The policy of the IVRMA and its member agencies is to maintain
and/or increase the county’s diversion rate from landfill sites to 50 percent of the total solid waste stream as
mandated by AB 939.
New residential and nonresidential development through the year 2035 will generate a proportional increase
in solid waste and demand for collection and hauling services with City residents and businesses carry the full
cost of solid waste collection and disposal services through a monthly fee. The fee is established by contract
between the City and CR&R. CR&R is expected to be able to accommodate the growth in demand for
collection services resulting from development under the Land Use Element, including the SOI, by adding
services to meet the additional demand.

S AFETY
Introduction
A safe community is an essential component of Holtville's vision for the future. Quality of life for Holtville
residents is affected by community members' sense of security. In order to provide a safe and enjoyable
environment for residents, the issues of crime, violence, and other human caused hazards must be addressed
and a response plan prepared in the event of uncontrollable hazards. In addition, SB 379 Safety Element and
Adaptation went into effect in 2015 to address climate adaptation and resiliency strategies. The Safety Element
establishes goals, policies, and a plan to ensure that there is an adequate, coordinated, and expedient response
to public safety concerns. New techniques to be incorporated include partnership in Imperial County’s Multi-
Jurisdiction Hazard Mitigation Plan (MHMP), resiliency techniques, green stormwater infrastructure, bio-
swales, and infiltration basins.
Purpose of the Safety Element
The purpose of the Safety Element is to identify and address those features or characteristics existing in or near
Holtville that represent a potential hazard to the community's citizens, sites, structures, public facilities,
infrastructure, and wildlife for areas along the Alamo River. The Safety Element establishes policies to minimize
the danger to residents, workers, and visitors, while identifying actions needed to manage crisis situations such
as earthquakes, fires, and floods. The Element also focuses on preventing criminal activity and violence before
they occur. Additionally, the Safety Element contains specific policies and programs to regulate existing and
proposed development in hazard- prone areas. Continuing education of City officials and citizens about
emergency preparedness is also addressed.
Scope and Content of the Safety Element
The Safely Element satisfies the requirements of state planning law and is a mandated component of the
General Plan. Government Code section 65302(g) sets forth a list of hazards that the Element must cover, if
they pertain to conditions in the City. These hazards are:
        Seismically induced conditions including ground shaking, surface rupture, ground failure, and seiches;
        Slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides;
        Subsidence and other geologic hazards;
        Flooding;
        Wildlife Hazards
        Wildland and urban fires; and
        Evacuation routes.
State law also permits communities to add safety issues to this list. Additional safety issues that are included in
this element are:
        Criminal activities and violence;
        Hazardous materials; and
        Ground and air transportation.

Related Plans and Programs
There are a number of existing plans and programs that directly relate to the goals of the Safety Element. These
plans and programs have been enacted through state and local legislation and are administered by agencies with
powers to enforce state and local law.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Guidelines
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by the state legislature in response to a public
mandate for thorough environmental analysis of projects that might affect the environment. The provisions of
the law and environmental review procedure are described in the CEQA Statutes and the CEQA Guidelines
which were updated and amended in 2016. Implementation of CEQA ensures that during the decision making
stage of development, City officials and the general public will be able to assess the environmental impacts,
including potential hazards, associated with private and public development projects.
SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is the regional association of governments for
a seven county area, including Imperial County. As a regional government, SCAG has prepared a Regional
Comprehensive Plan and Guide that responds directly to federal and state planning requirements. The Plan
constitutes the base on which local governments ensure consistency of their plans with applicable regional
planning under CEQA. The SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide includes a number of core,
ancillary, and bridge chapters that address regional issues such as: growth management, regional transportation,
air quality, hazardous waste management, water quality, housing, open space and conservation, water resources,
energy, and integrated solid waste management. The Safety Element is consistent with land use policies found
in the SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide.
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
Pursuant to the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act, the State Geologist compiles maps identifying seismic hazard
zones. Development in seismic hazard areas is subject to policies and criteria established by the State Mining
and Geology Board. Additionally, approval of development on a site within a seismic hazard area requires the
preparation of a geotechnical report and local agency consideration of the policies and criteria set forth by the
State Mining and Geology Board (Public Resources Code Section2690 et. seq.).
Landslide Hazard Identification Program
The Landslide Hazard Identification Program requires the State Geologist to prepare maps of landslide hazards
within urbanizing areas. According to Public Resources Code Section 2687 (a), public agencies are encouraged
to use these maps for land use planning and for decisions regarding building, grading and development permits.
Portions along the Alamo River may be subject to landslides.
City of Holtville Zoning Ordinance
The Holtville Zoning Ordinance is the primary implementation tool for the Land Use Element. Together, the
Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map identify specific types of land use, intensity of use, and development and
performance standards applicable to specific areas and parcels of land within the City. The Zoning Ordinance
restricts development that would increase risks to public safety.

City of Holtville Service Area Plan
Holtville recently adopted its Service Area Plan for the entire planning area with the General Plan and Housing
Element updates in 2017. The Service Area Plan identifies demand for public services and facilities based on
population and housing growth projections for the year 2030 and anticipated phasing of development within
the planning area. The Plan provides an analysis of existing public services and facilities of the City, and indicates
how the demand created by future development within the planning area will be met.
Holtville Emergency Operations Plan
The City of Holtville prepared an Emergency Operations Plan in an effort to ensure the most effective and
economical use of all resources for the maximum benefit of residents in time of an extraordinary emergency.
The plan does not address ordinary day-to-day emergencies. The objectives of the plan are to incorporate and
coordinate all the facilities and personnel of the City into an efficient organization capable of reacting adequately
in the face of any disaster; and to conduct such operations as the nature of the disaster deems necessary, whether
it be to combat a local emergency or to assist other jurisdictions should they suffer an emergency. The Holtville
Emergency Plan is an integral part of the Safety Element.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
Policies and plans in the Safety Element arc designed to protect existing and planned land uses identified in the
Land Use Element from public safety hazards. Potential hazards are identified in the Safety Element, and action
programs are established to avoid or mitigate public safety impacts from planned development. Concurrently,
the distribution of residential and other sensitive land uses on the Land Use Policy Map contained in the Land
Use Element is designed to avoid areas where hazardous conditions have been identified, such as aircraft hazard
areas. In the event of an emergency, Holtville residents would use local streets, roadways, and the pedestrian
network to evacuate the City. The provision of viable evacuation routes within the City is inextricably linked to
the existing and planned circulation system addressed in the Circulation Element.

Safety Element
Issues, goals, and policies
Certain human activities and natural conditions in Holtville create risks to individuals and properties within the
community. Excessive risk from such hazards can be reduced or avoided through implementation of the Safety
Element.
Three major issues are addressed by the goals, policies, and plan of the Safety Element. These major issues
include: 1) reducing the risk related to natural hazards; 2) reducing the risk related to human activity hazards
and toxic materials; 3) reducing risks from all hazards through emergency management response coordination,
and; 4) reducing the risks related to wildlife hazards. Each issue and related goals and policies are included in
this section of the Element.
Natural Hazards
Due to its geographic location in a seismically active region and the location of flood-prone areas within the
City limits, Holtville is subject to several types of natural hazards such as seismic activity, flooding, and fires.
This risk of exposure can be reduced through appropriate planning, land use designations, development
engineering, and building construction practices. Existing structures, especially older, un-reinforced buildings
or older mobile homes that are not securely attached to their footings may require retrofitting to be able to
withstand seismic hazards.
Safety Goal 1:              Minimize the risk of injury and the loss of life and property related to geologic
                            conditions, seismic activity, fires, storms, and flooding.
Policy 1.1:                 Reduce the risk of impacts from geologic and seismic hazards by applying proper land
                            use planning, development engineering, building construction, and retrofitting
                            requirements.
Policy 1.2:                 Implement specific land use and development standards for areas that have high risks
                            associated with seismicity, geology, or flooding.
Policy 1.3:                 Encourage open space uses and discourage development in areas with significant
                            hazards that cannot be overcome through proper engineering and construction.
Policy 1.4:                 Protect the community from flooding hazards by providing and maintaining drainage
                            facilities and limiting development within the flood-prone areas.
Policy 1.5:                 Protect the visitors to the Alamo Trail from flooding hazards by providing and
                            maintaining drainage facilities, warning signage at trail heads and entry points, and
                            management of trail use during major storm events.
Human Activity Hazards and Toxic Materials
Holtville is subject to many of the same human-related hazardous conditions that are encountered in any
community. Certain human activities such as use of cars and other gasoline driven vehicles, use of hazardous or
toxic materials, use of combustibles, and criminal activities expose the population of Holtville to risk. The risk
of exposure to these hazards can be reduced to acceptable levels through proper planning and regulation of
human activity.
Safety Goal 2:              Protect the community from hazards related to hazardous materials, structural fires,
                            ground transportation, and criminal activity.

                          concert with the County of Imperial plans for reducing hazardous waste.
Policy 2.3:               Reduce the risk from ground transportation hazards, such as bridge systems.
Policy 2.4:               Provide sufficient levels of police service to reduce the risk of criminal activity.
Policy 2.5:               Provide sufficient fire service to reduce property damage and loss of life associated
                          with structural fires.
Policy 2.6:               Coordinate with the County Agricultural Commissioner to monitor and promote the
                          responsible use of pesticides within and around the planning area.
Emergency Management and Response
Major emergencies occur periodically in all communities. Proper preparation for emergencies is an essential
action to minimize the disruption, personal injury, and property damage associated with such events.
Preventative measures, public education, and preparatory training before an emergency occurs will hasten
recovery from these emergencies.
Safety Goa1 3:            Improve the ability of the City to respond effectively to natural and human caused
                          emergencies.
Policy 3.1:               Implement an emergency response plan for the City that is coordinated with the
                          County's Emergency Response Plan.
Policy 3.2:               Promote public safety through increasing community awareness of the type and
                          variety of hazards, and the methods and services available to deal with such hazards
                          through education programs conducted in coordination with the Fire Department,
                          Police Department, and the Holtville Unified School District.
Policy 3.3:               Train police and fire response personnel in medical assistance and procedures to be
                          followed in severe emergencies.
Policy 3.4:               Ensure adequate back-up systems and facilities are provided for essential services such
                          as police, fire, and medical.
Policy 3.5:               Fund the planned new Public Safety Building, approximately 8,000 square feet, to
                          increase emergency management response staffing.
Policy 3.6:               Review existing development impact fees for law enforcement facilities and
                          equipment; identify necessary modifications to the current fee structure; and
                          implement a revised fee structure if necessary.
Wildlife Hazards
Due to the Alamo River, a riparian and wetland area that provide vegetative support and habitat, the City
intends to protect and preserve rare or endangered wildlife animal and game species as well as protection for
visitors from potential wildlife hazards in these areas. The Alamo River riparian area provides an opportunity

Safety Plan
As in all communities, human activities and natural conditions occur in Holtville that have an effect on the
quality of life of its residents. Providing an environment where business6s and residents can operate and feel
safe, as well as being prepared for emergency situations, is essential for creating an attractive and healthy
environment within the City. The City can minimize hazards and protect public health and private property
through proper prevention and emergency preparedness planning.
This section of the Safety Element identifies the City's approach for reducing potential hazards from human
activities and natural conditions. Human activity hazards include criminal activity, air pollution, the use and
transport of hazardous materials, ground and air transportation, and structural fires. Geologic conditions,
seismic activity, flooding, and fires are considered natural hazards. The Plan is based on goals and policies
identified in the previous section of this element. The Safety Element Implementation Program contained in
the last section of this Element is an extension of the Safety Plan and contains specific actions that the City will
take to protect the welfare of the community.
Natural Hazards
Geologic Hazards
The relatively flat topography and geologic setting of Holtville offer few geologic hazards, other than those
related to seismic activity. While bluffs adjacent to the Alamo River may be subject to periodic landslides, much
of this land has been designated as open space, as shown in Figure LU-1 of the Land Use Element. In the
event that there are geologic hazards in an area proposed for development, the City will require soil and geologic
surveys completed to analyze potential geologic hazards. The developers are required to incorporated design
features into their developments to minimize hazardous conditions.
Seismic Hazards
Holtville lies within a region with active seismic faults, and is therefore subject to risk of hazards associated
with earthquakes. Seismic activity poses two types of hazards: primary and secondary. Primary hazards include
ground rupture, ground shaking, ground displacement, and subsidence and uplift from earth movement.
Primary hazards can induce secondary hazards including ground failure (lurch cracking, lateral spreading, and
slope failure), liquefaction, water waves (seiches), movement on nearby faults (sympathetic fault movement),
dam failure, and fires.
No known active faults are located in the City and no Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning has been
established by the State for the planning area. Consequently, the potential for ground rupture is low. However,
as shown in Figure S-1, numerous faults and a seismic zone are located in the vicinity of Holtville and residents
may be affected by ground shaking from these faults. Nearby faults include the Rico Fault, Weinert Fault,
Superstition Mountain Fault, Superstition Hills Fault, and Imperial Fault to the west of the planning area. In
addition, the Boundary Fault, Calipatria Fault, and San Andreas Fault are several miles to the east of Holtville.
In 1940, the epicenter of an earthquake registering 7.1 on the Richter Scale was located on the Imperial Fault,
a few miles west of Holtville. In Holtville, the quake collapsed the City's water tower and extensive damage
was recorded in neighboring cities of Imperial and Brawley. Existing information about earthquakes that have
occurred in Imperial Valley in the past suggest that earthquake related hazards will continue to pose a threat to
residents of Holtville in the future.
Damage from earthquakes is often the result of liquefaction. Liquefaction occurs primarily in areas of recently
deposited sands and silts and in areas of high groundwater levels. Especially susceptible areas include sloughs
and marshes that have been filled in and covered with development.

Safety Element
However, swimming pools are enclosed bodies of water that are subject to potentially damaging oscillation, or
seiches, during earthquakes. The hazard is dependent upon specific earthquake parameters, and the degree of
damage due to seiches is likely to be minor.
The City continues to enact programs to reduce geologic, seismic, and structural hazards in order to protect
public safety. To minimize hazards from earthquakes and other geologic hazards, the City implements the most
recent geologic, seismic, and structural guidelines including the most recent Unifom1 Building Code and other
codes and regulations that ensure public safety through building design and standards. The stability of
residential structures, critical structures, and vital emergency facilities will be given special attention. During the
review of discretionary development proposals involving grading, unstable soils, and other hazardous
conditions, surveys of soils and geologic conditions are required to be performed by a state licensed engineering
geologist. Based on the results of the survey, design measures are incorporated into projects to minimize
geologic hazards. Open space easements to create buffers are also considered to avoid geologic hazards.
Earthquake preparedness is one of the best methods to minimize personal injury and property damage, and
accelerate recovery. The City of Holtville implements programs to educate the residents about earthquake
hazards, and thereby reduce the loss of life, injuries, damage to property, and economic and social dislocations
resulting from future earthquakes. The programs are coordinated with emergency service providers and the
Holtville Unified School District to maximize public participation and effectiveness.
Wildlife Hazards
Holtville lies within a region with a variety of wildlife, and is therefore subject to risk of hazards associated with
bee swarms, rattle snakes, coyotes especially in the Alamo River’s riparian area. While only a limited area in the
river is maintained in a natural state for the preservation of both animal and plant life, wildlife hazard
preparedness is necessary to protect the health and safety of local residents and visitors. The City is encouraged
to enact both signage programs to warn of potential hazards in natural area gateways and trail heads, as well as
manage the use of trails during major storm events, fires, and other natural hazards.
The Federal Fish and Wildlife Service agency, State Department of Fish and Game, and Wildlife Board has
information on best practices as reference. Natural wildlife resource land use areas are also referenced in the
Open Space and Conservation Elements. The Alamo River Habitat Conservation Area is the focus area for
these health and safety issues.

Flood Hazards
Holtville's water supply comes from the Colorado River via the canals and facilities of the Imperial Irrigation
District (IID). A majority of the water received is used for irrigating the vast acreage of farmland in Imperial
Valley and local drainage patterns within the valley have been altered through these agricultural activities. The
IID maintains about 1,600 miles of irrigation drainage structures, which collect surface water runoff and
subsurface drainage from some 32,200 miles of agricultural drains (tile) and channel the flow into the New and
Alamo Rivers, which ultimately drain to the Salton Sea. The canals and laterals are often open and unprotected.
The City requires developers to underground the canals and laterals as new development occurs adjacent to
existing open drainage facilities, as allowed by the Imperial Irrigation District.
Figure S-2 depicts flood-prone areas in a wide band on either side of the Alamo River and in an eastern portion
of the planning area. Floods in residential areas are considered hazardous due to the potential for injury and
property damage. Business and commercial activities can be impeded by floods due to facility damage and
access related problems. Most of the potential flood areas around the Alamo River are designated for open
space park uses as shown in Figure LU-1 of the Land Use Element, however new development could
potentially be located within a flood plain susceptible to a 100 Year Flood event.
The City’s Floodplain Management regulations for the mitigation of flood hazards, to minimize property
damage and health and safety hazards. Flood-prone areas are in a wide band on either side of the Alamo
River and in the eastern portion of the city. Most of the potential flood areas around the Alamo River
are designated for open space park uses; however, new development could potentially be located within
a flood plain susceptible to a 100-year flood event.
Holtville has been studying the feasibility of participating in the National Flood Insurance Program,
which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The program provides
federal flood insurance and federally financed loans for property owners in flood-prone areas. To qualify
for federal flood insurance, the City must identify flood hazard areas and implement a system of
protective controls. The City continues to identify and evaluate hazardous flood locations and inform
the public and developers proposing projects within these areas. In addition, in coordination with
emergency service providers and the Holtville Unified School District, the City promotes programs that
educate the public about flood hazards and methods to reduce the risk of flood losses. The City requires
new developments to provide adequate stormwater drainage systems to address runoff. In addition, the City
monitors its drainage facilities to ensure that adequate flood control is provided within the community.
Holtville has adopted a program to look into the feasibility of participating in the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP), which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA). The NFIP program provides federal flood insurance and federally financed loans for property
owners in flood prone areas. To qualify for federal flood insurance, the City must identify flood hazards
areas and implement a system of protective controls. The City continues to identify and evaluate
hazardous flood locations and inform the public and developers proposing projects within these areas.
In addition, in coordination with emergency service providers and the Holtville Unified School District,

Safety Element
Fire
Although wildfires do not pose much of a risk to Holtville, residents are exposed to various structural fire
hazards within the City. The City of Holtville Fire Department is responsible for providing all fire protection
and emergency medical aid to the City and has a mutual aid agreement with surrounding cities. The Department
operates out of one fire station located at 549 Fern Street; however, the City is looking a potential site for a
new Public Safety Center that would consolidate police and fire services to operate out of a single centrally
located building. The publicly land immediately north of Holt Park is a potential candidate.
The City of Holtville reviews funding levels for the Fire Department to ensure that an adequate level of service
and facilities are provided to residents. In addition, the City coordinates with the Fire Department to educate
the public about fire hazards and ways to reduce risks associated with fire hazards.
Human Activity Hazards and Toxic Materials
Police, Fire and Emergency Services
The Holtville Police Department operates from a single police station located at the corner of 6th and Fern
Avenue. The City of Holtville contracts with the Imperial County Sheriff’s Office for law enforcement services.
The services include traffic patrol; random monitoring of residential and commercial areas, municipal facilities,
and schools; investigative and administrative support; coordination of volunteer programs; attendance at City
meetings as requested; limited animal control; and dispatching services for public safety and fire emergency
calls. The City of Holtville is responsible for one full-time equivalent public safety dispatcher and the total
expenses for providing all necessary office space, computers, and furnishings for the performance of the
contract with Imperial County sheriff. The current contract calls for law enforcement services to be provided
24 hours per day, 7 days a week, 365 days per year.
According to the 2017 Holtville Service Area Plan, a new Public Safety Building is out to bid for construction
when funding is available. This will consolidate police and fire services to operate out of a single centrally
located building. The new public safety building will provide additional police and fire service capabilities and
will be shared with a new Sheriff substation.
The City ensures that the Police Department continues to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of Holtville by educating the public about criminal activities and reducing the incidence of crime. The
City also reviews funding levels for the Police Department to ensure that an adequate level of service and
facilities are provided to protect the safety of residents.
The City uses a contract ambulance service located on 4 th Street for medical emergency response. The 4 th
Street facility also houses the Imperial County sheriff’s administrative office under contract to the City.
Hazardous and Toxic Materials
Hazardous materials are used in and around Holtville for a variety of purposes including manufacturing,
agriculture, medical clinics, service industries, small businesses, schools, and households. Many chemicals used
in household cleaning, construction, dry cleaning, film processing, landscaping, agriculture, and automotive
maintenance and repair are considered hazardous. Accidents can occur in the production, use, transport, and
disposal of these hazardous materials. When potentially hazardous materials generated within the City need to
be disposed of, the City contacts the County Health Department. The Health Department makes a
determination whether or not the materials can be disposed of through the City's normal solid waste provider,
or if it needs to be dealt with by a hazardous waste specialist.

The use of pesticides in agricultural operations is a large source of hazardous materials within the planning area
since the City is surrounded by agricultural operations. The City does not have direct authority over the use of
pesticides. The County Agricultural Commission and the California Environmental Protection Agency,
Department of Pesticide Regulation are the major enforcement agencies responsible for controlling and
monitoring pesticide use. The City will continue to monitor regulations governing the use of pesticides and
work with the County Agricultural Commission to promote the responsible use of pesticides in the planning
area.
Hazardous materials also pass through the City in route to other destinations. Currently, the major
transportation route through the City is SR-115. The City has no direct authority to regulate the transport of
hazardous materials on State highways. Transportation of hazardous materials by truck is regulated by the U.S.
Department of Transportation (DOT). DOT regulations establish criteria for safe handling procedures. Federal
Safety standards are also included in the California Administrative Code. The California Health Services
Department also regulates the haulers of hazardous waste, but docs not regulate all hazardous materials. The
City will continue to coordinate with Caltrans and the Imperial County Transportation Commission (ICTC) to
realign SR-115. The realignment would divert a substantial amount of truck traffic from passing through the
City and would reduce the safety risks posed by transportation of hazardous materials along this roadway.
Transportation Hazards
Vehicular traffic within Holtville presents a potential hazard to motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists. The risk of
accidents can be reduced by properly maintaining the transportation system infrastructure and correcting
deficiencies. In addition, school aged children are often subject to vehicular hazards before and after school as
traffic around schools at these times is very heavy. The City can work with the Holtville Unified School District
and parents to identify ways to reduce these risks to children.
The City will monitor the removal or rehabilitation of hazardous or sub-standard structures that may be
expected to collapse in the event of an earthquake, including, but not limited to, unreinforced masonry
buildings, bridges, and critical facilities. The former railway also poses a potential safety hazard to residents of
Holtville. The Inter-Urban Railroad line connecting Holtville to El Centro has been out of operation since the
early 1990s, the railway operator retains the right-of-way and could, at some point in the future, transform into
a rails-to-trails facility that may be planned along this route. In the event a rails-to-trails facility is planned, the
City will work to ensure public safety along the trail.
The City will continue to use its police department and work with residents and the Holtville Unified School
District to monitor vehicular traffic along roadways and identify ways to avoid hazardous conditions. When
safety problems are identified, the City will request the appropriate agency (i.e. Caltrans, Police Department,
Public Works Department, railway operators, or the School District) to take corrective measures.
Emergency Management and Response
Recognizing that the City has the responsibility to save lives, limit injuries, and minimize damage to property
in the event of an emergency, the City has adopted an Emergency Operations Plan. Local emergency
preparedness plans serve as extensions of the California Emergency Plan and the Emergency Resource
Management Plan. The purpose of the Emergency Operations Plan is to respond to emergency situations with
a coordinated system of emergency service providers and facilities.
Holtville will maintain its Emergency Operations Plan. The Plan addresses the City’s planned response,
including evacuation of residents, to extraordinary emergency situations associated with natural disasters,
technological incidents, terrorist activities, and war-related operations. The Plan is designed to include the City
as part of a Statewide emergency management system.

Safety Element
To support the Holtville Emergency Operations Plan, the City will promote a high level of multi- jurisdictional
cooperation and communication for emergency planning and response management. The Plan will continue to
be coordinated with the Imperial County Emergency Response Plan. Effective emergency response also
requires vital facilities such as hospitals, fire stations, and communications centers to be functional during
disasters.
Educating residents and businesses about potential disasters and the Emergency Operations Plan can increase
the effectiveness of response efforts in case of an emergency. An educated public will know how to prevent
injury and property damage during and after emergency episodes and also know how to find and offer help to
their neighbors. The City works to educate residents and businesses about appropriate actions to safeguard life
and property during and after emergencies. Education about emergency preparedness occurs through the
distribution of brochures, presentations and coordination with civic groups, and instruction in local schools.
The City works with civic organizations and the Holtville Unified School District to educate the public about
emergency response plans.

Safety Element
NOISE
Introduction
Noise levels within the community of Holtville affect the quality of life of people living and working in the
City. The most significant noise levels within the community are associated with roadways. High noise levels
associated with transportation and other activities can create stress and irritation. The Noise Element addresses
the physiological, psychological and economic effects of noise by providing effective strategies to reduce
excessive noise and limit community exposure to loud noise sources.
Purpose of the Noise Element
The purpose of the Noise Element is to identify and appraise existing noise problems in the community, and
to provide guidance to avoid noise and land use incompatibility problems in the future. This Element addresses
noise sources in the community and identifies ways to reduce existing and potential noise impacts. In particular,
the Noise Element contains policies and programs to achieve and maintain noise levels compatible with various
types of land uses. These policies and programs emphasize the need to control noise through land use
regulation, as well as enforcement of City ordinances related to noise.
Scope and Content of the Noise Element
The State of California recognizes the relationship between noise and noise sensitive uses and has adopted State
Guidelines for Noise Elements. This Noise Element satisfies the requirements of State planning Jaw and is a
mandated component of the General Plan. Government Code Section 65302(f) establishes the required
components of the Noise Element. The Element also complies with California Health and Safety Code Section
56050.1 guidelines for Noise Elements.
Future noise conditions from short and long-term growth are quantified and identified as noise exposure
contours. This noise information serves as the basis for: developing guidelines for identifying compatible land
uses; identifying the proper distribution of land uses on the General Plan Land Use Policy Map; and establishing
proper development standards.
Related Plans and Programs
There are a number of existing plans and programs that directly relate to the goals of the Noise Element. These
plans and programs have been enacted through state and local legislation and are administered by agencies with
powers to enforce state and local laws.
California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by the State legislature in response to a public
mandate for thorough environmental analysis of projects that might affect the environment. Excessive noise is
considered an environmental impact under CEQA. The provisions of the law and environmental review
procedures are described in the CEQA Statutes and the CEQA Guidelines. Implementation of CEQA ensures
that during the decision making stage of development, City officials and the general public will be able to assess
the noise impacts associated with public and private development projects. This General Plan establishes noise
standards to help facilitate the assessment of these noise impacts.
California Noise Insulation Standards (Title 24)
The California Commission of Housing and Community Development officially adopted noise standards in
1974. In 1988, the Building Standards Commission approved revisions to the standards (Title 24, Part 2,
California Code of Regulations). As revised, Title 24 establishes an interior noise standard of 45 dBA for

MAY 2017                                                                                                      117
                                                                                          Safety Element
residential space (CNEL or Ldn). Acoustical studies must be prepared for residential structures that are to be
located within noise contours of 60 dBA or greater from freeways, major streets, thoroughfares, rail lines, rapid
transit lines or industrial noise sources. The studies must demonstrate that the building is designed to reduce
interior noise to 45 dBA or lower. These standards are incorporated by reference into this General Plan.
Imperial County Noise Element
The county’s Noise Element (2015) is a mandatory component pursuant to the State Government Code,
Section 65302. The State guidelines, Section 65302(f), specify the content of the Noise Element, which includes
the requirement to analyze, to the extent practicable, the current and projected noise levels. Policies established
in the Noise Element is applicable to lands that are owned or zoned by the County; lands regulated by the State
or Federal government are preempted from local land use policy. Long-term exposure to high noise levels can
affect psychological and physiological health. The Noise Element of the Imperial County General Plan provides
a program for incorporating noise issues into the land use planning process, with a goal of minimizing adverse
noise impacts to receptors which are sensitive to noise.
 City of Holtville Zoning Ordinance
The Zoning Ordinance is the primary implementation tool for the Land Use Element, but also contains noise
regulations. Together, the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map identify specific types of land use, intensity of
use, and development and performance standards applicable to specific areas and parcels of land within the
City. Standards contained in the Noise Element are consistent with and reflect standards outlined in the Zoning
Ordinance.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
Policies and plans in the Noise Element are designed to protect existing and planned land uses from significant
noise impacts. To do this, the Element identifies potential noise sources and establishes programs to avoid or
mitigate noise impacts from community development. Concurrently, the Land Use Element contains policies
to ensure that environmental conditions, including noise, are considered in all land use decisions. Planning for
future residential and other sensitive land uses on the Land Use Policy Map is designed to avoid new noise
sensitive development in areas (e.g., industrial areas) where noise impacts cannot be reduced or mitigated to
acceptable levels.
The Noise Element is linked to the transportation policies in the Circulation Element. Transportation noise is
largely responsible for excessive noise levels in certain locations within Holtville. The projected noise contours
identified in this element directly correspond to the Circulation Plan and the projected traffic generated from
the proposed land uses. Both the Noise and Circulation Elements contain policies and programs to minimize
the effects of transportation noise on existing and planned land uses. Noise exposure is a key consideration
when locating and designing new roadways.
The Noise Element also relates to the Conservation/Open Space Element. Excessive noise can diminish
enjoyment of parks and other designated open space. Because of this, noise levels are considered in the planning
of new recreational and open space areas. Additionally, open space areas can be used to separate and buffer
noise sensitive land uses from noise producers.

Safety Element
Issues, goals and policies
Human activities in the community create noise levels that can affect overall quality of life. The goals and
policies of the Noise Element are designed to protect the community from excessive noise. The major issue
related to noise addressed in the Noise Element is ensuring compatibility of land uses with the potential for
noise generated from various uses.
Noise/Land Use Compatibility
Certain areas within Holtville may be subject to high noise levels associated with transportation and/or
stationary sources such as trucks, packing sheds, and agricultural coolers. Consideration of the sources and
recipients of noise early in the land use planning and development process can be an effective method of
minimizing the impact of noise on people in the community. Areas already impacted by noise need to have
noise reduced through rehabilitative improvements. Enforcement of noise standards and implementation of a
"good neighbor" program that educates residents and businesses of City noise standards will also help reduce
nuisance noises associated with non-transportation related sources.
Noise Goal 1:             Minimize the effects of transportation-related and stationary source noise through
                          proper land use and circulation system planning, development techniques, and
                          enforcement of noise standards.
Policy 1.1:               Use noise/land use compatibility standards as a guide for future planning and
                          development decisions.
Policy 1.2:               Require noise control measures, such as berms, walls, and sound attenuating
                          construction in areas where new or infill development is impacted by noise.
Policy 1.3:               When necessary, provide buffer areas between noise sources and sensitive receptors.
Policy 1.4:               Enforce the construction and stationary noise limits established by the City.
Policy 1.5:               Educate residents and businesses about noise restrictions and acceptable noise levels
                          within the City.
Policy 1.6:               Support efforts by Caltrans and the ICTC to realign State Route 115 to reduce noise
                          along Fifth Street.

Noise Plan
Like most urbanized areas, Holtville experiences associated with transportation and other activities. The City
must seek ways to safeguard its population from excessive noise levels. The goals and policies identified in the
previous section establish an agenda to reduce overall noise levels within the City. This Noise Plan defines the
City's approach to achieve the agenda and generally outlines the action programs. The Noise Element
Implementation Program] is an extension of the Noise Plan and contains specific programs that the City
undertakes to protect community well-being.
Noise/Land Use Compatibility
Noise in the community is the cumulative effect of noise from transportation activities and stationary sources.
Transportation noise refers to noise from automobile use, trucking, airport operations, and rail operations.
Non-transportation noise typically refers to noise from stationary sources such as commercial establishments,
machinery, air conditioning systems, compressors, residential and recreational uses, and landscape maintenance
equipment. Regardless of the type of noise, noise levels are highest near the source and decrease with distance.
Noise is problematic when noise sensitive land uses are affected. Noise sensitive land uses (i.e., activities that
are interrupted by noise) include residences, schools, hospitals, religious meetings, and recreation areas. Most
noise impacts can be avoided when noise sources, sensitive land uses, and inf01mation about the future noise
environment are considered in land use planning and development decisions.
Noise Standards and Land Use Compatibility
To ensure that noise producers do not adversely affect sensitive receptors, the Land Use Element establishes
distinct land use designations, providing for a separation of incompatible uses. In addition, the City's Zoning
Ordinance contains noise restrictions to address excessive noise generated from stationary sources.
Table N-1 presents general guidelines for noise and land use compatibility within urbanized areas. All
development project proponents are required to demonstrate that the noise standards will be met prior to
human occupation of a building. If noise generated by a proposed project is anticipated to fall within Zone A
or Zone B, the project is considered compatible with the noise environment deemed acceptable for that land
use. Zone A implies that no mitigation will be needed. Zone B implies that minor mitigation may be required
to meet the City’s and Title 24 noise standards.
If the noise level falls within Zone C, substantial mitigation is likely needed to meet City noise standards.
Substantial mitigation may involve construction of noise barriers and substantial building sound insulation.
Projects in Zone C can be successfully mitigated; however, project proponents with a project in Zone C must
demonstrate that the noise standards can be met prior to issuance of a building permit. If noise levels fall in
Zone D, projects are considered clearly incompatible with the noise environment and are not approved.

Noise Contours and Noise Impact Areas
The noise environment for the community can be described with noise contours based on the major noise
sources. Noise contours define areas of equal noise exposure. Future noise contours have been estimated with
information about existing and projected land use development and transportation activity. These contours
have been prepared to assist in the distribution of land uses and the establishment of development standards.
Table N-2 lists the projected noise contours and associated Noise Impact Areas based on existing and future
traffic patterns within Holtville. The noise contours are expressed by the number of feet from the roadway
segment centerline and are used as a guide for land use and development decisions. Contours of 60 dBA or
greater define noise impacted areas. When noise sensitive land uses are proposed within these contours, an
acoustical analysis must be prepared. For the project to be approved, the analysis must demonstrate that the
project is designed to attenuate the noise to meet the City noise standards. If the project is not designed to meet
the noise standards, mitigation measures must be recommended in the analysis. If the analysis demonstrates
that the noise standards can be met with implementation of mitigation measures, the project can be approved
with the mitigation measures, which shall be required as conditions of project approval.

Development along roadway segments most significantly impacted by noise is along State Route 115. The
estimated future (2020) CNEL 60 noise contours extend more than 250 feet from the centerline of SR 115
along the Cedar to Holt and Holt to Walnut segments. The CNEL 65 contours are reduced considerably along
these segments. As shown in Figure LU-1, in the Land Use Element, the land uses surrounding these
segments are commercial and industrial uses. Small portions of Holt Park are also located within the noise
impact area. According to Table N-1, the uses impacted by the CNEL 60 and CNEL 65 noise contours are
compatible with the level of noise generated along these segments of roadway.
The City is coordinating with Caltrans and the Imperial County Transportation Commission (ICTCA) to realign
SR-115 to bypass Holtville. The realignment of SR-115 will reduce transportation related noise on Fifth Street,
effectively reducing the CNEL 60 and CNEL 65 noise contours and associated noise impact areas.

Safety Element
Construction Standards
The provisions of the State Noise Insulation Standards (Title 24, Part 2, California Code of Regulations) are
enforced in Holtville. Title 24 specifies that combined indoor noise for' multi- family living spaces shall not
exceed 45 dBA CNEL. This standard must be implemented when the outdoor noise level exceeds 60 dBA
CNEL. Title 24 requires that the same standard be applied to all new hotels, motels, apartments and multi-
family projects. The City also applies the same standard to new single-family development.
Noise Control at Reception Sites
The most efficient and effective means of controlling noise from transportation systems is to reduce noise at
the source. However, the City has little direct control over noise produced by transportation sources because
State noise regulations preempt local regulations. Because the City cannot control noise at the source, City noise
programs focus on reducing the impact of transportation noise reception sites.
During the planning stages of the development process, potential impacts from transportation noise will be
identified and mitigation measures will be required as needed to meet City noise standards. Site planning,
landscaping, topography and the design and construction of noise buffers are the most common method of
alleviating vehicular traffic noise impacts. Setbacks and buffers can also be used to achieve noise reduction.
Noise attenuating barriers are commonly incorporated into projects and can be extremely effective in reducing
noise levels. The effectiveness of the barrier depends on: I) the relative height and materials of the barrier; 2)
the noise source; 3) the affected area; and 4) the horizontal distance between the barrier and the affected area.
Although noise barriers can be extremely effective, the aesthetic effect of barriers on neighborhoods must be
considered during the preliminary stages of the development process. Potentially significant aesthetics impacts
associated with noise barriers must be addressed and mitigated through landscaping or other project design
measures in all new public and private projects.
Noise Control at the Source
The California Vehicle Code contains noise regulations pertaining to the operation of all vehicles on public
roads. These noise standards for cars, trucks and motorcycles are enforced through the Holtville Police
Department. The City also regulates traffic flow and enforces speed limits to reduce traffic noise.
Sensitive receptors must also be protected from excessive noise generated by non-transportation sources, such
as commercial and industrial centers, agricultural activities, restaurants and bars, religious institutions and civic
centers. Other noise sources commonly referred to as nuisance noises also contribute to the overall noise
environment. Noise generated by new development is effectively controlled through the site design review
process, compliance with CEQA, and compliance with City noise standards contained in the Noise Element
of the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance. During the preliminary stages of the development process,
potential noise impact must be identified and mitigation measures identified.
Business Activity Noise
When reviewing a proposed industrial, commercial or public project, noise generation and potential impacts to
surrounding development are considered in accordance with CEQA. An acoustical analysis is required for
projects that will potentially generate noise affecting sensitive receptors. Where significant impacts are
identified, mitigation measures are required. Common mitigation measures that could be applied when
reviewing projects include acoustically treated:

1) agricultural coolers; 2) packing sheds 3) furnaces; 4) fans; 5) motors; 6) compressors; and 7) valves and
pumps. The City may also require limited delivery hours and hours of operation in order to minimize impacts
to adjacent residential users or other sensitive receptors.
In addition, all City departments must comply with state and federal OSHA standards. Any new equipment or
vehicle purchased by the City will comply with local, state and federal noise standards.
Nuisance Noise
Several noise sources can contribute to the overall noise environment in the community, including: barking
dogs, loud audio equipment, defective or modified auto and motorcycle mufflers and activities at parks and
civic, community or religious institutions. The City has adopted a program to review and update its noise
ordinance to address nuisance noises. In addition, existing nuisance noises is addressed through implementation
of a "good neighbor" program that educates residents and businesses about noise regulations. Under this
program, fliers are distributed to local businesses and residents through the mail to make residents aware of
existing noise restrictions as well as changes in noise regulations.
Noise Ordinance
The City has adopted a program to develop a Noise Ordinance that will be designed to address business activity
and nuisance noise. The ordinance will establish specific interior and exterior standards for noise levels within
various types of land uses as well as AM/PM standards. Enforcement of the ordinance ensures that adjacent
propet1ies are not exposed to excessive noise from stationary sources or nuisances. Enforcing the ordinance
includes requiring proposed development projects to demonstrate compliance with the ordinance. The
ordinance will be reviewed periodically for adequacy and amended as needed to address community needs and
development patterns.
