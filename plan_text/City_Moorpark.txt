 1.1       OVERVIEW
This 2015 Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan (2015 M l-IMP) is written to (I) address the local
 mitigation planning requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of2000 (DMA 2000) for
 Unincorporated Ventura County and other local participants (Section 1.5): and (2) address the
510 Floodplain Management Planning activities of the Cormnunity Rating System (CRS) for the
 Ventura County Watershed Protection District (VCWPD) on behalf of Unincorporated Ventura
County and the City of Oxnard.
This section provides an introduction to hazard mitigation planning as well as a brief description
of DMA 2000 and CRS. This section also identifies the other local participants, provides a brief
narrative about Unincorporated Ventura County and the other local participants. and describes
the various sections and appendices of the 20 15 MHMP.
The '.W 1S MHMP supersedes the 2010 MHMP .
1.2        HAZARD MITIGATION PLANNING
As defined in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Subpart M, Section 206.401.
hazard mitigation is "any action taken to reduce or eliminate the long-tenn risk to human life and
property from natural hazards."' As such. hazard mitigation is any work to minimize the impacts
of any type of hazard event before it occurs. Hazard mitigation aims to reduce losses from future
disasters. It is a process in which hazards are identified and profiled. the people and facilities at
risk are analyzed. and mitigation actions to reduce or eliminate hazard risk are developed. The
implementation of tbe mitigation actions. which include short- and long-term strategies that may
involve planning, policy changes, programs, projects, and other activities. is the end result of this
process.
1.3        DISASTER MITIGATION ACT OF 2000
In recent years. hazard mitigation planning has been driven by a new federal law knO\vn as
OMA 2000. On October 30, 2000. Congress passed OMA 2000 (Public Law 106-390), which
amended the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988 (Stafford
Act) (Title 42 of the United States Code Section 5121 et seq.) by repealing the act's previous
mitigation planning section (409) and replacing it with a new mitigation planning section (322).
This new section emphasized the need for state, tribal. and local entities to closely coordinate
mitigation planning and implementation efforts. This new section also provided the legal basis
for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) mitigation plan requirements for
mitigation grant assistance.
To implement these planning requirements. FEMA published an Interim F inal Rule in the
Federal Register on February 26. 2002 (44 C'FR Part 101 ). The tribal planning requirements were
updated in 44 CFR Part 201.7 in 2009. The local mitigation plannjng requirements are identified
in their appropriate sections throughout the 1015 Ml IMP and also within the f'EMA Plan Review
Tool included in Appendix A.

 1.4       COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM -ACTIVITY 510 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
           PLANNING
 CRS is a voluntary incentive program that recognjzes and encourages community floodplain
 management activities that exceed the minimum National Flood Insurance Program (NF IP)
 requirements. Under CRS. flood insurance premiw11 rates are discounted to reflect the reduced
 flood risk that results when community actions meet the three goals of CRS: reducing flood
damage to insurable property. strengthening and supporting the insurance aspects of the NFIP.
and encouraging a comprehensive approach to floodplain management. In 20 I L Unjncorporated
 Ventura County joined CRS as a class 6 rating, entitl ing tlood insurance policy holders to receive
a 20 percent premiwn discount annually. In 2013. the City of Oxnard joined CRS as a class 9
 rating, entitling flood insurance policy holders to receive a 5 percent discount annually.
There are 18 programs or "activities" in CRS that are intended to reduce or eliminate exposure to
 floods. including Activity 5 10 Floodplain Management Plarming. To implement these activities.
fEMA published the 2013 NFIP CRS Coordinators Manual (F IA 15-20 13). which spells out the
credit and credit criteria fo r CRS activities. The floodplain management plarming activities for
 Unincorporated Ventura County (admini stered by the YCWPD) and the City of Oxnard are
 identified in their appropriate sections throughout the 2015 MHMP and also in the 5 10 FMP
Checklist included in Appendix A.

The djstrict serves an area of approximately 365 square miles and approximately 75 percent of
 Ventura County's population.
 1.6.3.2    Casitas Municipal Water District
The Casitas Municipal Water District was formed in l 952. In 1956, the Ventura Ri ver Project
was authorized by Congress, which included the Robles Di version facility on the Ventura River,
the Robles Canal, and the Casitas Dam.
Currently, the district supplies water to 60.000 to 70.000 people in western Ventura County and
to hundreds of farn1s. The district houndaries encompass the City of Ojai, Upper Ojai, the
Ventura River Valley area, the City of Ventura to Mills Road and the Rincon and beach area to
the ocean and Santa Barbara County line. The district is governed by a fi ve-member board of
directors.

entity to provide solutions to their need for various services, including but not limited to water,
sewer, and trash services.
 1.6.3.4    Ojai Valley Sanitary District
The Ojai Valley Sanitary District was established in 1985 as the result of a consolidation of the
Ventura Avenue, Oak View, and Meiners Oaks sanitary districts and the Sanitation Department
of the City of Ojai. The district provides sanitary sewer service for about 20,000 residents of the
City of Ojai and the unincorporated Ojai Valley. It collects and transports wastewater for
treatment at the Ojai Valley Treatment Plant and disposes of effluent and sludge.
The district is a public agency organized under the Sanitary District Act of 1923 and is governed
by an elected seven-member board. The district's collection system consists of approximately
120 miles of trunk and main sewer lines.
1.6.3.5     United Water Conservation District
L ocal landowners fom1ed the Santa Clara River Water Conservation Di strict in 1927. As cities
and agricultural areas grew, water usage increased rapidly. By 1950, the district was reorganized
and renamed the United Water Conservation District. The district constructed the Santa Felicia
Dam, three spreading grounds, and distribution facilities, all of which were urgently needed to
combat seawater intrusion.
The United Water Conservation District is governed by seven directors, one elected from each of
the seven district divisions. The district administers a "basin management" progran1 for the Santa
Clara Valley and Oxnard Plain. using the surface flow of the Santa Clara River and its tributaries
for replenishment of groundwater. Facilities include Santa Felicia Dan1; Lake Piru Recreation
Area; the Piru, Saticoy, and El Rio spreading grounds; the Pleasant Valley Pipeline and
Reservoirs; the Oxnard-Hueneme Pipeline, Pumping Plant, and Pumping Trough Pipeline; and
other facilities.

 1.6.3.6    Ventura County Fire Protection District
 ln 1928. the VCFPD was fom1ed to provide fire protection to the county, with the exception of
the four established cities. Since that time. six additional cities have become incorporated.
Today, the VCFPD acts as the Ventura County Fire Department for Unincorporated Ventura
County and as the City fire department for six cities (Camarillo. Moorpark, Ojai, Port Hueneme.
Thousand Oaks, and Simi Valley).
 1.6.3. 7   Ventura County Office of Education
Ventura County comprises 20 K-12 school districts. The VCOE provides facility planning,
construction, and maintenance to the school districts. VCOE also operates specialized schools in
the county. For the 2010 MHMP, the VCOE will represent all of20 K-12 school districts in
Ventura County. as well as the Ventura County Community CoJlege District.
 1.6.3.8    Ventura County Watershed Protection District
The VCWPD, fom1erly known as the Ventura County Flood Control District, was fonned on
September 12, 1944. by an act of the California State Legislature. It is governed by the Ventura
County Board of Supervisors. The District is the responsible sponsoring local agency for federal
flood control projects throughout Ventura County. The entire county, except for the islands of
Anacapa and San Nicholas, is within the District' s sphere of influence and boundaries. The
VCWPD also serves as the principal co-pem1ittee and manages the implementation of the
Ventura Countywide Stormwater Quality Management Program under the municipal National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for urban stormwater runoff discharges in
Ventura County. The VCWPD also manages FEMA 's NFIP and CRS for Unincorporated
Ventura County.

3.2.1       MHMP Review and Recommendations
This 2015 MHMP is the third iteration of the plan. The MHMP was originally developed for
Ventura County in 2005, and a second version was developed in 2010. Prior to developing the
2015 version of the plan, the consultant, and the MHMP and FMP committees reviewed the 2010
MHMP to identify the areas that require updating. Key recommendations for the 2015 MHMP
are noted in Table 3-1.

Shortly after the plan update kick-off process. the VCWPD reached out to several local, state,
and federal floodp lain management stakeholders to notify them of the 20 l 5 MHMP process;
request additional relevant flood data, mapping, and/or information on flood projects; and invite
them to participate in the plan update process. The VCWPD mailed personalized letters to 10
city floodplain managers on April 1, 2015. and an additional seven personalized letters to state
and federal partners on April 11, 2015. The agencies contacted are listed in Table 3-3, and a
copy of each mailed letter is included in Appendix E. The VCWPD followed up with five city
floodplain managers and one federal agency (FEMA) at the Ventura Cowlty Floodplain
Managers Meeting in Camarillo, California, on May 20, 2015. At this meeting. the consultant
presented an overview of the MHMP, including updated flood hazard figures and potential flood
mitigation actions; and the group discussed t1ood hazard data information. including Letter of

3.2.3      Land Use and Development Trends
The 1998 General Plan, with multiple amendments through October 20 13, is the current long-
range planning device for Ventura County. In 1969 Guidelines for Orderly Development were
developed. These Guidelines have been adopted by the County, the cities, and LAFCO and
provide that urban development will occur. whenever and wherever practical, within
incorporated cities rather than in the unincorporated area. Moreover, applicants for land use
permits or entitlements for buran uses within a city's Sphere of Influence are encouraged to
apply to the city and are discouraged from applying to the County. Urban residential
development can occur, therefore, only within cities or in unincorporated areas where are
designed by the County General Plan as "Urban' (urban centers within their own Areas of
Interest) or "Existing Communities" where zoning is established based on historical community
character and consistent with the land use plans of the respective cities.
In 1995, the voters within the City of San Buenaventura (City of Ventura) passed an initiative
that requires an affirmative vote of the electorate for any General Plan amendment affecting
Agricultural designated land. In late-1998 and early 1999, the voters or the city council of the
cities of Camarillo, Moorpark, Oxnard, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, as we11 as the
unincorporated area of the County, approved similar initiatives/ordinances. The City of Santa
Paula followed suit in 2000 and the City of Fillmore in 2002. These initiatives and ordinances
became collectively known as Save Open-space and Agricultural Resources (SOAR) ordinances.
With the exception of San Buenaventura, which requires a public vote to amend land designated
Agricultural, the SOAR ordinances establish urban boundaries around each city, outside of
which urban development and/or the extension of urban services can occur only with voter

 Section THREE                                                                           Planning Process
 approval. Most of the city SOAR ordinances remain in effect until 2020. The ordinances for lhe
 Cities of San Buenaventura and Thousand Oaks are in effect until 2030.
 The County of Ventura has twenty-five zoning designations in which some form of residential
 use is allowed. The General Plan's Land use Appendix describes the various zones and the
 residential uses allowed in each zone .
 The Planning Division processed two changes to the Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance for second
 dwelling units concurrent with the 20 I 0 Housing Element revisions. The first change allows
 second dwelling units of up to 1.800 square teet. (up to four bedroom) on parcels of 40 acres or
greater. The seconrl change allows second dwelling units on non-confom1ing parcels that are
 I 0,000 square feet or more. Prior to the amendment. parcels that were non-conforming as to the
 minimum parcel size requirements of the zone had to be '.W.000 square feet or more in order to
 be eligible for a second dwelling unit. These changes do not apply to parcels located in the
Arroyo Santa Rosa/Tierra Rejada Groundwater Quality Impact Area or the Ojai Traffic Lmpact
 Area. The existing. and more restrictive standards defined in Sec. 8107- l. 7 of the Non-Coastal
Zoning Ordinance. apply ro parcels located in these impact Areas.
For the most part development trends for Ventura County have remained consistent from the
20 I 0 Ml-IMP to this 20 15 MHMP ; growth is encouraged within the incorporated cities. and
protection of open space and agricultural land is a priority. Therefore, there have been no major
changes in development trends since the last plan, the 20 I 0 MHMP.
3.3         MHMP UDPATE PROCESS
The local hazard mitigation planning requjrements to document the planning process are as
follows:

 AL Does the Plan document the planning process, including hO\\ it was prepared and who was involved in the
 process for each jurisdiction'? (RequirementÂ§ 20 I .6(c)( I))
In March 2015, the Ventura County Sheriffs Office of Emergency Services (Ventura County
Sheriffs OES) kicked off the 2015 MHMP update process. For the 2015 MHMP update, the
Ventura County Project Management Team included Dale Carnathan and Kevin McGowan from
the Ventura County Sheriffs OES and Brian Trushinski from the Ventura County Watershed
Protection District. The major tasks the Ventura County Project Management Team is
responsible for include preparing for the project kick-off. developing the public outreach process,
coordinating and developing planning committee meetings. and providing input to ancl review of
plan deliverables. The Ventura County Project Management Team will also be responsible for
maintaining the plan. Table 3-4 shows the key planning tasks and the timeline associated with
each task.

Similar to the past two versions of the plan, a MHMP Committee was fanned to help guide
<.kvelopment of the 2015 MHMP . Th1.: membership of the 2010 MHMP Conunittec was used as a
starting point for the 2015 MHMP Committee. The 2015 MHMP Committee includes staff from
relevant County departments and agencies, representatives fo r each participating city and special
district, and other entities including Cal OES. The 2015 MHMP Committee is shown in
Table 3-5. Committee meetings (including time, date, location, and agenda) were listed on the
2015 MHMP website and were open to the public for any interested stakeholders to attend.
The MHMP Committee met two times during the plan update process to discuss the following:
    â¢    April 9, 2015: introduction of the project; overview of hazard mitigation planning in
         general; climate change; 2010 critical facilities and infrastructure review; 20 I 0 capability

4.1        OVERVIEW
A hazards analysis includes identifying, screening, and profiling each hazard. The hazards
analysis encompasses natural. human-caused. and technological hazards. Natural hazards result
from unexpected or uncontrollable natural events of signjficant size and destructive power.
Human-caused hazards result from hw11an activity and include technological hazards.
Technological hazards are generally accidental or result from events with unintended
consequences (for example. an accidental hazardous materials release).
This hazards analysis consists of the following rwo steps:
    â¢   Hazard identification and screening
    â¢   Hazard profiles
4.2       HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND SCREENING
As the initial step in this hazards analysis. the Ventura County Project Management Tean1 and
planning committees reviewed the list of hazards identified in the 2010 MHMP and considered
the following factors:
    â¢   Is the hazard included in the 2010 MHMP?
    â¢   Is the hazard included in the Ventura County General Plan: Hazard Appendix (2013)?
    â¢   ls the hazard included in the 2013 State of California MHMP?
    â¢   Has the hazard occurred in Ventura County and been declared a Presidential or state
        emergency or disaster in the past 15 years?
Based on the above analysis, the Ventura County Project Management Team and plannjng
conu11ittees detem1ined that all hazards identified in the 2010 MHMP should be included in the
2015 MHMP. In addition, it was decided that two additional hazards, climate change and
drought, should be profiled in the 2015 MHMP, based on recent disaster declarations and
hazards addressed in the 2013 State of California Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan.
As such, the fo llowing 12 hazards are profiled in the 2015 MHMP.
    â¢   Agricultural Biological                           â¢    Landslide
    â¢   Climate Change                                    â¢    Levee Failure Inundation
    â¢   Dam Failure Inundation                            â¢    Post-Fire Debris Flow
    â¢   Drought                                           â¢    Tsunami
    â¢   Earthquake                                        â¢    Wildfire
    â¢   Flood                                             â¢    Winter Storm
Hazards that were brought up for discussion. but were not included in the 2015 MHMP should
be re-reviewed for possible inclusion in the ne)...1 (2020) iteration of the plan. Ventura County
wiU continue to assess these hazards and as whether or not they are appropriate to include in the
County 's hazard mitigation plan. The hazards to be re-reviewed are listed below.
                                                                                                  4-1

         Hazard                                                 Description
                      Hazardous materials are substances that may have negative effects on health or the
                      environment. Exposure to hazardous materials may cause injmy, illness, or death.
    Hazardous
                      Recent hazardous materials re leases in Ventura County include the Mission Incident
    Materials
                      (Santa Paula) and the Cochran Incident (Simi Valley). The California Accidental
    Release
                      Release Prevention (CalARP) program is intended to prevent accidental releases of
                      substances and to minimize the damage if releases do occur.
                      An epidemic is when a disease affects a dispro portionately large number of ind ividuals
                      within a population, community, or region at the same time. The recent measles
    Epidemic
                      outbreak (of which a few cases were identified in Ventura County) and Ebola scare
                      he ightened awareness of an epidemic.
                      Train derailments are of most concern when there are volatile or flammable substances
                      on the train and when the train is in a highly populated area Recent incidents in Ventura
    Train
                      County include the Metrolink incident in Oxnard and the derailment that occurred in
    Derailment
                      Chatsworth. The concern is also heightened by reports of potential transport of Bakken
                      crude oil on railways within California
                      A cyber-attack is deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent
                      enterprises, and networks. Cyber-attacks use malicious code to a lter computer code,
    Cyber-Attack      logic, or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to
                      cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft. Cyber-attack is an ongoing concern
                      that has been increasing in frequency and magnitude.
                      Aircraft incidents include the Alaska Air crash off the coast of Ventura County in 2000.
                      Efforts directed at preparedness, planning, response, and mitigation of an aircraft
    Aircraft Incident incident is generally coordinated, maintained, and exercised by local area airports, along
                      with area fire departments. The Federal Aviation Administration has authority over
                      events resulting from this hazard.
                      A civil disturbance results from civil unrest, when individua ls or groups in the genera l
                      population feel they are being discriminated against or that their rights are not being
                      upheld. Civil disturbance spans a variety of actions includ ing strikes. demo nstrations.

 4.3.1      Agricultural Biological
 Natu re: Agricultural infestation generally involves the a11ificial introduction of an insect,
 disease. vertebrate. or weed pest. These pests are particularly destructive to the local agricultural
 crops because they have no natural enemies to keep them under control. The type and severity of
 an agricultural infestation will vary based on many factors. including weather. crop diversity, and
 proximity to urban areas .
 The onset for an agricultural infestation can be rapid . Controlling its spread is critical to Limiting
 the impacts of the infestation. Methods for detecting, limiting, and eradicating exotic pests
 include delimitation trapping. quarantining the area and preventing the shipment of products
 from the designated area, aerial and ground application of pesticides, and in extreme cases,
 premature harvest and/or crop destruction. Duration is largely affected by the degree to which
 the infestation is aggressively controlled, but is commonly more than 1 week. The warning time
 needed to control infestation is typically more than 24 hours. Maximizing warning time is also
 critical for reducing damage from this hazard.
 The County's agriculture industry provides a very significant base to the County's economy. The
 agricultural output of Ventura County in 2013 reached almost $2.1 billion annually and
 encompasses more than 92,000 acres of irrigated cropland. Ventura County is one of the top 10
 agricultural counties in California. The impact of infestation of a particular pest or disease would
 include economic losses due to crop losses from pest damage, limitations on the ability to export
 products from the area, and increased costs for pest control. The diversity and location of crops
produced in the County is shown on Figure F-1 (Appendix F). Many of the agricultural areas shown
 may be affected by the insect pests and agriculture biological diseases described in this section.
 Many pests not only daniage the agricultural economy but also affect residential areas and open
space. Damage to landscape plants and vegetable gardens can be significant. Pests such as the
gypsy moth danrnge primarily hardwood trees in open space areas such as Oak Woodlands.
 History: In 1994, the Mediterranean fruit fly affected 11 counties in California, including
Ventura County. The loss in Ventura County was about $22 million. In 2007, four gypsy moths
were trapped in Ojai; then in October 2008. a 5-square-mile quarantine area was established in
the City of Ojai, centered around two egg mass sites on South Rice Road. Since 2008, no gypsy
moths have been detected. ln 2007 and 2008. the charcoal rot disease suddenly affected
strawberry plants in several fields throughout Ventura County, but the loss of crops was limited.
The fungus was limited when growers routinely fumigated fields, but because of restrictions on
some fumigation chemicals, many growers have turned to less-potent chemical alternatives.
Fields afflicted by charcoal rot have typically been fumigated for several successive seasons with
these less-potent chemicals; the effectiveness of the chemicals is still being detern1ined. Research
is underway in Ventura County on epidemiology and fungicide treatment.
The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) pest, whjch carries Huanglongbing (HLB) disease, was identified
in San Diego County in 2008, and by 2009 was also found in Imperial, Orange, and Los Angeles
counties. All of Ventura County was declared under quarantine for ACP and HLB in December
2010. There have been zero detections of HLB in Ventura County.
Location: Ventura County's agricultural areas are most susceptible to insect pests and
agriculture biological diseases, such as those described above. The County ' s fann landscape is

 illustrated on Figure F-1 (Appendix F) . In addition to agricultural areas. the entire county is
susceptible co the gypsy moth. In 2008. a quarantine area for the gypsy moth was centered on
a 6-square-mile area in Ojai. ln the spring of 2009. hundreds of gypsy moth traps were placed in
 the same area; no adult gypsy moths were detected in 2009. Visual inspection in the quarantined
area began in the fall of 2009: the regulatory quarantine enfo rceme nt ceased on October 4. 20 I 0

 Extent: Future agri cu ltura l infestations in Ventura County are ljkely based on past occurrences.
 Based on previous history. infestations causi ng widespread damage ha\ e occurred about once
every 10 to 20 years. Another fac tor increas ing the likelihood of future infestations is the mild
climate in Ventura County. which increases the ability of pests to proliferate. However. the
extent and probability of a devastating event are unknown. Other facto rs that influence
agricultural infesta tions arc described below.
Injurious pests commonly enter Ventura County in a number of ways. [hey may. fo r example.
be inadvertentl y shipped by a private indi vidual in an infested plant. fruit. or vegetable. When the
package is received and the article is found to contain pests, the recipient throws it out and the
pests multiply and infest nearby agricultural crops or urban properties. Pests can also travel
easily on plants and plant parts shipped from uncertified and unlicensed nurseries; on plants
offered for sale at swap meets and other open air markets; or in vehicles or luggage. Inspectors
from the Agricultural Commissioner' s office ins pect incoming plants at nurseries, farmerÂ·s
markets, and swap meets to check fo r the presence o f pests not occ urring in this area. As the state
of California experi ences budget shortfall s. the us ual points of entry at the state border are no
longer staffed w ith inspectors. so this program at the local level becomes one of the main lines o f
defense against injurious pests.
Methyl bromide has been the fumigant of choice fo r controlling soil-borne in cct and disease
pests in many of the countyÂ·s highest value crops. including bell peppers, tomatoes. berries
(including strawberries, raspberries, and bluebe1Ties). and cut flowers. With the phase out of
methyl bromide. control o f diseases s uch as charcoal rot will depend on the a ailabili ty of
alternati ve methods. including fumigant s s uch as choropicrin, 13 -dichloro propene, meta.ml
potassium sodium, and methyl iodide.
Probability of Future Events: The probability and extent o f a devastating event would depend
on many factors. including the specific pest introduced, climactic conditions al the time o f
introduction. nuctuations in funding fo r pest detection and eradication. and public pressure
regarding aerial and ground applications of pesticides proximate to urban areas.

 4.3.2     Climate Change
 Natu re: Climate is defined as the average statistics of weather, wb ich includes temperature.
 precipitation, and seasonal patterns in a pru1icular region. Climate change refers to a long-tenn
 and irrevocable shift in weather-related patterns. either regionally or more globally. The Earth
and its natural ecosystem are closely tied to the climate, and any pem1anent climate change will
 lead to an imbalance in the existing ecosystem, impacting the way people live, the food they
grow. their health. the wildlife. the availability of water. and many other aspects. Research
indicates that much of this warming is due to human activities-primarily burning fossil fuels
and clearing forests- that release carbon dioxide (C02 ) and other gases into the atmosphere,
trapping heat that would otherwise escape into space. Once in the atmosphere, these heat-
trapping emissions remain there for many years-C02, for example, lasts about 100 years. If left
unchecked, by the end of the century C02 concentrations could reach levels three times higher
 than the levels in pre-industrial times.
According to most climatologists, the planet is starting to experience shifts in climate patterns
and an increased frequency of extreme weather events at both the global level and the local level.
Over the next century, increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are expected to
cause a variety of changes to local climate conditions, including sea-level rise and storn1 surges
in coastal areas; reduced mountain snowpack; increased riverine flooding throughout the county;
more frequent, higher temperatures (leading to extreme heat events and wildfires), particularly
inland; decreasing air quality; and extended periods of drought.
These effects of climate change are expected to negatively impact water and electricity demand
and supplies in Ventura County. Also. rising sea levels will threaten cities along the Ventura
County coast and its rivers, decreasing air quality and extreme heat days will degrade public
health, wildfire risk will increase (particularly in the grassland hills and mountainous areas of the
County), and the County' s over $2 billion agricultural industry could decline significantly.
History: The history of the scientific discovery of climate change began in the early nineteenth
century, when ice ages and other natural changes in paleoclimate were first suspected and the
natural greenhouse effect was first identified. In the late nineteenth century, scientists first
argued that human emissions of greenhouse gases could change the climate. Many other theories
of climate change were advanced. involving forces from volcanism to solar variation. In the
 1960s, the warming effect of C0 2 gas became increasingly convincing, although some scientists
also pointed out that human activities, in the form of atmospheric aerosols (e.g., "pollution"),
could have cooling effects as well. During the 1970s, scientific opinion increasingly favored the
wanning viewpoint. By the 1990s. as a result of improving fidelity of computer models and
observational work confim1ing the Milankovitch theory of ice ages, a consensus position formed:
greenhouse gases were deeply involved in most climate changes. and human emissions were
bringing serious global wan11ing.
Since the 1990s, scientific research on climate change has included multiple disciplines and has
expanded, significantly increasing our understanding of causal relations, links with l1istorical
data, and our ability to numerically modeJ climate change. The most recent work has been
sunm1arized in the Assessment Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). Climate change is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of
weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. It may be a change in
average weather conditions or in the distribution of weather around the average conditions (i.e.,

 Section FOUR                                                                     Hazards Analysis
 more or fewer extreme weather events). Climate change is caused by factors that include oceanic
 processes (such as oceanic circulation), biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by
 Earth. plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions, and human-induced alterations of the natural world.
 This last type of effect is currently causing global warming, and "climate change" is often used to
 describe human-specific impacts.

 with specific effects and their severity focused in particular parts of the County (e.g., coastal
 inundation from rising tides and stom1 surge.) Figures F-2 and F-3 (Appendix F) show projected coastal
 inundation areas in 2030 from rising tides and combined stom1 floods. which can result in coastal
 erosion, fluvial storm flooding, wave impacts, and coastal stonn floods. The County will also
 experience increases in wildfire risk in hillside and mountainous areas and an increase in riverine
 flooding along ri vers and creeks.
 Extent: The extent of climate risk includes Combined Coastal Storm Hazard Zones of
 28.43 square miles and a Rise Tide Inundation Area of 6.49 square miles. Under a low emissions
 scenario, wildfire risk could increase roughly two- to fourfold from its current extent in
 mountainous and hillside areas of the County, and average temperatures could rise four to
 six degrees Fahrenheit by 2080, resulting in a l 7 percent decrease in mountain snowpack.
 Countywide, the Mediterranean seasonal precipitation pattern is expected to continue, with most
 precipitation falling during winter from North Pacific storms. One of the four climate models
 projects slightly wetter winters, and another projects slightly drier winters with a l 0 to 20 percent
 decrease in total annual precipitation. However, even modest changes would have a significant
 impact because California ecosystems are conditioned to historical precipitation levels and water
resources are nearly full y utilized.
Probability of Future Events: The specific probability of the extent and frequency of climate
change-induced impacts is uncertain and depends on various climate-modeling assumptions.
Although there is some uncertainty about the rate of climate change and the severity and
frequency of extreme weather events, the JPCC, in its Fifth Assessment of climate change
(2014), concluded that:
      ... warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the
     observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and
     ocean have wam1ed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen.,
     and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased .... It is extremely likely that
     human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed wam1ing since the mid-
     20th century.
  California Governor Jerry Brown, in his Executive Order B-30-15, reiterated the 2014 IPCC
  finding and further stated that:
     ... climate change poses an ever-growing threat to the well-being, public health, natural
     resources, economy, and the environment of California, including loss of snowpack,
     drought, sea level rise, more frequent and intense wildfires, heat waves, more severe
     smog, and hann to natural and working lands, and these effects are already being felt in
     the state ...
The consensus of the scientific community-and the position of the State of Cali fornia-is
that climate change is occurring and will continue to occur. perhaps at an increasing rate.

 Dam failure may be caused by a variety of natural events. hwnan-cause<..1 events. or a
combination thereof. Dam failure usually occurs when the spiJlway capacity is inadequate and
water overtops the dam. or when internal erosion through the dan1 foundation occurs (also
known as piping). Factors contributing to dam failure events may include structural deficiencies
 from poor initial design or construction. lack of maintenance or repair. and the gradual
weakening of the dam through the normal aging process.
History: Although it was located elsewhere. the failure or one dan1 had catastrophic effects in
Ventura County. The t. Francis Dam in the San Francisquitos Canyon in Los Angeles County
(wi thin the Santa Clara Ri,er watershed) was constructed to provide 38.000 acre-feet of storage
 for water from the Los Angdes-Owens River Aqueduct. The midnight collapse of the dam in
March 1928 occwTed al'ter the newly constrncted concrete-arch dam was completely filled for
the first time. The resulting (lood swept through the Santa Clara Valley in Ventura County
toward rhe Pacific Ocean. about 54 miles away. At its peak, the wall of water was reported to be
78 feet high ; by the time it hit Santa Paul a. 42 miles south of the dan1. the water was estimated to
be 15 feet deep. Almost C\erything in its path was destroyed. including structures. railways.
bridges. livestock. and orchards. By the time the nood subsided. parts of Ventura County lay
under 70 feet of mud and debris. Nearly 500 people were killed, and damage estimates exceeded
$20 million. The communities of Piru. Fillmore. Santa Paula. Bardsdale. Sa ti coy. Montalvo. and
El Rio sustained exten sin~ life and property loss from the flood.
There is no record of a failure of any dam located in Ventura County.
Location: Table -i-t includes the name. year built. capacity. and type l'or the dams that
constitute failure hazards fo r Ventura County.
Figure F--'A (Appendi x F) shows the name. location. and extent of the dam failure inundation areas
for every dan1 failure that would affoct Ventura Count). It is not anticipated that every dam would fail at
the same time: this map is designed to simply pro\'ide an approximate assessment of total risk for
the County. Figure F--iB (Appendix F) illustrates dam failure inundation areas for particular dams. In some
instances. if one dam foil s there is potential that another dam downstream will also Cail (for
example if the Pyramid Dam fails. the Santa Fe licia Dam will likely fail too). Figure F-48 (Appendix F)
does not illustrate cw11ulative effects. Additional information on specific dam inundation areas may be
obtained from the agency that owns the dam. The map shows that dam failures may occur
outside Ventura Count y but still pose a threat of inundation within the County. In particular, if
dan1s in the Santa Clara River watershed in Los Angeles County fail. the resulting flood \VOuld

 * This table includes federal dams and reservoirs that are in the State of California but are not under state jurisdiction.
Extent: FEMA characterizes a dam as a high hazard if it stores more than 1,000 acre-feet of
water, is taller than 150 feet, and has the potential to cause downstream property damage. The
hazard ratings for dams are set by FEMA and confirmed with site visits by engineers. Most dams
in the county are characterized by increased hazard potential because of downstrean1

The Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD) regulates state-size dan1s and inspects them annually to
ensure that they are in good operating condition. Also, as required by DSOD regulations, the
flood inundation limits resulting from a dan1 breach during the design storm are established for
each state-size dam. The resultant maps contain flood-wave arrival time estimates and flood
inundation areas. Â·1hese maps are developed by Cal OES and provided to DSOD and local
conununities. Inundation areas are shown in T able 4-2.

 4.3.4      Drought
 Nature: Drought is a nom1al. recunent feature of virtually all climatic zones, including areas of
 both high and low rainfall, although the characteristics of a drought will vary significantly from
 one region to another. There is no universally accepted quantitative definition of drought from a
 scientific or engineering point of view. However, in common tem1s drought is defined as natural
 deficit of water supply in a region due to below-average precipitation over a seasonal period or
 several years, causing a serious hydrological imbalance that results in biological losses and/or
 economic losses. Drought differs from nom1al aridity, which is a pem1anent feature of the
 climate in areas of low rainfall. Drought is the result of a natural decline in the expected
 precipitation over an extended period, typically one or more seasons in length. Other climatic
characteristics (e.g., high temperature, high wind, low relative hwnidity) impact the severity of
drought conditions.
 Four scientific/engineering definitions of drought are listed below:
     â¢   Meteorological drought is defined solely by the degree of dryness, expressed as a
         departure of actual precipitation from an expected average or normal an1ount based on
         monthly, seasonal, or annual time scales.
     â¢   Hydrological drought relates to the effects of precipitation shortfalls on stream flows and
         reservoir, lake, and groundwater levels.
     â¢   Agricultural drought is defined principally in tem1s of soil moisture deficiencies relative
         to the water demands of plant life, usually crops.
     â¢   Socioeconomic drought associates the supply and demand of economic goods or services
         with elements of meteorological, hydrologic, and agricultural drought. Socioeconomic
         drought occurs when the demand for water exceeds the supply as a result of weather-
         related supply shortfall.
A drought's severity depends on numerous factors. including duration, intensity, and geographic
extent as well as regional water supply demands by humans and vegetation. Due to its multi-
dimensional nature, drought is difficult to define in exact tem1s and thus poses difficulties in
tem1s of comprehensive risk assessments.
Drought differs from other natural hazards in three ways. First, both the onset and the end of a
drought are difficult to detem1ine due to the slow accumulation and lingering effects of an event
after its apparent end. Second, the lack of an exact and universally accepted definition of drought
adds to confusion about its existence and severity. Third , in contrast with other natural hazards,
the impact of drought is less obvious and may be spread over a large geographic area. These
characteristics have hindered the preparation of drought contingency or mitigation plans by many
governments.
The effects of drought increase with duration as more moisture-related activities are impacted.
Non-irrigated croplands are most susceptible to precipitation shortages. Rangeland and irrigated
agricultural crops may not respond to moisture shortage as rapidly, but yields during periods of
drought can be substantially affected. During periods of severe drought lower moisture in plant
and forest fuels create an increased potential for devastating wildfires. fn addition, lakes,
reservoirs, and rivers can be subject to water shortages that impact recreational opportunities,
irrigated crops, availability of water supplies for activities such as fire suppression and human
                                                                                                 4- 11

Ventura County and roughly half of the State of California remained classified in the rughest

Drought impacts the residents. businesses. agriculture. and environmental resources of Ventura
County. T he current drought has:
  Affected the County's abil ity to meet drinking water demands.
    - Groundwater has been limited and wells have run dry in certain areas of the County.
      As a result water agencies that typically get their water from wells ha\ e had to start
      purchasi ng Lake Casi tas Water. Lake Casitas is an important. but dwindling resource.

            Recharge to the Ventura River Basin is almost exclusively from Ventura River now.
           The basin is relatively shallow and responds quickly to rainfall or lack thereof. Due to
           the drought. the City of Ventura has lost 70% of its normal Ventura River supply.
           Ventura County typically receives all of its imported water from the State Water
           Project (SWP). Because the County is at the westernmost extent of Metropolitan
           Water District's service area. there is very limited infrastructure to deliver Colorado
           River water to the area.
     â¢ Prevented the region from meeting existing agricultural demands.
           Due to the drought, pumping reductions have been established. Some agricu ltural
           users have supplemented reduced supplies by increased purchases of recycled water.
           but alternate supplies are not available to many farms. For some, this has resulted in
           fewer crop rotations. There is also a concern, that worst case scenario, some growers
           may choose to permanently leave the region.
     â¢ Put the region as risk of not meeting ecosystem water demands.
           Endangered species are further stressed by low flow conditions. Downstream of Lake
           Casitas, the Ventura River and ecological resources are stressed due to low flows. A
           particularly sensitive resource is the steelhead.
     â¢ Affected drinking water Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)
           The water needed to meet primary MCLs is dwindling. According to the United
           Water Conservation District, the highest nitrate concentrations are often observed
           during drought periods when nitrogen inputs continue but the diluting influence of
           natural and artificial recharge is reduced.
          The drought could cause Lake Casitas water quality to exceed secondary drinking
           water standards related to manganese. As low dissolved oxygen levels affect more of
           the lake, more manganese will be release from lake sediments.
     â¢ Exacerbated groundwater overdraft.
          Groundwater is the single largest water source for Ventura County, providing about
          65% of supplies. Releases from Lake Piru are typically managed to recharge
          groundwater basins. Lack of surface water and SWP water have dropped Lake Piru
           below deadpool, and groundwater recharge has been severely curtailed.
          The Oxnard Plain Forebay is the primary recharge area for the Oxnard Plain Pressure
          Basin. Changes in storage in the Forebay change the hydrostatic pressure in the
          Oxnard Plain Pressure Basin. When groundwater falls below sea level in the Forebay,
          there is significant seawater movement inland.
          The Oxnard Plain Pressure Basin is the largest and most complicated of the basins in
          Ventura County. Before the drought, this basin was considered to be in overdraft. As a
          result of the lack of surface water and precipitation to recharge the Forebay, overdraft
          in the Oxnard Plain Pressure Basin has been severely exacerbated. As groundwater
          elevations reach historic lows, the risk of subsidence increases.
          The southern coastal portion of the Pleasant Valley Basin has been in overdraft for
          many years. Like in the Oxnard Plain Pressure Basin, as groundwater levels decline,

            there is greater sal ine intrnsion. The US Geological Survey has also identified the
            Pleasant Valley Basin as susceptible to subsidence as groundwater pumping increases.
Probability of Future Events: The ability to reliably predict drought conditions at seasonal or
annual timescales is very limited. According to the California Department of Water Resources.
the status of El nifio-Soulhern oscillation (EnSo) conditions is currently the only factor that can
offer some predictabil ity to the onset of drought. Strong la njfia (warm) conditions of EnSo tend
to favor a drier outlook for California. Therefore. based on previous la nina conditions. drought
conditions may exist in Ventura County every 3 to 10 years.

 4.3.5      Earthquake
 Nature: An earthquake is a sudden motion or trembling caused by a release of strain
 accumulated within or along the edge of the earthÂ· s tectonic plates. The effects of an earthquake
 can be felt far beyond the site of its occurrence. Earthquakes usually occur without warning and
 can cause massive damage and extensive casualties in a few seconds. Common effects of
 earthquakes are ground motion and shaking. surface fault ruptures , and ground failure. Ground
 motion is the vibration or shaking of the ground during an earthquake. When a fault ruptures,
 seismic waves radiate. causing the ground to vibrate. The severity of the vibration increases with
the amount of energy released and decreases with distance from the causative faul t or epicenter.
 Soft soils can amplify ground motions.
In addition to ground motion, several secondary natural hazards can occur from earthquakes,
such as the following:
     â¢   Surface Faulting is the differential movement of two sides of a fault at the earth's
         surface. Displacement along faults-both in terms of length and width- varies but can be
         significant (e.g., up to 20 feet), as can the length of the surface rupture (e.g., up to
         200 miles). Surface faulting can cause severe damage to linear structures, including
         railways. highways, pipelines, tunnels. and dams.
     â¢   Liquefaction occurs when seismic waves pass through saturated granular soil, distorting
         its granular structure. and causing some of the empty spaces between granules to
         collapse. Pore water pressure may also increase sufficiently to cause the soil to behave
         like a fluid for a brief period and cause deformations. Liquefaction causes lateral spreads
         (horizontal movements of commonly l 0 to 15 feet, but up to 100 feet), flow failures
         (massive flows of soi l, typically hundreds of feet, but up to 12 miles), and loss of bearing
         strength (soil deformations causing structures to settle or tip). Liquefaction can cause
         severe damage to property. The California Geological Survey (CGS) Seismic Hazard
         Zone Maps illustrate areas prone to liquefaction; as shown in Figure F-5 {Appendix F).
         211.39 square miles of liquefaction areas of the saturated sandy soils of the Oxnard Plain
         and along the Santa Clara River Valley are prone to liquefaction.
     â¢   Landslides/Debris Flows occur as a result of horizontal seismic inertia forces induced in
         the slopes by the ground shaking. The most common earthquake-induced landslides
         include shallow, disrupted landslides such as rock fal ls, rockslides, and soil slides. Debris
         flows are created when surface soil on steep slopes becomes totally saturated with water.
        Once the soil liquefies, it loses the ability to hold together and can flow downhill at very
        high speeds, taking vegetation and/or structures with it. Slide risks increase after an
        earthquake during a wet winter.
The severity of an earthquake can be expressed in tem1s of intensity and magnitude. Intensity
measures the strength of shaking produced by the earthquake at a certain location. Intensity is
detem1ined from effects on people, structures and facil ities (roads, bridges, pipelines, etc.), and
the natural environment. Magnitude is the measure of the earthquake "strength," the energy
released at the source of the earthquake.
The two most common measures of earthquake intensity used in the United States are the
Modified Mercalli Â£ntensity Scale, which measures felt intensity. and peak ground acceleration
(PGA), which measures instrumental intensity by quantifying how hard the earth shakes in a

History : Although no large (M 5.0>) earthquakes have occurred recently within Ventura
County's boundaries, a number of relatively large earthquakes in other areas have caused
damage within the county. These earthquakes occurred in 1925 (Santa Barbara), 1927 (Point
Arguello), 1933 (Long Beach). 194 1 (Santa Barbara), 1952 (Tehachapi), 1971 (San Fernando),
and 1994 (Northridge). Additionally, damaging earthquakes occurred in the County in 1950
(north of Ojai). 1957 (Hueneme), 1963 (Camarillo). and 1973 (Point Mugu). The three most
recent events (San Fernando, Point Mugu, and Northridge) are discussed below. Figure F-6
(Appendix F ) illustrates historic earthquakes in the Ventura County region.
     â¢    San Fernando, M 6.5, February 9, 1971: This event was caused by oblique-slip reverse
          faulting in the San Fernando fault zone. The earthquake caused the destruction of freeway
          i_nterchanges, houses. and buildings and severe damage to three hospitals in the San
          Fernando Valley. The earthquake claimed 65 lives. Although the epicenter was within
          25 miles of Ventura County. damage sustained within the County was minor.
     â¢    Point M ugu, M 5.3, February 21, 1973: The Point Mugu earthquake was responsible
          for at least five injuries and more than $ 1 million danrnge in the Point Mugu- Oxnard
          area, though damage was confined mainly to the vicinity of the epicenter. Large boulders
          fell down onto State Route 1 at Point Mugu, partially blocking the road. More than 7,000
          customers lost electricity for several hours. Most reported damage was to windows,
          ceilings, plaster, chimneys, and shelved goods, though structural damage and broken
          pipes were also reported. Although much less powerful than the San Fernando earthquake
          of 1971 , the Point Mugu earthquake was simi lar in focal mechanism.
                                                                                                                     4-17

     â¢    No rthridge, M 6.7, J anuary 17, 199-': This blind thrnst earthquake occunÂ·ed along the
          Northridge thrust fault. It was the strongest earthquake instrumentally recorded in an
          urban selling in North America and caused parking structures. apartments. office
          buildings. and sections of freeways to collapse. Approximately 25.000 dwellings were
          rendered uninhabitable. Total damage exceeded $44 billion. The incident resulted in 51
          deaths.
 Location: As in most of southern and coastal Cali fornia. the potential for earthquake damage
 exists throughout Vemura County because of the nwnber of active faults within and near the
 county. These faults are shown on the COS Fault Activity Map of California. Descriptions of the
active faults are provided below. The locations of the active and potentially active faults are
shown on Figure F-7 (Appendix F) and Figure F-8 (Appendix F). Some of the more significant
 faults are described below:
     â¢    Malibu Coast fau lt system: The Malibu Coast fault system includes the Malibu Coast,
          Santa Monica, and Hollywood fau lts. The system begins in the Hollywood area, extends
         along the southern base of the Santa Monica Mountains, and passes offshore a few miles
          west of Point Dume. The 1973 Point Mugu earthquake, described in the previous section.
          is believed to have originated on this fault system.
     â¢    Oak Ridge fa ult system: The Oak Ridge fault system is a steep (65 degrees) southerly
         dipping reverse fault that extends from the Santa Susana Mountains westward along the
         southerly side of the Santa Clara River Valley and into the Oxnard Plain. The system is
         more than 50 miles long on the mainland and may extend an equal or greater distance
         offshore. Several recorded earthquake epicenters on land and offshore may have been
         associated with the Oak Ridge fault system. Portions of the system are zoned by the state
         as active.
     â¢   Pine Mountain thrust fault and Big Pine fau lt: These two large faults occur in the
         mountainous portion of Ventura County north of the Santa Ynez fault; the faults are
         located 9 and 16 miles north of the City of Ojai, respectively. The Pine Mountain thmst
         fault is reported to have ruptured the ground surface for a distance of 30 miles along its
         length during the northern Ventura County earthquakes of November 1852.
     â¢   San Andreas fault: San Andreas is the longest and most significant fault in California.
         Because of clearly established historical earthquake acti viry, this fault has been
         designated as active by the State of California. The last major earthquake on this fau lt
         near Ventura County was the Fort Tejon earthquake of 1857, which was estimated at
         M 8.0 and would have caused considerable damage if there had been structures in the
         southern part of the county. There is a 59 percent chance that an M 6.7 quake or larger
         will occur on this fault within the next 30 years.
    â¢    San Cayetano-Red Mountain-Santa Susana fault system: This fault system consists
         of a major series of north-dipping reverse fau lts that extend over 150 miles from Santa
         Barbara County into Los Angeles County. Within this system, the San Cayetano fault is
         the greatest hazard to Ventura County; it is a major, north-dipping reverse fault that
         extends for 25 miles along the northern portion of the Ventura Basin. The San Fernando
         earthquake of 1971. described in the previous section, was caused by activity along this
         fault.

    â¢    Simi-Santa Rosa fault system: This fault system extends from the Santa Susana
         Mountains westward along the northern margin of the Sirnj and Tierra Rejada valleys and
        along the southern slope and crest of the Las Posas Hills to their westerly tem1ination.
    â¢   Ventura-Pitas Point fauJt: The western half of this fault is known as the Pitas Point
         fault, and the eastern half is known as the Ventura fault. The Pitas Point fau lt extends
        offshore into the Pacific Ocean and is roughly 14 miles long. The Ventura fault extends
         into the communities of Ventura and Sea Cliff and runs roughly parallel to portions of
         U.S. 101 and State Route 126. The fault is roughly 12 miles long. The Ventura-Pitas
         Point fault is a left-reverse fault.
Extent: The strength of an earthquake's ground movement can be measured by PGA. PGA
measures the rate in change of motion relative Lo the established rate of acceleration due to
gravity (g = 980 centimeters per second, per second). PGA is used to project the risk of damage
from future eru1hquakes by showing earthquake ground motions that have a specified probability
(e.g., 10 percent, 5 percent, or 2 percent) of being exceeded in 50 years. The ground motion
values are used for reference in construction design for earthquake resistance and can also be
used to assess relative hazard between sites when making economic and safety decisions.
In 2008, CGS developed an updated map of ea1thquake shaking potential for Cal ifornia. The
map shows the relative intensity of ground shaking and damage in California from anticipated
future earthquakes. Regions near major. active faults are shown in red and pink and experience
stronger earthquake shaking more frequently. Regions that are distant from known. active faults
are shown in orange and yellow and experience lower levels of shaking less frequently.
Figure F-7 (Appendix F) and Figure F-8 (Appendix F) indicate the level of low-frequency shaking
potential in Ventura County (in which local soil conditions have greater effect on low frequency),
which includes 15.16 square miles of severe low frequency ground shaking potential; 659.67
square miles of extreme low frequency shaking potential; and 1, 157.57 square miles of a
violent low frequency shaking potential.
Probability of Future Events: Ongoing field and laboratory studies suggest the likely
maximum magnitudes and recurrence intervals for the major local faults shown in Table 4-5.

 4.3.6      Flood
 Nature: A fl ood occurs when the existing channel of a stream. ri ver. canyon, or other
 watercourse cannot contain excess runoff from rainfall or snowmclt. resulting in overflow onto
 adjacent lands. rn coastal areas. flooding may occur when high winds or tides result in a surge of
 seawater into areas chat are above the nom1al high tide line.
 A floodplain is the area adjacent to a watercourse or other body of water that is s ubj ect lo
 recurring floods. Floodplains may change over time as a result or natural processes. changes in
 the characteristics of a watershed_ or human activity such as construction of bridges or channels.
 In areas where flow contains a high sedi ment load. such as along the Santa Clara River in
 Ventura County. the course of a river or stream may shift dranrntically during a single flood
 event. Coastal floodplain s may also change over time as waves and currents alter the coastline.
 Secondary hazards from floods can incl ude :
     â¢    Erosion or scouring of strean1 banks, roadway embankmencs. foundations. footings for
          bridge piers. and other features.
     â¢    Impact damage to structures. roads. bridges. culverts, and other features from high-
         velocity fl ow and from debris carried by flo odwaters. Such debris may also accumulate
         on bridge piers and in culverts. increasing loads on these features or causing overtopping
         or backwater effects.
     â¢    Destruction o f crops, erosion of topso il. and depos ition of debris and sediment on
         croplands.
     â¢   Release of sewage and hazardous or toxic materials when was tewater treatment plants are
         inundated. storage tanks are damaged . and pipelines are se\ ere<l.
 In areas s uch as Ventura Counry that do not have extendt!d periods of below- freezing
temperatures or significant snowfall, flood s usually occur during the season of highest
precipitation or during heavy rainfalls after prolonged <lry periods. Vcntura County is dry during
the late sp1ing. s ummer. and early fa ll and receives most o f its rain during the winter months.
T he rainfall season extends from November through April. with approximately 95 percent of the
annual rain fall occurring during this period. T he a verage annual rainfall in Ventura County
ranges from less than 8 inches in the Cuyama VaJl ey in northwestern Ventura County to
38 inches in the Ventura River warershed west of the C ity of Ojai. Along the coast near Oxnard.
San Buenaventura. Simi Valley. and Thousand Oaks. the average rainfall is approximately
 14 inches.
The prevai ling weather patterns during the winter and the orientation of the mountain ranges in
the northern half of the co unty combine to produce extremely high-intensity rainfall. The peak
hi storic rainfall intensity recorded by a Ventura County rain gage occuffed on Februar) 12. 1992.
A rainfall intcns iry of approximately 4 inches per hour was measured during a 15-minute period
at the Wheeler Gorge gage. approximately .., miles northeast of Matilija Dam . Such intensities
can produce severe fl ooding conditions. particularly in small watersheds where fla sh floods are
likely.
Flas h floods are particularly dangerous. NWS defines a tlash fl ood as one in which the peak flo w
travels the length of a watershed within a 6-hour period. These fl oods ari se when stom1s produce
a high volume o f rainfall in a short peri od over a 'vVatershed where runoff collects quickJy. They

are likely to occur in areas with steep s lopes and sparse vegetation. They o ften strike with little
warning and are accompanied by high-veloci ty flow.
History: Damaging floods in Ventura County were reported as early as 1862. A 1945 report by
the Ventura County Flood Control District reported that floods o f sullicient magnitude to cause
extensive danrnge occurred in 1862. 1867. 1884. 19 11. 19 14. 1938. 1941. 1943. and 1944.
The largest and most damaging natural flood s recorded in the Santa Clara and Venrura
watersheds occurred in January and February of 1969. The January flood was a result of the
highest monthly precipitati on total ever recorded in Ventura County at that time. The February
fl ood was a result of intense rainfall similar in magnitude to the rainfall that caused the record-
breaking flood in January. The combined effects of the 1969 floods were disastrous: 13 people
lost their lives. and property damage was estimated at $60 million ( 1969 dollars). Homes in
Casitas Springs. Li ve Oak Acres, and Fillmore were flooded, and 3,000 residents in Santa Paula
and several families in Fillmore were evacuated twice. A break in the Santa Clara River levee
threatened the C ity of Oxnard . Agricu ltural land. primarily citrus g roves. was seriously damaged
or destroyed. A ll over the county. transportation faci lities. including roads. bridges. and railroad
tracks. were damaged . The Fillmore. Oak View. and Ventura sewage treatment plants were
severely damaged and dumped raw sewage into the Santa C lara and Ventura rivers. The
untreated sewage polluted the ri vers and the beaches at their outlets into the ocean. In addition.
sewer trunk lines were broken along the Ventura River and its tributary. an Antonio Creek.
   us pended sediment concentrations and discharge in many streams greatly exceeded any
previously measured leve ls in the flood-affected areas. Suspended sedi ment concentrations
reached a maximum o f about 160,000 millig rams per liter in the Santa Clara Ri ver at Saticoy,
and the maximum daily sed iment discharge was 20 million tons during the storm peak (FEMA
10 I Oa).
Jn 1980. Calleguas Creek breached its levee in rhe Oxnard Plain and caused approx imately
$9 million {in 1980 dollars) in damage to the Po int Mugu aval B ase fro m Oooding and
sedime nt deposi tion . In addition, approximately 1.500 acres of farmland were covered by
floodwaters. The peak discharge was 9.3 10 cubic fccc per second at the Madera Road Bridge in
Simi Val ley.
In 1983, a federal disaster was declared because of storm damage. Re pairs to flood-control
fac ilities have been estim ated to cost $15 mi ll ion (in 1983 dollars). Improved channels in
Moorpark and Simi Valley suffered severe damage from erosion during this event. and Calleguas
Creek experienced record flooding. Damage to other public and pri\ate facilities has been
esti mated at approximately $39 million. with little more than half of that total due 10 damage to
agricultural lands.

  January 1995         On January 9 and 10, the region was subjected to an intense winter storm that produced more
                       than 6 inches of rain in some areas. A major Disaster Declaration was declared for all but one
                       county throughout California on January 10, 1995.
  January through      A second powerful winter storm brought heavy rain, heavy snow. and strong winds
  March 1995           throughout much of California from mid-January to mid-March. On January 13, a Major
                       Disaster Declaration was declared for nearly half the counties in California.
 December 1996        A series of subtropical storms hit California from late December through early January,
 through January      resulting in one of the wettest Decembers on record. On January 4, 1997, a Major Disaster
 1997                 Declaration was declared for half of the counties in California, including Ventura County.
 February 1998        El niilo conditions led to extensive flooding throughout California. A Major Disaster
                       Declaration was declared for more than 30 counties, including Ventura County. Countywide
                      damages exceeded $50 million.
 December 2004        A powerful Pacific storm brought heavy rain, snow, flash flooding, high winds, and
 through January      landslides to Central and Southern California. During the multi-day event, rainfall totals
 2005                 ranged from 3 to 10 inches over coastal areas, with up to 32 inches in the mountains. A Major
                      Disaster Declaration was declared on February 4, 2005, for multiple counties, including
                      Ventura County.
 Location: Figure F-9 (Appendix F) shows the locations of areas likely to flood and types of
 flooding in Ventura County, including:
      â¢   Upland flooding: The mountainous terrain of northern Ventura County and the hills in
          the central and eastern parts of the county give rise to numerous annual streams, many
          draining into steep canyons. These streams are subject to floods of relatively short
          duration, often following high-intensity rainfall. Such floods may occur with little
          warning and carry large quantities of sediment and debris. Communities adjacent to the
          upland areas, such as Fillmore, Ojai, Piru, and Santa Paula, are subject to this hazard.
          Many of the watersheds in question contain dams or basins designed to attenuate flow
          and trap debris, reducing the effects on downstream communities.
     â¢    Broad floodplains: The watersheds of the Santa Clara River (watershed area of
          1,650 square miles), Ventura River (watershed area of226 square miles), and Calleguas
          Creek (watershed area of 325 square miles) drain to the broad coastal plain in the
          southern part of Ventura County. Tfo s plain is subject to inundation during longer
          intervals ofrain, typically as the result of a series of winter stom1s. These floods typically
         have longer duration and may be forecast with more warning time. The Santa Clara River
         Valley, which crosses central Ventura County, is also subject to flooding. Numerous
         levees have been built to protect the agricultural lands along the river; because of its
         sediment load, the river has historically migrated across the valley floor during flooding
         intervals. The levees are typically not sufficient to withstand severe flood events.
     â¢   Coastal flooding: The County's 43 mile coastline is subject to tidal flooding, stonn
         surge, and wave action, all of which usually occur during winter stom1s. Areas that are
         susceptible to severe wave action are generally confined to a narrow area immediately

        However. the eftects of coastal flooding can be severe-in addition to wave action. beach
        and bluff erosion can cause sign ificant dan1age to coast-side homes and infrastructure.
        Coastal flooding may also occur as the result of tsunamis. which are extreme tidal surges
        caused by distant earthquakes or massive undersea landslides. ln addition to fl ooding.
        winter coastal storms can cause minor coastal erosion along the shores of Ventura
        County. Coastal erosion is a natural process that occurs particularly in the winter, when
        coastal storms wear away land by wave action, tidal currents, or wave currents. Material
        deposited on beaches during the mild sununer and fall months gets redistTibuted by the
        waves. According to City of Ventura engineers, the majority of the sand is pulled just off
        coast and then comes back to shore over time. Although most receding sand stays fairly
        close to shore, some sand is driven south by currents until it reaches Hueneme Canyon, a
        large deep-water depression near the Port of Hueneme.
Unmapped flood hazard areas include numerous small channels. Agricultural drainage ditches
and urban drains cover much of the flatter parts and urban areas of Ventura County. Flooding in
these areas is due to high-intensity rainfall occurring over a very short period. The flooding is
usually shallow and mainly affects roadways and other low-lying areas. In particular, the
Hollywood Beach and Silver Strand residential coastal conununities have historically
experienced local ized flooding conditions primarily due to inadequate storm drainage
infrastructure and topography (hence, the "Zone B"/"Zone X-Shaded" FEMA designations on
the Flood Insurance Rate Maps [FIRMs] I Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map [DFIRMs]). These
residential coastal conununities (largely built out) are not currently mapped by FEMA in the
"Zone VE" coastal high hazard Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). These communities have
historically been mapped by FEMA as a Zone Band most recently under the DFRIRMs as a
Zone X-Shaded (500-year floodplain).
Repetitive flood hazard areas are discussed in Section S.S.
Natural and Beneficial Floodplain Functions: The county's floodplains drain into five
wetlands, described below. A wetland is an area of land whose soil is saturated with moisture
either pem1anently or seasonally. Such areas may also be covered partially or completely by
shallow pools of water. Wetlands include swamps, marshes, and bogs ~ the water found in
wetlands can be saltwater, freshwater, or a mixture of both.
    â¢   McGrath Lake Wetlands: Located on the western city limits of Oxnard, the McGrath
        Lake wetlands extend south from the Santa Clara River. A small lake within the wetlands
        helps to attract more than two hundred species of birds, including black-shouldered kites,
        northern harriers, owls, and herons; and special-status birds, including ospreys, white
        wagtails, black skimmers, and peregrine falcons. The Santa Clara Estuary Natural
        Preserve on the northern boundary of McGrath Lake Park offers a refuge fo r birds, and
        habitat for various burrowing animals. In April 201 O. the Nature Conservancy. the State
        of California. and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service purchased 141 acres of prime
        riparian habitat, agriculture fields. and fl oodplains within the McGrath Lake Wetlands to
        become pan of the Santa Clara River Parkway. The parkway was established to protect
        and restore the river' s floodplain and functions, and to provide recreational opportunities
        such as hiking and bi rd watching.

     â¢  Mugu Lagoon: The Mugu Lagoon is located within Point Mugu Naval Base. 8 miles
        sou theast of the City of Oxnard. The lagoon consists of 1,4 74 acres of wetlands.
        Calleguas Creek flows into the lagoon. In addition, there is a ridal connection tlu-ough an
        inlet in the barrier beach. There are high concentrations of banned pesticides found in
        lagoonÂ· s sediment. Consequently, the Navy has undertaken several wetland restoration
        projects since the mid- l 990s, resulting in the restoration of several acres of tidal
        mudflats, sandflats, channels. ponds. salt marsh, and sand islands. There are a number of
        special-status species that inhabit the lagoon. including Pacific loon, ashy and black
        storm petrels, American while and Cali fornia brown pelicans, double-crested cormorant,
        least hittem, w hite- faced ihis, fulvous whistl ing d uck , ha rlequin duck, BarrowÂ·s

       billed curlew, laughing gull, California gull, elegant tern, black tern, black skimmer,
       rhinoceros auklet, long-b illed savannah sparrow, and trico lored blackbird.
     â¢  Ormond Beach Wetlands: The Ormond Beach wetlands, located in the City of Oxnard
       between the Port of Hueneme and the Point Mugu Naval Base, support many rare plants
       and hundreds of species of migratory birds, including the endangered California least tern
       and Western snowy plover. However, a secondary metal smelter, operating at Onnond
       Beach over the past 40 years, created such a large amount toxic pollution that the site is
       now a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund Site. The California State
       Coastal Conservancy is spearheading efforts to permanently protect habitat and expand
       and restore the wetlands and, as of June 2010, had acquired 265 acres of the wetlands.
     â¢ Santa Clara River Estuary: The 49-acre Santa Clara River Estuary is located at the
        mouth of the Santa Clara River and the Pacific Ocean near the City of Ventura. The river
       drains a watershed of approximately 1,600 square miles. The City of Ventura's sewage
       treatment plant currently discharges up to 9 million gallons per day of tertiary treated
       wastewater into the Santa Clara River Estuary. This is one of the last remaining estuary
       discharges in California. The discharge is in conflict with the State Water Resources
       Control Board's Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of
       California (Resolution No. 74-43, 1974), which mandates that the discharge of municipal
       and industrial wastewaters to enclosed bays and estuaries be phased out. Exceptions to
       this policy are limited to ci rcumstances in whi ch the regional water quality control board
       finds that the treated wastewater enhances the quality of receiving waters above that
       which would occur in the absence of the discharge. The City of Ventura has been granted
       an exception since 1977 on the basis that the treatment plant's discharge enhanced fish
       and wildlife habitat and non-contact water recreation. However, more recent information
       regarding the relationship of the discharge to the ecological function of the estuary is
       considered to be lacking, and the issues associated with the treatment p lant's discharge
       include impacts of nutrient-rich water in the estuary and the artificial hydrology created
       by this volw11e of water. In addition, with this discharge, the lagoon fills up and breaches
       on a more frequent basis than it would under natural conditions. In 2008, the Los Angeles
       Regional Water Quality Control Board required the City of Ventura, as a condition to
       continue the current discharge practice, to perform three special studies to evaluate a
       variety of environmental solutions and estimate the needed financial investment for each
       solution. The studies have been completed and submitted to the Board for review.

    â¢   Ventura River Estuary: The 110-acre Ventura River Estuary lies directly west of the
        City of Ventura. It drains a watershed of approximately 226 square miles. The estuary is
        home to several special-status species, includjng California brown pelican, western
        snowy plover. California least tern. Belding's Savannah sparrow. yellow warbler. yellow-
        breasted chat, tidewater goby, arroyo chub, steelhead trout, and pallid bat. In 1996, the
        Ventura River Estuary Enhancement Plan was implemented to restore and enhance the
        estuary. Measures within the plan included riparian restoration along the river, its
        floodplain, and the surrounding dunes: recreation of habitat types; habitat protective
        fencing; and trail soil stabilization.
Extent: The magnitude of flooding that is used as the standard for floodplain management in the
United States is a flood with a probability of occurrence of 1 percent in any given year. This
flood is also known as the I 00-year flood or the base flood. The most readily available source of
information regarding the 100-year flood, as well as the 500-year flood, is on the FIRMs
prepared by FEMA. These maps are used to support the NFIP.
FEMA has prepared a countywide D FIRM for the unincorporated areas of Ventura County and
for each incorporated city in the county, effective January 20, 20 l 0. Figure F-9 (Appendix F)
shows the SFHAs identified in the Ventura County DFIRM. The Ventura County DFIRM
identifies the following SFHAs: 7.79 miles in the I 00-year ''coastal rugh hazard" flood zone;
78.37 square miles in the 100-year flood zone; and 51.65 square miles in the 500-year flood
zone.
Probability of Future Events: On average, floods causing major damage within Ventura
County occur every 5 years.

 4.3. 7     Landslide
 Nature: Landslide is a general tem1 for the dislodging and fall of a mass of soil or rocks along a
s loped surface. or for the dislodged mass itself. The tem1 is used fo r varying phenomena.
 including mudflows. muds lides. debris flows. rock falls. rock slides. debris avalanches. debris
slides. and slump-earth flows. Landslides may resu lt from a wide range of combinations of
 natural rock. soi l. or arti licial fill. The susceptibility of hillside and mountainous areas to
landslides depends on variations in geo logy. topography, vegetation. and ""eather. Landslides
may also occur because o f indiscriminate development of sloping ground or the creation of cut-
and-fill slopes in areas of unstable or inadequatel y s table geologic conditions.
Additionally. landslides often occur together with other natural hazards. thereby exacerbating
conditi ons, as described below:
     â¢   Shaking due lo eart hquakes can trigger events ranging from rock fa ll s and topp les to
         massive slides.
      â¢  Intense or prolonged precipitation that causes flooding can also saturate slopes and cause
         failures leading to landslides.
      â¢  Wildfires can remove vegetation from hills ides. significantl y increas ing runoff and
         landslide potential.
      â¢  Landslides into a resen.oir can indirectly compromise dam safety; a landslide can even
         affect the dan1 itself.
Another type of landslide occurs in areas cut by perennial streams. As fl oodwaters erode channel
banks. ri vers have undercut clay-rich sedimentary rocks along their south bank. thereby
destabilizing the ground and causing the ground above it to slide.
 History: Lands lides ha' e occurred in areas along the Rincon Fault. hillsides south of the Santa
C lara River. and the east side o f the Ventura River. In recent years, the most damaging landslides
in Ventura Cow1ty have occurred in the coastal communiry of La Conchita. just southeast of the
  anta Barbara count)' line . La Conchita has been the s ite of multiple non-earthquake-induced
landslides.
La Conchita was built on ground that had been graded by the Southern Paci fi e Railroad after a
 1909 landslide s lid into the rai lroad tracks. The land was intended to be a buffer zone between
the retreating and eroding cliff and the Pacific Ocean. However. it was subdivided into smaller
res idential lots in l 924. Along the bluff face above La Conchita, the upper portion of the bluff is
underlain by two rock formations separated by the Red Mountain fault.
The bluff above La Conchita has been associated with a \.ariety of landslide activity. with
histori cal accounts dating back to 1865. More recently, two small slides occurred in 1988 and
1991. fo llowed by large movements of the same landslide mass in 1995 and 2005. T he 1995
land slide. which occurred one month after the hea viest rainfall of an extraordi narily wet year.
was considered to be a deep, s low-mo,Â·ing landslide. This landslide destroyed nine houses. The
January 2005 e\Â·ent was a shallow and highly Ouicl remobilization of the same material that
carried a thick layer of dry. viscous material. This landslide. which occurred at the peak of an
extremely wet 2-week period. killed I 0 people and destroyed 13 homes. Approximately
400.000 tons of debri s cascaded down the slope behind the La Conchita housing development.

covering the entire stale of California. The map shows the relative likelihood of deep landsliding
 based on a methodology developed by Wilson and Keefer ( 1985). and uses detailed information
on:
     â¢   Landslide invento ry. including all previously mapped deep-seated landslides in Cali fornia
         (approximately 57.000) that were assigned the lowest value of rock strength.
     â¢   Geology from a general geologic statev ide map and a detailed geologic map over the
         most populated areas.
     â¢   Rock strength to measure the resistance to landsliding. developed from geo logic and
         landslide inventory maps. Geologic units were classified into three rock strength unjts:
         ( 1) highest rock strength unit, which includes crystalline rocks and well -cemented
         sandstones; (2) intermediate rock strength unit, including weakly cemented sandstones;
         and (3) weakest rock strength unit. including s hale. claystone. pre-existing landslides, and
         unconsolidated surficial units.
     â¢   Slope. including eight s lope classes ranging from nearly flat (less than 3 degrees) to very
         steep (greater than 40 degrees).
     â¢   A \'erage annual rainfall in inches.
     â¢   Earthquake shaking potential.
As shown on Figure F- 10 (Appendix F), the factors listed above were combined to create classes of
landslide susceptibility. These classes express the generalization that on very low slopes, landslide
susceptibility is low even in weak materials. and that landslide susceptibility increases with slope
and in weaker rocks. Very high landslide susceptibility--c lasses VIII. IX, and X- includes very
steep slopes in hard rocks and moderate to Yery steep s lopes in weak rocks. In Ventura County.
areas most susceptibk to landslide are generally located on the edge of cities. outside of the
cities. and in the northern portion of the county. Each city in the county. with the exception of
Port Hueneme. has some land mass in the cluss V I I. IX. and X landslide susceptibility zones.
Extent: Accordi ng to the 20 11 Susceptibility to Deep-Seated Landslides grip map, there are
l .111.52 square miles of Ventura County located in the Very Hi gh Landslide Susceptibility area.
including 174.51 square miles in class V fll , 668.7 1 square miles in class IX. and 268.30 square
miles in class X.
Probability of Future Events: Based on the history of landslide occurrences and the potential
for landslides as a resu lt of the conditions in the county. future events are m.el) to occur about
once e\'ery I 0 years. The extent of future events is unknown. but could be s imilar to historic
events: up to 400.000 tons or more of debris could be involved in one event.

 4.3.8       Levee Failure Inundation
 Nat u re: Levees are typically earthen em bankme nts des igned to contain. control, or divert the
 fl ow of water to provide some leve l of protection from fl ooding. Some levee systems are bui lt
 fo r agriculturaJ purposes and provide flood protection and flood loss reduction fo r fam1 field s
and other land used for agricultural purposes. U rban levee systems are bui lt to provide flood
 protection and fl ood loss reduction for population centers and the industrial , commercial. and
residential facilities within them .
 Levees are designed to provide a specific leve l of fl ood protection. Agricultural le,Â·ee systems
provide a level of protection that is appropriate hased on the value of the assets being protected.
 Because urban levee syste ms are designated lo protect urban areas. they are genera lly bui lt to
higher standards. Urban le ee systems that are shown to provide protection fro m a I % annuaJ
c hance flood occurre nce event o n a FEMA FIRM must docw11ent ongoing complia nce with the
 Federal Levee Certification requirements found in Section 65 .10 of the NFIP regulati ons (i.e ..
44 CFR 65. 10).
No le,Â·ee system provides full protection from a ll floodi ng events to the people and s tructures
 located behind it. Some level of flo od risk exists in the levee-affected areas.
 Levee failure is the overtoppi ng. breach. or collapse of a levee wall. Levees can fail because of
an earthquake. inte rnal erosion, poor engineering/construction or maintenance. or landslides. but
levees most commonly fa il as a result of significant fl ows. During heavy precipitation periods o r
sudden melting of accumu la ted snow. excessive ly large fl ows m ay overto p levee sections and
cause fa ilure. The overfl ow of water washes away the top portion of the levee. creating deep
grooves. Eventually. the levee weakens, resul ting in a breach or co llapse of the levee wall and
the release of uncontro llable amounts of water.
His tory: The fl oods or J anuary and February 1969 were the most damaging fl oods along the
Santa Clara Ri\'er in Ventura County. The estimated peak discharge of the 1969 fl ood was
 165.000 cubic feet per second (cfs). before the gage data adjustment referenced in the Ventura
County hydrology report titled Santa Claro RilÂ·er 2006 Hydrology Update: Phase I. From Ocean

 After the 1969 flood damage. USACE repaired 7 of the original 40 groins (station 330-rOO to
stati on 344+50). restored 2. 100 linear fee t of levee embankment with deeper rock revetment
 (station 3 11 +00 to station 332+00), and added 35 additional groins (station 246+00 lO station
 330+00 and station 421 +80 to station 436+80), which were completed in 1971 . A total of 75
groins are now in place along the reach of the SC R- 1 Levee from station 246+00 to
station 470+00. In December 1985, the VCWPD restored five groins (between as-built station
316+45 and station 356+45) in the vicinity of the 1969 levee failure location. The damages may
have been due to the 1983 flood. with a peak discharge of I00.000 cfs. The damage to the groins
was likely due to the low-flow channel encroaching and .,,,Â·ashing out the top portion of the groin
tips. After the 1983 floods. the riverward tips of fhe groins extending bct\\ een 40 to 100 feet
along the groins were damaged. VCWP D repaired these five groins. which included one of the
original 1961 groins constructed by the U ACE. and fo ur of those added by VCWPD in 197 1
(station 32 l +00 to station 333+07). TI1e repair included removal of approximately 2 feet of
ex isting rock and placement of 1 tons of rock riprap back to the original design dimensions and
backfilling the uncompacted fill. This is the only known non-Corps stone that has been added to
the SC R-1 Le,ee.
Location: In ovember 2009. the VCWPD completed federa lly mandated engi neeri ng
evaluations of nine pro\'isionally accredited levees (PALs) within the Calleguas Creek. Santa
Clara Ri\'er. and Ventura Ri\'er watersheds. At that time. VCWPD submined Levee Certification
Report (LCR) compliance documentation packages lo FEMA for three of the nine PAL-
designated levees. As shown on Figure F-11 (Appendix F). these levees include the AS R-2
Levee Flood wall along Arroyo Santa Rosa in the unincorporated community of Santa Rosa
Valley, the AS-6 Levee along Arroyo Simi in Simi Valley, and the SC- I Levee along Sespe
Creek in Fillmore.
At that same time. PAL-Response Reports (PRRs) were also submitted to FEMA for the
remaining six PAL-designated levees also sho"rn on Figure F-11 (Appendix F). These are AS-7
along Arroyo Simi in imi Valley. CC-2 and CC-3 along Calleguas Creek in Camari llo.
  CR-1 along lhe Santa Clara River in Oxnard. VR-1 along the Ventura River in Ventura.
and VR-3 in the unincorporaled areas of the Ventura Ri ver Valley. The PRRs indicated
that in cheir current condi tion. those six levees could not be certified by the VCWPD before
FEMA 's November 30. 2009. compliance submiual deadline date.
Subsequently. two additional le\'ee systems. SC-2 (the south half of the cspe Creek levee in
Fi llmore) and CR-3 (along the Santa Clara Rh er in Oxnard) were added to the abo\'e list of six
VCWPD levees requfring rehabi litation work to be fully compliant with Federal le,Â·ee
certi fication regulations (i .e .. 44 CFR 65. 10). Also. the VR-2 levee system. along the west bank
of the Ventura Ri ver, which ""as originally constructed by the Natural Resources Conservation
Service (N RCS) in 1979 to provi de flood protection for the unincorporated communi ty of
Casitas prings. was added to the list or VCWPO levees requiring rehabili tation and/or
improvement work.
Extent: There are 5. 17 square miles in Ventu ra County protected by VCWPD PALs from the
I 00-year fl ood.
Pro bability of Future Events: The probability of future le,Â·ee failures in Ventura County is
unkn0\-\-11. but may result from a large winter stom1 or seismic event.

 4.3.9      Post-Fire Debris Flow
 Nature: Wildfires are a conunon occurrence in the hills and mountainous regions of Ventura
 County. By reducing or destroying vegetative cover and altering soil characteristics, fires often
 result in conditions that can significantly increase runoff and erosion when winter rains begin to
 fall. These conditions may result in a debris flow (also referred to as mud flow) , which is a s lmry
 of water, sediment, and rock that converges in a stream channel.
 The threats of erosion, flooding, and debris flows are significantly increased by the following
 processes:
      â¢  Reduced infiltration and incrÂ·eased runoff: A fireÂ· s conswnption of vegetative covet
         increases exposure of the soil surface to raindrop impact. Soil heating destroys organic
         matter that binds the soil together. Extreme heating may also cause the development of
         water-repellant, or " hydrophobic," soil conditions that further reduce infiltration.
      â¢  Changes in hill slope conditions: Fires remove obstructions to overland flow, such as
         trees, downed timber, and plants, increasing flow velocity and therefore erosive power.
         Increased sediment movement also fills depressions, reducing storage capacity and
         further contributing to increased velocity and volume of flow. These factors combine to
         allow more of the watershed to contribute flow to the flood at the san1e time. increasing
         the volume of the flood.
      â¢  Changes in channel conditions: Increased overland flow and sediment transport result
         in increased velocity and volume of flow in defined channels. Channel erosion increases,
         as do peak discharges.
The occurrence of erosion, floods, and debris flows in burned areas is also dependent on
precipitation intensity- stonns with high intensity are more likely to initiate the processes
described above and result in flood events. Additionally, easily eroded soils facilitate changes in
hill slope conditions and increase the volun1e of runoff. Both of these conditions are likely to
occur in Ventura County.
In extreme situations, the cond itions described above combine to form a debris flow. These flows
are often the most destructive events resulting from heavy rainfall in fire-affected areas. They
occur with little warning, carry vast quantities of rock and other material, and strike objects with
extreme fo rce. Because of their viscosity and density, debris flows can move or carry away
objects as large as vehicles and bridges, and they may travel great distances down canyons and
stream valleys. Debris flow fronts may also travel at high speeds, exceeding 50 miles per hour.
History: Evidence of debris-flow movement was widespread following the 1969 storms
throughout the mountain ranges in Ventura County. Debris flows occurred in numerous
watersheds, including Cozy Dell Canyon, Stewart Canyon, Senior Canyon, Orcutt Canyon,
Jepson Wash. and others. Mudflows also occurred in 1969 and 1971 in watersheds that were
underlain by fine-grained sedimentary rocks and had been more recently burned by wildfires
near Ojai. Witnesses to the mud flows described surges of what appeared to be mud covered with
water behind a moving boulder.
In 2014, two post-fire debris flows occurred in the Camarillo Springs. Around midnight on
November I. 2014, a heavy rain totaling 0.5 inch- the first in Ventura County in many
months- unlodged debris and created thick mud from the h.ills recently burned by the Springs

Fire in May 20 13. Twenty homes were evacuated. including two homes that were severely
damaged. According to the Ventura County Fire Depanment, a stom1 drain system that should
have prevented the mud and debris from flooding the area apparently filled to capacity. in part
because of additional amounts of debris left on the hillside due to Spri ngs fire.
On December 12. 20 14. n second debris flow affected Camarillo Springs when a storm dwnped
1.8 inches of rainfall O\er the region. According lo the Ventura County Fire Department. 16
homes were damaged, including 10 homes that were red-tagged. Hours before the storm was
expected. mandatory evacuations were ordered for 124 homes. County crews had also worked to
clear drainage areas before the stonn hjt and had put up K-rails to direct water and mud away
from homes in the projectt!<l <l1:bris now area.
Location: Areas of Ventura County that have been subject to recent \.\ildfires are susceptible to
potent iall y hazardous debris tlows. Areas susceptible to debris flow include localiti es that are
adjacent to and dovvnslopc of these burn areas. especiall y in locati ons that are in ravines and
canyons. and at the mouths of canyons. Figure F- 12 (A ppendix F) shows wild tire perimeters
of concern; this includes wildfires within the last 3 years (Grand and prings fires). and
burnt areas that are recovering slowly (Day fire).
Extent and Probability of Future Events: Ventura County has a long history of flooding and
wildfLres. which are two major factors in the occurrence of post-fire debris flow. However.
because a nw11ber of complex factors lead to debris flow (basin morphomctr)'. bum severity. soil

 4.3.10     Tsunami
Nature: A tsunami is a series of traveling ocean waves o f extremely long length. generated by
disturbances associated primarily with earthquakes occurring below or near the ocean floor.
Subduction zone earthquakes at plate boundaries often cause tsunamis. However. tsunamis can
also be generated by submarine landslides. submarine volcanic eruptions, the collapse of
volcanic edifices. and-in very rare instances-large meteorite impacts in the ocean.
In the deep ocean, a tsunami may have a length from wave crest to wave crest of I 00 miles or
more but a wave height of only a few feet o r less. Thus. the wave period can be up to severaJ
hours. and wavelengths can exceed several hundred miles. Therefore, tsunami s are unlike typical
wind-generated swells on the ocean, which might have a period of about l 0 seconds and a
wavelength of up to 300 feet. Tsunam is cannot be felt aboard ships and they cannot be seen from
the air in the open ocean. In deep water, the waves may reach speeds exceeding 700 miles per
hour.
Tsunamis can originate hundreds or even thousands of miles away from coastal areas. Local
geography may intensify the effect of a tsunami. Areas at greatest risk are less than 50 feet above
sea level and within I mile of the shoreline. Tsunamis arrive as a series of successive crests (high
water levels) and troughs (low water levels). These successive crests and troughs can occur
anywhere from 5 to 90 minutes apart. They usuaJly occur 10 to 45 minutes apart.
Tsunamis not only affect beaches that are open to the ocean. but also bay mouths. tidal flats. and
the shores of large coastal rivers. Tsunami waves can also diffract around land masses. Because
tsunamis are not symmetrical. the waves may be much stronger in one direction than another.
depending on the nature of the source and the surrounding geography. However. tsunamis do
propagate outward from their source, so coasts in the shadow of affected land masses are usually
fairly safe.

 4.3.11    Wildfire
 Nature: A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that spreads through vegetative fuels. exploding and
 possibly consuming stTuctures. Wildfires often begin unnoticed, spread quickly. and are usually
 signaled by dense smoke that may be visible from miles around. Wildfires can be hw11an-caused
 by arson or campfires. or can be caused by natural events such as lightning. Wi ldfires can be
 categorized into four types:
     â¢   Wildlaod fires occur mainly in areas under federal control, such as national forests and
         parks, and are fueled primarily by natural vegetation.
     â¢   Interface or intermix fires occur in areas where both vegetation and structures provide
         fuel. These are also referred to as urban-wildland interface fires.
     â¢   Firestorms occur during extreme weather (typically high temperatures, low humidity,
         and high winds) with such intensity that fire suppression is virtually impossible. These
         events typically burn until the conditions change or the fuel is exhausted.
     â¢   Prescribed fires and prescribed natural fires are intentionally set or natural fires that
         are allowed to burn for beneficial purposes.
T he following three factors contribure significantly to wi ldfire behavior~ as described more fully
 below. these factors can be used to identify wildfire hazard areas:
     â¢   Topography: As slope increases. the rate of wildfire spread increases. South-facing
         slopes are also subject to greater solar radiation, making Lhem drier and thereby
         intensifying wi ldfire behavior. However. ridgetops may mark the end of wildfire spread
         because fire spreads more slowly or may even be unable to spread downhill.
     â¢  Fuel: The type and condition of vegetation plays a significant role in the occunence and
        spread of wildfires. Certain types of plants are more susceptible to burning or burn with
        greater intensity. Dense or overgrown vegetation increases the amount of combustible
         material available to fuel the tire (refe1Ted to as the ..fuel load .. ): the ratio of living to
        dead plant matter is also important. The risk of fire is increased significantly during
        periods of prolonged drought as the moisture content of both living and dead plant matter
        decreases. The fuers continuity is also an importanr factor, botb horizontally and
        vertically.
     â¢  Weather: The most variable factor affecting wildfire behavior is weather. Variables such
        as temperature. humidity. wind. and lightning can affect chances for ignition and spread
        of fire. Extreme weather. such as high temperatures and low humidity, can lead to
        extreme wildfire activity. By contrast. cooling and higher humidity often signals reduced
        wi ltl fire occurrence and easier containment. Years of precipitation followed by wanner
        years tend to encourage more widespread fires and longer burn periods. Also. since the
        mid ~ 1980s, earlier snowmelt and associated wam1ing due to global climate change has
        been associated with longer and more severe wildfire seasons in the western United
        States.
If not promptly controlled. wildfire may grow into an emergency or disaster. Even small fires
can threaten lives and resources and deslroy improved properties. It is also impo11ant to note that
in addition to affecting people, wildfire may severely affect livestock and pets. Such events may
require the emergency watering/feeding. shelter. evacuation, and e\Â·en burying of animals.

 Wildfires can have serious effects on the local environment. ln addition to stripping the land of
 vegetation and destroying forest resources. large. intense fires can hann the soil, waterways. and
 the land itself. Soil exposed to intense heat may lose its capacity to absorb moisture and support
 life. Exposed soils erode quickly and enhance siltation of rivers and streams, thereby enhanci ng
 flood potential, harming aquatic life, and degrading water qual ity. Lands stripped of vegetation
 are also subject to increased debris flow hazards, as described above. Wildfires can also greatly
 affect the air quality of the surrounding area.
 History : Wildfires are a common occurrence in Ventura County. ln the last 50 years ( 1965
 through 2015), 23 wildfires, with an extent greater than 10,000 acres, have occuned. Table 4-8
 illustrates the 10 largest fires over the last 50 years. Most recently, in May 2013, the Springs fire
 burned 24,251 acres; IO structures were destroyed and 12 were damaged, and l 0 injuries were
 recorded.

Location: Public Resources Code 4201-4204 and Government Code 51175-89 directed the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal FIRE) to map areas of significant fire
hazards based on fuels, terrain, weather, and other relevant factors. These zones, referred to as
Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZs), are represented as very high, high, or moderate.
Specifically, the maps were created using data and models describing development patterns,
potential fuels over a 30- to 50-year time horizon, expected fire behavior, and expected burn
probabilities. The maps are divided into local responsibility areas and state responsibility areas.
Local responsibility areas generally include cities, cultivated agriculture lands, and portions of
the desert. Local responsibility area fire protection is typically provided by city fire departments,
fire protection districts, counties, and by Cal FIRE under contract to the local government. State
responsibility area is a legal tem1 defining the area where the state has financial responsibility for
wildfire protection. Incorporated cities and federal ownership are not included. The prevention

 and suppression of fires in all areas that are not state responsibility areas are primarily the
 responsibility of tederaJ or local agencies.
 Figure F-14 (Appendix F) displays the areas of Ventura County most susceptible to wildfires.
 Within the County, very high F HSZs are located in mountainous or hillside areas (west of Lake
 Casitas, northeast of Ojai. north of Fillmore, and surrounding Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley),
 where the greatest fuel density exists: as well as throughout much of the county' s large
agricultural and cattle-grazing areas. Although these areas are not heavily populated. they are near
 populated conmrnnities.
 Extent As shown on Figure F-15 (Appendix F), in Ventura Coi.mty there are 81.87 square miles
 in the high FHSZ and 504.42 square miles in the very high FHSZ.
Probability of Future Events: The climate in Ventura Cow1ty is characterized as Mediterranean
dry-sununer featuring cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. High moisture levels during the
winter rainy season significantly increase the growth of plants. However, the vegetation is dried
during the long, hot summers. decreasing plant moisture content and increasing the ratio of dead
fuel to living fuel. As a result. fire susceptibility increases dramatically, particularly in late
summer and early autumn . In addition. the presence of chaparral. a drought-resistant variety of
vegetation that is dependent on occasional wildfires, is expected in Mediterranean dry-summer
climates. Also, the history of plant succession in Ventura County is important in predicting fire
susceptibi lity. For several years after a fire has occurred. easily flanunable herbaceous species
predominate and increase the likelihood of new fires. When woody species become re-
established. they contribute to a lower overall level of fire susceptibility for approximately
 10 years. However, after this period. the slow aging plant community becomes ever more likely
to bum because of increased levels of dead plant material and lowered plant moisture levels.
In addition, the local meteorological phenomenon known as the Santa Ana winds contributes to
the high incidence of wildfires in Ventura County. These winds originate during the autwnn
months in the hot. dry interior deserts to the north and east of Ventura County. They often sweep
west into the county, bringing extremely dry air and high wind speeds that further desiccate plant
communities during the period of the year when the constituent species have very low moisture
content. The effect of these winds on existing fires is particularly dangerous ; the winds can
greatly increase the rate at which fires spread.
Based on the conditions described above and the history of occurrence in the past, future events
are very likely to occw-. Tn the past fires burning more than 1,000 acres have occurred about
every l to 3 years. The extent of future events wi ll depend on specific conditions at the time of
the fire.

 4.3.12     Winter Storm
 Nature: The climate on CaliforniaÂ·s southern coast is hot Mediterranean. in which summers are
 hot and dry and winters are cool and damp. A dominating factor in the weather of Cal ifo rnia is
 the semi-permanent l1igh pressw-e area of the North Pacific Ocean, sometimes called the Pacific
 High. This pressure center moves northward in summer. holding storm tracks well to the north:
 as a result. California receives little or no precipitation during that period. The Pacific High
 decreases in intensity in winter and moves farther south, permitting stonns to move into and
 across the state and producing high winds. widespread rain at low elevations. and snow at high
 elevations. Occasionally the state's circulation pattern pern1its a series of stom1 centers to move
 into Cali fornia from the southwest. This type of stom1 pattern is responsible for occasional heavy
rains that can cause serious winter flooding. Tbe rainy season is from mid-autumn to mid-spring.
 During these months. winter stonns may occur.
In add ition to high winds and flooding, winter storms may bring hail. lightning. and extended
 peri ods of freezing temperatures to all areas of the county.
History: Ventura County was included in the Presidential Disaster Declarations for freezing/
 severe winter stom1s that occurred in December 1998 and January 2007. The 1998 freeze was
particularly damaging to citrus crops.
According to NOAA 's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) database, I 05 storms causing
high winds occurred in Vent1lra County over the last 10 years. These sLonns included wind
speeds of up to 76 miles per hour; in one case, the storm caused a death. Storms with high winds
also knocked down uÂ·ees and power 1ines.
Also according to the NCDC database, 31 winter storms causing snow and ice have occuned in
Ventura County over the last 10 years. Some of the stom1s also caused hail ; in addition, two
hailstorms have been recorded in Ventura County since 2005, with reported hail of up to
 1.5 inches in diameter.
Location: Many events described above affected all of Ventura County. The entire county is
susceptible to winter stom1s and daniage from wind. However, only the higher elevation areas
(typically at or above 4,000 to 5,000 feet) experience snowfall, while lower elevation areas
experience heavy rains. Hail has occurred throughout the county.
Extent: A winter stom1 can cause high rains. flooding, up to I 8 inches of snow at the highest
elevations in the county (e.g.. Mount Pines). and wind speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. Hail of
up to 1.5 inches in diameter has been recorded.
Probability of Future Events: Based on recent history, a winter storm can occur every year, but
those causing injury or damage occur about once every I 0 years.

5.3       METHODOLOGY
A conservative exposure-level analysis was conducted to assess the risks associated with the
identified hazards. This analysis is a simplified assessment of the potential effects of the hazards
on values at risk, without consideration of the probability or level of damage. Due to a
combination of a lack of adequate information, the lack of a standard methodology for a
quantitative exposure analysis, and limited GIS capabilities, a quantitative exposure analysis has
been prepared for the hazards listed in T a ble 5-2.

Population was derived from 20 l 0 Census infom1ation. then a combination of spatial overlay and
proportional analysis was used to determine the number of people in areas where hazards are
likely to occur.
Using block-level residential building information from the 2010 Census. a combination of
spatial overlay and proportional analysis was used to detennine the number of residential
buildings located where hazards are likely to occur.
Point locations for each critical facility and infrastructure were compared to locations where
hazards are likely to occur. For each critical facility/infrastructure in a hazard area, exposure was
calculated by assuming the worst-case scenario (that is, the asset would be completely destroyed
and would have to be replaced). A similar analysis was used to evaluate the proportion of the
population at risk. However, the analysis simply represents the number of people at risk; no
estimate of the number of potential injuries or deaths was prepared.
Additionally. replacement values and/or insured values are not included for residential buildings
due to incomplete data, and are only included for critical facilities/facilities if available.

5.4.3       Summary of Impacts to Dam Failure Inundation
There are 16 state regulated dams within Ventura County as well as 5 state regulated dams
outside of the County that can lead to inundation of Ventura County. The entire County is
vulnerable to inundation from dam failure(s), but the a:reaÂ·s most susceptible to dam failure
inundation include those locations along the Santa Clara River, including Fillmore and Santa
Paula. and the cities of Oxnard. and Port Hueneme. Accordingly, the following percentages of
the population are located within dam failure inundation zones: Camarillo, 37.02 percent:
Fillmore, 85.65 percent; Moorpark, 39.94 percent; Ojai, 2.86 percent; Oxnard, 100 percent: Port
Hueneme, 100 percent; Santa Paula. 85.88 percent; Simi Valley, 30.77 percent; Thousand Oaks;
3.81 percent; Ventura, 27.77 percent; and Unincorporated Ventura County, 27.35 percent.
Table 5-5 below illustrates the summary of impacts from dam failure inundation on the entire
County. This includes the level of impact to the County' s landmass, population, residential
structures, and the critical facilities and infrastructure. It is important to note that this summary
reflects the impacts due to failure of all dams with inundations areas in Ventura County, which is
not ever anticipated to occur.

 Additional Life/Safety Information : As described in CRS Activity 610. the VCW PD operates
 and maintains a Flood Threat Recognition System also known as the Fl ood Warning System
 (Annex A). The Flood Warning System is made of self-reporting rain and stream gages placed in
 strategic locations to provide real-time data fo r monitoring stom1s and fl ooding conditjons. The
 gages provide warnings for each water course and basin across Ventura County. including each
 city. Each stream gage has an Advance Hydrologi c Prediction System di splay to show the
 ctuTent stream level, predicted level(s). and warnjng levels. Alarm criteria are set by specific
 thresholds for each gage on rainfall intensity and stream/ river fl ows. Once an alam1 is tri ggered,
 the alann message is sent via e-mail. pager text, SMS cell text, and Twi tter message to
 emergency personnel in the Ventura County Storm Operati on Centers and the Emergency
 Operation Center. The staff at the operation centers can provide hydrologic knowledge o n how
 the channels are responding to the sto1111 and can clarify any discrepancies between observed
 peaks and fo recasted peaks for the Ventura County Sheriff s (OES) and other local agencies that
 execute vvamings and evac uations. The Twiner message is sent to a public account and can be
 monitored by the public, emergency personnel. and NWS .

Very little of the County's population falls within the high FHSZ. Accordingly. 0.04 percent of
Ojai 's population; 0.03 percent of Santa PaulaÂ· s population; and 3 .89 percent of Unincorporated

The VCWP D has identified 12 repetitive flood areas throughout the Unincorporated Ventura
Count). 1 hese areas correspond with the RL and RL properties identified in Figur e F-19
(A ppendix F). The repetitive flood areas are as follows: areas 1-4 arc along the Ventura RiYer;
areas 5-6 are located along the coast (Rincon Beach/Solimar Beach) near Santa Barbara County: area
7 is located along the Santa C lara River/City of Santa Paula: area 8 is located outside of the Cit) of
Oxnard in the yeland Acres community: area 9 is located along the coast bordering Los Angeles

 7.1        OVERVIEW
A mitigation strategy includes the identification of mitigation goals and actions that wi ll reduce
 the risks of each hazard and vulnerability to the local population and built environment for each
 local participant.
 Ln accordance with local mit igation planning requirements. this mitigati on strategy consists of
the followi ng steps:
     â¢   Update of local hazard mitigation goals
     â¢   Review of the 20 I 0 M l IMP's local participants ' mitigation action plans
     â¢   Identification of new and updated mitigation actions
     â¢   Prioritization of the 20 15 MH MP's local participantsÂ· mitigation actions
     â¢   Implementation of the 2015 MHM P' s local participants' mitigation action plans
In addition. this section addresses the following floodplain management planning activities for
the VCWPD:
     â¢   Set Goals
     â¢   Review possible activities
     â¢   Draft an action plan
7.2        UPDATE OF LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION GOALS
The local hazard mitigation planning requirements and floodplain management planning
activities for updating local hazard mitigation goals are as follows:
                    Regulation Checklist - 44 CFR 201.6 Local Mitigation Plans
C 3. Does the Plan include goals to reduce/avoid long-term vulnerabilities to the identified hazards?
(Requirement Â§'.WI .6{c){3)(i))
               Regulation Checklist - CRS 510 Floodplain Management Planning
Goals Should address all the major hazards that face the community as well as all nood-related problems identified
in Step 5 (Assess the Problem).
Mitigation goals are defined as general guidelines that explain what a community wants to
achieve in terms of hazard and loss prevention. Goal statements are typically long-range, policy-
oriented statements representing community-wide vision. Table 7-1 shows the updated
mitigation goals that were developed to reduce or avoid long-tenn vulnerability to hazards.
                                                                                                                7-1

                     awareness/ participation in the NFIP, and guarantee continuity of emergency services.
 7.3         REVIEW OF THE 2010 MHMP MITIGATION ACTION PLAN
The local hazard mitigation planning requirements for reviewing the 2010 MHMP's mitigation
 action plans are as follows:
                       Regulation Checklist - 44 CFR 201.6 Local Mitigation Plans
 02. Was the Plan revised to reflect progress in local mitigation efforts? (RequirementÂ§ 20 I .6(d)(3))
During the 2015 MHMP update process, each local participant reviewed its 2010 mitigation
action plan to determine which mitigation actions had been completed, deleted, deferred, or are
ongoing. Mitigation actions are activities. measures, and/or projects that help achieve the goals
of a mitigation plan. The results of this review, shown in each participant-specific capability
assessment, illustrate the progress of participants in their local mitigation efforts over the 5 years.
For the VCWPD, an annual review of its mitigation action plan and that of Unincorporated
Ventura County since the 20 I 0 MHMP was adopted by the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors: the review is provided in Appendix X.
7.4         IDENTIFICATION OF NEW AND UPDATED POTENTIAL MITIGATION ACTIONS
The local hazard mitigation planning requirements and floodplain management planning
activities fo r identifying and updating the 20 I 0 MHMP 's potential mitigation actions are as
follows:
                      Regulation C hecklist - 44 CFR 201.6 Local Mitigation Plans

S imil ar to the 2005 and 20 I 0 MHMP planning process, the MHMP Planning Committee
developed overarching potential mitigation actions fo r all local participants. These potential
mitigation actions are li sted in Table 7-2. In addition, each local participant identified other
participant-specific potential mitigation actions through the review of existing resources:
identification of past success stories and best management practices: and solicitation of input
from pertinent departments. including planning. public works. building and safety. code
enforcement. watershed protection, and emergency management staff. Additional local
participant-specific potential mitigation actions arc provided in each local participant-specific
appendix .

7.5         PRIORITIZATION OF THE 2015 MHMP MITIGATION ACTIONS
The requirements for the prioritization of mitigation actions, as stipulated in OMA 2000 and its
implementing regulations, are described below.
                    Regulation Checklist - 44 CFR 201.6 Local Mitigation Plans
0 3. Was the plan revised to reflect changes in priorities? (Requirement Â§ 20 I .6(d)(3))
                    Regulation CheckJist - 44 CFR 201.6 Local Mitigation Plans
CS. Does the Plan contain an action plan that describes how the actions identified will be prioritized (including cost
benefit review). implemented. and administered by each jurisdiction? (Requirement Â§ 20 L.6(c)(3 )(iv));
(RequirementÂ§ 20 I .6(c)(3)(iii))
After the list of potential mitigation actions had been developed. the local participants
determined which potential mitigation actions should be included in their local plan participant-
specific mitigation action plans. This process included the fo ll owing steps:
     â¢    Local participants began by reviewing the list of overarching potential mitigation actions;
         overarching mitigation actions could be applicable to the County and a variety of
         cities/special districts.
     â¢    Local participants then determined if there were mitigation actions speci fie to their city or
         spec ial district that they would also like to consider. If so, these mitigation actions were
         added to that jurisdictions list of potential mitigation actions.
     â¢   Then local participants were asked to narrow the list down to a manageable number of
         mitigation actions, mitigation actions that have a decent chance of being pursued in the
         next five years. This narrowed down list would be comprised of the high-priority projects
         and would become each local participant's .. Mitigation Action Plan."
             To narrow down the list local participants were asked to consider the information
             obtained in their capability assessment (their human/technical resources, financi al
             resources, and legal/ regulatory resources), as well as the Hazard Mitigation
             Assistance (HMA) Program requirements (Table 7-3).
             It was encouraged to consider the HMA Program requirements because mitigation
             actions/projects that meet the I IMA Program requi rements have the greatest chance
             of leading to enhanced project scoping and the lowest probability of experiencing
             HMA funding delays.
             The narrowed down list of selected mitigation actions is considered each local
             participant's list of high-priority projects. Proj ects not selected as hi gh-priority
             projects may be considered at a later date fo r implementation if the priority projects
             have been completed or deferred or additional funding sources have-become
             available.
                                                                                                                   7-7

7.5.1       2015 MHMP Local Participant-Specific Mitigation Action Plans
Each local participant selected priority projects to include in its mitigation action plan (provided
in each local -participant-specific appendix, Appeodb: G-W). As noted above. priority projects
are projects that meet the HMA gu idance program requirements identified in Table 7-3.
Emphasis in this process was placed on cost-effecti,Â·eness and technical feasibility and
effectiveness.
The fol lowing infonnation has been included for local-participant-speci lie mitigation action
plans: mitigation action number and description. facility to be mitigated (if known and/or
applicab le). department/agency to oversee the implementation of the mitigation action. potential
funding so urce. and implementation timeframe. Also. for the VCWPD and City of Oxnard. the
mitigation action plan identifies the mitigation goal associated with each priority project.

8.1        OVERVIEW
This section describes a formal plan maintenance process to ensure that the 2015 MHMP
remains an active and applicable document. lt includes an explanation or how the Ventura
County Project Management Team intend to organize its efforts to ensure that improvements and
revis ions to the 2015 MHMP occur in a well-managed, efficient. and coordinated manner.
The following three process steps are addressed in detail below:
     â¢    Monitoring. e\ aluating. and updating the M l L 1P
     â¢    lmplementation through existing planning mechanisms
     â¢    Continued public invo lvernent
In addition, revis ions made from the 20 I 0 MHMP plan maintenance section to the 20 15 MHMP
plan maintenance section are discussed below.
8.2        MONITORING, EVALUATING, AND UPDATING THE PLAN
The local hazard mitigation planning and fl oodplain management planning requirements for
monitoring. evaluating. and updating the Ml IMP are as fo llows.
                     Regulation Checklist - .t.t C FR 201.6 Local Mitigation Plans

A. Procedures to monitor and recommend revisions.
B. Same planning committee or successor committee that qu::i li lies under Section 5 11 .a.2 (a) docs the evaluation.
The Ventura County Project Management Team will take the lead on monitoring. evaluating. and
updating the 2015 Ml IMP through the following activi ties. (the Ventura County Sheriffs OES
Assistant Director will lead these efforts for the Ml IMP Committee. and VCWPD Floodplain
Manager & CRS Coordinator will lead these efforts for the FMP Committee).
    â¢    Monitoring: Every 12 months from plan adoption. the Ventura County Project
         Management I eam wi ll email each member of both planning committees an Annual
         Review Questionnaire to complete. As s hown in Appendb: X. the Annual Review
         Questionnaire eva luation of the following: planning process. hazard analysis.
         vulnerability analysis. capability assessment. and mitigation strategy.
    â¢    Additionally. mitigatio n actions will be monitored and updated through the use of the
         Mitigation Project Progress Report. During each annual review. each department or
         agency currently administering a mitigation project will submit a progress report to the
                                                                                                                      8-1

          Ventura County Project Management Team Lo review and evaluate. For projects that are
          being fu nded by a FEMA mitigation grant. FEMA quarterly reports may be used as the
          preferred reporting tool. As shown in Appendix X. the progress report wi ll discuss the
          current status of the mitigat ion proj ect. including any changes made LO the project.
          ide ntify impl ementation problems. and describe appropriate strateg ics to overcome them .
     â¢     Ev aluating: The Ventura County Project Management Team will co llect all completed
          questionnaires and determine if the 20 15 MHMP needs to be updated to address new or
          more threateni ng hazards. new technical reports or findings. and new or better-defined
          mitigation proj ects. The Ventura County Project Management Team will swnmarize
          these findings and ema il chem out to both planning committees. As done with the 2010
          MHMP, the Project Management Team will submit this annual re port to the Ventura
          County Board of Supervisors as part or the CRS recertification process (See
          Appendix X , for the 20 11 , 20 12, 20 13 and 20 14 annual repo11s). In addition. for the
          annual review of the 20 15 MHMP. the report will be posted to the MHMP website for
          public review. If the Ventura County Project Management Team believes that the 20 15
          M HMP needs to be updated based on the findings. then a request will be made to the
          planning conuninees to attend a fomial Ml IMP update meeting. A media release will be
          issued that the update process has begun.
     â¢    Updating: To ensure that this update occu rs. on the fourth year following plan adoption.
          the Ventura County Project Management Team will appl y for fu nding or secure local
          funding to ass ist in the next MHMP update. Six months prior to the live year adoption
          date, the Ventura County Project Management Team will organize both planning
          committees to kick-off the next MHMP update. The process for the update wi ll fo llow
          the process identified in Section 3.
8.3         IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH EXISTING PLANNING MECHANISMS
The local hazard mitigation planning requirements for integrating the MHMP into other planning
mechanisms are as follow.
                     Regulation Checklis t - .t4 C FR 201.6 Local M itigation Plans
C6. Does Lhe Plan describe a process by which local governments will integrate the requirements of the mitigation
plan into other planning mechanisms. such as comprehensive or capi1al improvemen1 plans. when appropria1e?
(RequirementÂ§ 20 I .6(c)(4 )(iii))
After the adoption of the 20 15 MHMP. the Ventura County Project Management Team and
planning conrn1ittecs will work tu i11curpurat<.: applicable elements of rhe 10 15 MHMP into other
ex isting planning mechan isms. T he processes fo r incorporating the 20 15 M l IMP into various

   LOCAL MITIGATION PLAN REVIEW TOOL
  The Local Mitigation Plan Review Tool demonstrates how the Local Mitigation Plan meets the regulation in 44
  CFR Â§201.6 and offers States and FEMA Mitigation Planners an opportunity to provide feedback to the
  community.
            The Regulation Checklist provides a summary of FEMA's evaluation of whether the Plan has addressed
            all requirements.
        â¢   The Plan Assessment identffies the plan's strengths as well as documents areas fo r future
            improvement.
        â¢   The Mufti-jurisdiction Summary Sheet is an opt ional worksheet that can be used to document how
            each jurisdiction met the requirements of the each Element of the Plan (Planning Process; Hazard
            Identification and Risk Assessment; Mitigation Strategy; Plan Review, Evaluation, and Implementation;
            and Plan Adoption).
  The FEMA Mitigation Planner must reference this Local Mitigation Plan Review Guide when completing the
  Local M itigation Plan Review Tool.

            hazard maps to produce the Vulnerability Analysis
              -     fn essence. Lhe critical facilities are mapped then the map of each hazard is overlaid to
                   determine which hazards fall into wllich hazard zones.
               - The analysis does nol try to determine to what kvel a faci lity is vulmm1ble. i.e. 2011 0 oflhe
                    facility is wirhin lhe flood zone or the facility will receive I foot of water. Rather a facility
                    is ::.imply in or out. iflhc hazard boundary touches a facili l) the foci lily is 1.:ountcd as being
                   suscepli ble.
              - A similar approach is taken for population und rcsi<lcntiul structures.
          â¢    Examples of what the infonnation obtained from the nilnerability analysis wi ll look like were
              shown and discussed - for each critical faci lity identi fied it notes which of the chosen hazards
               U1e faci lity is susceptible to.
          â¢    l'or population and residential bui ldings. census data is used and we gel lhc number of people
              and residential buildings susceptible to each hazard.
      Mitigation Strategy
       â¢    Begin the mitigation !.tratcgy process by reviewing the 20 10 Mitigation Strategy: review the
            precious mitigation goals/objectives und analyze U1i.: previous mitigation actions - which \\Cre
            completed and which were not. lfnot completed discuss why and should they be included in the
            :WIS stnitcgy?
      Mitigation Goals
       â¢    In lhe 20 10 plan one goal per hazard \.\US idenlilied. Reducing U1e number of goals and making
            them more general - to apply to multiple hazards - was suggested and agreed upon by the group.

      Potential Mi ti uation /\clions
        â¢   A list ofpotcnlial mitigation actions has been developed (Table l in tho Mitigation Strategy
            handoul).
                -   II is suggested that additional mitigation actions. spccilic lo ~1 our jurisdiction1spccial
                    district, are added to the I isl of potential mitigation actions (Table 2). The list of potential
                    mitigation actions is your laundry list that you enter all possible ideas onto. and then you
                    can go through the list and choose 3-10 mitigation actions based upon established priorities.

                      2015 Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan Update
            Ventura County has launched an effort to update their Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan
             (MHMP) in accordance with FEMA regulations. The 2015 MHMP update indudes the
              review of the natural and human-caused ha1ards the county is susceptible to and
                   identifies ways to reduce the risks and vulnerability from these hazards.
             Additionally, the updated 2015 MHMP will support the County's p11rtldpation in the
               National Flood lnsur11nce Program's Community Rating System (CRS) Program by
                                    addressing the Program's FMP activities.
          For this proied, we will have two committees; a committee to focus on hatard mitigation
                planning requirements (MHMP Committee) and a planning committee to focus
           specifically on the floodplain management planning requirements (FMP Committee). We
          invite you to be a part of this effort and participate as a member of the FMP Committee.

     Ventura County has launched a regional effort to review the risks posed by natural and
     human-caused hazards and to identify ways to reduce the damage from those risks
     through the update of a County-wide Hazard Mitigation Plan. Additionally this project will
     support the County's participation in the National Flood Insurance Program's Community
     Rating System (CRS) program by addressing floodplain management planning activities.
     We invite you to attend a town hall to learn about the planning efforts and to provide
     your input regarding your concerns about natural and human-caused hazards.
     Please join us anytime between lOam and 12pm.
     A formal 15 minute presentation will occur on the hour at 1Oam, and 11 am
     the remainder of each hour will be an open forum to ask questions, view
     maps, and interact with the project staff.

                                     jurisdiction's departments/agencies. Further, this plan
                                     describes the role of the Emergency Operation Center
                                     (EOC) and the coordination that occurs between the EOC
                                     and the local jurisdiction's departments and other
                                     response agencies. Finally, this plan describes how the
                                      EOC serves as the foca l point among local, state, and
                                     federal governments in times of disaster.

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                      I. Introduction
I.    INTRODUCTION
A. Setting
Nestled among the rolling hills in eastern Ventura County, Moorpark incorporated as a
city in 1983. Beginning with the small settlements of Epworth and Fremontville in the late
19th/early 20th centuries, Moorpark has experienced tremendous growth since the 1980s â
increasing to a population estimated at 37,576 in 2010. Despite this rapid population
growth, Moorpark has retained its country charm reminiscent of a small town.
Moorpark is distinct from other communities in Ventura County. The city has a high
percentage of younger families with children. Residents generally tend to have a higher
education level than many communities, and one of the highest median household
incomes in the county. Due to its predominantly residential nature, Moorpark serves as a
bedroom community for larger employment centers throughout Ventura County as well
as northwest Los Angeles County, which is readily accessible via the Ventura Freeway
(SR-101), the Ronald Reagan Freeway (SR-118) and SR-23.
The Cityâs housing stock offers a range of housing opportunities consistent with the urban-
rural nature of Ventura County. The downtown area contains a mix of older single-family
neighborhoods, commercial and higher-density development. New residential develop-
ment nestled in surrounding hillsides offer more rural settings. Strong growth in the
Southern California economy during the first half of this decade fostered increased
residential development in Specific Plan areas and other areas around the cityâs
perimeter.
Although the strong economy spurred housing development, it also caused a rapid
increase in housing prices. Housing prices still remain well in excess of 2000 levels, despite
the downturn in the housing market since 2006. These increases place a burden upon
lower-income individuals and families, seniors, the disabled, large families, and other
persons with special housing needs. Though higher-priced homes ring the downtown
area, the cityâs center contains much of the older housing stock, some of which shows
signs of deterioration.
Moorpark faces several challenges over the 2014-2021 Housing Element planning period,
including maintaining the diversity and affordability of the housing stock, rehabilitating
older housing in the downtown area, fostering economic development, and balancing
growth with the needs of existing residents. The City has set forth the following goals for
addressing the housing needs facing the community (see Chapter V â Housing Plan):
      ï·     Adequate provision of decent, safe, and affordable housing for residents
            without regard to race, age, sex, marital status, ethnicity, or other arbitrary
            consideration.
      ï·     Adequate provision of housing opportunities by type, tenure, and location
            with particular attention to the provision of housing for special needs groups.
      ï·     Identification of suitable parcels for residential development, and appropriate
            recycling of land for future housing development.

      ï·    Development of a balanced community accessible to employment,
           transportation, shopping, medical services, and governmental services.
B.    State Policy and Authorization
State law requires the preparation of a Housing Element as part of a jurisdiction's General
Plan (Government Code Â§65302(c)). The Element is to consist of the identification and
analysis of existing and projected housing needs, and a statement of goals, policies,
quantified objectives, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and
development of housing. It is also required to identify adequate sites for housing and to
make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic segments
of the community (Â§65583).
Periodic review of the Element is required to evaluate (1) the appropriateness of its goals,
objectives and policies in contributing to the attainment of the state housing goals, (2) its
effectiveness in attaining the City's housing goals and objectives, and (3) the progress of
its implementation (Â§65588).
C. Public Participation
The City provided several opportunities for residents to participate in the Housing Element
update and recommend strategies for addressing local needs. Prior to public hearings,
the draft Housing Element was made available for review at City Hall, on the Cityâs
website, and at public libraries. To ensure a wide distribution, notices were sent to the
School District, the Moorpark College Library, and the Post Office. Local non-profit and
housing advocate groups were also notified of the availability of the Housing Element.
Through these efforts all interested residents and stakeholders had ample opportunity to
participate in the development of the Housing Element.
Appendix C contains additional details regarding the Cityâs efforts to encourage
participation by all economic segments of the community, as well as a summary of
concerns and recommendations expressed during the public review process.
As required by state law, a draft Housing Element was submitted to the State Housing
and Community Development Department (HCD) for review. After receiving HCDâs
comments, a proposed final Housing Element was made available for public review prior
to adoption by the City Council.
Annual reviews of the Element have been, and continue to be, accomplished in
accordance with state law. Annual reports are placed on the Cityâs website as a
resource for the public and interested parties.
D. Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
The Housing Element is one of the elements of the comprehensive General Plan.
Moorparkâs General Plan comprises the seven elements mandated by state law, and
includes the Land Use Element, the Circulation Element, the Housing Element, the Open
Space, Conservation and Recreation Element, the Noise Element, and the Safety
                                              I-2                                 January 2014

Element. The Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan Elements and is entirely
consistent with the policies set forth in those elements.
The City will ensure consistency between General Plan elements so that policies
introduced in one element are consistent with those in other elements. At this time, the
revised Element does not propose significant change to any other element of the Cityâs
adopted General Plan. However, if it becomes apparent over time that changes to
another element are needed for internal consistency, such changes will be proposed for
consideration by the Planning Commission and City Council.

      2.    Age
Housing needs are influenced by population age characteristics. Different age groups
require different accommodations based on lifestyle, family type, income level, and
housing preference. Table II-2 provides a comparison of the city and county population
by age group in 2010. This table shows that the Cityâs population was slightly younger
than the Countyâs, with the âunder 20 yearsâ age cohort representing 31% of the City
compared to 29% of the County. The median age of Moorpark residents is 1.5 years
younger than that of all Ventura County residents (34.7 years vs. 36.2 years).

      3.    Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of the City differs from the County in that a lower
proportion of City residents are Hispanic/Latino or other racial/ethnic minorities.
Approximately 75.1% of City residents are white, contrasted with 68.7% for the county as
a whole. The percentage of Hispanics residing in the City, at 31.4%, is about 9% less than
that of the County. Asians, at 6.8%, represent the largest non-Hispanic minority group
(Table II-3).

B.    Household Characteristics
      1.      Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing
needed in a city. The Census defines a âhouseholdâ as all persons occupying a housing
unit, which may include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or
blood, or unrelated persons sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as
dormitories, retirement or convalescent homes, or other group living situations are
included in population totals, but are not considered households.
Table II-4 provides a comparison of households by type for Moorpark and Ventura
County as a whole, as reported in the 2010 Census. Family households comprised
approximately 82% of all households in the City, as compared to 74% for the County. The
City had more families with children at home, fewer singles living alone, and a somewhat
larger average household size than Ventura County as a whole. These statistics suggest
that there is a somewhat greater need for large units in Moorpark than for other areas of
the County.

      2.   Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market.
Communities need an adequate supply of units available for rent and for sale in order to
accommodate a range of households with varying income, family size and composition,
and lifestyle. Table II-5 provides a comparison of the number of owner-occupied and
renter-occupied units in the City in 2010 as compared to the County as a whole. It
reveals a very high level of homeownership in the City, approximately 14 percentage
points higher than the county (76% City vs. 62% County).

      3.   Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The
U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than
one person per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding
when there are more than 1.5 occupants per room. Table II-6 summarizes overcrowding
for the City of Moorpark.

According to recent Census data, overcrowding was more prevalent among renters
than for owner-occupied units. Approximately 5% of the Cityâs renter-occupied
households were overcrowded compared to only 3% of owner-occupied households.
       4.     Household Income
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community.
According to recent Census data, the median household income in Moorpark was
$103,009, 34% higher than the County as a whole (Table II-7).
                                                                 Table II-7

Extremely Low Income Households
State law requires quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of
extremely low-income (ELI) households. Extremely low income is defined as households
with incomes less than 30% of area median income. The 2013 area median income for
Ventura County was $89,300 (see Table II-16). For extremely-low-income households, this
results in an income of $26,800 or less for a four-person household. Households with
extremely-low-income have a variety of housing needs.
Existing Needs
According to recent Census estimates, approximately 165 extremely-low-income house-
holds resided in Moorpark, representing about 2% of all households. All ELI households
were reported to be paying more than 30% of their income toward housing costs (Table
II-8).
                                                                 Table II-8

Projected Needs
The projected housing need for ELI households is assumed to be 50% of the very-low
income regional housing need of 289 units. As a result, the City has a projected need for
145 ELI units during this planning period. The resources and programs to address this need
are the same as for low-income housing in general and are discussed throughout the
Housing Element, including the Chapter V, Housing Plan. Because the needs of ELI
households overlap extensively with other special needs groups, further analysis and
resources for these households can be found in Chapter II, Needs Assessment, Section E,
Special Needs, and Chapter IV, Constraints, Section A.1.e. Special Needs Housing.
      5.   Overpayment
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of
gross household income. Table II-8 displays recent estimates for overpayment by income
category. About 93% of all lower-income renter households and 76% of all lower-income
owner households were overpaying for housing. Extremely-low-income households
generally suffer the greatest cost burden.
Although homeowners enjoy income and property tax deductions and other benefits
that help to compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to
defer maintenance or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For
lower-income renters, severe cost burden can require families to double up resulting in
overcrowding and related problems. Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs
available in each employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and
size of housing residents can afford.
      6.   Current Employment
Current employment and projected job growth have a significant influence on housing
needs during this planning period. Table II-9 shows that the City had a workforce of
18,907 persons, or 73.2% of the working-age population, according to recent Census
data . This table shows that the Cityâs population had a higher labor force participation
rate than the County as a whole (73.2% City vs. 67.3% County) and had a lower
unemployment rate (5.1% City and 7.2% County).

According to recent Census data, approximately 42% of the Cityâs working residents
were employed in management and professional occupations (Table II-10). A low
percentage of workers (18%) were employed in service-related occupations such as
waiters and beauticians. Blue-collar occupations such as machine operators, assemblers,
farming, transportation, handlers and laborers constituted about 16% of the workforce.

      7.   Projected Job Growth
Future housing needs are affected by the number and type of new jobs created during
this planning period. Table II-11 shows projected job growth by occupation for the
Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura MSA along with median hourly wages for the period
2008-2018. Total employment in Ventura County is expected to grow by 7.7% between
2008 and 2018. The overall growth is expected to add 26,500 new jobs and bring the
Countyâs employment to about 371,000 by 2018.
Residents who are employed in well-paying occupations have less difficulty obtaining
adequate housing than residents in lower-paying jobs. Table II-11 illustrates the growth
trend in low-wage service jobs such as health care support, food preparation and
serving, cleaning and maintenance, sales, and office/administrative support.

          8.       Jobs-Housing Balance
A regional balance of jobs to housing helps to ensure that the demand for housing is
reasonably related to supply. When the number of jobs significantly exceeds the housing
supply, the rental and for-sale housing markets may become overheated, requiring
households to pay a larger percentage of their income for housing. In addition, a tight
housing market can result in overcrowding and longer commute times as workers seek
more affordable housing in outlying areas. The current jobs-housing objective within the
SCAG region is one new housing unit for every 1.5 jobs.1

C. Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the communityâs housing
stock and helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the
number and type of housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure,
vacancy, housing costs, affordability, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to
conversion to market-rate. A housing unit is defined as a house, an apartment, a Mobile
Home, or a group of rooms, occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended
for occupancy as separate living quarters.
      1.   Housing Type and Growth Trends
According to recent Census data, the housing stock in Moorpark was comprised mostly
of single-family detached homes, which made up about 86% of all units, while multi-
family units comprised about 13% of the total. Mobile Homes comprised approximately
1.3% of the Cityâs housing stock. Table II-13 provides a breakdown of the housing stock by
type along with growth trends for the City compared to the county as a whole for the
period 2000-2012.

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                     II. Housing Needs Assessment
Between 2000 and 2012, single-family detached homes represented more than two-
thirds of all units built in the City. While detached homes also comprised the majority of
new construction in the County during this period, it is noteworthy that over one-quarter
of all residential development in the City was comprised of multi-family units. Mobile
homes experienced a decrease in both the City and the county during this period (-11%
City vs. -3% countywide).
      2.    Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior
to 1978 before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed may have
interior or exterior building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built
before 1970 are the most likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in
deteriorated condition. Lead-based paint becomes hazardous to children under age six
and to pregnant women when it peels off walls or is pulverized by windows and doors
opening and closing.
Table II-14 shows the age distribution of the housing stock in Moorpark compared to
Ventura County as a whole.

This table shows that only 9% of the housing units in Moorpark were constructed prior to
1970. These findings suggest that there may be a lesser need for maintenance and
rehabilitation, including remediation of lead-based paint, for the Cityâs housing stock
than other areas of the County.
The City employs one full-time code compliance technician. Typical issues include
property maintenance, illegally parked/inoperative vehicles, overgrown vegetation, and
occupancy of non-habitable structures, such as garages and tool sheds. Code
compliance activities cover the entire city, however the majority of cases are focused in
the central area of Moorpark, where much of the Cityâs older housing stock is located.
The Code Compliance Technician also works in conjunction with the Building and Safety
Division to enforce the Cityâs building code to ensure that construction is safe and legal,

non-habitable spaces such as garages are not used for occupancy, and smoke
detectors are operable.
Based on field experience, Code Compliance and Building Department staff estimate
that approximately 8% of all housing units in the downtown area (an estimated total of
500 units) are in need of some type of rehabilitation (e.g., roofing, doors/windows,
plumbing, electrical) but none are deteriorated to the point of requiring demolition and
replacement. All other residential neighborhoods in the City are less than 30 years old
and do not have significant needs for major rehabilitation.
      3.   Vacancy
Housing vacancy rates as reported by the Department of Finance for 2012 are shown in
Table II-15. The table shows that vacancy rates in Moorpark were very low compared to
most jurisdictions in Ventura County, with just 2.37% of units available for rent or sale.
Rental vacancy rates in the 2% range indicate nearly full occupancy, and contribute to
upward pressures on rents.

a.    Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on
the area (i.e., county) median income (âAMIâ): extremely-low (30% or less of AMI), very-
low (31-50% of AMI), low (51-80% of AMI), moderate (81-120% of AMI) and above
moderate (over 120% of AMI). Housing affordability is based on the relationship between
household income and housing expenses. According to the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) and the California Department of Housing and
Community Development2, housing is considered âaffordableâ if the monthly payment is

no more than 30% of a householdâs gross income. In some areas (such as Ventura
County), these income limits may be increased to adjust for high housing costs.
Table II-16 shows affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for
housing in Ventura County by income category. Based on state-adopted standards, the
maximum affordable monthly rent for extremely-low-income households is $670, while the
maximum affordable rent for very-low-income households is $1,116. The maximum
affordable rent for low-income households is $1,780, while the maximum for moderate-
income households is $2,679.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage
interest rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments,
homeowner association fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the
maximum home purchase prices by income category shown in Table II-16 have been
estimated based on typical conditions.

 Median housing sales price statistics for Ventura County during 2012 (Table II-17) show
that the median price for single-family detached homes was $475,000 while the median
condo price was $218,000. For the County as a whole, median prices were $406,000 and
$242,000 for single-family and condos, respectively. .

Based on the estimated affordable purchase prices shown in Table II-16, only a very small
percentage of single-family homes were affordable to lower-income or moderate-
income residents. However, the median condo price indicates that many low- and
moderate-income households may be able to find affordable attached units for sale in
Moorpark.
c.      Rental Housing
An internet search3 of available rental units in large complexes in Moorpark found rents
ranging from approximately $1,400 for a 1-bedroom unit to $2,300 per month for a 3-
bedroom unit.
When market rents are compared to the amounts low-income households can afford to
pay (Table II-16), it is clear that very-low- and extremely-low-income households have a
difficult time finding housing without overpaying. The gap between market rent and
affordable rent at the very-low-income level is about $700 per month, while the gap at
the extremely-low-income level is $1,100 per month. However, at the low-income and
moderate-income levels, households are much more likely to find affordable rentals.

D. Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to oneâs employment and
income, family characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some Moorpark
residents may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other
housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines âspecial needsâ groups to include persons with
disabilities, the elderly, large households, female-headed households with children,
homeless people, and farm workers. This section contains a discussion of the housing
needs facing each of these groups.
      1.    Persons with Disabilities
Recent ACS data estimated that approximately 2,609 people in Moorpark, or about 8%
of the total population, had some type of disability (see Table II-18). As may be
expected, those aged 65 and over had the highest rate of disabilities. Included within
these disabilities are persons whose disability hinders their ability to live independently
(1.4% of the working age population and 21% of the senior population).

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                           II. Housing Needs Assessment
Housing opportunities for persons with disabilities can be expanded through housing
assistance programs and providing universal design features such as widened doorways,
ramps, lowered countertops, single-level units and ground floor units. During the prior
planning period the City amended the Municipal Code to establish procedures to
ensure reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities pursuant to California
Government Code Â§65008 and Â§65583 (SB 520).
Persons with Developmental Disabilities
As defined by federal law, âdevelopmental disabilityâ means a severe, chronic disability
of an individual that:
      ï·      Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental
             and physical impairments;
      ï·      Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
      ï·      Is likely to continue indefinitely;
      ï·      Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following
             areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language;
             c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or
             g) economic self-sufficiency;
      ï·      Reflects the individualâs need for a combination and sequence of special,
             interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of
             assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually
             planned and coordinated.
The Census Bureau does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S.
Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage
of the population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many
developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy
are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the personâs
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-
based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and
their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental
centers, and two community-based facilities. Moorpark is served by the Tri-Counties
Regional Center4 (TCRC) which is based in Santa Barbara and operates a field office in
Oxnard. As of 2011 the Center served approximately 11,300 clients and had 280 staff
persons. TCRC reported that it assisted 238 Moorpark residents in 2013. Any resident who
has a developmental disability that originated before age 18 is eligible for services.

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                         II. Housing Needs Assessment
Services are offered to people with developmental disabilities based on Individual
Program Plans and may include: Adult day programs; advocacy; assessment/
consultation; behavior management programs; diagnosis and evaluation; independent
living services; infant development programs; information and referrals; mobility training;
prenatal diagnosis; residential care; respite care; physical and occupational therapy;
transportation; consumer, family vendor training; and vocational training. TCRC also
coordinates the state-mandated Early Start program, which provides services for children
under age three who have or are at substantial risk of having a developmental disability.
One of the challenges for persons with developmental disabilities is obtaining suitable
affordable housing. Many children with developmental disabilities are cared for at home
by family members, but as these children move into adulthood their parents or other
caregivers may have increasing difficulty providing needed care at home. Suitable
supportive housing is in short supply. To address this issue, Program 15 includes a
commitment to encourage and facilitate the production of supportive housing for
persons with developmental disabilities.
      2.    Elderly
According to recent Census data, there were 1,240 households in Moorpark where the
householder was 65 or older (Table II-19). Approximately 12% of both owner and renter
householders were in the 65+ age groups. Many elderly persons are dependent on fixed
incomes or are disabled. Elderly householders may be physically unable to maintain their
homes or cope with living alone. The housing needs of this group can be addressed
through smaller units, second units on lots with existing homes, shared living arrange-
ments, congregate housing and housing assistance programs.

      3.    Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as
those with five or more members. Large households are considered a special needs
group because they require more space and larger bedroom counts. According to
recent Census data (Table II-20) there were 934 households in Moorpark with a least five
persons, representing approximately 7% of the total households in the City. About 8% of
owner-occupied households but only 3% of renter-occupied households had 5+
members. This distribution indicates that, while a portion of the Cityâs households need
                                                               II-16                                January 2014

large units with four or more bedrooms, this demand is expected to be less than for
smaller units.

       4.    Female-Headed Households
Female-headed households are a special needs group due to comparatively low rates
of homeownership, lower incomes and higher poverty rates experienced by this group.
According to recent Census estimates (Table II-21) there were approximately 848 female-
headed households in Moorpark. Of the total female-headed households in the City, 44%
were renter-occupied and 56% were owner-occupied. About 6% of owner households
and 19% of renter households had female householders.

       5.    Farm Workers
Unlike most areas of the Southern California metropolitan area, agriculture is still a
significant component of the economy in Ventura County, with a total value of over $1.8
billion in 20115. There is strong public sentiment for retaining agricultural production, as
reflected in the SOAR (Save Open-space and Agricultural Resources) initiatives that have
been approved by voters. Figure II-2 illustrates the wide variety of crops produced in the
county.

                                Agricultural Production Areas â Ventura County
According to the Ventura County Workforce Investment Board, over the past two
decades the number of farm workers continued to increase â- there were 5,000 more
agricultural jobs in Ventura County in 2003 than there were in 1983. This represents more
than 30% growth in an industry that is stagnant in the value of its output. As a result, while
agriculture has become a less significant component of the countyâs economy, its
relative importance as a source of jobs has slipped only a little.
In spite of the increase in agriculture sector jobs, wages have shown no tendency to
increase. Quite the opposite has occurred, in fact. The real, inflation-adjusted agricultural
workerâs average salary has fallen in 2000 dollars from $20,503 in 1983 to only $19,729 in
2003. This is counter to the national trend where real agricultural wages grew by 15%
between 1993 and 2002.
Official employment data suggests there are over 20,000 agricultural workers in Ventura
County. Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail estimates that 17,000 to 24,000 immigrant
workers come to the county each year at peak growing seasons. Other estimates of the
Ventura County farm population come from the Migrant Health Program, housed in the
federal Bureau of Primary Health Care, Health Resources and Services Administration6. In
their most recent study (2000), MHP researchers estimated the number of farm workers in
several categories: total number of farm workers, the number of seasonal farm workers,

As part of its technical assistance to member jurisdictions for the 2013 Housing Element
Cycle, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) compiled a variety of
demographic and employment statistics7 that included information related to farm
workers. According to SCAGâs sources, about 14,500 persons in Ventura County are
employed in agricultural occupations. Of these, 183 reported Moorpark as their place of
residence (1.3% of the County total), and 250 worked in Moorpark (1.7% of the County
total) (Table II-23). A variety of factors could explain the difference between Census
data and the Bureau of Primary Health Care estimates, including the difference between
job location and residence location, the undocumented status of some workers, or their
living arrangements.

Since the majority of farm laborers in Ventura County are permanent non-migrant and
seasonal laborers, the housing needs of farmworkers are primarily addressed through the
provision of permanent affordable housing, such as apartments, lower-cost single-family
homes, and mobile homes. In compliance with the Employee Housing Act (Health and
Safety Code Â§17021.5 and Â§17021.6), the City amended the Municipal Code to allow
farmworker housing for up to 12 units or 36 persons by-right (i.e., without a CUP or other
discretionary approval) in zones allowing agricultural uses. The City has also approved
non-profit affordable housing developments that respond to the needs of permanent
and seasonal farmworkers.

        6.   Student Population
The City is home to Moorpark Community College with an enrollment of approximately
15,000 students. Moorpark is also located near several regional colleges, including
California State University Channel Islands (Camarillo), and California Lutheran University
(Thousand Oaks).
Students have special housing needs due to limited income and financial resources.
Many students attending part-time in community colleges work full-time jobs, while full
time students often work less. In either case, students often earn low income, pay more
than half their income for housing, and thus may double up to save income. According
to recent Census estimates8, 2,767 Moorpark residents were enrolled in college.
The type of housing need depends on the nature of the enrollment. Currently, about 67%
of the students are part-time9, and many work full-time or part-time within their respective
communities. As is the case with most community colleges, no housing is provided by the
college. Because the vast majority of students commute from other communities where
they work or live, the need for housing is not considered significant. Moorpark College
does, however, assist students in finding appropriate housing in the community.
        7.   Homeless Persons
Homelessness is a continuing national problem that persists within local cities and
communities including Ventura County. During the past two decades, an increasing
number of single persons have remained homeless year after year and have become
the most visible of all homeless persons. Other persons (particularly families) have
experienced shorter periods of homelessness. However, they are often replaced by other
families and individuals in a seemingly endless cycle of homelessness.
The homeless count conducted by the Ventura County Homeless and Housing Coalition
(VCHHC) in January 2012 reported 5 homeless persons in Moorpark, which represents
about 0.3% of the county total (Table II-24). The most recent survey by VCHHC identified
a number of sub-populations of the homeless, as shown in Table II-25. These include
families that might be displaced through evictions, women and children displaced
through abusive family life, persons with substance abuse problems, or persons suffering
from mental illness.

Although there are myriad causes of homelessness, according to Ventura County
information from 2007, among the most common causes are the following:
      ï·     Substance Abuse and Alcohol
           The incidence of alcohol and other drug abuse within the homeless population
           is estimated to be three times higher than the general population (30% vs.
           10%). This estimate is closely aligned with national survey statistics. The Ventura
           County Housing and Homeless Coalition identifies a need in Ventura County
           for treatment facilities with housing and clinical staff. They also recommend
           that a treatment facility be established within the county for youth with drug
           and alcohol addiction.
           The State of California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs licenses
           residential facilities and/or certified alcohol and drug programs in Ventura
           County. There are eleven residential facilities and two residential detoxification
                                                              II-21                                         January 2014

           facilities in the county. None are located in Moorpark. Facilities available for
           substance abusers (including homeless substance abusers) are coordinated
           through the Countyâs Alcohol and Drug Program.
      ï·     Domestic Violence
           The Ventura County Housing and Homeless Coalition has identified a need for
           additional shelters for battered women and runaway youth. These individuals
           also require counseling and assistance to become self-sufficient or return to
           their families. Victims of household violence can become homeless as a result
           of escaping abusive living environments. They also suffer physical and psycho-
           logical trauma as a result of the abuse. Many of these persons (almost
           exclusively women) are ill-equipped to fend for themselves and their children.
           Without access to affordable housing, reliable transportation and supportive
           counseling, they are at a greater disadvantage and create special homeless
           needs. Common issues faced by battered women are lack of jobs, lack of
           child care, lack of suitable housing, under-employment, codependent
           substance abuse, and a need for marketable skills.
      ï·     Mental Illness
           According to the Turning Point Foundation, persons who are homeless and
           mentally ill have special needs and are not being served well in traditional
           homeless shelters. Many are at risk in the community, frequently being
           victimized and often suffering from physical and mental illnesses due to lack of
           proper nourishment and shelter. Many of the homeless mentally ill do not avail
           themselves of services or cannot be served by traditional services due to their
           untreated psychiatric symptoms, active substance abuse, or histories of
           abusive behavior.
           The incidence of homelessness for the chronically mentally ill is expected to
           increase in Ventura County due to a shortage of affordable housing and the
           closing of single occupancy hotels and residential care facilities. National
           surveys indicate the mentally ill comprise approximately 20% of the homeless
           population (plus a portion of the 21% of the homeless who are both mentally ill
           and are suffering from drug and/or alcohol abuse). Local service providers
           estimate that 33% of the homeless are also mentally ill. Moorpark, as part of the
           Ventura County service area, receives assistance with the homeless mentally ill
           from the Ventura County Behavioral Health Department.
Needs of the Homeless Population
While there are no emergency homeless shelters in Moorpark, several homeless shelters
and service providers operate in adjacent communities. These include the Conejo Winter
Shelter in Thousand Oaks, which is operated by Lutheran Social Services, the winter
shelter run by PADS in Simi Valley, and the Samaritan Center in Simi Valley, which
operates a drop-in center and supportive services.
As a member of the Ventura County Council of Governmentâs Standing Committee on
Homelessness, the City is engaged in addressing homelessness and the needs of the
homeless throughout the region. Locally, the City funds Catholic Charities, which
                                             II-22                              January 2014

provides eviction prevention services that help very-low-income individuals and families
that are at risk of becoming homeless. In addition, the agency provides a variety of
services such as food, clothing and referrals to those persons who are homeless. Local
service providers also provide eviction prevention services and landlord/tenant
counseling to lower-income Moorpark residents.
E.      Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
This section identifies residential projects in the city that are under an affordability
restriction, and identifies those that are at risk of losing their low-income affordability
restrictions within the ten-year period 2013-2023. This information is used in establishing
quantified objectives for units that can be conserved during this planning period. The
inventory of assisted units includes units that have been assisted under any federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), state, local and/or other
program.
Table II-26 provides a list of developments within the City of Moorpark that currently
participate in a federal, state or local program that provided some form of assistance,
either through financial subsidy or a control measure. As seen in the table, none of the
units have covenants due to expire prior to 2023. Data compiled by SCAG and the
California Housing Partnership confirm that there are no at-risk units in Moorpark.

F.     Future Growth Needs
       1.      Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to
plan for anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the anticipated need for housing within
each jurisdiction for the period from January 2014 to October 2021. Communities then
determine how they will address this need through the process of updating the Housing
Elements of their General Plans.
The current RHNA was adopted by the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) in October 2012. The future need for housing is determined primarily by the
forecasted growth in households in a community. Each new household, created by a
child moving out of a parent's home, by a family moving to a community for
employment, and so forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The housing need for new
households is then adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy to promote housing
choice and mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost
due to demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these
factors â household growth, vacancy need, and replacement need â determines the
construction need for a community. Total housing need is then distributed among four
income categories10 on the basis of the Countyâs income distribution, with adjustments to
avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in any community.
       2.      2014-2021 Moorpark Growth Needs
The total housing growth need for the City of Moorpark during the 2014-2021 planning

III. RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
A. Land Resources
Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an
âinventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and
public facilities and services to these sites.â A detailed analysis of approved projects,
pending applications, vacant land and potential redevelopment opportunities is
provided in Appendix B. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table III-1. The table
shows that the cityâs land inventory, including approved projects, pending applications
and the potential development of vacant and underutilized parcels, exceeds the RHNA
allocation for all income categories

A discussion of public facilities and infrastructure needed to serve future development is
contained in Section IV.B, Non-Governmental Constraints. There are currently no known
service limitations that would preclude the level of development described in the RHNA,
although developers will be required to pay fees or construct public improvements prior
to or concurrent with development.
B.    Financial and Administrative Resources
      1.    State and Federal Resources
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG)
      Federal funding for housing programs is available through the Department of
      Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Since the City is not an entitlement
      jurisdiction, Moorpark receives its CDBG allocation through the County of Ventura
      rather than directly from HUD. The CDBG program is very flexible in that the funds
      can be used for a wide range of activities. Eligible activities include, but are not
      limited to, acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or property, public facilities
      and improvements, relocation, rehabilitation and construction (under certain
      limitations) of housing, homeownership assistance, and clearance activities. The
      County is the final decision-making body regarding annual CDBG applications and
                                                                 III-1                                    January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                     III. Resources and Opportunities
      the City plays an advisory role in recommending which applications to fund. In past
      CDBG cycles, Moorpark received approximately $192,000 annually in CDBG funds,
      15% of which was allocated to public service projects and the remainder allocated
      toward public improvement projects. Under the CDBG agreement, the County
      ensures that an amount within 5% of the Cityâs annual allocation is used for any
      applications received relevant to Moorpark. In the past, the Cityâs public service
      allocation has typically been used to fund social service organizations located
      within the City. The public improvement allocation has been used to fund
      architectural services for the Ruben Castro Human Services Center, a 25,000-sq.ft.
      âunder one roofâ concept that will house various social service agencies at one
      location.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program
         The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program was created by the Tax Reform Act
         of 1986 to provide an alternate method of funding low- and moderate-income
         housing. Each state receives a tax credit allocation, based upon population,
         toward funding housing that meets program guidelines. The tax credits are then
         used to leverage private capital for new construction or acquisition and
         rehabilitation of affordable housing. Limitations on projects funded under the Tax
         Credit programs include minimum requirements that a certain percentage of units
         remain rent-restricted, based upon median income. One tax credit project has
         been built in Moorpark to date-- the Area Housing Authorityâs Charles Street
         Terrace, which was completed in 2012.
Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC)
      This program provides a federal tax credit for income-qualified homebuyers
      equivalent to 15% of the annual mortgage interest. Generally, the tax savings are
      calculated as income to help buyers qualify to purchase a home. Using an MCC,
      first-time buyers can save $700 to $2,500 a year on their annual federal income tax
      bill. The City has participated in the program since 1997. There have been no MCCâs
      issued during this planning period. This is presumably due to the fact that in order to
      purchase a home in Moorpark, a prospective purchaserâs income has to be higher
      than the income limits allowed by the MCC program. The current goal is to assist 3
      households over a 3-year period.11 There may be MCCâs issued during the current
      planning period due to the downturn in the housing market.
Section 8 Rental Assistance
      The City maintains membership in the Area Housing Authority of the County of
      Ventura, which administers the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program. The
      Housing Assistance Payments Program assists elderly and disabled households by
      paying the difference between 30% of an eligible household's income and the
      actual cost of renting a unit. The Housing Authority also operates Tafoya Terrace, a
      30-unit affordable senior apartment project in Moorpark and Charles Street Terrace,
      a 20-unit affordable large family apartment project adjacent to Tafoya Terrace.

      While these two apartment developments are available to tenants who receive
      Section 8 certificates, they are not restricted to only Section 8 tenants.
      2.    Local Resources
Moorpark Redevelopment Agency
        The Redevelopment Agency of the City of Moorpark (Redevelopment Agency)
        has been dissolved by AB x1 26. The City of Moorpark (City) has elected to
        become the Successor Agency of the Redevelopment Agency of the City of
        Moorpark (Successor Agency) and is tasked with winding down the activities of
        the former Redevelopment Agency. The City has also elected to assume the
        housing activities of the former Redevelopment Agency. The Successor Agency
        has successfully transferred the housing assets to the City with approval from the
        Oversight Board to the Successor Agency and the Department of Finance (DOF).
        The City plans to develop the vacant parcels during this planning cycle and use
        the land proceeds to continue its affordable housing land banking program. The
        Successor Agency has completed the Long Range Property Management Plan
        and has submitted it to the DOF for approval.
In-Lieu Fees and the Housing Trust Fund
      Since 1997, the City has collected or has agreements in place for the collection of
      in-lieu fees from developers for the purposes of providing affordable housing
      pursuant to defined development agreements. The In-Lieu Fees are project-specific
      and vary based on the terms of the Development Agreement. Annual increases in
      the fees are tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The revenue collected from
      developers is placed in the Housing Trust Fund, which is used for the provision and/or
      maintenance of affordable housing in Moorpark. At the current rates for all
      approved Development Agreements, the City can expect a total of about $1.9
      million of in-lieu fees, contingent upon buildout of market rate units. The trust fund is
      currently at about $3.6 million.

      single-family homes at affordable prices in Santa Barbara. PSHHC partnered with
      Cabrillo and developed the Villa Campesina project consisting of 62 homes in
      Moorpark.
C. Energy Conservation Opportunities
State law requires all new construction to comply with "energy budget" standards that
establish maximum allowable energy use from depletable sources (Title 24 of the
California Administrative Code). These requirements apply to such design components
as structural insulation, air infiltration and leakage control, setback features on
thermostats, water heating system insulation (tanks and pipes) and swimming pool
covers if a pool is equipped with a fossil fuel or electric heater. State law also requires
that a tentative tract map provide for future passive or natural heating or cooling
opportunities in the subdivision, including designing the lot sizes and configurations to
permit orienting structures to take advantage of a southern exposure, shade or prevailing
breezes.
The 2013 California Green Building Standards Code became effective January 1, 2014,
and the City will adopt updates as they become available.
Consistent with Assembly Bill 1881, in January of 2010, the City adopted by reference, the
model water efficient landscape ordinance of the State of California, as contained in
the California Code of Regulations Title 23. Waters, Division 2. Department of Water
Resources, Chapter 2.7. Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance, Sections 490
through 494, as the water efficient landscape ordinance of the city of Moorpark. The
Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance, (WELO) has been updated to establish a structure
for designing, installing, maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new
and rehabilitated projects. The ordinance reduces water use to the lowest practical
amount and sets an upper limit that shall not be exceeded. It also establishes provisions
for water management practices and water waste prevention for established
landscapes. The ordinance intends to promote the values and benefits of landscapes
while recognizing the need to use water and other resources efficiently.
In 2004, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 2004-2169 establishing Design Standards
for Solar Energy Systems to ensure that solar energy systems are integrated into the
buildings they serve without detracting from the visual character. This Resolution allows
issuance of ministerial permits, by-right for the installation of solar panels on residential
structures.
Southern California Edison (SCE) and the Southern California Gas Company offer energy
conservation programs to residents of Moorpark, including audits of home energy use to
reduce electricity consumption, refrigerator rebates, appliance repair and weatheriza-
tion assistance to qualified low-income households, buyerâs guides for appliances and
incentives (by the Gas Company) to switch from electric to gas appliances. Direct
assistance to low-income households is provided by the Gas Company through the
California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program and by SCE through its Energy
Management Assistance Program.

Both companies have programs to encourage energy conservation in new construction.
SCEâs energy rebate program applies to residential developers as well as individual
customers. SCE also offers an Energy STAR new home program, and Sustainable
Communities Program offering design assistance and financial incentives for sustainable
housing development projects. The Gas Companyâs Energy Advanced Home Program is
offered to residential developers who install energy-efficient gas appliances that exceed
California energy standards by at least 15%.

Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General
Plan to guide its future. The land use element of the General Plan establishes the basic
land uses and density of development within the various areas of the city. Under state
law, the General Plan elements must be internally consistent and the Cityâs zoning must
be consistent with the General Plan. Thus, the land use plan must provide suitable
locations and densities to implement the policies of the Housing Element.

  Sources: Land Use Element, 1992; Moorpark Zoning Code, 2013
The Land Use Element of Moorpark's General Plan sets forth policies for guiding local
development. These policies, together with zoning regulations, establish the location and
type of residential development that may occur. A comprehensive update to the Land
Use Element was adopted in 1992, and several significant amendments have been
adopted since that time. These include conversion of about 2,071 acres of rural
residential designated land to higher residential densities and open space; including the
Country Club Estates, Meridian Hills, Pacific Communities, Birdsall and Essex residential
developments. There have been adoptions or substantial amendments of three Specific
Plans (Carlsberg, Downtown and Moorpark Highlands) and the approval of a voter-
initiated City Urban Restriction Boundary (CURB).
Table IV-1 details the major General Plan and zoning land use categories and types of
homes permitted. The Zoning Code allows for a range of residential uses in different
settings. The Code was amended in 2013 to establish a new RPD-20 zoning district
allowing attached housing by-right at a minimum density of 20 units/acre.

  * RPD permit required for any development that creates five or more separate residential lots in the R-A, R-E, R-O, R-1, and R-2 zones.
  1. Density Bonuses can be approved up to 100% with a City Council Approved Density Bonus and Development Agreement
  n/a: Residential development standard not specified in the Zoning Code
  Note: Residential development is also permitted within the Planned Community (P-C) zone on minimum 100-acre site. As with R-P-D, SP
  and TPD zones, development standards are âby permit.â
b.      Zoning
The type, location, density, and scale of residential development is regulated primarily
through the Zoning Code. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the
health, safety, and general welfare of residents, as well as implement the policies of the
General Plan. The Zoning Code also serves to preserve the character and integrity of
existing neighborhoods. Table IV-2 summarizes pertinent development standards for the
non-Specific Plan areas of Moorpark. These standards allow maximum densities to be
achieved and do not add significantly to development costs.
c.      Specific Plan Areas
Moorpark has four Specific Plans areas: Carlsberg, Hitch Ranch, Moorpark Highlands, and
the Downtown Specific Plan. These Specific Plans have been designated to compre-
                                                                         IV-2                                                  January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                    IV. Constraints
hensively address a variety of unique land uses (e.g. topography, viewshed, and
circulation) and provide focused planning and development standards tailored to the
unique characteristics or purpose of a particular area.
Carlsberg Specific Plan
      The Carlsberg Specific Plan was adopted by the City Council in 1994. This specific
      plan area encompasses a total of 488.4 acres of land, of which 220.4 acres are
      designated open space. There are a total of 155.0 acres dedicated to single-family
      detached residential development ranging in densities between 3.0 units an acre
      up to 5 units per gross acre. There are 73.0 acres designated for Sub-regional Retail /
      Commercial / Business Park uses and 7.0 acres of Institutionally designated land.
      There is also a 9.0 acre nature preserve, a 6.5 acre public park and 17.5 acres of
      land dedicated for roadway, access purposes. The residential component of this
      Specific Plan is completely built out.
Hitch Ranch Specific Plan
      The Hitch Ranch Specific Plan, in the northwest quadrant of the City, consists of
      285.10 acres, of which over half of the acreage is proposed for 755 residential units.
      The project contains two single-family residential development areas, with lots
      ranging from 4,000 to 7,000 square feet. The Specific Plan includes a multi-family
      housing component consisting of a high-density residential area of 32.78 acres with
      295 housing units. This project entered into the planning and environmental stage as
      of 2000. The site planning and project description has been finalized for application
      processing purposes and the Draft EIR is being completed for circulation and
      consideration. In 2013, a 23.44-acre portion of this property was rezoned to RPD-20-
      U.
Moorpark Highlands Specific Plan
      The Moorpark Highlands Specific Plan, located in the northern part of the city,
      consists of approximately 445 acres. Of the total acreage, 40% is designated for
      residential use at densities ranging from 1.3 to 12.0 units/acre. According to the
      Specific Plan, approximately 685 single- and multi-family homes will be built in this
      Specific Plan area. The Specific Plan has been approved by the City Council and
      development implementation is underway. Twenty-eight low-income affordable
      units have been provided in this development. All 28 affordable units are currently
      occupied, and 7 more are under construction.
Downtown Specific Plan
      The Downtown Specific Plan contains High Street, Old Town, several residential
      neighborhoods, and the downtown commercial area. Within this area, residential
      zones permit up to 6 dwelling units per acre, while the Residential Planned
      Development zone permits up to 28 units per acre under land consolidation criteria,
      when in conjunction with the Cityâs density bonus provisions. Housing development
      that has occurred in the Downtown Specific Plan in recent years has consisted of
      infill housing projects, including single-family, duplexes, and one senior housing
                                              IV-3                               January 2014

      project. The senior project, known as Tafoya Terrace, is operated by the Area
      Housing Authority of the County of Ventura. There are 30 units restricted to very-low-
      and extremely-low-income seniors. Within this Specific Plan area, the Area Housing
      Authority also built Charles Street Terrace, with 20 apartment units restricted to low-
      and very-low-income residents.
d.    Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites with
appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of
housing for all economic segments of the population. Housing types include single-family
and multi-family housing opportunities, factory-built housing, Mobile Homes, as well as
housing for persons with special needs such as emergency shelters, transitional housing,
and farm labor housing.
Moorparkâs Zoning Code permits a wide variety of housing types, as discussed below and
summarized in Table IV-3. Zone clearance and administrative permits require only the
approval of the Director of Community Development. A conditional use permit requires a
public hearing and clearance by the Planning Commission. RPD (Residential Planned
Development) clearance requires Planning Commission approval. Each of these permit
procedures is described in Subsection 4, âDevelopment Permit Procedures.â
Multi-Family Housing
      Moorparkâs Zoning Code provides for multi-family housing in the R-2 and Residential
      Planned Development (R-P-D) zones, which allow densities up to 30 dwelling units
      per acre (assuming a density bonus and additional incentives). In addition, the
      Downtown Specific Plan allows multi-family housing up to 20 units/acre, excluding
      density bonus, which can only be achieved for a low/very-low or senior housing
      project. The provision of multi-family housing in these zones facilitates the
      production of lower-income housing. In 2004, the state legislature passed Assembly
      Bill 2348, which established 20 units/acre as the âdefault densityâ that is assumed to
      be suitable for lower-income housing in smaller suburban jurisdictions such as
      Moorpark. Multi-family densities of at least 20 units/acre can be achieved in the R-2
      and RPD zones as well as within specific plans.
      Municipal Code Chapter 17.36.030 contains development standards for properties
      within the Residential Planned Development (R-P-D) zone (see Table IV-2). These
      minimum standards may be modified by up to 20% when the developer agrees to
      include affordable units in the project.
      The framework provided by the General Plan and Zoning Code creates a high
      degree of flexibility for developers, which also allows the City to provide significant
      incentives to encourage the provision of affordable housing. As noted in Appendix
      B, this approach has been very successful in generating low- and moderate-income
      housing in previous planning periods. Without the âleverageâ created by this
      regulatory flexibility, it is unlikely that affordable housing production would have
      been as successful.

Second Units
         In compliance with AB 1866, the City has adopted a Second Unit Ordinance which
         makes permits for second units ministerial (Zoning Clearance only). Second units are
         permitted on conforming lots of Â¼-acre or larger. Maximum unit sizes range from 800
         to 1,100 square feet, depending on lot size. Production of second units ranges from
         one to three units per year.
Mobile Homes and Manufactured Housing
         There is often an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a plant rather than
         on site, thereby reducing cost. State law precludes local governments from
         prohibiting the installation of Mobile Homes on permanent foundations on single-
         family lots. It also declares a Mobile Home park to be a permitted land use on any
         land planned and zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring the average
         density in a new Mobile Home park to be less than that permitted by the Municipal
         Code.
         Moorpark has about 243 Mobile Homes within the community. Mobile Home parks
         are permitted in all residential zones subject to a CUP from the Planning
         Commission. The Mobile Home Park Rent Stabilization Program (see Chapter V,
         Program 11a) limits space rent increases and the Hardship Waiver Program provides
         a waiver for tenants if a space rent increase results in economic hardship. The City
         also participates in Mobile Home revenue bond financing to provide for reserved
         spaces and affordable units for very-low-income households.
                                                                                 IV-5                                                          January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                       IV. Constraints
Single Room Occupancy
      Single room occupancy (SRO) facilities are small studio-type units intended for
      occupancy by one or two persons and may have shared bathroom or kitchen
      facilities. The Zoning Code allows SROs by-right in the C-2 zone subject to objective
      development standards.
e.    Special Needs Housing
Persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities, persons with
disabilities, farm workers, persons needing emergency shelter or transitional living
arrangements, and single room occupancy units. The Cityâs provisions for these housing
types are discussed below.
Extremely-Low-Income Households
      Many of the persons and households discussed in this section under the topic of
      special needs fall within the extremely-low-income category, which is defined as
      30% or less of area median income, or up to $26,800 per year for a 4-person
      household in Ventura County (2013).
      A variety of City policies and programs described in Chapter V address the needs
      of extremely-low-income households, including those in need of residential care
      facilities, persons with disabilities, and farm workers. However, it should be
      recognized that development of new housing for the lowest income groups
      typically requires very large public subsidies, and the level of need is greater than
      can be met due to funding limitations, especially during these times of declining
      public revenues.
Residential Care Facilities
      Residential care facilities refer to any family home, group home, or rehabilitation
      facility that provides non-medical care to persons in need of personal services,
      protection, supervision, assistance, guidance, or training essential for daily living.
      Moorpark complies with the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act by
      allowing State-authorized, certified, or licensed family care homes, foster homes, or
      group homes serving six or fewer persons by-right in all residential zones.
      Care facilities, including congregate living health facilities, community treatment
      facilities, hospices, long-term health care facilities, residential care facilities for the
      elderly, residential care facilities for persons with chronic life-threatening illness,
      skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities, social rehabilitation facilities,
      transitional housing placement facilities, and transitional shelter care facilities are
      permitted in C-O, C-1, CPD and C-2 zones, subject to approval of a conditional use
      permit from the Planning Commission.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
      The Cityâs building codes require that new residential construction comply with the
      federal American with Disabilities Act (ADA). ADA provisions include requirements
                                              IV-6                                  January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                        IV. Constraints
        for a minimum percentage of units in new developments to be fully accessible to
        the physically disabled. Provisions of fully accessible units may also increase the
        overall project development costs. However, unlike the Uniform Building Code,
        enforcement of ADA requirements is not at the discretion of the City, but is
        mandated under federal law. Compliance with building codes and the ADA may
        increase the cost of housing production and can also impact the viability of
        rehabilitation of older properties required to be brought up to current code
        standards. However, these regulations provide minimum standards that must be
        complied with in order to ensure the development of safe and accessible housing.
        Some aspects of zoning regulations have the potential to act as a constraint on
        housing for persons with disabilities. Such regulations include how âfamilyâ is defined,
        physical separation or concentration requirements for group homes, site planning
        requirements, parking standards, and procedures for ensuring reasonable
        accommodation for persons with disabilities.
        ï·      Definition of âFamilyâ. The Municipal Code defines âfamilyâ as âOne or more
               persons living together in a dwelling unit, with common access to, and
               common use of all living, kitchen, and eating areas within the dwelling unitâ
               consistent with current law.
        ï·      Concentration requirements. The City imposes no minimum separation
               requirements for residential care facilities.
        ï·      Parking requirements. One space per 2 beds plus 1 space for each 500 square
               feet is required for care facilities.
        ï·      Reasonable accommodation. The current Zoning Code allows reasonable
               accommodations by-right, that include construction of uncovered porches,
               platforms, or landings that do not extend above the floor level of the first floor
               of the main structure, and these features may extend into required setback
               areas not more than six feet. Also, construction or installation of safety guard
               railings required for stairs, landings, porches, and installation of depressed
               ramps are allowed and may encroach into front, side or rear setback areas,
               provided they are open and do not exceed 42 inches in height. While a
               zoning clearance is not required by the Planning Department, issuance of a
               building permit for construction is required to ensure that construction is in
               compliance with building codes. In order to ensure that the Cityâs procedures
               for reviewing and approving requests for reasonable accommodation do not
               pose a constraint to persons with disabilities, the Municipal Code was
               amended in 2013 to establish procedures for reviewing and approving
               requests for reasonable accommodation consistent with current law.
Farm Worker Housing
        The state Employee Housing Act12 regulates farm worker housing and generally
        requires that facilities with no more than 36 beds or 12 units be treated as an
        agricultural land use that is not subject to any conditional use permit that is not

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                     IV. Constraints
      required of other agricultural uses in the same zone. The Zoning Code allows small
      farm worker housing projects in conformance with the Employee Housing Act.
Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
      Emergency shelters, transitional and supportive housing are part of the Ventura
      County regional continuum of care to address the needs of the homeless
      population. Emergency shelters are year-round facilities that provide a safe
      alternative to the streets, usually for 30 days or less. Transitional housing is longer-
      term housing, typically up to two years. Transitional housing requires that the
      resident participate in a structured program to work toward the established goals so
      that they can move on to permanent housing. Residents are often provided with an
      array of supportive services to assist them in meeting goals. Supportive housing has
      no limit on length of stay and is intended to provide housing with support services to
      persons with disabilities.
      In conformance with Senate Bill 2 (California Government Code Â§65583 and
      Â§65589.5), the Zoning Code allows emergency shelters by-right subject to objective
      development standards in the C-2 zone, and also at existing established places of
      worship in residential zones, provided that the use is established in coordination with
      an existing permitted religious facility. The C-2 zone comprises approximately 1.05
      acres and includes six vacant or underutilized sites that could accommodate at
      least one year-round shelter. In addition, there are approximately 11 permitted
      places of worship in Moorpark where shelters could be established.
      SB 2 also requires that transitional/supportive housing be treated as a residential use
      that is subject only to the same requirements and procedures that apply to any
      other residential use of the same type in the same zone. The Zoning Code was
      amended in 2013 in compliance with these requirements. As a result of the passage
      of SB 745 in 2013, the Zoning Code will be amended to revise the definitions of
      transitional and supportive housing consistent with Government Code Â§65582 (see
      Chapter V, Program 7).
f.     Off-Street Parking Requirements
The Cityâs parking requirements for residential zones vary by residential type, housing
product, and parking needs (see Table IV-2). Two enclosed parking spaces are required
for a single-family residence 2,800 square-feet or less and three enclosed spaces are
required for a single-family residence over 2,800 square feet. For multi-family housing, one
space in a garage or carport is required for a bachelor or studio unit, 1.75 spaces per unit
with one space in a garage or carport is required for each one-bedroom unit, and two
spaces (one enclosed in a garage or carport) are required for units with two or more
bedrooms, plus an additional one-half space for guest parking is required for each unit.
Mobile Home parks require two covered parking spaces for each unit plus one-quarter
space per unit for guest parking. Second units are required to have one space for a one-
bedroom unit and two spaces for a two-bedroom unit. For senior housing projects
restricted to residents age 55 or older, 0.5 space is required per unit. The City has
reduced parking standards through development agreements to encourage the
                                              IV-8                                January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                    IV. Constraints
production of affordable housing. The City also allows reduced parking consistent with
state Density Bonus law (Government Code Â§65915) upon the developerâs request.
g.    Density Bonus and Inclusionary/In-lieu Fee Program
Moorpark employs a variety of tools that facilitate and encourage the development of
affordable housing for all economic segments of the community. The two primary tools
are the density bonus program and the inclusionary/in-lieu fee program. These programs
are employed alone or in tandem to facilitate and encourage the construction of
affordable housing for lower- and moderate-income households.
Moorpark has adopted a Density Bonus Ordinance (Chapter 17.64 of the Zoning Code)
that allows a density increase of up to 100% above the otherwise allowable maximum for
qualifying projects (see Chapter V, Program No. 16). The increase in the allowable
housing units under a density bonus is based on the percentage density increase above
that permitted under the existing zoning per state density bonus law (Government Code
Â§65915 et seq.) and Chapter 17.64 of the Zoning Code, as follows:
      ï·    When one hundred percent (100%) of the units in a housing development
           project are restricted to be affordable to low- or very-low-income households
           for the life of the project, a density bonus up to a maximum of one hundred
           percent (100%) greater density than allowed by the existing zone may be
           granted by the city council when considering project entitlements. The one
           hundred percent (100%) maximum density bonus is inclusive of all density
           bonuses allowed under Government Code Â§65915 et seq., and Chapter 17.64
           of the zoning code.
      ï·    When at least sixty percent (60%) of the units in a housing development
           project are restricted to be affordable to low- or very-low-income households
           for the life of the project, a density bonus up to a maximum of seventy-five
           percent (75%) greater density than allowed by the existing zone may be
           granted by the city council when considering project entitlements. The
           seventy-five percent (75%) maximum density bonus is inclusive of all density
           bonuses allowed under Government Code Â§65915 et seq., and Chapter 17.64
           of the zoning code.
      ï·    For density bonuses higher than required by state law, the city council must
           find that: (a) the project will help to meet a local housing need for family
           housing as identified by the housing element of the general plan; and (b) the
           project will be compatible with surrounding development. Density bonuses
           higher than required by state law may not be granted for an age-restricted
           senior housing project.
In conjunction with the Density Bonus Ordinance, concessions and/or incentives
determined by the city council necessary in order to develop affordable units in lieu of or
in addition to density bonuses may include, but are not limited to, the following:
                                             IV-9                                January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                        IV. Constraints
      ï·     A reduction in development standards by an amount not to exceed twenty
            percent (20%), or a reduction in architectural design requirements beyond the
            minimum building standards adopted by the city; and
      ï·     Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer or the
            city, which result in identifiable cost reductions.
      ï·     The City Council, in granting higher density bonuses under subsections (B)(2)
            and (B)(3), is not obligated to grant any additional incentives or concessions.
State law (Government Code Â§65915) was amended (SB 1818 of 2004) to increase the
maximum permitted density bonus to 35% along with other changes. Therefore, in 2009,
the City adopted a Density Bonus Ordinance to update the Zoning Code in compliance
with current state law, as outlined above.
The Cityâs Inclusionary Program (see Chapter V, Program No. 12) requires that a minimum
of 15% of units constructed within the Redevelopment Project Area to be affordable to
lower-income households and has a minimum 10% requirement for all Specific Plan
projects outside the Project Area. If a developer cannot meet all of the affordable
housing requirements, an in lieu fee is paid. In spite of the dissolution of the
Redevelopment Agency, this program is being maintained for projects within the former
redevelopment project area.
As an example, the 312-unit Archstone complex was required to build 62 lower-income
units (including 25 very-low-income units). Pacific Communities was required to provide
22 low-income units, but opted to pay $900,000 in fees to cover the very-low-income
requirement. In-lieu fees are used to assist in the development, rehabilitation or
preservation of affordable housing.
Density bonus can be an effective means, in conjunction with inclusionary requirements,
to facilitate affordable housing development. In order to ensure the provision of
affordable housing, the City has granted density increases for projects that are required
to provide inclusionary units or pay in-lieu fees. As an example, the Archstone project
was granted higher densities (16.2 du/acre), reduced parking standards, and reduced
setbacks in return for setting aside 20% of the units for lower-income households.
h.    Condominium Conversions
In order to reduce the impacts of condominium conversions on residents of rental
housing and to maintain a supply of rental housing for low- and moderate-income
persons, the City's Municipal Code (Section 16.30.040 to .070) provides for the following:
        1.     Tenant notifications of the proposed conversion in compliance with Section
               66452.8 of the State Subdivision Map Act;
        2.     A phasing plan to reflect unit sales and tenant relocation agreements;
        3.     A tenant assistance plan that provides for a 90-day period for the tenant to
               exercise his or her right of first refusal to purchase a unit pursuant to Section
               66427.1(d) of the Subdivision Map Act. The assistance plan also provides for
               the reimbursement of tenant moving costs;
                                                 IV-10                               January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                     IV. Constraints
         4.     Reservation of a minimum of 20% of the units as affordable, with 10% low-
                income and 10% very-low-income units guaranteed through a recorded
                affordable housing agreement between the property owner and city; and
         5.     A requirement that vacancy rates at the time of the approval of the
                conversion are below guidelines set forth in the General Plan.
As a result of these requirements, the potential impact of condominium conversions is not
a significant constraint on the preservation of affordable rental housing.
i.     Building Codes and Enforcement
State law prohibits the imposition of building standards that are not necessitated by local
geographic, climatic or topographic conditions and requires that local governments
making changes or modifications in building standards must report such changes to the
Department of Housing and Community Development and file an expressed finding that
the change is needed.
The City's building codes are based upon the 2010 California Building, Plumbing,
Mechanical and Electrical Codes with local amendments adopted that address
structural calculations. These are considered to be the minimum necessary to protect the
public's health, safety and welfare. No additional regulations have been imposed by the
city that would unnecessarily add to housing costs.
The City attempts to link its code enforcement and housing preservation efforts, when
appropriate, by making property owners aware of available programs to help with
repairs, particularly for lower-income residents.
The City of Moorparkâs Code Compliance Program (see Chapter V, Program No. 2) was
created in part to safeguard the health and safety of tenants living in rental units in
Moorpark by ensuring that rental properties in the city are sanitary and conform to
current state fire, building and municipal codes. Following receipt of a report on
deficiencies of a rental property, the program requires the rental property be subject to
inspection focusing on life and health safety issues such as working smoke detectors and
working heat and hot water.
j.     Growth Controls
Growth management has long been a concern in Ventura County. In 1999, the City
adopted the âSOARâ (Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources) Initiative. This
Initiative originated from public concern that rapid urban development over the past
decade was threatening agricultural, open space, watershed, sensitive wetlands, and
riparian areas vital to Ventura County. Voters thus passed an initiative amending the
General Plan to direct population growth into incorporated areas where infrastructure is
in place.
Until December 31, 2020, the City is required to restrict urban uses to areas within the
urban restriction boundary (CURB), which is generally coterminous with the Cityâs Sphere
of Influence and corporate limits. The City Council may not approve any general plan
amendment, rezoning, specific plan, subdivision map, special use permit, building permit
                                             IV-11                                January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                      IV. Constraints
or other ministerial or discretionary entitlement inconsistent with the General Plan and
CURB line established by the SOAR Initiative. Generally, the City Council may not amend
the CURB, without voter approval, unless specific procedures and purposes are followed.
If sufficient land resources are not available to address the Cityâs RHNA allocation, the
SOAR Initiative allows the City Council to amend the CURB line to comply with state law
regarding the provision of housing for all economic segments of the community. In order
to invoke this provision, the Council must make the following findings:
       ï·     the land is immediately adjacent to existing compatibly developed areas and
             that adequate services have or will be provided for such development;
       ï·     the proposed development will address the highest priority need identified
             (e.g., the provision of lower income housing to satisfy the RHNA);
       ï·     there is no existing residentially-zoned land available within the CURB and it is
             not reasonably feasible to re-designate land within the CURB for such
             purposes; and
       ï·     no more than 20 acres may be brought within the CURB for this purpose
             annually.
The SOAR Initiative is not expected to prevent the City from meeting its RHNA
requirements for the following reasons: (1) the City has a large reserve of vacant land
within its corporate limits; (2) the City makes wide use of development agreements to
require inclusionary units or in-lieu fees; and (3) the SOAR initiative has specific
amendment procedures to accommodate the lower-income affordability goals of the
RHNA.
       2.   Development Processing Procedures
a.     Residential Permit Processing
The City has designed its development review procedures to streamline the permit
process while ensuring that residential development proceeds in an orderly manner and
contributes to the community. The City utilizes a range of mechanisms to approve
residential projects based on the size, complexity, and potential impact. The approach is
to allow by-right administrative approval for smaller projects with low potential for land
use conflicts, with more complex projects being reviewed by the Planning Commission
and City Council. The process is summarized below.
       ï·     Zoning Clearance - The Zoning Clearance is applied to projects that are
             allowed by-right. The Zoning Clearance is used to ensure that the proposed
             development is consistent with the General Plan land use designation and
             meets all applicable requirements of the Cityâs Zoning Code. The Zoning
             Clearance is a ministerial permit granted by the Director of Community
             Development without a public hearing. Approval is typically granted within 1-3
             days from submittal of a complete application. Examples of projects requiring
             only Zoning Clearance include Second Dwelling units, Large Family day care
             homes serving up to 14 children within a single-family residence; a balcony,
             deck, patio cover; room additions or storage sheds; fences and walls greater
                                                IV-12                              January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                     IV. Constraints
           than 6 feet in height and retaining walls greater than 3 feet in height;
           swimming pools, wading pools and spas; and finally maintenance and minor
           repair to buildings involving structural alterations.
      ï·    Administrative Permit - Some projects may require an Administrative Permit,
           such as detached single-family housing unit developments or affordable or
           senior housing projects of less than five total units. These developments
           typically have a higher level of concern regarding compatibility with adjacent
           uses and therefore require a greater level of zoning review, requiring approval
           of an Administrative Permit. The Administrative Permit is granted by the
           Director of Community Development, without a public hearing. These projects
           typically qualify for a Categorical Exemption under CEQA. Approval is
           typically received within one month from submittal of a complete application.
      ï·    Conditional Use Permit - A Conditional Use Permit is required for uses such as
           mobile home parks and boarding houses. Development projects are required
           to meet site development standards and submit site plans and architecture
           subject to design review. A public hearing is required. For residential
           developments, the decision-making body is the Planning Commission, with
           appeals heard by the City Council. Typical review and approval time is 2.5 to
           9 months, depending on project complexity and the level of CEQA review
           required. Conditions of approval typically include a minimum number of units
           or tenant spaces to be provided and may include special conditions for
           parking arrangements.
      ï·    Planned Development Permit - Planned Development Permits are required for
           new residential developments of five or more units and for projects associated
           with a subdivision of land, zone change, or Development Agreement and
           may include a General Plan Amendment and are reviewed by the Planning
           Commission at a public hearing. The standard of review for PDPs is confirming
           that the project complies with objective development and design standards
           rather than examining the use itself. Staff typically works with the applicant on
           the project design to ensure the site planning and architecture is compatible
           with the surrounding properties and will not negatively affect the safety, health
           and welfare of adjoining property owners. The focus of this process is
           confirming project conformance with development standards. The City also
           offers applicants the option of pre-application meetings to discuss project
           requirements with staff. These meetings help to expedite the permit process by
           identifying key issues early in the process, thereby avoiding multiple rounds of
           review, reducing design costs and increasing development certainty. Typical
           review and approval time is 3-6 months, depending on project complexity
           and the level of CEQA review required. Conditions of approval typically
           ensure compliance with existing development standards in the Municipal
           Code to address: parking standards, landscaping criteria, trash storage and
           disposal services, minimum and maximum standards related to varieties of
           architectural designs of units, setbacks and circulation and access.
           The Planned Development Permit process provides flexibility and reduces
           constraints on development, in that the purpose of this zone is to provide areas
                                              IV-13                               January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                       IV. Constraints
            for communities that will be developed utilizing modern land planning and
            unified design techniques. This provides a flexible regulatory procedure in order
            to encourage: 1) Coordinated neighborhood design and compatibility with
            existing or potential development of surrounding areas; 2) An efficient use of
            land particularly through the clustering of dwelling units and the preservation
            of the natural features of sites; 3) Variety and innovation in site design, density
            and housing unit options, including garden apartments, townhouses and
            single-family dwellings; 4) Lower housing costs through the reduction of street
            and utility networks; and 5) A more varied, attractive and energy-efficient
            living environment as well as greater opportunities for recreation than would
            be possible under other zone classifications. This review process also creates
            incentives for developers to provide affordable housing and other public
            benefits in projects by allowing higher densities and modified development
            standards as part of a development agreement when such commitments are
            provided. The Cityâs successful track record in generating affordable housing
            supports the validity of this approach and demonstrates that this process does
            not unreasonably impact the cost and supply of housing.
b.    Efforts to Minimize Development Review Timeframes
State law requires that communities work toward improving the efficiency of their
planning and building permit processes by providing "one-stop" processing, thereby
eliminating the unnecessary duplication of effort. The Permit Streamlining Act reduces
delay by limiting permit processing time to one year and requiring agencies to specify
the information needed for an acceptable application.
Early consultation with City staff is encouraged to identify issues as soon as possible and
reduce processing time. A "pre-submittal conferenceâ is strongly encouraged so that
applicants can become acquainted with the information and fees required by each
department and agency. Site and architectural plans are also reviewed for consistency
with City standards. This conference allows the applicant to determine the feasibility of
the project and make adjustments during the preliminary planning stages to minimize
costs.
Simultaneous processing of entitlements (e.g., subdivisions and planned developments
permits) is also provided as a means of expediting the review process. These procedures
help to ensure that the development review process meets all legal requirements without
causing an unwarranted constraint to housing development.
Table IV-4 summarizes the typical time frame for reviewing projects from pre-application
development review phase through approval.

The timeframe for reviewing and approving permit applications, zone changes,
variances, conditional use permits, and other discretionary approvals varies on a case-
by-case basis. Developments in Moorpark typically range from a single home, to a large-
scale project of 100 homes, to even larger Specific Plan projects. The time needed to
review projects depends on the location, potential environmental constraints, the need
to ensure adequate provision of infrastructure and public facilities, and the overall
impact of large-scale developments on the community.
For larger development projects subject to the residential planned permit, the City allows
concurrent processing of a variety of actions (e.g., general plan amendment and zone
change) to help expedite the processing of development applications.
The Residential Planned Development (RPD) and Design Review processes are important
components in the development approval process. The RPD and design review process
work in tandem to facilitate and encourage projects that address the housing needs of
the community and also are designed in a manner that preserves and contributes to the
quality of the living environment in Moorpark.
The RPD and design review process begins with a joint application submittal to the
Community Development Department. City staff meets with the developer to discuss the
project and, upon request by the applicant, provides appropriate direction and
examples of projects that meet City design standards.
Once the project schematics are completed, staff reviews the application to make sure
it is complete, and then prepares a written report assessing the overall design and
consistency with the Cityâs development standards. The Planning Commission then
reviews the project to ensure it complies with the following findings:
      ï·     Is consistent with the intent and provisions of the Cityâs general plan and
            appropriate zoning chapter;
      ï·     Is compatible with the character of surrounding development;
      ï·     Would not be obnoxious, harmful, or impair the utility of neighboring property;
      ï·     Would not be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, welfare, and
                                                    IV-15                                         January 2014

       ï·    Is compatible with the scale, visual character and design of surrounding
            properties.
The RPD process has resulted, at times, in lower densities for single-family projects,
particularly for hillside developments subject to environmental constraints. With respect
to multi-family developments, the RPD process has not resulted in lower densities for multi-
family projects containing affordable units. For example, multi-family projects built at or
above maximum allowable densities include the Archstone, Urban West, Essex and Area
Housing Authority Apartments projects.
In the previous planning period, a new RPD-20-U district was established allowing multi-
family development by-right at a minimum density of 20 units/acre. Development
projects within this district are reviewed through a non-discretionary process intended to
confirm that the project is in compliance with objective development standards.
As larger Specific Plan areas and remaining large vacant parcels in the community are
gradually built out, the remaining development in Moorpark will shift to smaller infill
locations. Rather than conduct design review for large open tracts, focus will shift to
neighborhoods, where developments must be compatible with adjacent uses. Therefore,
the City will continue to use the RPD and Design Review processes in the development
approval process to facilitate and encourage projects that address the housing needs of
the community and also are designed in a manner that preserves and contributes to the
quality of the living environment in Moorpark and is compatible in scale with existing
neighborhoods.
c.     Environmental Review
Environmental review is required for all discretionary development projects under the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Most projects in Moorpark are either
Categorically Exempt or require only an Initial Study and Negative Declaration.
Developments that have the potential of creating significant impacts that cannot be
mitigated require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report. Most residential
projects require a Negative Declaration, which takes two to three weeks to complete.
Categorically Exempt developments such as second residential units require a minimal
amount of time. As a result, state-mandated environmental review does not pose a
significant constraint to housing development.
       3.   Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost
of providing the service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and assessments are
charged by the City and other public agencies to cover the costs of processing permit
applications and providing services and facilities such as schools, parks and
infrastructure. Almost all of these fees are assessed through a pro rata share system,
based on the magnitude of the project's impact or on the extent of the benefit that will
be derived.
Moorpark collects fees and exactions from developments to cover the costs of
processing permits and providing the necessary services and infrastructure related to

Moorparkâs development fees are considered typical for jurisdictions in Ventura County.
The City Council has the authority to reduce or waive local fees on a case-by-case basis.
For affordable or senior housing, the City Council at its discretion may provide developers
with incentives such as the waiving of fees and other concessions that may result in cost
reductions. For the development of Villa Campesina, the City reduced development
fees for Cabrillo Economic Development Corporation in order to ensure the projectâs
affordability to lower income households.
After the passage of Proposition 13 and its limitation on local governmentsâ property tax
revenues, cities and counties have faced increasing difficulty in providing public services
and facilities to serve their residents. One of the main consequences of Proposition 13 has
been the shift in funding of new infrastructure from general tax revenues to development

impact fees and improvement requirements on land developers. The City requires
developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements necessary to serve their projects.
Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility extensions, street
construction and traffic control device installation that are reasonably related to the
project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-of-
way, transit facilities, parks and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision Map Act.
City road standards vary by roadway designation as provided in Table IV-6.

          Source: City of Moorpark General Plan - Circulation Element
A typical local residential street requires a 56-foot right-of-way, with two 18 foot travel
lanes, these widths vary based on project location and circulation design needs. The
Cityâs road standards are typical for cities in Ventura County and do not act as a
constraint to housing development.
The Cityâs Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public
improvements including streets, bridges and other facilities needed for the continued
build-out of the city. The CIP helps to ensure that construction of public improvements is
coordinated with private development.
Although development fees and improvement requirements increase the cost of
housing, cities have little choice in establishing such requirements due to the limitations
on property taxes and other revenue sources needed to fund public improvements.
B.    Non-Governmental Constraints
      1.    Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones,
floodplains, sensitive biological habitat, and agricultural lands. In many cases,
development of these areas is constrained by state and federal laws (e.g., FEMA
floodplain regulations, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, and the
California Fish and Game Code and Alquist-Priolo Act). The Cityâs land use plans have
been designed to protect sensitive areas from development, and also to protect public
safety by avoiding development in hazardous areas. While these policies constrain
residential development to some extent, they are necessary to support other public
policies.
                                                                      IV-18                                      January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                     IV. Constraints
      2.   Infrastructure Constraints
Adequate infrastructure, services, and public facilities are important components of new
development. In order for residential development to not adversely impact the Cityâs
service system levels, the City must ensure that various capital improvement plans and
adequate financing mechanisms are in place to provide essential services. The following
discussion details the adequacy of the cityâs infrastructure system.
      ï·     Streets - The City has mechanisms in place to address capital improvement
            projects needed to facilitate new development. To provide needed
            transportation improvements, the City has instituted an area of contribution
            requirement and appropriate fees to pay for circulation and system
            improvements. While this provides the City sufficient funds to construct
            transportation improvements needed to serve new developments, ongoing
            maintenance costs will be added to the Cityâs budget. In addition, due to
            upcoming restrictions on the use of TDA funds for maintenance, it is likely that
            the City would require new developments to have private streets where
            feasible and consistent with the Circulation Element of the General Plan.
            Private streets will add to Home Owner Association costs for new
            developments as the Home Owner Association will be responsible for
            maintenance.
      ï·     Drainage - The major drainage facility in Moorpark is the Arroyo Simi Channel.
            The Army Corp of Engineers and local Ventura County Watershed Protection
            District is acquiring right of way to complete projects to reduce the risk of
            flooding in parts of Moorpark. Until such improvements are completed,
            developers must provide site improvements necessary to protect the property
            from flooding.
      ï·     Wastewater Treatment - Ventura County Waterworks District No. 1
            encompasses 19,500 acres and serves 30,000 customers in Moorpark and
            contiguous unincorporated areas. The District owns, operates and maintains
            the Moorpark Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWTP). In 2000, the MWTP was
            upgraded to increase treatment capacity to 3.0 mgd â 50% higher than the
            average flow in 1999. The plant expansion is intended to accommodate future
            development in Moorpark beyond the current planning period.
      ï·     Water Supply - Ventura County Waterworks District No. 1 provides domestic
            water to Moorpark. The District receives water from five groundwater wells,
            imports the remainder from the Metropolitan Water District and Calleguas
            Municipal Water District, and treats water at the Jenson Plant in Granada Hills.
            The District supplies 11,500 acre-feet of water annually, 75% of which is
            imported. The District foresees sufficient water capacity to meet future housing
            needs in Moorpark throughout the planning period.
      3.   Land Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing.

nature of the residential real estate market. It is expected that economic recovery will
occur and land prices will again rise, although the timing is unknown. Per-unit land cost is
directly affected by density â higher density allows the cost to be spread across more
units, reducing the total price. The Cityâs policies regarding inclusionary housing and
density bonus help to reduce land costs, thereby improving affordability.
       4.   Construction Costs
Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor, development standards
and general market conditions. The City has no influence over materials and labor costs,
and the building codes and development standards in Moorpark are not substantially
different than most other cities in Ventura County and the state of California.
       5.   Cost and Availability of Financing
Moorpark is similar to most other communities with regard to private sector home
financing programs. Moorpark participates in a mortgage credit certificate program that
offers homebuyers a tax credit and assists in qualifying for a home loan. The City is also a
participant in the California Rural Housing Mortgage Finance authority homebuyer fund
that provides low-interest loans to first-time homebuyers. Low-interest loans and grants
are also offered through the -Tax Increment of the Redevelopment Agency of the City of
Moorpark or City housing funds for home improvements to help maintain existing housing
units.
The recent crisis in the mortgage industry has affected the availability of real estate
loans, although for those homebuyers who can qualify, interest rates are at historic lows.
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire
neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical, social or economic
conditions in the area (âredliningâ). In monitoring new construction sales, re-sales of
existing homes, and permits for remodeling, it would not appear that redlining is
occurring in the city.
C. Fair Housing
State law prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property
transactions, and it is the Cityâs policy to uphold the law in this regard. Moorpark
participated in a countywide consortium that prepared an Analysis of Impediments to
Fair Housing Choice in 2010. Such impediments are typically any action, omission, or
decisions that have the effect of restricting housing choice or the availability of housing
on the basis of race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, disability, marital status,
familial status, source of income, sexual orientation, or any other arbitrary factor.
The County contracts with a fair housing agency for these services. Fair housing
programs, referral, and counseling for Moorpark residents are provided by the Housing
Rights Center and funded through the Entitlement Area CDBG program. The Cityâs
support and participation in fair housing activities minimizes the potential for housing
discrimination in Moorpark (see Housing Plan, Program No. 18).
                                                 IV-20                                 January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                    V. Housing Plan
V. HOUSING PLAN
Chapters II through IV describe the housing needs, resources and constraints in
Moorpark. This Housing Plan sets forth the Cityâs goals, policies, programs, and quantified
objectives to address the identified housing needs in Moorpark from 2014 to 2021.
A. Goals and Policies
This section of the Housing Element contains a brief overview of the key issues from the
Needs Assessment as well as the goals and policies that Moorpark intends to implement
to address these housing needs. In addressing the Cityâs housing needs, the Cityâs overall
community goals are as follows:
      ï·    Adequate provision of decent, safe and affordable housing for residents
           without regard to race, age, sex, marital status, ethnicity, disability or other
           arbitrary considerations.
      ï·    Adequate provision of housing opportunities by type, tenure, and location
           with particular attention to the provision of housing for special needs groups.
      ï·    Encourage growth through the identification of suitable parcels for residential
           development, changes in land use patterns, and appropriate recycling of
           land.
      ï·    Develop a balanced community accessible to employment, transportation,
           shopping, medical services, and governmental agencies among others.
Within the aforementioned general framework, the City has developed the following
goals and policies to encourage the preservation, production, maintenance, and
improvement of housing within the Moorpark community.
      1.   Housing and Neighborhood Conservation
Housing and neighborhood conservation are important to maintaining and improving
quality of life. While the majority of housing in Moorpark is relatively new, some of the
older residential neighborhoods in the downtown show signs of deterioration. Efforts to
improve and revitalize housing must not only address existing conditions, but also focus
on preventive repairs to maintain the quality of the housing stock. The policies listed
below address the issue of housing and neighborhood conservation.
GOAL 1.0:      Assure the quality, safety, and habitability of existing housing and the
               continued high quality of residential neighborhoods.
Policy 1.1     Continue to monitor and enforce building and property maintenance
               code standards in residential neighborhoods.
Policy 1.2     Continue to provide City public safety services, infrastructure maintenance,
               graffiti removal, and other public services to maintain the quality of the
               housing stock, neighborhoods, and the environment.
                                              V-1                                 January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                     V. Housing Plan
Policy 1.3    Promote increased awareness among property owners and residents of the
              importance of property maintenance to long-term housing quality.
Policy 1.4    Continue to promote the repair, revitalization, and rehabilitation of
              residential structures which have fallen into disrepair.
Policy 1.5    Support the preservation and maintenance of                    historically   and
              architecturally significant buildings and neighborhoods.
      2.   Adequate Residential Sites
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment addresses the need for decent, adequate, and
affordable housing to accommodate existing and future housing needs induced from
regional growth. In order to further these goals, Moorpark is committed to assisting in the
development of adequate housing that is affordable to all economic segments of the
population through the following goals and policies:
GOAL 2:       Provide residential sites through land use, zoning and specific plan
              designations to provide a range of housing opportunities.
Policy 2.1    Identify adequate sites which will be made available and zoned at the
              appropriate densities, to facilitate goals set forth in the 2014-2021 RHNA.
Policy 2.2    Ensure residential sites have appropriate public services, facilities,
              circulation, and other needed infrastructure to support development.
Policy 2.3    Investigate rezoning or redesignation of commercial lots that are no longer
              economically viable uses to appropriate residential uses.
Policy 2.4    Promote and encourage mixed-use residential and commercial uses where
              appropriate as a means to facilitate development.
      3.   Housing Assistance and Special Needs
Moorpark is home to a number of groups with special housing needs, including seniors,
large families, disabled persons, and single parent families, among others. These groups
may face greater difficulty in finding decent and affordable housing due to special
circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to oneâs income, family
characteristics, disability, or health issues.
GOAL 3:       Expand and protect housing opportunities for lower income households
              and special needs groups.
Policy 3.1    Use public financial resources, to the extent feasible, to support the
              provision and production of housing for lower-income households and
              persons and families with special needs.
Policy 3.2    Provide rental assistance to address existing housing problems and provide
              homeownership assistance to expand housing opportunities.
                                               V-2                                  January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                      V. Housing Plan
Policy 3.3    Support the conservation of Mobile Home parks, historic neighborhoods,
              publicly-subsidized housing, and other sources of affordable housing.
Policy 3.4    Require, in aggregate, 10% of new units to be affordable to lower-income
              households. Establish priority for usage of in-lieu fee as follows: 1st priority â
              production of affordable housing; 2nd â subsidy of affordable housing; 3rd â
              housing rehabilitation; 4th priority â housing assistance; and 5th staffing costs.
      4.   Removal of Government Constraints
Market factors and government regulations can significantly impact the production and
affordability of housing. Although market conditions are often beyond the direct
influence of any jurisdiction, efforts can be directed at ensuring the reasonableness of
land use controls, development standards, permit-processing, fees and exactions, and
governmental requirements to encourage housing production.
GOAL 4:       Where appropriate, mitigate unnecessary governmental constraints to the
              maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
Policy 4.1    Periodically review City regulations, ordinances, fees/exactions to ensure
              they do not unduly constrain the production, maintenance, and improve-
              ment of housing.
Policy 4.2    Offer regulatory incentives and concessions for affordable housing, such as
              relief from development standards, density bonuses, or fee waivers where
              deemed to be appropriate.
Policy 4.3    Provide for streamlined, timely, coordinated, and concurrent processing of
              residential projects to minimize holding costs and encourage housing
              production.
Policy 4.4    Support infill development at suitable locations and provide, where
              appropriate, incentives to facilitate their development.
      5.   Fair and Equal Housing Opportunity
Ensuring fair and equal housing opportunity is an important goal. Whether through
mediating disputes, investigating bona fide complaints of discrimination, or through the
provision of education services, the provision of fair housing services is an important tool
to ensure fair and equal access to housing. The following policies are designed to
continue implementation of applicable fair housing laws.
GOAL 5:       Ensure fair and equal housing opportunity for all persons regardless of race,
              religion, sex, marital status, family type, ancestry, national origin, color or
              other protected status.
Policy 5.1    Provide fair housing services to residents and assure that residents are
              aware of their rights and responsibilities with respect to fair housing.
Policy 5.2    Discourage discrimination in either the sale or rental of housing on the basis
              of state or federal protected classes.

B.       Housing Programs
The goals and policies discussed above are implemented through housing programs
offered by the City's Community Development Department and Redevelopment
Agency.
This section describes the programs that Moorpark will implement to address housing
needs within the community. Table V-1 provides a summary of each program, objective,
funding source, and agency having responsibility to implement the program.

 residential use, and the up-zoning of low-density residential sites for higher-density
 development. Zoning amendments have resulted in development of the Archstone
 project, Shea Homes Tract 5425, and the CEDC Monte Vista project. Other projects
 where zoning has been modified to allow for affordable housing opportunities that
 have not yet been built include the Pacific Communities project, the Essex apartment
 project, William Lyon Home 17-unit affordable project, Area Housing Authority
 Apartment project, and the Pardee School Site project. Other projects are under
 consideration.
 The new RPD-20 zoning district was established in the previous planning period to
 allow owner-occupied and multi-family rental residential development by-right at a
 density of 20 units/acre.
 For projects that require subdivision or lot consolidation prior to development, the City
 will facilitate this process through expedited or concurrent processing of the required
 approvals. Since most affordable housing developments occur on sites of 2 to 10
 acres, the City will prioritize rezoning and subdivision of sites that can accommodate
 developments of this size. In order to enhance the likelihood of affordable housing
 development in these projects, the City will take the following actions:
                                                                     V-4                                             January 2014

      ï·     Contact affordable housing builders regarding development opportunities in
            these projects, and convene meetings between the master developer and
            interested builders, if requested.
      ï·     Offer incentives and concessions for affordable housing projects such as
            expedited processing, reduced development standards, administrative
            assistance with funding applications such as Low-Income Housing Tax
            Credits, and fee waivers or reductions if feasible.
4.      Downtown Specific Plan                                                           8-Year Objective:

area. The Downtown Specific Plan area is characterized by smaller lots, underutilized
lots, older single-family homes, and a downtown commercial core. Because the
majority of lots are irregularly shaped, the Zoning Code restricts density for lots of
7,000 square feet to 7 units per acre.
According to the Specific Plan, the Downtown offers significant opportunities for public
or private involvement in facilitating mixed use, infill, and affordable housing. The
Zoning Code offers incentives to facilitate the Downtown Specific Plan. If parcels are
combined or merged, and the Cityâs density bonus provisions are utilized, the
maximum density can be increased to 28 units/acre.
5.      Farm Worker Housing                                                              8-Year Objective:

             Evaluation of the 2008-2013 Housing Element
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the
effectiveness of the existing Housing Element, the appropriateness of goals, objectives
and policies, and the progress in implementing programs for the previous planning
period. This appendix contains a review the housing goals, policies, and programs of the
previous Housing Element and evaluates the degree to which these programs have
been implemented during the previous planning period, 2008 through 2013. This analysis
also includes an assessment of the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies. The
findings from this evaluation have been instrumental in determining the Cityâs 2014-2021
Housing Implementation Program.
Table A-1 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Housing Element along
with the source of funding, program objectives, accomplishments, and implications for
future policies and actions.
Table A-2 evaluates the appropriateness of previous goals and policies, and identifies
any changes that are called for in response to the Cityâs experience during the past
planning period.
Table A-3 presents the Cityâs progress in meeting the quantified objectives from the
previous Housing Element.

                               Residential Land Inventory
1.       Assumptions and Methodology
The assumptions and methodology for the residential land inventory are provided below
and summarized in Tables B-1 through B-3. Affordability assumptions are based on deed
restrictions or market conditions (for approved projects) as described in Chapter II
(Needs Assessment). Market conditions indicate that attached housing units are likely to
be affordable to moderate-income households in Moorpark. Sites without project
entitlements as assigned to the lower-income category if the allowable density is 20
units/acre or more, pursuant to state law13.
2.       Approved Projects
Projects that are approved but not yet completed, are shown in Table B-1. These projects
include 51 very-low-income units, 61 low-income units, 196 moderate units, and 776
above-moderate units. Income categories are based on specific project requirements or
market conditions, as described in Section 1 above. Given the uncertainty in the current
economic climate, it should be recognized that the anticipated development schedule
noted for each project is based on City experience with typical development projects. If
the recovery in the real estate market proceeds more slowly than expected, the
development timeline for some projects may be delayed.
Pending Projects
Pending projects are those with filed applications but no approval has been granted.
The status and anticipated characteristics of these projects are described below. The
potential units for these projects are summarized in Table B-2. The estimated number of
lower-income units is based on the default density of 20 units/acre.
       ï·      The âSpecific Plan-1 Hitch Ranchâ project consists of 283 acres of vacant land
              located north of the Union Pacific Railroad, west of Walnut Canyon Road
              (Highway 23), and east of Gabbert Road. An application has been filed for a
              Zone Change, General Plan Amendment, development agreement,
              residential planned development permit and a tract map to allow
              construction of 755 dwelling units, 3 acres of institutional use, and open space.
              The project is currently undergoing review, an EIR scoping meeting has been
              held and environmental review is underway. Final entitlement review is
              expected to occur in 2014, which would allow subdivision maps and building
              permits to be issued during the current planning period. The site slopes
              downward from north to south and has available utility connections and
              services. There are no additional city requirements that would affect the rate
              of construction or limit the number of housing units that can be constructed at
              any one time, following approval of entitlements. The estimate of 468 lower-
13 Government Code Sec. 65583.2(c)(3)(B) provides that a density of 20 units/acre is deemed to be appropriate for
    lower-income housing in Moorpark.
                                                      B-1                                          January 2014

           income units for this project is based on the rezoning of a 23.44-acre portion of
           the site that was designated for multi-family development at 20 units/acre in
           2013 (see Figure B-1). No specific development project has been submitted to
           the City for this high-density planning area. The developer has indicated that
           the entire planning area may be sold to a multi-family builder.
      ï·    The âRPD 2005-02 (Chiu)â project consists of a 2+ acre site on the north side of
           Everett Street, east of Walnut Canyon Road (Highway 23). An application has
           been filed for a Zone Change, General Plan Amendment, development
           agreement, residential planned development permit and a condominium
           tract map to allow construction of a 60-unit condominium building with 125
           parking spaces. The city is currently negotiating the development agreement
           with the applicant and preparation of a Negative Declaration is underway
           with the public hearings anticipated for a 60-unit condominium project. The
           site slopes downward from north to south and has available utility connections
           and services. Final entitlement review is expected to occur in 2014, which
           would allow building permits to be issued during the current planning period.
           There are no additional city requirements that would affect the rate of
           construction or limit the number of housing units that can be constructed at
           any one time, following approval of entitlements. Although no entitlements
           have yet been approved for this property, the affordability levels shown in
           Table B-2 assume that only 20% of the units will be restricted to lower-income
           households because the developer has expressed the intention of building the
           entire project as condominiums.
      ï·    The âRPD 2007-01 Casey Road - Mansiâ project consists of 48.2 acres of vacant
           land on the north side of Casey Road, west of Walnut Canyon Road, (Highway
           23). An application has been filed for a Zone Change, General Plan
           Amendment, development agreement, residential planned development
           permit and a tract map to allow construction of 390 senior housing units. The
           site is moderately sloping on the west and east with a shallow valley in the
           middle of the site. The application is currently incomplete and CEQA analysis
           has not yet begun. The property has available utility connections and services.
           Final entitlement review is expected to occur in 2014, which would allow
           building permits to be issued during the current planning period. There are no
           additional city requirements that would affect the rate of construction or limit
           the number of housing units that can be constructed at any one time,
           following approval of entitlements.
      ï·    The âPacific Communitiesâ project consists of 37.09 acres on the South Side of
           Los Angeles Avenue between Leta Yancy Road and Maureen Lane (see
           Figure B-2). An application has been filed for a Zone Change, General Plan
           Amendment, development agreement, residential planned development
           permit and a tract map to allow construction of 157 single-family detached
           dwellings and 300 attached units with integrated recreation areas for the
           community. The application is currently incomplete and CEQA analysis has not
           yet begun. The property is relatively flat and is bound on the southern
           perimeter by the Arroyo Simi. Remainder lot areas within the Arroyo Simi would
           be dedicated to the Ventura County Flood Protection District. The property
                                              B-2                                  January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element            Appendix B â Residential Land Inventory
           has available utility connections and services. Final entitlement review is
           expected to occur in 2014-15, which would allow building permits to be issued
           during the current planning period. There are no additional city requirements
           that would affect the rate of construction or limit the number of housing units
           that can be constructed at any one time, following approval of entitlements.
           A total of 300 lower-income units are assumed for this project based on a 15-
           acre planning area that is proposed at a density of 20 units/acre. Only
           conceptual development plans have been submitted to the City for this high-
           density planning area, and the anticipated entitlement would allow
           reconfiguration of the site plan to accommodate different product types. The
           developer has indicated that the planning area may be sold to a multi-family
           builder. As noted in Program 3, the City will take proactive steps to encourage
           and facilitate affordable housing development in this multi-family planning
           area.

3.      Vacant Land
The Cityâs inventory of vacant land suitable for residential development is described
below and summarized in Table B-3.
      ï·    The âWaste Managementâ property consists of 256 acres of vacant land,
           comprised of varied topography consisting of a valley ringed by moderately
           sloped foothills. This property is constrained by limited vehicular access,
           valuable natural habitat and wildlife corridors and floodways. No entitlement
           applications have been submitted for this property. The realistic capacity for
           this site (under current general plan) has been estimated at 6 units based on
           the 1 unit/40 acres land use designation. The realistic potential for multi-family
           development is not known at this time, since this area has not been the focus
           of any development studies. There are no known environmental constraints
           that would preclude development during this planning period.
      ï·    The âRasmussenâ property consists of 68 acres of vacant land. The topography
           consists of mild to moderately sloping land adjacent to a rural large-lot
           equestrian oriented neighborhood. The realistic capacity for this site (under
           current Agricultural Exclusive zoning) has been estimated to be 1 unit based
           on density allowed in the AE zone. A General Plan amendment pre-screening
           application to increase density has been submitted and is under review. There
           is estimated to be potential capacity of up to 150 housing units on this
           property, which will be studied as part of the application review process. There
           are no known environmental constraints that would preclude development
           during this planning period.
      ï·    The âAB Properties-North Villageâ property consists of 82.8 acres of vacant
           land. The realistic capacity for this site (under current zoning) has been
           estimated to be 16 units based on Rural Exclusive-5Acre zoning allowing 1 DU /
           5 acres. A General Plan amendment pre-screening application has been
           approved to allow the processing of a request to increase density to allow up
           to 50 large-lot single-family homes on this property. Affordable housing would
           be provided off-site as determined through a development agreement, which
           is required for this project. There are no known environmental constraints that
           would preclude development during this planning period.
      ï·    The âLa Perchâ property is a 25.73-acre site which has one single-family
           residence, one second unit and an equestrian boarding facility. The property
           is sloped and the useable areas are mostly comprised of a moderate slope
           leading up to a hilltop, with steeper unusable slopes dropping off to the west
           and north toward Walnut Canyon Road (Highway 23), and east to Spring
           Road. This property is adjacent to the Moorpark Highlands master planned
           residential community and is accessible from existing roadways, and has
           available utility connections and services. The realistic capacity for this site
           (under current zoning) has been estimated to be 2 units based on the Rural
           Agricultural-10Acre zoning, allowing 1 DU / 10 acres. No entitlement
           applications have been submitted for this property. The potential for higher-
           density development is currently unknown for this site, as no applications have
           been submitted. However, portions of the site are adjacent the Moorpark
                                               B-6                                 January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element               Appendix B â Residential Land Inventory
           Highlands master planned community which consists of a variety of densities,
           some of which are detached single-family homes and one neighborhood
           contains an attached tri-plex. The site appears to be developable at a similar
           density to that of adjacent single-family detached neighborhoods, with the
           steeper portions of the site remaining as natural sloped areas. There are no
           known environmental constraints that would preclude development during
           this planning period.
      ï·    The âOld Fire Station Propertiesâ (four contiguous parcels that can be
           consolidated) total approximately 1.36 acres, are owned by the City of
           Moorpark, with the intention of consolidation and resale to developers for
           construction of affordable housing. These properties are mostly undeveloped
           land except for an old unused fire station office and garage, and a vacant
           commercial office building. These properties are gently sloping from west to
           east with a drop in elevation of approximately five feet. These properties have
           access from Walnut Canyon Road (Highway 23), Charles Street, Walnut Street
           and Everett Street with available utility connections and services. The current
           capacity for this site is only 2 units based on current zoning of R-1, Commercial
           Office and Institutional. However, the anticipated capacity for the project is
           estimated at 20-25 units based on a density of 20 to 25 units/acre. There are no
           known environmental constraints that would preclude development during
           this planning period. The site has excellent potential for affordable housing
           development during the planning period and the City completed a zoning
           amendment for the site to RPD-20-U in 2013.
      ï·    The âWalnut Canyon Road Propertiesâ total 2.37 acres, are owned by the City
           of Moorpark and are being acquired for potential consolidation and
           construction of affordable housing units. Several of the parcels are contiguous,
           and it is anticipated that lots will be consolidated for the clustering of new
           developments. These properties are accessed from Walnut Canyon Road
           (Highway 23), with available utility connections and services. The properties
           are gently sloping towards the west and some lots have large slopes at the
           western perimeters of the properties. All of these lots have drainage
           easements along the western perimeter and some have an open drainage
           channel in these areas. The realistic capacity for this site (under current zoning)
           has been estimated at 18 units based on the Rural Exclusive zoning of 4
           DU/Acre with a 100% density bonus for affordable housing. This could result in
           approximately 18 affordable housing units being constructed on this site. There
           are no known environmental constraints that would preclude development
           during this planning period. The City is currently in negotiations with a
           developer on an agreement for an affordable housing project.
      ï·    The âCharles Streetâ properties are 3 properties totaling 0.53 acre owned by
           the City. Two of the properties are contiguous and the other property is
           separated by a non-agency owned parcel. These properties are being
           consolidated for resale to a developer. Two of the properties are relatively flat
           with the topography having a gradual slope down to High Street. The third
           property is at a similar grade elevation as High street and is generally flat. All
           properties are currently unimproved with available utility connections and
                                                B-7                                  January 2014

City of Moorpark 2014-2021 Housing Element                                 Appendix B â Residential Land Inventory
           services. The realistic capacity for this site (under current zoning) has been
           estimated to be a total of 6 units based on Residential Planned Development
           7-14 DU/Acre zoning. The anticipated density for the project is 20 units/acre. At
           100% affordable, this would result in a potential for construction of 10
           affordable housing units. There are no known environmental constraints that
           would preclude development of this property during the current planning
           period. The City is currently exploring options for affordable housing
           development and it is feasible that rezoning could occur during the current
           planning period.
4.      Second Units
The Zoning Code allows second units in single-family residential districts, pursuant to state
law. A total of nine second unit permits have been issued from 2005 to 2013, or an
average of about one unit per year. It is anticipated that second unit development will
continue at a similar pace during the 2014-2021 planning period, which would result in 8
additional units. Based on affordability categories (see Chapter II) these units are
expected to rent in the Very-Low and Low-income ranges.
5.      Land Inventory Summary
The following chart summarizes the Cityâs residential development potential compared
to the RHNA allocation for the 2014-2021 planning period. This table demonstrates that
the City has sufficient capacity to accommodate the RHNA in all income categories for
the planning period.

                             Public Participation Summary
This summary of Housing Element public participation efforts describes opportunities for
public involvement along with an explanation of how public comments were
incorporated into the Housing Element. In addition, prior to the adoption hearings all
interested parties were given the opportunity to review proposed revisions.
Public participation is an important component of the planning process, and this update
to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties numerous
opportunities for review and comment. Public notices of all Housing Element meetings
and public hearings were published in the local newspaper in advance of each
meeting, as well as posting the notices on the Cityâs website. The draft Housing Element
was made available for review at City Hall, posted on the Cityâs website, as well as at the
Public Library. The document was also made available to housing advocates and non-
profit organizations representing the interests of lower-income persons and those with
special housing needs. The following organizations with an interest in housing for lower-
income households were included in the notices of all public meetings for this Housing
