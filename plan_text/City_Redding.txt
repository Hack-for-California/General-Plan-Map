                                                3.   If, after applying BAMM, use still exceeds Level "B" threshold, then a minimum of 25 percent of unmitigated emissions exceeding 137 pounds per day must be offset by reducing emissions from existing sources of pollution;

AUTHORITY
California Government Code Section 65302(a) states
that a city's general plan shall include:
   "... a Land Use Element which designates the
   proposed general distribution, location, and extent
   of the uses of the land for housing; business;
   industry; open space, including agriculture, natural
   resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic
   beauty; education; public buildings and grounds;
   solid and liquid waste-disposal facilities; and other
   categories of public and private uses of land."
The Land Use Element is also required to include a
statement of the standards of population density and
building intensity recommended for the various
districts and other territory covered by the Plan.
Section 65303 of the California Government Code
states that a general plan may include any other
optional elements as long as they relate to the physical
development of the City. Due to the interrelationship
between land use and community design, the City of
Redding has chosen to develop a Community
Development and Design Element, which includes all
the necessary provisions of the Land Use Element as
required by the Government Code.
In addition to meeting the mandatory requirements of
a land use element, the Community Development and
Design Element provides guidance in terms of the
community's expectations and desires relative to
development design and aesthetics.

Households with extremely low income have a
variety of housing situations and needs. For
example, most families and individuals receiving
public assistance, such as social security insurance
(SSI) or disability insurance, are considered
extremely low income households. At the same
time, a minimum wage worker could be considered
an extremely low income household with an annual
income of approximately $16,000 or less. The
following are examples of occupations with wages
that could qualify as extremely low income
households depending on the number of hours
worked during the year. The nature of these jobs is
often part-time and/or seasonal.

Accomplishments. Redding Electric Utility (REU) has
provided over $11 million in rebates toward energy
efficiency and renewable measures since 2009. These
rebates included such things as HVAC retrofits, duct
repairs and replacement, weather stripping, insulation
and window treatments as well as Energy Star
appliances.
Proposed Changes.             Continue to explore new
technologies and develop new programs that will
further reduce REU customers’ energy consumption.
8.2 Activity. Low Income Residences Retrofit
      Program
Objective. To obtain program funding to establish a
pilot program focusing on community outreach,
conducting energy audits and retrofits, and provide
training opportunities to achieve a larger inventory of
energy efficient homes in the City.
Accomplishments.           A public/private partnership
between the City of Redding and the Shasta Builders'
Exchange was established in 2011. It resulted in the
training of 30 local contractors giving them the skills
necessary to perform deep energy retrofits on 25 low
income homes and partial deep energy retrofits on 15
homes. As a result of these projects, REU developed
a Utility funded Home Performance Program that has
been widely recognized by other publicly owned and
investor owned utilities throughout the state as a
model for their own deep energy retrofit programs.
 REU’s Home Performance Program was also featured
in the January 2012 issue of the ASHREA Journal, a
national mechanical industry/engineering publication.
Proposed Changes. REU is working to expand the
program to include multi-family housing, as well as a
low-or-no-cost low-income home weatherization
program.

                                                           A community noise survey was conducted to document

                                                           Generally, noise is generated from two types of

           In the case of hotel/motel facilities or other transient lodging, outdoor activity areas, such as pool areas, may not be
           included in the project design. In these cases, only the interior noise-level criterion will apply.

   Each of the noise levels specified above shall be lowered by five dB for simple tone noises, noises consisting
   primarily of speech or music, or for recurring impulsive noises (e.g., humming sounds, outdoor speaker systems).
   These noise-level standards do not apply for residential units established in conjunction with industrial or
   commercial uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings). The City can impose noise-level standards which are more restrictive
   than those specified above based upon determination of existing low ambient noise levels.
   Industrial, light industrial, commercial, and public-service facilities which have the potential for producing
   objectionable noise levels at nearby noise-sensitive uses are dispersed throughout the City. Fixed noise sources
   which are typically of concern include, but are not limited to, the following:
             HVAC Systems                             Cooling Towers/Evaporative Condensers
             Pump Stations                            Lift Stations
             Emergency Generators                     Boilers

             Outdoor Speakers                         Blowers
   The types of uses which may typically produce the noise sources described above include, but are not limited to:
   industrial facilities, including lumber mills, trucking operations, tire shops, auto maintenance shops, metal
   fabricating shops, shopping centers, drive-up windows, car washes, loading docks, public works projects, batch
   plants, bottling and canning plants, recycling centers, electric generating stations, race tracks, landfills, sand and
   gravel operations, and athletic fields.

   "Average wait" is a measure of traffic conditions at intersections. It is an estimate of the average delay for all vehicles entering the
   intersection in a defined period of time, for example, the evening peak hour. It is expressed as a range rather than a single value. Some
   drivers will actually wait more or less time than indicated by the range.

   "Average speed" is a measure of traffic conditions on arterials. "Average speed" is based on the total time it takes to travel a certain distance,
   including the time spent waiting at intersections. It is determined more by traffic volume and conditions at intersections than by the legal
   speed limit.
Quantitative measures of LOS are useful aids to

                                      TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
The following streets will provide the basic framework for the City's expressway, arterial, and collector street systems. Unless
otherwise indicated in Appendix "A," the ultimate right-of-way for arterial streets should accommodate a minimum of four lanes
as well as necessary turn pockets, center medians, and detached sidewalks. Variations in ultimate right-of-way width are expected
due to circumstances such as proximity to existing development, slopes, bridge approaches, and other site-specific factors.
Collector streets vary greatly in their design depending on their intended function. Some provide circulation between arterial
streets in commercial areas, while others provide direct residential access. The list of collector streets below is not intended to
be all-inclusive, and includes examples of the various types of streets within the collector street system.
