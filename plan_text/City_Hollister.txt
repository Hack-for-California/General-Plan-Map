Circulation Element
The primary purpose of the Circulation Element is to facilitate the
orderly, efficient, and context sensitive expansion and development of
Hollister's circulation systems in support of the Land Use Element.
The Circulation Element addresses a comprehensive set of public con-
cerns that include the location and design of streets and roadways,
vehicular circulation, parking, pedestrian accessibility and enjoyment,
bicycle access, local and regional transit systems, and the transport of
public and private goods.
The following sections will:
  Describe the existing transportation system,
  Report some useful information concerning how the system is
   used,
  Quantitatively evaluate the quality of service provided by the road-
   way system,
  Describe the previously planned roadway system improvements
   shown in the Circulation Element,
  Report the projected increase in traffic attributable to the expected
   future population and employment growth,
  Quantitatively evaluate the projected quality of service,
  Identify projected roadway capacity deficiencies, and
  Recommend improvements that will mitigate the projected level of
   service deficiencies back to insignificant levels.

                                       The City of Hollister and San Benito County together maintain
                                       approximately 900 centerline miles of major streets and highways, 11.7
                                       miles of heavy rail track, two airports, and a few bicycle facilities within
                                       the City of Hollister. Many more miles of local residential streets are
                                       also maintained. The transportation system also includes transit and
                                       paratransit systems, taxi service, over the road trucking services, and
                                       transportation demand management programs such as a ridesharing
                                       program. The primary road networks in Hollister are described in the
                                       following sections.
                                       Regional Context
                                       The Council of San Benito County Governments (SBCOG) was estab-
                                       lished in 1974. SBCOG's jurisdiction follows the boundaries of San
                                       Benito County and consists of five members - two representatives each
                                       from the San Benito County Board of Supervisors and the Hollister
                                       City Council, and one representative from the San Juan Bautista City
                                       Council. The actions of SBCOG are governed by Transportation
                                       Development Act (TDA) regulations, the California Administrative
                                       Code, and Memorandums of Understanding with Caltrans govern the
                                       actions of SBCOG.
                                       While SBCOG plays a major role in developing local transportation
                                       policy and transportation planning programs, project implementation is
                                       the responsibility for the local jurisdictions, Caltrans, County Express
                                       and the private sector.
                                       In July 2000, SBCOG adopted a Regional Transportation Plan that
                                       contained approximately $230 million in constrained transportation
                                       improvement projects. The plan evaluated three alternative growth
                                       scenarios: Alternative 1 - Grow the Existing Hollister Urban Area;
                                       Alternative 2 - Push Future Growth to the North County Area; and
                                       Alternative 3 - Consolidate Future Growth Around Commuter Rail
                                       Stations. SBCOG selected Alternative 1 as its preferred alternative.

The plan also set forth transportation goals and policies for the region,
which established the framework for locally-adopted circulation plans.
Existing Roadway Network
The majority of the roadways within the City of Hollister are two-lane
roadways, with a few three-lane and four-lane segments. Map 8 shows
a schematic diagram of the main streets in the Hollister area and is
color-coded to indicate the number of travel lanes.
These roadways are classified into different functional classifications:
1) highways,
2) major thoroughfares,
3) major collectors,
4) collectors, and
5) residential.
Map 9 illustrates the functional classification of the Hollister area road-
ways and Map 10 shows existing peak-hour traffic volumes on Hollis-
ter's major streets..
The California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) maintains
five state highways in San Benito County (Routes 25, 101, 129, 146,
and 156). Two of these routes, Routes 25 and 156, pass through the
City of Hollister. These are described below.
State Route (SR) 25 transverses the entire length of San Benito County
from the southern county boundary at the junction of SR 198 near
King City north through Paicines, Tres Pinos, and Hollister. It con-
nects to US 101 just past the northern county boundary near Gilroy. In
Hollister, SR 25 occupies Airline Highway, Tres Pinos Road, Nash
Road, and San Benito Street. Caltrans classifies this route as a minor
arterial, and the route is primarily a rural two-lane facility, except for a
                                                                             SR 25 shown at Third Street in downtown

SR 25 is a primary commuter route between Hollister and Gilroy.
Commuter traffic on this rural two-lane highway has increased steadily
over the last 15 years. During peak commute periods, SR 25 experi-
ences high levels of traffic congestion, and the operating conditions
have substantially deteriorated. The number of accidents along the cor-
ridor is currently the highest in the County. In addition, traffic opera-
tions have deteriorated on SR 25 south of Sunnyslope Road, due in
                                                                           SR 25 shown at Hillcrest Road.
large part to increased traffic volumes from new residential develop-
ment in south Hollister.
State Route (SR) 156 transverses Northern San Benito County from
US 101 west of San Juan Bautista through San Juan Bautista and Hol-
lister to the San Benito-Santa Clara County line where it connects with
SR 152. In Hollister, the SR 156 bypass skirts north of the city limits,
while Business Route 156 passes through Downtown Hollister.
The corridor serves interregional traffic, including substantial amounts
of truck traffic during the week and recreational traffic between the
Central Valley and the Monterey Bay area on the weekends. CalTrans
classifies SR 156 as a rural minor arterial and includes it as part of the
Interregional Route System. It is also designated as a Federal Aid Pri-
mary Route and is part of the Freeway and Expressway System,
although a large portion of the route is conventional highway.
SR 156 is a four-lane expressway from US 101 to San Juan Bautista,
where it narrows into a conventional two-lane rural highway. In the
Hollister area, SR 156 becomes a two-lane expressway as it bypasses
Hollister and maintains that configuration to the San Benito-Santa
Clara County line. Business Route 156 is a two lane rural highway from
the SR 156 (bypass) to San Felipe Road, where it becomes a four-lane
expressway to SR 156 (end of bypass). SR 156 is a major corridor for
commuters traveling to Monterey and Santa Clara Counties. The seg-
ment of SR 156 between San Juan Bautista and Hollister is a two-lane
highway with high commuter volumes, as well as substantial truck and
farm equipment traffic.

Express transit system. The Council of San Benito County Govern-
ments (SBCOG) currently monitors the transit system.
County Express Transit System operates three fixed-route bus lines in
Hollister on weekdays between 7 AM to 6 PM. In 2003, fares for fixed-
route service were $0.75 for general public and $0.50 for youth (5-17),   The County Express Transit Bus serves

and San Benito Streets, which is also the transfer point for inter-county
service. The routes of the three lines are as follows:
  Green Line: An eastbound loop serving an approximately 2-mile
   radius around the core of Hollister
  Blue Line: A westbound loop in the same corridor as the Green
   Line

                                        Commuter Rail Service
                                        The nearest connection to commuter rail service is located in Gilroy,
                                        with service to Santa Clara County and points north. SBCOG is evalu-

                                        analysis of commuter rail for San Benito County. This study, by R.L.

                                        Aviation Services
                                        The City of Hollister has one public airport, Hollister Municipal Air-
                                        port. Hazel Hawkins Hospital also maintains a heliport at its Hollister
                                        facility.
                                        The Hollister Municipal Airport is located approximately two miles
                                        north of downtown Hollister, adjacent to SR 156. It is owned and
                                        operated by the City of Hollister. The facility is a general aviation air-

port and is included in the National Airport Systems Plan. In its opera-
tional role, it is classed as General Utility and accommodates all current
aviation aircraft except certain business jets. There are 195 aircraft cur-
rently based at the airport with annual operations such as landings and
take-offs estimated at 57,300.
The five-member Hollister Airport Commission oversees the operation
of the facility, and a part-time airport manager manages day-to-day
activities. In 1986, the Hollister City Council adopted the Airport Mas-
ter Plan, which projected use and needed improvements through 2005.
The Airport Master Plan is currently being updated.
Commodity Movement Facilities
Commodities in San Benito County are transported in and out of San
Benito County by truck and rail, with the large majority of goods being
moved by truck. San Benito County experiences a higher than average
amount of truck traffic, and this activity, while largely confined to state
highways, impacts local streets and rural roads not designed to handle
large, heavy trucks. The sole rail line in San Benito County is the 12-
mile-long Hollister Branch Line running from Hollister to Carnadero
in Santa Clara County. The facility is owned by the Union Pacific Rail-
road.
Pedestrian Facilities
An important first step in promoting pedestrian activity (and therefore
healthy cities and neighborhoods) is to recognize that city streets are
not just for cars. In fact, while city streets must accommodate automo-
bile traffic, an equal or greater focus should be placed on accommodat-
ing the pedestrian (and bicyclist). Hollister is filled with beautiful
tree-lined streets, wide sidewalks, and neighborhoods built on a pedes-
                                                                            Tree-lined sidewalks are common in
trian scale. In many cases, these streets are well preserved and function   Hollister.
as they were originally designed to function. In downtown Hollister,
for example, San Benito Street has wide sidewalks that support the
commercial uses in the downtown area.

                                       Bicycle Facilities
                                       There are currently limited bicycle facilities in Hollister. Most bicycling
                                       is done on roadway shoulders, which are not striped for bike lanes. In
                                       many cases, bicycles can be accommodated on well-designed streets
                                       without the need for separate bike lanes. However, as many of the
                                       major city streets in Hollister become impacted by heavy traffic,
                                       increased emphasis must be placed on accommodating bicycle travel
                                       when designing streets. This can be accomplished by adding Class II
                                       bicycle lanes on existing streets and by providing alternative routes
                                       dedicated to bicycle and pedestrian use (Class I facilities).
                                       At present, there are two Class I bicycle facilities in the Hollister Area.
                                       One of these is adjacent to Prospect Avenue/Airline Highway,
                                       between Hawkins Street and Sunset Drive; the other is adjacent to
                                       State Route 25, from Tres Pinos School to Southside Road.
                                       In 2001, the SBCOG adopted a revised County Bikeway Plan, which
                                       designates routes that can be used by commuters, recreational riders,
                                       students, and others for safe, convenient access to major employers,
                                       shopping centers, and schools throughout Hollister.

INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
ANALYSIS
Traffic conditions at the intersections under study were evaluated using
level of service (LOS). Level of Service is a qualitative description of
operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions
with little or no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive
delays.
Intersection levels of service were analyzed using TRAFFIX, which is
based on the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 method for sig-
nalized intersections. TRAFFIX evaluates signalized intersection opera-
tions on the basis of average control delay time for all vehicles at the
intersection. The City of Hollister level of service standard for signal-
ized intersections is LOS C or better. The correlation between average
delay and level of service is shown in Table 4.1.

                                       Existing peak hour traffic volumes were obtained from recent manual
                                       turning-movement counts at the key study intersections. The existing
                                       lane configurations at the study intersections were obtained from field
                                       observations.
                                       Existing Intersection Levels of Service
                                       It is the intent of this plan that most streets should operate with no
                                       more than a tolerable level of congestion, LOS C. The concept of
                                       maintaining no worse than a tolerable level of congestion is important,
                                       not only to provide a reasonable LOS for motorists, but also to protect
                                       neighborhoods from the impact of excessive through traffic. To the
                                       extent that the arterial and major collector street system is operating
                                       with limited congestion, there will be less incentive for drivers to use
                                       local streets to bypass areas of congestion
                                       The results of the level of service analysis under existing conditions
                                       are summarized in Table 4.2. The results show that four of the study
                                       intersections currently operate at an unacceptable LOS D during at
                                       least one of the peak hours.

KEY FINDINGS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
Forecasts of future demand on the City's transportation system were
prepared using the San Benito County/Hollister travel demand model.
This model uses widely accepted transportation planning formulas to
convert forecasts of future land use into the number and distribution
of future vehicle trips on the roadway network. The forecast volumes
are compared to the roadway design capacities to identify transporta-
tion corridors, roadway segments, or intersections where a prescribed
level of service will be exceeded.
Various roadway improvements have been identified and assumed in
place in the year 2023. These improvements are designed to maintain
or improve the current levels of service for the roadways and meet
future traffic demand within the City of Hollister and the San Benito
County. These improvements are summarized in Table 4.3.

                                       The network improvements that are included are based on information
                                       from several recent planning efforts. These include the 1995 General
                                       Plan, the 2001 San Benito County Regional Transportation Plan and
                                       the planning associated with the traffic impact fee programs for Hollis-
                                       ter, San Juan Bautista and San Benito County. One of the common
                                       characteristics of all these previous planning efforts was that they
                                       relied upon a planning horizon of approximately 10 years.
                                       A variety of factors led to the decision to set the year 2023 as the long-
                                       range planning horizon for this update of the Hollister General Plan.
                                       Therefore, a set of population, housing and employment projections
                                       were developed based on the land use designations shown on the draft
                                       Hollister General Plan Map, and other state and regional projections of
                                       population and employment growth. The constrained projections
                                       adopted by the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments
                                       (AMBAG) were used as the controlling values for the Hollister 2023
                                       growth projections.
                                       These projections were then allocated to the traffic analysis zones used
                                       by the City's traffic forecasting model. The traffic forecasting model
                                       was then used to develop projections of future traffic demand on the
                                       area's roadway system. The results were then analyzed to determine
                                       where there were projected roadway capacity deficiencies, and to
                                       develop recommendations for further improvements.

Hollister Growth Areas
The draft General Plan includes a Phasing Diagram that indicates the
City's priorities for locating future residential growth. The General Plan
also includes a similar diagram showing the preferred locations for
retail growth. These diagrams and their associated growth allocations
were the basis for developing the 2023 projected distribution of popu-
lation and employment.
The phasing diagram designates a large number of infill sites as the
first priority for future residential growth. Subsequent phases provide
for new residential areas outside of, but contiguous to, the existing
urbanized area. These new residential areas include land northeast,
south, east, and eventually northwest of the City respectively as the
preferred progression of development. New employment growth is
focused within the existing downtown, new retail gateways north and
west of the downtown, and in the industrial park near the airport.
A total of about 7,200 new residential units were included in the above
described residential areas. Employment growth of approximately
7,800 was also included. This amount of household and employment
growth is projected to occur between 2004 and 2023.

                                       future changes in Hollister's circulation system. The intended effect of
                                       this diagram and the street classifications show therein is to govern the
                                       growth and character of major circulation facilities, including street
                                       and railroad facilities. The street classifications used in this diagram are
                                       described in the following section, and streets in all classifications are

                                       Street Classification and Design
                                       This section sets forth the street classifications used in the Circulation
                                       Diagram to designate how streets will be developed during the 20-year
                                       planning horizon of this plan.
                                       The street classifications set forth in this Circulation Element combine
                                       traditional street classifications, which define design and operational
                                       characteristics based on the need to accommodate the movement of
                                       motor vehicles, with context-sensitive street classifications, which fac-
                                       tor in neighboring land uses and the need to accommodate pedestrians,
                                       bicyclists, and transit users. The resulting matrix of street classifica-
                                       tions creates a framework within which street design is influenced by
                                       both function and context.

Major Thoroughfares
Function
The primary function of the major thoroughfare is to provide a high
degree of mobility and generally serve longer vehicle trips to and from
the urban area. Its secondary function is to serve longer trips within
the urban area connecting major urban elements such as the Down-
town Central Business District, industrial facilities, large urban and sub- Design elements for commercial through-
                                                                            fares in Hollister are driven by the land use
urban commercial centers, and other key activity centers.                   context.
Major throughfares may be four to eight lanes in width and may
accommodate up to 30,000 vehicles or more per day. Major thorough-
fares often have a large median area used as a left turn lane at intersec-
tions. Access to major thoroughfares should be limited to signalized
intersections with major and minor collector streets and major com-
mercial driveways. Direct access to adjacent properties should be lim-
ited to right-turn-in and right-turn-out movements only. Posted speed
limits on thoroughfare facilities generally range between 30 and 45
mph, varying based on the type of area being served.
With an emphasis on mobility, a thoroughfare facility is generally
designed to accommodate vehicle trips in the form of passenger cars,
trucks, and buses. Bicycle facilities may be provided. Pedestrian facili-
ties are always provided, but the width of these facilities varies depend-
ing on adjacent land use and the level of pedestrian activity.

                                       Design Context
                                       As with all functional street types, the design of a major throughfare
                                       depends on its land use context. Traffic-dependent commercial land
                                       uses, such as suburban shopping centers, are the most common land
                                       use along major arterials. Where this is the case, for example Airline
                                       Highway, primary design considerations are lane width and access man-
                                       agement.

                                       The primary function of the major collector is to serve longer trips
                                       within the urban area connecting major urban elements such as the
                                       Downtown Central Business District, industrial facilities, large urban
                                       and suburban commercial centers, major residential areas, and other
                                       key activity centers. Its secondary function is to provide backup capac-
                                       ity for regional traffic in the event of emergency or temporary road
                                       construction.
                                       Major collectors are two to four lanes wide and may accommodate up
                                       to 20,000 vehicles per day. Major collectors often have a median or
                                       third lane for turning movements. Direct access to properties should
                                       be consolidated where feasible. Posted speed limits on major collector
                                       facilities generally range between 30 and 35 mph.

Design Context
A mix of land uses, such as office and residential, is the most common
land use along major collectors. Where this is the case, for example on
San Benito Street south of South Street, high priority design elements
include wide sidewalks and transit facilities with high amenities. Alter-
natively, in a Main Street context with limited right-of-way, for example
Fourth Street, lane width and access management may be compro-
mised in favor of wide sidewalks, planting strips that separate the side-
walk from the street, and on-street parking.
Collectors
Function
The primary function of a collector is to provide access between local
streets and arterials. Its secondary function is to provide access to land
within residential, commercial, and industrial areas.
Collectors are two lanes wide and may accommodate up to 10,000
vehicles per day. Direct access to adjacent properties is discouraged.
Speed limits are typically in the 25-to-35 miles per hour range.

                                       Design Context
                                       Residential or industrial land uses are the most common land use along
                                       collector streets. In residential areas, collector streets provide access to
                                       local residential streets and occasionally provide direct access to resi-
                                       dential properties. Where this is the case, for example on Buena Vista
                                       Road, high priority design elements include detached sidewalks and
                                       street trees in planting strips. Alternatively, in an industrial context, for
                                       example on Chappell Road, emphasis shifts to lane width and intersec-
                                       tion design for large trucks.

                                       Function
                                       The primary function of a residential street is to provide direct access
                                       from collector streets to residential, industrial, and mixed-use property.
                                       In the residential and mixed-use contexts, the primary function of the
                                       residential street is also to provide a high amenity environment for
                                       pedestrians. Its secondary function is to provide access to alternative
                                       collectors in high traffic periods. Mobility on local streets is typically
                                       incidental and involves relatively short trips at lower speeds to and
                                       from collector facilities.
                                       Because of their "neighborhood" nature, travel speeds are generally
                                       lower than collectors and throughfares. Posted speed limits on residen-
                                       tial streets generally range between 25 and 30 mph, depending on avail-
                                       able right-of-way and the adjacent land uses. Traffic volumes on local
                                       streets are generally less than 5,000 vehicles per day, and also vary
                                       depending on available right-of-way and the adjacent land uses.
                                       Pedestrian and bicycle safety and aesthetics are generally high priorities
                                       on local streets in residential and commercial areas. Wider travel lanes
                                       and broader turning radii to accommodate larger vehicle size are major
                                       considerations on residential streets in industrial areas.

                                       Roadway Capacity Deficiency Analysis
                                       Roadway capacity deficiencies were identified in several areas. These
                                       deficiencies are directly related to the future land use designations
                                       shown on the updated General Plan Land Use Plan. The deficiencies
                                       can be grouped into several categories of roadway capacity needs.
                                       These include:
                                         Regional commuting,
                                         Northwest Hollister circulation needs,
                                         Southeast Hollister circulation needs, and
                                         Additional roadway capacity serving the Industrial Park.
                                       Regional Commuting Deficiencies
                                       The household and employment projections through the year 2023
                                       show a reasonable balance between new housing and new jobs. The
                                       projected household growth was about 7,200 residential units and the
                                       projected employment growth was about 7,800. However, since most
                                       households tend to have more than one worker, each new residential
                                       unit can be expected to contribute to the demand for inter-regional
                                       commuting. Consequently, the travel forecasts show projected roadway
                                       capacity deficiencies for the major highways and arterial streets serving
                                       regional commuters.

Capacity deficiencies were identified along the two major State High-
ways 25 and 156, and along Fairview and Shore Roads. The
Fairview/Shore Road route is frequently used by commuters who are
avoiding the high traffic volumes on Highway 25 between Hollister and
Route 101 and Highway 152 between Gilroy and the intersection with
Highway 156.
Circulation Needs In Northwest Hollister
The updated General Plan includes new residential and gateway com-
mercial designations for the northwest area of Hollister. The new des-
ignations cover not only the areas near and between Fourth Street and
Buena Vista Road, but also the land between Buena Vista Road and
Wright Road. The area is large enough to eventually support more than
2,000 new residential units.
Capacity deficiencies were identified on Wright Road, Buena Vista
Road, and Fourth Street.
Circulation Needs in Southeast Hollister
The circulation needs for the southeast area of Hollister have been
previously studied and the 2023 traffic forecasts reinforce the earlier
conclusions regarding needed roadway improvements. Union Road and
Airline Highway will eventually require widening to four or more lanes.
Additional Roadway Capacity Serving the Industrial
Park
Fallon Road is the major thoroughfare leading in to Hollister's indus-
trial park near the municipal airport. The industrial park has the largest
amount of land available for employment growth in the area. It is pro-
jected that about 25 percent of the non-retail employment growth will
likely occur at the industrial park. The segment of Fallon Road just east
of its intersection with San Felipe Road is projected to have a capacity
deficiency by the year 2023. Fallon Road should be widened to 4 lanes
through the industrial park.

IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
1-Year Time Frame
C.A        Classify roadways
Classify the roadways within the Sphere of Influence by function, and
specify the improvement concept for each major roadway. The public
right-of-way associated with the specified improvement concepts shall
be protected through the use of City Council adopted plan lines.
C.B        Develop truck routes
Truck routes should be developed with COG, Caltrans and San Benito
County and must include enforcement mechanisms to encourage the
approriate routes.
On-going Time Frame
C.C        Encourage intergovernmental coordination
The City should coordinate regional planning efforts with COG, Cal-
trans, San Benito County and other applicable agencies. Hollister offi-
cials should actively participate in development review for circulation
projects outside the city limits but within Hollister's planning area.
C.D        Evaluate public facilities fees
The City should consider adopting a citywide public facilities impact
fee ordinance to fund new circulation improvement projects required
to serve new residents and employees in Hollister.
C.E        Monitor LOS levels
Monitor the LOS for intersections along the arterial roadways at least
once every two years to ensure compliance with the City's LOS stan-
dards. This information shall be presented to the City Council for their
use in evaluating amendments to the City's transportation plan.
                                                                            DECEMBER 2005                4.37

C.F.2: Buena Vista Road Construction
Segment           Westside Boulevard to McCray Street
Location:
Improvement       Construct two-lane road
Description:
Purpose           Buena Vista Road currently exists along a discon-
and Need:         tinuous alignment in northeast Hollister. There is
                  an opportunity to improve this roadway so that it
                  can serve as a westward extension of Santa Ana
                  Road. Improvement is needed from McCray
                  Street westward to intersect with the planned
                  Westside Boulevard. The objective is to provide a
                  continuous 2-lane collector street across north
                  Hollister. The improved roadway would signifi-
                  cantly improve the accessibility of the neighbor-
                  hoods in northeast Hollister. Future plans could
                  include a westward extension of Buena Vista
                  Road that could intersect with the Highway 156
                  Bypass.

HOLLISTER TODAY
Topography
The land within the Hollister Planning Area generally slopes upward
from north to south, with elevations of approximately 210 feet near
the Hollister Municipal Airport, 290 feet near City Hall and 500 feet
near the intersection of Fairview Road and Airline Highway (Highway
25). Although the topography is relatively flat in most areas, the terrain
is hilly near the San Benito River, west of the Southern Pacific railroad
line northwest of Hollister and in the eastern portion of the Planning
Area.
Open Space
Open Space is vacant land in the City that is primarily maintained in its
natural condition. In some cases this land includes landscaped areas
which are maintained but which are not actively used for recreational
purposes.
Soils
The Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
has classified the soils within the Hollister Planning Area using three
soil associations. Soils of the Sorrento-Yolo Mocho association consist
of nearly level to sloping soils that formed in very deep alluvium
derived from sedimentary rocks, and underlie the central and western
portions of the Planning Area. The dominant soils in this association
are very deep and well drained, and include some of the most produc-
                                                                                      DECEMBER 2005                 6.1

                                           tive soils in the country. Soils of the Rincon-Antioch-Cropley associa-
                                           tion consist of nearly level to strongly sloping soils on fans and ter-
                                           races, and underlie the southeastern quadrant of the Planning Area.
                                           These soils are very well drained, although erosion is a problem on the
                                           more sloping soils. Soils of the Clear Lake-Pacheco-Willows associa-
                                           tion consist of nearly level and gently sloping soils that formed in allu-
                                           vium derived from sedimentary rocks, and underlie the northern
                                           portion of the Planning Area. In order for these soils to support agri-
                                           cultural activity, drainage is needed in most areas, and reclamation may
                                           be necessary in those areas affected by salts and alkali.
                                           Agricultural Land
                                           When the State of California evaluates agricultural land, areas are des-
                                           ignated as "Prime Farmland" when they are found to have the best
                                           combination of physical and chemical characteristics for crop produc-
                                           tion, and have the soil quality, growing season and moisture supply
                                           needed to produce sustained yields of crops when treated and man-
                                           aged. Lands identified as "Prime Farmland" must have been used for
                                           the production of irrigated crops within the last three years. Areas des-
                                           ignated as "Farmland of Statewide Importance" represent land other
                                           than "Prime Farmland" which has a good combination of physical and
                                           chemical characteristics for the production of crops. As in the case of
                                           "Prime Farmland", these areas must have been used for the production
                                           of irrigated crops within the last three years.
                                           Under the Land Conservation Act ("Williamson Act"), farmers are able
                                           to enter into land conservation contracts with San Benito County
                                           which enable them to enjoy reduced property taxes in exchange for
                                           maintaining their land in agricultural production. Once entered into by
                                           a farmer, a Williamson Act Contract is binding for a period of ten
                                           years. Contracts are automatically renewed each year unless the farmer
                                           files a Notice of Non-Renewal. After the filing of such a Notice, the
                                           land may not be converted to other uses for ten years, during which
                                           time the property taxes are gradually increased to reflect the full market

Protection of Agriculture and Soils
Agricultural soils and other natural features and assets are important to
preserve through land use planning. As development pressures in the
Hollister area increase, the demand for land suitable for residential
development is expected to result in the conversion of some land
which is currently in agricultural production, and some development
may take place on soils which have been identified as among the most
productive in the country. As construction takes place in developing
areas, soil erosion would be expected to increase.
                                                                                      DECEMBER 2005                 6.5

OPEN SPACE AND AGRICULTURE
ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
Preservation of open space and the natural environment have been a
priority for Hollister residents for many years. Whenever possible, the
natural terrain and vegetation of the community should be preserved
and maintained.Recognizing the importance of agriculture to the com-
munity, the City will protect agricultural lands by maintaining parcels
large enough to sustain agricultural production, preventing conversion
to non-agricultural uses, and prohibiting uses that are incompatible
with long-term agricultural production.
GOAL            Preserve and protect open space and the natural
OS1             environment for all to enjoy.
GOAL            Preserve viable agricultural activities and lands.

                                           lic open space. When potential open space is not contiguous to existing
                                           public open space, the preference is to retain the open space in private
                                           ownership. When portions of a site are retained as private open space,
                                           ensure the preservation and management of that open space through
                                           appropriate means, including required maintenance, as determined
                                           though development review. Work with other public and non-profit
                                           agencies to identify sources for acquisition and maintenance of open
                                           space.

Chapter Two:
Land Use and Community
Design Element
The Land Use and Community Design Element provides the founda-
tion for growth on which the other General Plan elements are based.
State law mandates the inclusion of a land use element in any General
Plan. Land use goals and policies establish the overall type and loca-
tion of development activity in Hollister and are closely related to
housing and economic development. This element also includes a
community design section, although not required by California law,
                                                                            Hollister’s mix of land uses range from

HOLLISTER TODAY
The Land Use and Community Design Element defines land use cate-
gories within three planning boundaries: the planning area boundary,
the sphere of influence, and the city limits. These three areas allow the
General Plan to address development within the City and in surround-
ing areas that directly influence development planning and decision-
making in Hollister.
The Hollister planning area boundary encompasses incorporated and
unincorporated territory bearing a relation to the City's planning. A
city's planning area generally includes the city limits and land for poten-
tial annexation with the sphere of influence. Reduced in size from the
1995 General Plan, the Hollister planning area is generally bounded by
Shore Road (north), Santa Ana Creek and parcels east of Fairview
Road (east), Bolsa Road and the San Benito River (west), and
Enterprise Road (south).
                                                                                     DECEMBER 2005                 2.1

2. LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
                               The sphere of influence (SOI) encompasses the city's ultimate service
                               area. The Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) determines
                               the SOI boundaries for which Hollister is responsible. As a function
                               of this responsibility, Hollister city staff review certain development
                               proposals submitted to San Benito County for parcels in unincorpo-
                               rated areas for consistency with land use policies outlined in the City's
                               General Plan. Though Hollister may offer comments on land outside
                               of the city limits, San Benito County is not obligated to accept.
                               The Hollister city limits encompass incorporated territory that the City
                               serves and regulates. The use of land within the city limits is con-
                               trolled by the City of Hollister through its General Plan, zoning code,
                               land subdivision process and other related regulations.
                               KEY FINDINGS AND
                               RECOMMENDATIONS
                               To accommodate growth in Hollister, the General Plan outlines a series
                               of land use and growth management strategies to intensify urban uses
                               while preserving the small town character and rural feel of the area.
                               Each strategy outlined in the following sections is supported by land
                               use and design goals, policies and implementation measures.
                               Hollister's population is projected to grow at an average annual rate of
                               3.4% through the year 2023, slightly above the national average of
                               3.3% but below California's population growth rate of 4.8%. The
                               population growth rate slightly outpaces the projected housing unit
                               production rate of 3.0% and the projected employment growth rate
                               within City limits of 2.9%.

                                          Table LU1: City of Hollister Growth Projections through 2023, above,
                                          shows the City's employment, housing units and population counts as
                                          of the 2000 Census and projected values for each category in 2010,
                                          2020 and 2023. By the end of the 2004 General Plan's planning hori-
                                          zon, Hollister's population will increase from 34,413 to a projected
                                          55,192 residents. The Land Use Plan accommodates this projected
                                          growth within the City's Planning Area.
                                          LAND USE PLAN
                                          The General Plan's Land Use Plan graphically represents prescribed
                                          land uses and intensities for physical development within the planning
                                          area. The General Plan land use designations provide the basis for
                                          more specific requirements and standards in Hollister's zoning ordi-
                                          nance. Definitions for each land use category are provided on the fol-
                                          lowing pages. It is important to consider the following points when
                                          referring to the Land Use Plan:
                                            The Land Use Plan indicates the primary use of land prescribed in
                                             the indicated areas but does not preclude minor deviations from the
                                             designated pattern, so long as the intent of the predominant land
                                             use designation is maintained.
                                            The Land Use Plan map will be amended in the event that the City
                                             makes changes to the designations of any land areas.

LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Residential Estate (1 unit/5 net acres)
The Rural category of residential land uses is intended for single-fam-
ily, residential units on large lots. The Residential Estate category only
occurs in long-range phased areas outside of Hollister's city limits and
Sphere of Influence (but is within the Planning Area). Residential
Estate land uses are intended to provide sites for larger, distinctive resi-
dences in areas that the City does not provide public infrastructure.
Low Density Residential (1 to 8 units/net acre)
The Low Density category of residential land uses is intended to pro-
mote and protect single-family neighborhoods. Low Density Residen-
tial land uses are intended to provide sites for single-family detached
units, zero lot-line single-family units, and Planned Unit Development
(PUD) units.
Medium Density Residential (8 to 12 units/net acre)
The Medium Density category of residential land use accommodates
more intensive forms of residential development. This category is
intended to provide greater housing choices in the City for different
family sizes and incomes (examples include duplexes and triplexes).
Existing Medium Density Residential uses are located close to the
community and retail services downtown, and future Medium Density
uses are intended to be located near other services, such as neighbor-
hood shopping centers, parks and open spaces areas, and near minor
and major collector streets where sufficient access can be provided.
                                                                             DECEMBER 2005  2.7

                               High Density Residential (12 to 35 units/net acre)
                               The High Density residential land use category is intended to provide
                               opportunities for multiple-family residential development in a well-
                               designed environment. The range of unit types is intended to be
                               located in areas where higher traffic volumes and buildings can be
                               accommodated. These developments should be located outside of sin-
                               gle-family residential communities, where services and transportation
                               systems are adequate to serve increased densities. High Density Resi-
                               dential land uses are intended to provide sites for multi-family apart-
                               ments, condos, row houses, apartments, court homes, and cluster
                               housing.
                               Mixed Use Commercial and Residential
                               (25 to 40 units/net acre)
                               The Mixed-Use Commercial and Residential designation is intended to
                               promote a vertical or horizontal combination of residential and com-
                               mercial uses within a single building or site. The designation is
                               intended to encourage retail sales, service, office, and public uses on
                               the ground floor with upper floors of office and residential uses. The
                               Mixed-Use Commercial and Residential category applies to commercial
                               activity that includes government and professional offices, neighbor-
                               hood-oriented retail, community shopping centers, specialty stores, arts
                               and crafts, woodworking, and assembly processes.
                               Downtown Commercial and Mixed-Use
                               The Downtown Commercial and Mixed-Use designation is intended
                               primarily for all types of commercial uses and secondarily for residen-
                               tial uses or a combination of the two. Special attention should be
                               given to pedestrian circulation within the area to provide access to
                               adjacent facilities and uses. The designation is intended to encourage
                               ground floor, pedestrian friendly, retail sales and service uses with
                               upper floors of office and residential uses. The Downtown Commer-
                               cial category applies to commercial activity including neighborhood

convenience stores, restaurants, regionally-oriented specialty stores,
medical and dental offices, and residential units. To promote pedes-
trian activity, neither commercial uses that require drive-through
windows nor open-air car, truck and boat lots, automotive repair and
body shops are appropriate Downtown. Smaller vehicle sales are per-
mitted within enclosed buildings.
Home Office
The Home Office designation is intended to allow for residential and
office uses, including administrative and professional offices, in the
same area. The Home Office designation also allows for limited,
small-scale specialty manufacturing uses, such as arts and crafts, wood-
working, assembly processes, and beauty salons. Non-residential build-
ings that share street frontage with residentially developed properties
should maintain a residential character. The designation does not
require office development; rather, it creates the option for offices in
what is otherwise a medium-density residential district.
West Gateway Mixed-Use
The West Gateway Mixed-Use designation is intended to foster an
attractive entry to the City of Hollister by featuring community shop-
ping, retail and offices with residential uses. The design guidelines
described in the "Special Planning Areas" section of this element stipu-
lates additional criteria that development within the West Gateway
must meet.
North Gateway Commercial
The North Gateway Commercial designation is intended to foster an
attractive entry to the City of Hollister by featuring commercial and
service-oriented businesses along with high-employment uses such as
office parks. The design guidelines described in the "Special Planning
Areas" section of this element stipulates additional criteria that devel-
opment within the North Gateway must meet.

                               The General Commercial designation allows for a variety of commer-
                               cial uses and service-oriented businesses at scales ranging from large
                               retail stores serving the community and region to smaller businesses
                               oriented towards neighborhood activity. Uses are encouraged to
                               develop in clusters, serving areas with access to major arterials. Inde-
                               pendent small businesses such as hair salons, small offices, and restau-
                               rants are also permitted. Other examples of uses are department
                               stores, supermarkets, hardware stores and convenience stores.

                               allowed uses in this category are computer software companies,
                               research laboratories, copying services, printing companies, warehous-
                               ing, offices, equipment manufacturing and repair and trucking opera-
                               tions. Other permitted uses include limited commercial uses that serve
                               industrial and employment centers.
                               Industrial areas that fall in the North Gateway Overlay district will also
                               allow limited commercial uses with frontage along Highway 25 to serve
                               passing motorists. The design guidelines described in the "Special
                               Planning Areas" section of this element stipulates additional criteria
                               that development within the North Gateway must meet.
                               Airport
                               The Airport designation is applied to publicly owned lands of the Hol-
                               lister Municipal Airport. Uses include airport operations and support
                               facilities as well as limited commercial and industrial uses incidental to
                               and in support of the airport.

Airport Support
This designation allows industrial or commercial development on those
areas that are adjacent to and have direct access to the Hollister Munic-
ipal Airport. Development may include industrial, commercial or
recreational uses that provide support to the airport and are compati-
ble with both airport operations and adjacent uses.
Public
This designation is applied to publicly and privately owned lands used
for activities such as utilities, schools, and other City of Hollister,
county, state or federal facilities.
Transit Hub
This designation includes stations and other uses associated with a
regional transit corridor or a park-and-ride facility. While neither
Transit Hub designated on the Land Use Plan is currently developed,
they correspond with future planned development along the Southern
Pacific railroad line.
Open Space
This designation is applied to public and privately owned lands used
for low-intensity, open space activities such as hiking, walking or pic-
nicking. The designation also highlights environmentally sensitive
areas such as rivers and creeks, habitats, City parks and recreation
facilities.
Agriculture
The Agriculture designation encompasses lands with continuing com-
mercial agriculture potential. The intent of this category is to retain
primary agricultural use to the greatest extent practical. These areas
should be kept free of any urban-type development and annexations.
Allowed uses include orchards, row crops, nurseries, grazing lands,
open space, farm services and parks.

                               Specific Plan / Area Plan Overlay
                               The Specific Plan / Area Plan Overlay designation is intended to iden-
                               tify areas that require special planning attention to promote a mix of
                               land uses that remain flexible enough to adjust to changing market
                               demands or the approved West of Fairview Specific Plan and North-
                               east Hollister Area Plan. Specific Plans should facilitate high-quality
                               development while allowing for multiple property owners to coordi-
                               nate development efforts, share the cost of infrastructure improve-
                               ments and provide special amenities.
                               Land uses with Specific Plan / Area Plan overlay areas may deviate
                               from the underlying land use designations and intensities if recom-
                               mended by the Specific Plan, however a General Plan amendment
                               would be required as part of the Specific Plan approval process.
                               To promote timely development on sites in Specific Plan and Area Plan
                               areas, development must commence within five years of Specific Plan
                               approval or in the case of existing Area Plans by 2010. If develop-
                               ment does not begin in this time period, designations within the Spe-
                               cific Plan or Area Plan area will revert to standard General Plan
                               designations unless an extension of this time period is authorized by
                               City Council.
                               The preparation of a Specific Plan or an infrastructure capacity plan
                               shall be required prior to annexation properties outside of the 2005
                               Sphere of Influence.

                               RETAIL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
                               The General Plan’s Land Use Plan is designed to provide a high level
                               of flexibility for future commercial development projects. New land
                               use categories, such as Mixed-Use and Home Office, allow a range of
                               commercial projects to develop throughout Hollister without mandat-
                               ing specific uses so that individual projects are free to meet the market
                               demand of the City and its unique neighborhoods at the time of devel-
                               opment.
                               In addition to this flexibility, the General Plan identifies prime loca-
                               tions for new development to occur. By distributing different types of
                               retail development opportunities throughout Hollister, the General
                               Plan seeks to promote accessible and diverse retails districts that com-
                               plement, rather than compete with, each other.
                               The major retail characeterizations are:
                                 Neighborhood-Serving Mixed-Use Retail,
                                 Downtown Specialty Retail,

INFILL AND PHASING STRATEGIES
As Hollister continues to grow, development pressure on the edges of
the City will increase. Without a strategy to counterbalance this pres-
sure, development will creep further from the core of Hollister. If this
happens, new buildings will begin to cover the scenic hillsides that sur-
round Hollister and the City will have a more difficult time extending
municipal services to all its residents. To promote concurrent develop-
ment, Hollister should actively encourage infill development for the
next five years.
As a first step, the City should attempt to annex any county "islands"
that are within the city limits, making these sites "ripe" for develop-
ment. Once this has occurred, sites that are within the SOI should be
encouraged to develop before development extends to the surrounding
areas.
As another component of the Infill Strategy, Hollister shall allocate a
portion of the legally permissible units under the City's existing growth
management restrictions to be developed exclusively in the Downtown
area (bounded by Santa Ana Road and North Street Extension to the
north, Nash Road and Sunnyslope Road to the south, Monterey Street
to the west, and Highway 25 Bypass to the east) illustrated on Map 5:

also establish an expanded market for retail, entertainment and other
commercial services in Downtown Hollister.

                               Map 6: Phasing Strategy highlights areas outside of the City's SOI that
                               should not be developed until the SOI is sufficiently built out. Once
                               this occurs, each development phase will be prioritized in sequence;
                               applications for projects in the Phase 1 district will be promoted in
                               favor of projects in Phases 2 or 3. The preparation of a Specific Plan
                               that offers Hollister a high-quality product or a unique opportunity is
                               an alternative way for a development project to gain priority.
                               Even with these identified priority areas and the phasing strategy, the
                               City cannot force development to occur in these places. In order to
                               implement the phasing plan, Hollister should offer incentives that
                               make the infill development and phased growth areas the easiest,

                               projects in infill areas. The City can provide credits, fee waivers, or fee
                               deferments on exactions such as water and sewer fees, construction
                               and building permit fees, etc., on projects in priority areas.
                               Hollister may adopt a policy to defer or adjust sales and/or property
                               taxes in specific districts. For example the City could:
                                 Explore the possibility of exempting from sales tax the purchase of
                                  building materials for infill development projects; and
                                 Investigate the legal and financial implications of freezing property
                                  taxes at the year 2004 (or at the level at the time of development)
                                  for parcels that are underutilized or blighted, or any developments
                                  that place housing above restaurants or retail in infill areas.
                               Hollister can adjust its land use policies, and zoning and development
                               standards to provide developers with greater potential financial returns
                               in exchange for tackling high priority development projects which oth-
                               erwise might prove too risky. The City could provide density bonuses
                               for development projects on priority infill sites.

                               This General Plan identifies five Special Planning Areas. Each of these
                               areas is at least partially developed already. By designating them as
                               Special Planning Areas, the General Plan intends to provide additional
                               policy direction to guide additional development, redevelopment, and
                               property improvements in these areas. The Special Planning Areas are
                               designated as such for the following reasons:
                                 They are located in highly visible locations that characterize
                                  Hollister, in and around Downtown or as people approach and
                                  leave the City.
                                 They contain potential economic development opportunities if
                                  developed appropriately.
                                 They would benefit from a unified design approach and take advan-
                                  tage of unique elements of the City.
                               The General Plan identifies design concepts for circulation and park-
                               ing, site organization, building detailing, landscaping and streetscape
                               elements for each Special Planning Area.

                               The North Gateway area is intended to create an entry boulevard for
                               motorists arriving in Hollister from the north along Highway 25. The
                               district begins at the intersection of San Felipe and McCloskey Roads
                               and extends south along San Felipe Road to Santa Ana Road. The
                               gateway area extends east of San Felipe Road between McCloskey
                               Road and the Highway 25 Bypass. The district is important because it
                               provides the opportunity for large retail uses that cater to commuters
                               and other motorists without duplicating services found Downtown.
                               The North Gateway includes a triangular area northeast of Highway 25
                               and San Felipe Road north of Downtown that could be developed for
                               automobile dealerships. The site has access from Highway 25, and the
                               dealerships would be visible to all motorists entering the City. The
                               commercial boulevard could then continue south along San Felipe
                               Road, lined by decorative landscaping and retail facilities, leading into
                               the heart of Downtown. Guidelines for development include the fol-

                               The Home Office designation is an older residential district surround-
                               ing Downtown that has changed over time to include professional
                               offices. Users such as accountants, architects, engineers, graphic
                               designers, lawyers, etc., contribute to an economically viable area that is
                               relatively free of high-volume automobile and pedestrian traffic. The
                               major design goal is to preserve the residential look and feel of the
                               neighborhood while continuing to allow specific office uses to adjoin

                               Zoning regulations provide the standards for development, prescribe
                               allowable uses, contain specific incentive provisions, and include other
                               standards and procedures related to approval of development projects.
                               The City has begun to re-evaluate its existing zoning regulations and
                               will need to update the code to maintain consistency with the goals of
                               the General Plan. The code should be revised to regulate the location
                               and mixing of uses, gateway development styles, landscaping and
                               streetscape treatments, circulation and parking requirements, and set-

                                            Hollister should formulate a strategy to retain and attract businesses.
                                            This strategy should be reviewed frequently to ensure that it reflects
                                            current economic and business trends. City staff, elected officials, and

LU.N       Assemble parcels for development in accordance with
           RDA programs
In support of its economic development strategy the City may choose
to use the authority of its Redevelopment Agency (RDA) to attract and
retain businesses and other activities and in providing supportive pub-
lic improvements. A strategy for encouraging investment is to pur-
chase adjacent parcels of land to assemble one large lot for
development, then building a RDA-funded project or offering the land
to a private developer.

                               projects outside of official RDA project areas in some instances.
                               When opportunities arise for unique housing product types on sites
                               that have the potential to trigger future private investment, the RDA

LU.U        Implement phasing strategy
The Planning Commission should work with City Council and San
Benito County planners to determine priority areas for development
within Hollister's Sphere of Influence and a means for promoting
these sites for development. City Council members and the Commis-
sioners should also determine the timing sequence for promoting the
long-range development phases outside the Sphere of Influence.
LU.V        Offer development incentives
Providing development incentives to developers and property owners
can influence good community design. Development incentives can be
in the form of density and development intensity bonuses, reduced
development standards (such as reductions in setback and parking
requirements), or restructured development fees. Incentives should be
offered when they promote a close adherence to Hollister's develop-
ment objectives by providing desirable features such as in-fill housing,
exceptional design, enhanced public amenities or environmental bene-

HOLLISTER TODAY
Natural Habitats and Wildlife
Hollister is rich with diverse habitats, such as creeks and drainageways,
that are valued resources for Hollister's wildlife. Protection, restoration
or enhancement of damaged habitats is important for the continued
health of Hollister's natural environment.
Protection of the creeks and drainageways and wetlands, and the plants
and animals that live in and near them, can be achieved by managing
public access along these areas and by minimizing encroachment by
new development to only that which is unavoidable. This can be
accomplished by preserving buffer areas along creeks and drainage-
ways, associated riparian areas and wetlands. Another way to protect
creeks is to improve public access points so that uncontrolled foot traf-
fic does not damage these sensitive habitats.
Vegetation, fish, and wildlife habitat are essential to the community of
Hollister. As development pressures grow, the need for preservation of
the valuable diversity of species becomes increasingly important. The
City recognizes the ecological, scientific, aesthetic and cultural values of
threatened and endangered species as well as their inherent and legal
right to exist without undue disturbance. Protection of threatened and
endangered species shall also extend to habitat that might reasonably
be expected to support populations of those species, consistent with
the requirements of state and federal law. By providing protection to
special status species, the City is recognizing the need to contribute to
                                                                                        DECEMBER 2005                7.1

                                          their populations are so low that they must be listed as threatened or
                                          endangered under the state and federal endangered species acts.
                                          The San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) is listed as a federally
                                          endangered and state threatened species, and has been identified in the
                                          Natural Diversity Database (prepared by the California Department of
                                          Fish and Game) as the only species endangered, threatened or of spe-
                                          cial concern which may be found within the Hollister Planning Area.
                                          The nearest sighting of a San Joaquin kit fox in relation to the Hollister
                                          Planning Area occurred in 1972, when one was seen approximately
                                          3,000 feet east of the southeast corner of the Planning Area. However,
                                          the San Joaquin kit fox is known to range within two miles of sight-
                                          ings, and San Benito County has designated the area east of Fairview
                                          Road as a potential San Joaquin kit fox habitat area.
                                          Wetlands
                                          Wetlands are defined as: "Those areas that are inundated or saturated
                                          by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to
                                          support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a preva-
                                          lence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil condi-
                                          tions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar
                                          areas." Wetlands are fragile, natural resources subject to flooding, ero-
                                          sion, soil-bearing capacity limitations and other hazards. In addition
                                          they are resources of special significance due to the modulation of
                                          flood waters, water quality and habitat functions they perform, and
                                          resulting values identified by man such as control of flood velocities,

                                          and animals that live in and near them, can be achieved by managing
                                          public access along these areas and by minimizing encroachment by

new development to only that which is unavoidable. This can be
accomplished by preserving buffer areas along creeks and drainage-
ways, associated riparian areas and wetlands. Another way to protect
creeks is to improve public access points so that uncontrolled foot traf-
fic does not damage these sensitive habitats.
Mineral Deposits
The State Mining and Geology Board has designated portions of the
Hollister Planning Area as having construction aggregate deposits
(sand, gravel and crushed rock) of regional significance (see Figure 7),
pursuant to the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (Public Resources
Code Section 2710 et seq.). These resources remain potentially avail-
able near the San Benito River and are needed to meet future demands
in the region. Land uses that require a high public or private invest-
ment in structures, land improvements, and landscaping and that would
prevent mining (i.e., high density residential development, public facili-
ties, intensive industrial and commercial uses) are inherently incompati-
ble with mining. Those land uses that require a low public or private
investment in structures, land improvements, and landscaping that
would allow mining (i.e., extensive industrial, recreation, agricultural
and open space uses) may be compatible with mining in these areas.
Interim land uses that require structures, land improvements, and land-
scaping of a limited useful life may be able to accommodate mining at
the end of that useful life.
Energy Conservation
Supplies of non-renewable energy resources, such as petroleum, natu-
ral gas and other fossil fuels, are finite and, therefore, considered scarce
in the long term. Renewable energy resources, such as solar and geot-
hermal energy, have been available for decades. With technological
advances, increasing concerns about the potential for supply disruption
and the rising costs of conventional resources, renewable energy
resources are an attractive alternative for homes and businesses.
                                                                                         DECEMBER 2005                7.3

                                          Energy conservation is viewed as an energy resource, since the effi-
                                          cient use of energy allows our energy supplies to be consumed at a
                                          slower rate. Energy conservation includes such measures as turning off
                                          lights and equipment when not needed, planting trees that shade build-
                                          ings during the summer and using fuel-efficient vehicles. Reducing
                                          demand and reducing wasted energy can be accomplished through resi-
                                          dential, commercial, and industrial programs designed to educate the
                                          consumer about options for energy conservation, and energy-efficient
                                          site and architectural design. Transportation-related measures that lead
                                          to energy conservation might include urban design and land use pat-
                                          terns that reduce trip lengths, thereby reducing fossil fuel consumption.
                                          Title 24 Standards
                                          The California Building Code establishes building energy efficiency
                                          standards for new construction (including requirements for entire new
                                          buildings, additions, alterations, and in nonresidential buildings,
                                          repairs). Since first established in 1977, the Building Energy Efficiency
                                          Standards (along with standards for energy efficiency in appliances)
                                          have helped Californians save more than $11.3 billion in electricity and
                                          natural gas costs. The Standards are updated periodically to allow

Water Conservation
Reuse and conservation of water throughout the year helps to provide
a reliable source and reduces the need and cost of securing out-of-area
supplies. Examples of water conservation measures include aerators
for faucets and showerheads, low-flow toilets, irrigation system timers
and monitors, drought-tolerant landscaping, and water-efficient dish-
washers and washing machines. Water also can be recycled: car washes,
commercial laundries and air-conditioning towers are candidates for
reuse (the major use of recycled water is landscaping with gray water).
KEY FINDINGS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
Continue to Protect Wildlife Habitat.
Additional development could put increased pressure on existing
wildlife habitat areas. Development proposed within the County-desig-
nated kit fox habitat area boundaries will be assessed an impact fee for
every home or acre developed, under the terms of a Habitat Conserva-
tion Agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Developers
must conduct pre-construction kit fox surveys within this area. Ripar-
ian habitat areas are commonly found within the 100-year floodplain.
California Department of Fish and Game policy is to permit no net
loss of riparian habitat, which means that those who propose to
develop or otherwise modify a riparian habitat must, at a minimum,
preserve or recreate a habitat area equal in area to the amount of ripar-
ian habitat which would be lost in implementing their plans.
Identify Ways to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reducing, reusing and recycling resources saves raw materials. Reduc-
tion refers to use of less of a resource material, such as the purchase of
products with minimal packaging; reuse of a product involves the reap-
plication of a used product additional times before disposal, such as
                                                                                       DECEMBER 2005                7.5
7 . N AT U R A L R E S O U R C E S A N D C O N S E R VAT I O N E L E M E N T
                                          donating clothes to a charitable organization; recycling involves the
                                          reprocessing of the used product into the same or new product, such
                                          as reprocessing of used paper into newsprint.
                                          Opportunities for Saving Energy
                                          Conserving processes also save energy, since less energy is used than in
                                          the mining/harvesting, processing and transport of finished product.
                                          This is true of all resource types, from the commonly recycled items,
                                          such as glass, paper, aluminum, and tin, to fossil-fuel-based resources,
                                          such as plastics and automobile-related waste oils. Reduction of waste
                                          has been an issue in California due to the limited amount of land avail-
                                          able for landfills. Residents, businesses and government should do all
                                          that is possible to reduce, reuse and recycle materials.
                                          Utilize Mineral Deposits Appropriately
                                          Increased development within the region is likely to create a growing
                                          demand for the regionally significant construction aggregate deposits
                                          which are located within the Hollister Planning Area.

Chapter Eight:
Health and Safety Element
This section of the General Plan covers two of the seven State-man-
dated General Plan elements: Safety and Noise. The purpose of the
Safety section is to identify and appraise hazards in the community in
order to assure community safety. Information on Safety issues has
been coordinated with the other elements of the City's General Plan,
particularly Land Use, Open Space and Conservation. The extent of a
hazard depends on local conditions, since most hazards are confined to
a particular area or site. Various health and safety hazards should be
considered in planning the location, design, intensity, density and type
of land uses in a given area. Long-term costs to the City, such as main-
tenance, liability exposure and emergency services, are potentially
greater where high hazards exist.
Noise issues are most closely associated with the Land Use and Circu-
lation portions of the Hollister General Plan. Specific concerns
addressed are: (1) establishment of noise compatible land uses; (2) reg-
ulation of new development to limit noise impacts on noise-sensitive
uses; (3) minimization of traffic noise; (4) enforcement of noise stan-
dards to protect the existing quality of life; and (5) insulation of resi-
dences exposed to excessive levels of noise.
Below is a review of State law requirements for the two mandated ele-
ments covered in this chapter of the General Plan.

                                             Safety issues have been required to be addressed as part of local gen-
                                             eral plans since 1971. The San Fernando earthquake of February 1971,
                                             which claimed 64 lives and resulted in over $500 million in property
                                             damage, and the devastating wildland fires in September and October
                                             of 1970, were largely responsible for prompting the Legislature to pass
                                             this requirement. The following citation is from Government Code
                                             Section 65302(f),
                                             "A safety element for the protection of the community from any
                                             unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically induced
                                             surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and
                                             dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides, sub-
                                             sidence and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body;
                                             flooding; and wildland and urban fires. The safety element shall
                                             include mapping of known seismic and other geologic hazards. It shall
                                             also address evacuation routes, peak load water supply requirements,
                                             and minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those
                                             items relate to identified fire and geologic hazards."
                                             Geologic and safety hazards are related to landforms and sub-surface
                                             features, and thus often cross jurisdictional boundary lines. To elimi-
                                             nate duplicative efforts, State law allows cities to adopt the relevant
                                             portions of their county's safety elements, as long as the element is suf-
                                             ficiently detailed and complies with all other General Plan requirements
                                             (Government Code, Section 65350).
                                             The County's Seismic and Safety Element is a comprehensive docu-

                                             countywide. The element addresses specific issues in Hollister but con-
                                             tains no policies specific to Hollister land use and development. How-

The following information supplements the County Element. There is
potential for earthquake, landslide and liquefaction hazards in some
portions of Hollister and the General Plan Planning Area. Map 17
illustrates that there is one localized area in the City of Hollister near
Park Hill that has the potential for Landslide Hazard. This property
area is also within the Alquist Priolo Earthquake Fault Hazard Zone.
Map 18 illustrates the potential for liquefaction hazards in the planning
area. The City of Hollister has adopted a fault hazard overlay zone that
establishes procedures for geologic fault hazard assessments if
required by the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone Act.
The City of Hollister is not located within a State Responsibility Area
for Fire Protection or an Extremely High Fire Hazard Area.
In 2001, the City of Hollister adopted a Comprehensive Land Use Plan
for the Municipal Airport. The Plan identifies both an inner and outer
safety zone with restrictions on residential uses and an influence area.
This General Plan recommends that all development within the identi-
fied influence area be reviewed for compatibility with the 2001 Land
Use Plan or its subsequent updates during the development review
process.
A Noise Element has been required as part of local General Plans
since 1971. The State Legislature adopted the California Noise Control
Act of 1973, which defined the following findings and policy:
(1)       Excessive noise is a serious hazard to the public health and
          welfare.
(2)       Exposure to certain levels of noise can result in physiological,
          psychological, and economic damage.
(3)       There is a continuous and increasing bombardment of noise
           in urban, suburban, and rural areas.
(4)       Government has by and large not taken the steps necessary to

(5)     It is the policy of the State to provide an environment for all
        Californians free from noise that jeopardizes their health or
        welfare.
To implement this policy, Section 65302(f) of the California Govern-
ment Code requires each city to have a Noise Element as part of its
General Plan. The Government Code states that the Noise Element
should be prepared according to guidelines established by the State
Department of Health Services, Office of Noise Control.
                                                                                     DE CE MBE R 2005             8 .7

                                             Noise contours shall be shown for all of these sources and stated in
                                             terms of community noise equivalent level (CNEL) or day-night aver-
                                             age level (Ldn). The noise contours shall be prepared on the basis of
                                             noise monitoring or following generally accepted noise modeling tech-
                                             niques for the various sources identified in paragraphs (1) to (6), inclu-
                                             sive.
                                             The noise contours shall be used as a guide for establishing a pattern
                                             of land uses in the land use element that minimizes the exposure of
                                             community residents to excessive noise.
                                             The noise element shall include implementation measures and possible
                                             solutions that address existing and foreseeable noise problems, if any.
                                             The adopted noise element shall serve as a guideline for compliance
                                             with the state's noise insulation standards.

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                     Final Housing Element, November, 2009
SECTION 1.0
INTRODUCTION TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
Recognizing the importance of providing adequate housing in all communities, the State of
California has mandated a Housing Element within every General Plan since 1969. Article
10.6, Section 65580 – 65589.8, Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code sets
forth the legal requirements of the Housing Element and encourages the provision of
affordable and decent housing in all communities to meet statewide goals. Specifically,
Section 65580 states the element shall consist of "… an identification and analysis of existing
and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial
resources and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing."
The element must also contain a five-year housing plan with quantified objectives for the
implementation of the goals and objectives of the Housing Element. The contents of the
element must be consistent with the other elements of the General Plan.
Meeting the housing needs established by the State of California is an important goal for the
City of Hollister. As the population of the State continues to grow and scarce resources
decline, it becomes more difficult for local agencies to create adequate housing
opportunities while maintaining a high standard of living for all citizens in the community.
This Housing Element (2009-2014) was created in compliance with State General Plan law
pertaining to Housing Elements and was reviewed by the Hollister Planning Commission
on April 2, and is scheduled for review by the Hollister City Council on April 20, 2009.
1.1     PURPOSE
The State of California has declared that “the availability of housing is of vital statewide
importance and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for
every California family is a priority of the highest order.” In addition, government and the
private sector should cooperate to provide a diversity of housing opportunity and
accommodate regional housing needs. At the same time, housing policy must
recognize economic, environmental and fiscal factors and community goals within the
general plan.
        Further, State Housing Element law requires “An assessment of housing needs and
        an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs.” The
        law requires:
              An analysis of population and employment trends
              An analysis of the City’s fair share of the regional housing needs
              An analysis of household characteristics
              An inventory of suitable land for residential development

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                Final Housing Element, November, 2009
             An analysis of the governmental and non-governmental constraints on the
              improvement, maintenance and development of housing
             An analysis of special housing needs
             An analysis of opportunities for energy conservation
             An analysis of publicly-assisted housing developments that may convert
              to non-assisted housing developments
The purpose of these requirements is to develop an understanding of the existing and
projected housing needs within the community and to set forth policies and schedules
which promote preservation, improvement and development of diverse types and costs
of housing throughout Hollister.
1.2     ORGANIZATION
Hollister’s Housing Element is organized into four primary sections:
Review of the Previous Housing Element: This section includes an evaluation of the
effectiveness and progress of the implementation of the 2003 Hollister Housing
Element, as well as an examination of the appropriateness of housing goals.
Summary of Existing Conditions:          This section includes current demographic
information, an inventory of resources, housing cost and affordability, at-risk units,
suitable land for development, and a section discussing constraints, efforts and
opportunities.
Housing Needs, Issues/Trends: This section includes a discussion of State issues and
policies, regional housing policies, Hollister’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment
(RHNA), and current housing issues.
Housing Program: This section identifies housing goals, policies and objectives.
Funding sources are identified and schedules for implementation are set forth. In
addition, a quantified objectives summary is provided.
1.3     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
State Law requires that “…the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an
integrated, internally consistent, and compatible statement of policies….” The purpose
of requiring internal consistency is to avoid policy conflict and provide a clear policy
guide for the future maintenance, improvement and development of housing within the
City.
This Housing Element is part of a comprehensive Hollister General Plan. The plan was
adopted in 2005. All elements of the Hollister General Plan have been reviewed for

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                  Final Housing Element, November, 2009
consistency and the Housing Element was prepared to assure compatibility with the
remaining elements. The City will annually review the housing element for consistency
with the general plan as part of its general plan progress report.
1.4     CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
In the past, the City of Hollister has made diligent efforts to solicit public participation
pertaining to the development of the 2003-2008 General Plan, and subsequent revisions,
specific plan developments, and development ordinances. These processes included
workshops, public review and citizen meetings. Meetings are held at various times to
ensure that all members of the community have access to the participation process.
Public participation for the current 2009-2014 Housing Element included several types
of public outreach. The City of Hollister partnered with San Benito County for outreach
efforts with social service organizations and community groups. City staff and San
Benito County staff attended meetings between July and September of 2008 of
organizations that serve special housing needs groups, provide jobs or represent
community business interests. Commissioners and Council persons also served in a
capacity as a liaison for the meetings. The City and County met with the following
organizations on the following dates:

In addition to the above outreach efforts, the City also participated as an invited guest
at the Senior Lunch program at Hollister Community Center and provided bi-lingual
translation.
Further, a bi-lingual rental housing survey was prepared to determine the specialized
or underserved housing needs in the community; surveys were conducted at some

apartment complexes and were made available at the Building Departments, a local
property rental company, the library, at the Community Food Bank distribution days
and at the Health and Human Service Agencies.
The City of Hollister and San Benito County collaborated to host a housing needs
workshop on October 25, 2009; bi-lingual translation was available. Decision-makers as
well as representatives from a variety of interest groups attended. The workshop
included a summary of issues identified from outreach efforts with community groups
and social service organization. Input received from workshop participants was
recorded and the suggested solutions were identified. A complete summary of the
topics, issues and recommended solutions that came out of the workshop is contained
in a table included as Appendix A. The City has made an effort to incorporate all
feedback from the workshop and other sources into the Draft Housing Element.
All workshops were open to the public. As noted above, the City Council held a public
hearing on November 3, 2008, to receive input on the Housing Element update. The
City Council and Planning Commission held a joint study session on March 16, 2009 to
review the draft element. Members of the community were invited to address concerns
and give input on the contents of the Housing Element. Notices were posted in the
local newspaper, at the City Hall, the community center, on the City’s web site, the post
office, at the public schools, and in the Hollister library. A Public Review Draft, will be
prepared and made available to the community for a 60-day review period by
approximately April 20. Copies of the draft will be made available in public facilities
such as the City Hall, the library, the community center, the Development Services
Department, and the chamber of commerce. Service providers and individuals
representing all economic segments of the population will be notified of the availability
of a draft for review.
The City has maintained an effort to involve the public throughout the housing element
process by consistently and conscientiously reaching out to members of the public
throughout the process (as indicated above). All potentially affected agencies will be
contacted by direct mailing (at minimum) prior to subsequent hearings and meetings
held by the City in reviewing and ultimately adopting the final housing element.
Staff continues to consider all comments received by the public from all sources; any
specific concerns related to development standards or any other City policy or approval
process have been and will continue to be thoroughly considered by staff in assembling
the final draft of the housing element. Where appropriate, comments have been
incorporated into the document. As this is a living document, the City will remain open
to dialogue with all members of the public, as well as public and private agencies, after
the document is adopted by the City Council and certified by the State of California.

1.5     REVIEW OF PREVIOUS ELEMENT
State law requires the City of Hollister to review its Housing Element in order to evaluate:
                   a. “The effectiveness of the previous Housing Element in attainment
                      of the community’s housing goals and objectives.”                      The
                      effectiveness of the Housing Element should be quantified where
                      possible and qualitative where necessary.
                   b. “The progress of the City and/or County, in implementation of the
                      Housing Element.” An analysis should be performed to determine
                      where the previous Housing Element met, exceeded, or fell short of
                      what was anticipated.
                   c. “The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives and policies
                      in contributing to the attainment of the state housing goal.”
                      Describe how goals, objectives, and policies are being changed or
                      adjusted as necessary.
         The remainder of this section fulfills this State requirement.
               1.5.a. EFFECTIVENESS OF PREVIOUS ELEMENT
               The State’s housing goal is met by an assignment of gross allocations of
               housing unit goals to regional governments, which in turn allocate the
               housing unit goals to counties and cities. The document produced by
               regional governments that allocates housing unit goals is referred to as the
               “Regional Housing Needs Assessment” (RHNA). The last funded RHNA
               for San Benito County was prepared in 2001 from the Council of San Benito
               County of Governments, which covered the period January 1, 2001 to June 30,
               2009. The 2009-2014 RHNA is discussed in Section 2.2-New Construction
               Needs.
               The effectiveness of the City of Hollister’s Housing Programs in meeting
               regional housing needs can be measured by the level of achievement in
               constructing new housing units. Many uncontrollable factors influenced the
               City’s effectiveness. The primary determinant was the City’s inability to
               construct or approve new residential units because of a lack of sewerage
               capacity between October of 2002 and December of 2008. Early in the prior
               RHNA period (2000, 2001 and 2002), approximately 600 single family units
               were built in the City. However, prior to the sewer moratorium, the City was

                  able to approve allocations for construction of 1200 new housing units from
                  prior growth management programs and a development agreement. Nearly
                  19 percent will be made affordable to lower income households. In 2008 the
                  City issued building permits for 15 single family homes out of the previously
                  approved 1,200 units.

                  Due to the City’s inability to provide sewer service to additional urban
                  development, the 2003-2008 Housing Element was a period of virtually no
                  growth.
                  While the City has worked to facilitate additional development of low and
                  very low-income housing, due to the previously aforementioned factors, and
                  other elements beyond the City’s control, the City did not meet the RHNA
                  affordable housing goals for the prior period.                The City achieved
                  approximately 18.8 percent of the RHNA goals for extremely low, very low,
                  and low income households. The City implemented its affordable housing
                  strategy as outlined in the 2003-2008 Housing Element, and concentrated
                  much effort on preparing to emerge from the moratorium well positioned for
                  the pent up demand for growth. The City has retained the minimum number
                  of housing choice vouchers and several multi-family complexes have
                  maintained their affordability, and the Redevelopment Agency has continued
                  to work with property owners towards rehabilitation and increasing
                  opportunities for first-time homebuyers. The City also accomplished many of
                  its goals, by adopting a new Zoning Ordinance and Growth Management
                  rating scale to implement the General Plan, setting the stage for mixed-use
                  and other types of innovative development, by passing a “Second Unit
                  Amnesty” program, and by adopting several housing related policies.

                 1.5.c. APPROPRIATENESS OF GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND
                POLICIES
                The City of Hollister has made progress in effectively carrying out
                programs and policies of the last Housing Element, including addressing
                the provision of housing for all income segments of the population. A
                significant portion of this success is measured by the City’s adoption of a
                revised Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map. The City has also adopted a
                Growth Management rating scale. Some of the goals were not met due to
                market forces and the City’s restricted ability to approve units due to a
                sewer treatment moratorium. The appropriateness of the goals has not
                been diminished however.
                The City is addressing these issues and is in the process of reviewing and
                reassessing the City’s housing needs, preparing development standards,
                and implementing programs utilizing CDBG and Redevelopment Agency
                funds that target the homeless population and other special needs
                segments of the population.
                The City of Hollister has identified goals and implementation programs to
                provide for affordable housing programs in order to create more
                opportunities for multifamily dwellings and to address fair housing
                needs. Many issues identified in the previous Housing Element have been
                addressed, so the City will be positioned to manage future growth.
                However, several areas of concern have been identified and will be
                addressed in the “Policy and Programs” section, as well as discussed
                throughout this document.

       1.6 COMMUNITY PROFILE
       There are two cities in San Benito County, Hollister and San Juan Bautista. The City
       of Hollister is the County Seat and population center in San Benito County, with 64.1
       percent of the county population. San Benito County is situated in the Central Coast
       region of California, about 100 miles southeast of San Francisco, 40 miles east of
       Monterey and 300 miles north of Los Angeles. While agriculture continues to be the
       predominant economic activity in the county, development pressure is changing the
       rural character of the area, leading to a decreasing amount of land devoted to
       agricultural activities and more land being subject to urban development. The
       community’s attitude continues to change toward development. Hollister continues
       to operate under a growth control cap, adopted in 2002 as a ballot measure, to
       manage and more actively direct growth in the City.
       Hollister is a general law City that operates under the Council/Manager form of
       government. City departments include: Finance, Development Services, Airport,
       Animal Control, Traffic, Engineering, Community Services, Fire Department, Police
       Department, Recreation Department, and Human Resources. According to the
       California Department of Finance, the City has an estimated population of 37,051, as
       of 2008.
       Portions of Hollister are located within the boundary of the City of Hollister
       Redevelopment Agency. Most of the existing and developable residential lands are
       within the boundaries of the Redevelopment Project Area (see Exhibit 3).

SECTION 2.0
EXISTING CONDITIONS AND DEMOGRAPHIC DATA
The purpose of this chapter is to summarize and analyze the existing housing conditions in the
City of Hollister. It consists of two major sections: Section 2.1 - Summary of Existing Conditions
- an analysis of population trends, employment trends, household trends and special needs
groups, and Section 2.2 – Inventory of Resources - an analysis of existing housing
characteristics, housing conditions, vacancy trends, housing costs and availability, “at-risk
housing” and suitable lands for future development.
2.1     SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
 In order to assess the present and future housing needs of the City of Hollister, it is important
 to analyze demographic variables, such as population, employment, and households. This
 section utilizes sources, such as the 1980, 1990, and 2000 U.S. Census, State Department of
 Finance (Demographic Research Unit), the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments
 (AMBAG) and AnySite, a demographic data provider. See Appendix B for a complete list of
 data sources.
 Between 1990 and 2000 Hollister’s population increased by nearly 80.0 percent, from 19,212
 residents in 1990 to 34,314 in 2000, at an annualized growth rate of 6.0 percent. During that
 same time period, the number of housing units increased by nearly 60 percent. Much of the
 increase in the population can be attributed to an influx of people moving from surrounding
 counties, particularly Santa Clara County, where housing prices and median income are
 significantly higher.
 Hollister experienced a housing boom in the 1990s that resulted in a significant amount of new
 single family development. About 80.0 percent of all the homes in Hollister are single family
 houses.
        2.1.a. POPULATION TRENDS
        The City of Hollister is part of the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments
        (AMBAG) for Regional Planning issues, including population and employment
        forecasts. AMBAG is comprised of 17 cities and the unincorporated areas of four
        Counties. As shown in Table 5, between 1990 and 2008, San Benito County’s population
        increased by 57.5 percent or 21,087 persons. In 2008, the County had an estimated
        population of 57,784, which represents an increase of 4,550 persons since 2000. Five
        counties surround San Benito County: Santa Clara, Fresno, Monterey, Santa Cruz, and
        Merced. Of these counties, San Benito County is the fifth most populated, but was the
        fastest growing county between 1990 and 2008. Only two incorporated cities are located
        in San Benito County, Hollister and San Juan Bautista

         The City of Hollister is first in population growth among cities in this four county
         region. Between 1990 and 2008, Hollister’s population increased by 92.8 percent growth
         rate, as shown in Table 6. This increase can be attributed to the increasing demand for
         housing due to the shortage of housing in the Bay Area, the lack of affordable housing in
         the Bay Area and the willingness of commuters to move further from their place of
         employment, (see Table 12, Employment by Commuting Patterns).

        Over the last two decades there has been an influx of people moving from outside
        areas into Hollister. Much of the increase in population came from Santa Clara
        County, where housing prices and median income are significantly higher. As a
        result, a dramatic change in commuting patterns has occurred. In 2000, over half of
        all Hollister residents were commuting to areas outside of San Benito County for
        employment. Since 1990, the number of workers living in San Benito County, and
        commuting to Santa Clara County, has increased over 114 percent, according to the
        Metropolitan Transportation Commission.
        According to the 1990 Census 65.2 percent of those living in the County of San
        Benito worked there as well, as shown in Table 12. This number decreased in 2000
        to 50.3 percent. In addition, the proportion of persons commuting over 45 minutes
        to work increased by 14.2 percent.

        2.1.c.    HOUSEHOLD TRENDS
        The change in the number of households in a city is one of the prime determinants of
        the demand for housing. Households can form even in periods of static population
        growth as adult children leave home, through divorce, and with the aging of the
        population.
        The number of persons per household is an important indicator of the relationship
        between population growth and household formation. For example, if the number
        of persons per household is decreasing with steady population growth, then
        households are forming at a faster rate than population growth. Conversely, if
        population were growing faster than households, then the persons per household
        would increase.

        Between 1990 and 2008, persons per household fluctuated for the City of Hollister
        and San Benito County. Specifically, the City of Hollister rose from 3.2 persons per
        household to 3.52 persons per household, in 2000 and has then risen to 3.6 in 2008.
        The number of households in San Benito County increased by 39.1 percent between

        same time period. According to the 1990 Census, 11,419 households resided in the
        County. By 2000, an estimated 15,880 households lived in the County. San Benito
        County households are projected to continue increasing over the period of 2008-2013
        by approximately 1.3 percent annually. Between 1990 and 2000, the City of Hollister
        increased by 3,228 households or 49.9 percent, a total of 9,694 households. The City

         Household size is also an important factor in determining the size of housing units
         needed within a jurisdiction. In the City of Hollister, “large” households containing
         five or more persons represented 25.7 percent of all households in 2000, about 10.9
         percent less than the “small” households with one or two persons. Households with
         one person represented the fastest growing household size between 2000 and 2008,
         increasing from 13.0 percent in 2000 to 18.7 percent in 2008. However, 54.0 percent
         of the households contained 3 or more persons, increasing to 56.1 percent in 2013.

         Tenure, or the ratio between homeowner and renter households, can be affected by
         many factors, such as: housing cost (interest rates, economics, land supply, and
         development constraints), housing type, housing availability, job availability, and
         consumer preference.

        During the period 1990 to 2000, the proportion of renter households decreased from
        44.7 percent of the households to 33.6 percent in the City of Hollister. The
        percentage of renter households further deceased to 30.8 percent in 2008. This
        decrease in the percentage of renter households can be attributed to the growth of
        single-family homes built over the last 10 years (see Table 15).
        In comparison, San Benito County has a slightly lower proportion of renter
        households. For example, in 2008, 30.8 percent of the Hollister households were
        renters, while 29.8 percent of the San Benito County households were renters, a
        difference of 1.0 percent.

       According to the 2000 Census, the County of San Benito median household income
       was higher than most of the surrounding counties, with the exception of Santa Clara
       County. . All counties showed an increase in the median income between 1990 and
       2000. The median income in San Benito and Santa Clara Counties increased by more
       than $20,000. This reflects the increased population of commuters from the Bay
       Area, which has a higher median income.

As shown in Table 17, the block groups that saw a significant increase in housing units, 100
or more, had a higher median income. This trend reflects the influx of higher paid
commuters from the Bay Area increasing the number of housing units built.

        The Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) estimates area
        median incomes (AMI) for all counties in the State annually. In turn, this AMI is
        utilized in many housing programs, such as CDBG, HOME and LIHTC. Of
        particular note, the 2008 San Benito County AMI was $78,000.
        In addition to estimated annual income, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
        Development HUD has established standard income groups. They are defined as:
        (1) Extremely Low, which are households earning less than 30 percent of AMI; (2)
        Very Low Income, which are households earning between 30 and 50 percent of the
        AMI; (3) Low Income, for households earning between 50 percent and 80 percent of
        the AMI; (4) Moderate Income, for households earning between 80 percent and 120
        percent of the AMI, and (5) Above Moderate Income are households earning over
        120 percent of the AMI. Generally, these categories are used to determine household
        eligibility for federal, and local programs.

         Based on the 2008 San Benito County AMI and household income tables, the
         proportion of households in the Extremely Low, Very Low and Low Income groups
         is less than those in the Moderate and Above Moderate categories. For example,
         approximately 44.8 percent of Hollister households make less than 80 percent of the
         State designated San Benito County Area Median Income, which translates to 5,143
         households. In comparison, 55.2 percent of households are in the Moderate and
         Above Moderate categories.

         2.1.d. OVERPAYMENT
         Overpayment is an important measure of the affordability of housing within a
         city. Overpayment for housing is based on the total cost of shelter compared to a
         household’s ability to pay. Specifically, overpayment is defined as a household
         paying more than 30 percent of their gross household income for shelter.
         According to the US Census, shelter cost is the monthly owner costs (mortgages,
         deeds of trust, contracts to purchase or similar debts on the property, taxes, and
         insurance) or the gross rent (contract rent plus the estimated average monthly
         cost of utilities).
         In 2000, a total of 3,490, or 37.9 percent, of all households in the City of Hollister
         pay in excess of 30 percent of their income for shelter (See Table 20). Of these 874
         families pay 30 to 34 percent of their household income for rent. Households
         paying in excess of 35 percent of their income for housing comprise 1,592 of total
         owner-occupied units and are primarily concentrated in the moderate to above
         moderate income ranges. The majority of renter households paying in excess of
         35.0 percent of their income had incomes below $35,000.
         The percentage of owners versus renters overpaying was disproportionate,
         representing 36.0 percent owner and 41.0 percent renter households. The
         overpayment situation is particularly critical for renters with annual incomes less
         than $20,000.

        Of all owner occupied households with incomes below 80.0 percent MFI within
        the City, 285 (16.4 percent) are considered to be in the extremely-low income
        category and for 60.4 percent of those households, the cost of housing is greater
        than half of the net household income. Similarly, of all renter occupied
        households within the City, 586 (27.6 percent) are considered to be in the
        extremely-low income category and for 57.7 percent of those households; the cost
        of housing is greater than half of the net household income. As indicated in Table
        21 as household income increases, the cost burden also decreases, indicating that
        the City does not have sufficient low income housing to support residents in the
        very low and extremely low income ranges.

         2.1.f. SPECIAL NEEDS
         As noted in Government Code Section 65583 (a)(6), within the overall housing
         needs assessments there are segments of the population that require special
         consideration. These are generally people who are low income and have less
         access to housing choices. These special housing needs groups include the
         elderly, disabled, female/single parent households, large families, farmworkers,
         and homeless. Housing opportunities for each of these segments of the
         population is important; various special needs housing types include multi-
         family rental housing, housing for agricultural workers, emergency (homeless)
         shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, single-room occupancy
         (SRO’s), and mobile homes/factory built housing. A discussion of the
         availability of each type of special needs housing is included below.
                 2.1.f (1) Elderly
                 Many elderly households live in housing that costs too much or live in
                 housing that does not accommodate specific needs for assistance. Due to

                various circumstances, an elderly household may have difficulties staying in
                their home community or near family. The purpose of this section is to
                determine the housing needs for all characteristics of the elderly community,
                defined as persons over the age of 65 years.
                As the population of seniors in the City increases, so do their collective needs.
                Traditionally, the senior population has only represented a small proportion
                of the overall population of the City. Table 23 below indicates that in 1990,
                there were 1,930 seniors in Hollister, which represented 9.0 percent of the
                total population in the City. Between 1990 and 2000, the senior population
                increased by 17.5 percent annually. By 2008, the senior population had
                increased by 30.1 percent to 2,950. By 2013, the senior population is estimated
                to reach 3,377 persons, which equates to 9.0 percent of the total population.

                Senior households comprise a moderate proportion of the total households
                within the City of Hollister (see Table 24). In the 2000 Census there were an
                estimated 1,338 senior households in the City, constituting 13.8 percent of the
                total City households. Comparatively, 15.5 percent of the City’s households
                were seniors in 1990. Currently, there are an estimated 1,507 senior
                households estimated in the City of Hollister, with the number of seniors
                projected to increase to 1,908 by 2013. Many seniors have special housing
                needs, such as the need for smaller and more efficient housing. Typical
                housing to meet the needs of seniors includes smaller homes and second
                units for independent living as well as assisted living facilities and nursing
                homes. As more and more baby boomers enter their senior years, the need
                for senior housing will continue to increase in Hollister.

                In 1990, 27.0 percent of the senior households in Hollister were renters.
                Change in the proportion of senior renters is dependent on the quantity of
                housing options and the propensity to convert from ownership. In 2000,
                the proportion of the City’s senior renters actually decreased by 1.6
                percent to 25.4 percent.          This demonstrates a slight increase in
                homeownership rates among seniors.

                 Eligibility for federal programs is based on the median income of the county
                 or statistical area in which the project or program is located. In this case,
                 eligibility is based on the 2008 area median income for San Benito County of
                 $62,400 for a two-person household (see Table 26). Using that as the basis,
                 11.2 percent of senior households in the City of Hollister are considered
                 above moderate income, 15.3 moderate income, and 73.5 percent are in the

               Three types of disabled persons are considered as having special housing
               needs: Physically, Mentally, and Developmentally Disabled. Each type is
               unique and requires specific attention in terms of access to housing,
               employment, social services, medical services and accessibility within
               housing.
               In 2000, a total of 8,936 persons in the City had some type of disability. Of
               these, 81.9 percent or 7,322 persons were between the ages of five (5) and 64
               and the remaining 1,614 were 65 years of age or older.

                Large households often have lower incomes, which frequently results in
                overcrowding in smaller dwelling units and in the acceleration of unit
                deterioration. According to the 2000 Census, there were 2,565 large
                households in the City and 6,182 housing units of three or more bedrooms.
                This would indicate a more than adequate number of larger housing units

                2.1.f (4) Farmworkers
                Generally, farmworker population contains two segments of farmworkers:
                permanent and migratory (seasonal); Hollister is no different. Varying
                employment estimation techniques result in diverse estimates of local
                agricultural employment. Nonetheless, a range of estimates of farmworkers
                in the State can be derived. By applying assumptions derived from surveys
                specifically targeted to farmworkers, an aggregate population (both workers
                and households) can be estimated. These estimates indicate that average
                annual employment of farmworkers in California is about 350,000, with peak
                period employment of about 450,000 within the State. This employment
                demand is filled by between 650,000 and 850,000 farmworkers within the
                State. Total population (including family members) associated with these
                workers is between 900,000 and 1.35 million persons.
                According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture, San Benito County contains a
                total of 625 farms on 579,851 acres, which is an increase in acreage over the
                677 farms and 578,351 acres from the 2002 Census. Approximately, 56.9
                percent of the farms are between one and forty-nine acres in size and 43.1
                percent are more than 50 acres. About 36.5 percent of the farms (228 farms)
                hired farm labor for a total of 2,945 workers, however, 66.2 percent of the
                farm laborers worked less than 150 days.

               There is limited agriculture within the City, however a significant number of
               farmworkers still live in Hollister that work in San Benito County. Farm
               workers earn some of the lowest wages relative to other workers and
               typically live below the poverty line.          Many farm workers live in
               overcrowded housing conditions in Hollister, and some live in substandard
               and illegal units. While some farm workers are migrant workers in need of
               temporary housing, many are permanent residents; therefore, a need exists
               for more transitory housing as well as low-cost housing for year-round
               workers. Farm worker housing is permitted in the Residential Estate zoning
               district. Currently, farm worker housing requirements are not specifically
               addressed or identified in the Zoning Ordinance, Title 17. In order that the
               City comply with the requirements of Health and Safety Code Sections,
               17021.5 and 17021.6, a program has been included (see Program H.R) in this
               Housing Element to amend the Zoning Ordinance to permit farm worker
               housing as a permitted use not subject to any conditional approval, and to be
               considered in the same manner as other agricultural uses in the same zone. It
               should be noted that farmland under cultivation in the City is located in the
               airport industrial zoning districts. Much of this land is within the Airport
               Influence Area of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the Hollister
               Municipal Airport where any residential development is discouraged.
               According to AnySite, 616 persons were employed in the farming, fishing
               and forestry occupations in the City of Hollister in 2008, which is an increase
               of 59 persons since the 2000 Census.

               2.1.f (5) Single-parent Households
               Single-parent households have special housing needs such as reasonable day
               care, health care, and affordable housing. The most significant portion of this
               group is the female-headed household. Female-headed households with
               children often have lower incomes, limiting their access to available housing.
               Many housing experts believe these households are especially at risk of
               housing cost burden or homelessness.

              2.1.f (6) Homeless Persons (Persons in Need of Emergency Shelter)
              Homelessness continues as a regional and national issue, and also continues
              to be a concern locally. There are generally two types of homeless - the
              "permanent homeless," who are the transient and most visible homeless
              population, and the "temporary homeless," who are homeless usually due to
              eviction and may stay with friends, family, or in a shelter or motel until they
              can find a permanent residence.
              Generally, factors contributing to the rise in homelessness include a lack of
              housing affordable to lower income persons, increases in the number of
              persons whose incomes fall below the poverty level, reductions in public
              subsidies to the poor, alcohol and substance abuses, and the de-
              institutionalization of the mentally ill. Homeless people, victims of abuse,
              and other individuals require housing that is being met by the traditional
              housing stock. These people require temporary housing and assistance at
              little or no cost to the recipient.
              Due to their transient nature in Hollister as elsewhere, it is difficult to count
              the number of homeless; however, according to the Homeless Task Force of
              San Benito County in February 2009, there are approximately 100 homeless
              adults (over 18) in the City.        Seasonal farmworker and day-laborer
              populations are most appropriately classified as part of the temporary
              homeless population. The San Benito County Homeless Task Force operates
              winter only shelter services (with a capacity of 25 beds) and food bank
              services. Other homeless service providers in the community include the
              Salvation Army (food bank and clothes closet), the Community Pantry (food
              bank), and Fishes and Loaves (food program).
              Special Needs Resources/Emergency Shelters/Single Room Occupancy
              (SRO) Units
              Residential occupancy or single room occupancy (SRO) hotels can be an
              important component of the special needs housing picture. SRO’s can
              provide low cost housing for those in the extremely low and very low income
              categories, and can also play a role in the transitioning process from
              homelessness to more permanent housing.
              The City’s current zoning ordinance Section 17.22.120 allows homeless
              shelters by right in the North Gateway zoning district. Bus service is
              available to locations within the North Gateway district on San Felipe Road.
              The North Gateway district is also the closest non-industrial district in
              proximity to the umbrella of support services at the San Benito County
              Health and Human Services Agency, located at 1111 San Felipe Road, but is
              also within walking distance of the courts, library, and annex to the local

              for a shelter, totaling over 12 acres, all located within the North Gateway
              district.    Sites include vacant parcels, and existing non-conforming
              residences, apartments and/or motels that are prime candidates for adaptive
              reuse projects.
              The City’s current zoning ordinance allows SRO units. Emergency shelters
              are not defined in specific zones. Residential occupancy or single room
              occupancy (SRO) hotels can be an important component of the special needs
              housing picture. SRO’s can provide low cost housing for those in the
              extremely low and very low income categories, and can also play a role in the
              transitioning process from homelessness to more permanent housing. The
              City’s current zoning ordinance does not allow emergency shelters by right,
              SRO units are permitted with a Conditional Use Permit in the Downtown
              Mixed Use (DMU) district. The City shall continue to encourage the
              development of SRO’s through identification of potential locations and
              through City assistance with grant writing for their development. Please see
              the Policies and Programs chapter found at the end of this element for the full
              program definition.
              San Benito County generally provides the majority of the services for the
              homeless. The primary method of providing emergency shelter to homeless
              individuals and families in San Benito County is motel voucher programs,
              dispersed through various divisions of San Benito County Health and
              Human Services (HHS), and through several community-based
              organizations.
              San Benito County Community Services and Workforce Development
              provide a temporary, emergency shelter during winter months for homeless
              families. The County uses vacant cabins at the Migrant Housing Center. The
              shelter operates from December through March. Space is limited.
              Although the City does not have the population of homeless persons to
              support a full-time shelter, church-based organizations, and the Salvation
              Army do provide some homeless services such as referrals, meals to low-
              income residents and a clothing closet.
              Special Needs Resources/Transitional and Supportive Housing
              Transitional Housing is defined as interim housing helping families move
              from homelessness to self-sufficiency by providing short-term housing
              (usually two years) at extremely low rent to qualified families; assistive
              services for life skills may be an inclusive part of the housing. Supportive
              Housing has no limit on the length of stay, and typically offers a wider array and
              more intensive services to individuals transitioning from homelessness, including
              counseling, case management, health treatment, in addition to life skills.

3.   HOUSING ELEMENT                                  Final Housing Element, November, 2009
              As per Section 17.22.120 of the Hollister Zoning Ordinance, Transitional
              Housing facilities are included under the definition for Homeless Shelters,
              and are identified as Small or Large Temporary Residential Shelters (LTRS or
              STRS). Supportive Housing is not identified. Large and Small Temporary
              Residential Shelters are permitted in the North Gateway (NG) zoning district
              provided that each establishment meets specified objective location and
              operational standards. A use permit is required for homeless shelter or
              transitional facilities in residential, mixed use, or commercial districts.
              Program H.D. of this Housing Element requires a Zoning Ordinance
              amendment to clarify that Transitional and Supportive Housing shall be
              treated as residential uses of property subject to the same requirements as
              other residences in the same district. In order to comply with SB2, the words
              “by right” shall be added to the code section clearly indicating homeless
              shelters are allowed by right in the North Gateway, district without any
              discretionary approval.
              San Benito County Community Services and Workforce Development
              operate a six-month transitional homeless shelter, in Hollister, in conjunction
              with Community Services Development Corporation. The transitional shelter
              program works with families who are homeless and seek to secure
              permanent housing. The program provides services for parents to seek and
              maintain employment or to gain the skills necessary for obtaining
              employment. The program emphasizes the parents developing the financial
              resources to obtain permanent housing to move into after completion of the
              program. Assistance is provided in locating and securing permanent
              housing.
              San Benito County Supportive Housing is defined as housing with no limit
              on length of stay. The current Zoning Ordinance does not mention
              transitional housing by right or with a Conditional Use Permit. However,
              Program H.D. will amend the zoning to permit transitional and supportive
              housing, subject to only those regulations governing other types of housing,
              whether single-family or multifamily.
              Manufactured Housing and Mobile Homes
              Manufactured housing and mobile homes provide a viable housing
              alternative to segments of the population. State law states that any site that
              can be developed for site-built housing must also be available for the
              development of manufactured housing and mobile homes. GC Section
              65852.3 requires that cities allow installation of certified manufactured homes
              on foundation systems, as per GC Sect. 65852.3, on lots zoned for
              conventional single family residences. This section and GC Section 65852.4
              require that manufactured homes be subject to the same land use regulation
              as conventional homes. GC Section 65852.7 deems mobile home parks to be a

              According to the US Census, there were 307 mobile homes in Hollister in
              2000. Section 17.22.150 of Hollister’s zoning code currently limits mobile
              homes and manufactured housing to approved locations within established
              mobile home parks. Mobile homes and manufactured housing are not
              expressly permitted as a use by right in single family districts. As part of this
              Housing Element, and in adopted to implement the General Plan, a Zoning
              Ordinance amendment will be done establish mobile and manufactured
              homes on foundations as permitted uses in the R1 Single Family Residence
              District and the RA Residence Agricultural District subject to other applicable
              zoning and development standards in the same fashion as a single family use.
       2.1.g. OVERCROWDING
              An overcrowded unit is defined by the Census as having 1.01 persons or
              more per room, excluding kitchens and bathrooms. A severely overcrowded
              unit has 1.5 or more persons per room. Generally, a room is defined as a
              living room, dining room, bedroom, or finished recreation room.
              While family size and tenure are critical determinants in overcrowding,
              household income also plays a strong role in the incidence of overcrowding.
              As a general rule, overcrowding levels tend to decrease as income rises,
              especially for renters. The rate of overcrowding for lower income households
              is generally nearly three times greater than households over 95 percent of the
              area median income. As with renters, owner households with higher incomes
              have lower rates of overcrowding.
              Between 1980 and 1990, the percentage of overcrowded households in
              California nearly doubled from 6.9 percent to 12.3 percent. Census 2000
              reports more than 15 percent of California households were overcrowded
              with overcrowding most common among low-income households, and most
              prevalent in renter housing. Roughly 24 percent of renter households
              statewide were overcrowded; in some counties, nearly a third of renter
              households were overcrowded. One quarter of all overcrowded renter
              households contained more than one family. Of all owner and renter
              overcrowded households, estimates are that 8.9 percent are severely
              overcrowded (more than 1.5 persons per room). As indicated in Table 35, 7.0
              percent of owner-occupied households and 12.7 percent of renter-occupied
              units are considered to be severely overcrowded. Of all units, 17.4% are
              considered to be overcrowded, 27.1% of renter-occupied households are
              overcrowded, and 12.4% of owner-occupied households are overcrowded.

SECTION 2.2.a
INVENTORY OF RESOURCES
2.2.a. EXISTING HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
The City of Hollister has grown significantly in the last 18 years, increasing by over 92 percent.
In 1990, Hollister had 6,222 dwelling units and by 2000 there were 9,928 dwelling units, an
approximately 59.9 percent increase. In 2008 there were 10,584 housing units, an approximately
6.3 percent increase from 2000. Overall, in the past 18 years the City has increased its housing
stock 70.1 percent.
The market for housing in the City of Hollister has been restricted during the past 5 and one-
half years as a result of the wastewater treatment related moratorium on growth and
development. Prior to that, the City experienced a significant amount of single family home
building; approximately 75% of homes in Hollister are single family dwellings. This in turn has
created a need for alternative housing types in the City, including apartments, condominiums
and other types of residences, available to all income groups. Other patterns of growth have
continued to affect the City as well, including the influx of people moving from other regions to
locate in Hollister.

2.2.b. HOUSING CONDITIONS
During the summer and fall of 2008, the City of Hollister, Department of Development Services
utilized in-house staff to gather primary data and tabulate the information regarding the
condition of housing units in the City. Areas of the City, for purposes of establishing general
conditions, were analyzed according to Census Tracts and Block Groups.

        Results of the survey can be seen in Table 37 below. Of the 9,012 units surveyed by the City,
        7,313 units (81.1 percent) are in sound condition. However, approximately 1,693 units (18.8
        percent) of Hollister’s housing stock are deemed to be in need of some form of rehabilitation.
        The need for rehabilitation exists if the condition is classified as Minor, Moderate or Substantial.
        The city has approximately 1,502 units (16.7 percent) in need of minor repairs, 186 units (2.0
        percent) in need of moderate repairs and 5 units (0.1 percent) in need of substantial repairs. As
        many as 6 units are considered Dilapidated and should be considered for demolishing. With
        approximately 11 units in need of either substantial rehabilitation or deemed dilapidated, the
        City may have a need to place further emphasis on a residential rehabilitation program.

Generally, housing conditions can be described by the age of the units, exempting diligent
maintenance. Since building codes change with time and technology, the older housing units
are the most likely to be considered substandard or in marginal condition. Approximately 16.2
percent of the housing stock in the City of Hollister was built before 1960. An additional 8.7
percent was built between 1960 and 1969, while more recently, 6.1 percent of the housing units
were built between 2000 and 2008.

2.2.c. RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION TRENDS
From 2000 to 2008, 663 housing units have been constructed in the City of Hollister. Of the new
units, 93.5 percent were single-family units. A total of 42 (6.5%) multi-family units have been
built since 2000.
Based on the figures in Table 38, an average of 81 building permits have been issued each year.
Depending on the market conditions, the City of Hollister, in fact, any city, will experience
changes in the total number of building permits issued over time. Going forward, an average of
610 units per year needs to be constructed in order to meet the Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA) of 3,050 for 2007-2014. The City is able to demonstrate, based on units
approved and pending construction, and based on vacant land as well as redevelopment
parcels, that they have the capacity to meet the RHNA. Section 2.2.b contains a more in-depth
discussion of the City’s sites inventory.

  2.2.d. VACANCY TRENDS
  Vacancy trends in housing are analyzed using a “vacancy rate” which establishes the relationship
  between housing supply and demand. For example, if the demand for housing is greater than the
  available supply, then the vacancy rate is low and the price of housing will most likely increase.
  Additionally, the vacancy rate indicates whether or not the City has an adequate housing supply to
  provide choice and mobility. HUD standards indicate that a vacancy rate of five percent is
  sufficient to provide choice and mobility.
  In 2000, the Census reported a vacancy rate of 2.14 percent in the City of Hollister. The
  California State Department of Finance (DOF) Population Research Unit publishes an annual
  estimate of population, housing units, vacancy, and household size for all incorporated cities in
  the State. In 2008, the DOF estimated the vacancy rate for Hollister to be 2.10 percent. It should
  be noted that the DOF estimate is for all housing unit types and does not exclude seasonal,
  recreational, occasional use or other vacant. According to the 2000 Census, 32.7 percent of the
  vacant units are rental units and 15.0 percent of the vacant units are for seasonal, recreational, or
  occasional use.
                   2.2.d (1) Multifamily Vacancy
                   In January 2008, Laurin Associates conducted a vacancy survey of existing rental
                   properties within Hollister. A total of 780 multifamily units were surveyed. The
                   survey found that there were 27 vacancies within the City of Hollister, for an
                   overall vacancy rate of 1.2 percent. Most managers reported that turnover is rare,
                   waiting lists are long, and when vacancies do occur the units are rented very
                   quickly.

               2.2.d (2) Single Family Vacancy
               According to the Multiple Listing Service, there were a total of 41 homes and
               condominiums for sale in the City of Hollister in February 2009. The estimated
               vacancy rate for single-family dwellings in 2008 was 2.1 percent, based on a total
               of 8,505 single-family units. As a rule, this vacancy rate indicates a normal
               housing market with limited choice and mobility. However, over the past year
               there have been numerous homes in some stage of foreclosure.                 The high
               number of foreclosures skews the discussion of a vacancy rate. Homes that are
               currently in foreclosure as a result of the market crisis are considered outside the
               normal discussion of residential vacancies. The analysis below provides a
               discussion of the current state of foreclosed properties.
               2.2.d (3) Foreclosure Vacancy
               According to Realtytrac.com, Hollister has approximately 883 homes that are at
               some stage of foreclosure as of March 2, 2009. The City of Hollister City
               Council has been active in addressing this problem, adopting an ordinance in
               early 2008 addressing nuisance problems associated with such foreclosures.
                      475 homes are currently bank-owned properties
                      135 homes are scheduled for trustee sale
                      6 pre-foreclosure homes are on the market for re-sale
                      267 homes are in pre-foreclosure, have received notices of default
               The City is taking an active role in addressing the foreclosure issue in Hollister.
               Section 4.0 (Program H.A) of this Housing Element includes a program
               administered by the Redevelopment Agency to help address the significant
               number of foreclosures within the City. The Hollister RDA is preparing to fund a
               program called the “Foreclosed Home Reactivation Program” to assist in
               returning foreclosed homes to occupied status. The City will continue to conduct
               public workshops providing foreclosure prevention information to property
               owners. Additionally, the City will continue to implement the Property
               Maintenance Ordinance in an attempt to prevent deterioration of neighborhoods
               with high foreclosure rates.
2.2.e. HOUSING COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
One of the major barriers to housing availability is the cost of housing. In order to provide
housing to all economic levels in the community, a wide variety of housing opportunities at
various prices should be made available. The following table describes the acceptable monthly
payment for households (family of four) in the five major income groups: Extremely-Low
Income, Very-Low, Low, Moderate and Above-Moderate.

        *NOTE: affordable housing is up to 30% of income used toward gross monthly housing costs.
In the previous program period, due to the high cost of housing in Hollister, significant
subsidies were needed to make housing affordable to low and moderate-income households.
To make projects feasible, developers must rely on a variety of federal, state, and local funding
and financing sources. All funding sources require separate reporting and data collection.
When multiple funding sources are used, as is usually necessary, additional burdens are placed
on developers with limited staffing to track the information required and report on a timely
basis.
California localities receive federal subsidies for affordable housing through a number of
programs. Like state programs, federal programs often change in terms of program details,
application procedures, and amount of subsidy dollars available. State agencies also play an
important role in providing housing assistance by allocating federal housing funds and/or
making loans available to affordable housing developments. The three principle agencies
involved are the State Treasurer’s Office, the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA), and
the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). Competition for
available funding is keen and is expected to become more intense in view of current and
projected government deficits.
Local government resources, which have played a less important role in the past supporting
housing development, now play a fairly significant role by making local developments more
competitive for federal and state financing. There is considerable competition for the program
funds that are available, and any one development will need to draw upon multiple resources
to be financially feasible. When developments are able to demonstrate a financial commitment
and contribution from local sources – especially if coupled with regulatory support through
policies such as fast-track processing, fee waivers, and/or density bonuses – they have a much
higher change of ensuring a projects’ success.
                2.2.e (1) Single-family Sales Units
                Since 2003, the median single-family home sales price ranged from a low of
                $383,000 to the 2006 high of approximately $615,000. From 2004 to 2006, home
                prices increased by approximately 50 percent. Since that time, the peak prices
                have declined by 55 percent, and are continuing to decline. Based on information
                provided by a local real estate agent prices are decreasing, and foreclosures and
                short sales are common. The current median home prices of $272,000 is 55
                percent lower than the 2006 peak, The Hollister median home price is slightly

                currently $249,000. This volatility in median sales price is due in part to the
                speculative housing demand and problematic lending standards that have
                resulted in housing problems throughout the State and nation.

               According to the 2000 Census, the median rent was $720 in the City of Hollister,
               compared to $715 for San Benito County. Based on information provided by a
               local realtor, the current average market rents range from $800 for a two-
               bedroom unit to $1,400 for a four-bedroom unit.
               The identified rental apartments in the City of Hollister are a combination of
               affordable and market rate units. There are currently four complexes providing
               affordable housing under HUD, USDA, and LIHTC programs for families, farm-
               workers, and seniors. The affordable housing complexes range in size from 19
               units to 116 units in size. Home rentals are somewhat more expensive, and range
               from $1000 to $2,100.

               2.2.e (4) Affordability
               Affordability is defined as a household spending 30 percent or less of household
               income for shelter. Shelter is defined as gross rent or gross monthly owner costs.
               Gross rent is the contract rent, plus utilities. In most cases, the contract rent
               includes payment for water, sewer and garbage. Gross monthly owner costs
               include mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, utilities, condominium fees, and
               site rent for mobile homes.

                 As noted in Table 20 in the previous section, 28.4 percent of renter households
                 pay in excess of 30 percent of their income for shelter while 26.8 percent of
                 owners overpaid in 2000. To put this in perspective, the maximum rent that can
                 be charged to be considered affordable housing based on income is reflected in
                 the following Table 39. The average rents listed in Table 38 are less than the
                 maximum affordability for low income households. Despite this trend for
                 increasing rents, Hollister has remained relatively affordable. For instance, while
                 households within the very low-income categories could not afford the average
                 market rents within the City, most market rents are affordable to those
                 households within the low-income category.

While shelter costs for rental units are estimated to be affordable at 30 percent of gross income,
households are generally able to obtain a mortgage loan based on 35 to 40 percent of gross
income. In light of the current mortgage crisis, these limits are being given renewed
consideration. This is subject to individual credit and budgeting conditions and those with less
revolving loan-type debt can usually find financing for a more expensive home. For instance,
very low-income households in Hollister could afford a home priced approximately $154,000,
depending on the interest rate (typically 6%) currently there are nine (9) home available in that
price range.
2.2.f. AT - RISK HOUSING
California Housing Element Law requires all jurisdictions to include a study of all low-income
housing units which may at some future time be lost to the affordable inventory by the
expiration of some type of affordability restrictions. The law requires that the analysis and
study cover a five-year and a ten-year period, coinciding with updates of the Housing Element.
Expiration of the low-income use period of various financing sources, such as Low-income
Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), bond financing, density bonuses, California Housing Finance
Agency (CalHFA), Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME funds and
redevelopment funds.

      2.2.g INVENTORY OF AT RISK RENTAL HOUSING UNITS
      The following inventory includes government assisted rental properties in the City of Hollister
      that may be at risk of opting out of programs that keep them affordable to very low and low
      income households over the five year Housing Element Period (2009-2014) and for the
      subsequent five years (2019). Generally, the inventory consists of Housing and Urban
      Development (HUD) subsidized and USDA Section 515 properties that are at risk. As indicated
      by the California Housing Partnership Corporation, target lower income populations including
      extremely-low income groups, very-low income groups, and seniors. At-Risk units indicate
      units that may convert to market rate within 5 years, a Lower Risk project may convert within 5-
      10 years.
      The process of selling out of affordable programs is a thorough and lengthy process which
      requires notices to local government and local housing authorities. Appendix D of this housing
      element lists housing non-profit organizations known to both the State and local governments as
      being interested in acquiring at-risk units and maintaining affordability for the life of the
      structure.
      The listed deed-restricted affordable housing developments in Hollister that are at risk of
      converting to market rate (see Table 44 below) utilize the Rural Development’s Section 515 direct
      mortgage program; some were originally FarmHome projects and some were originally Section
      8. This program granted 40-year loans with a 1 percent interest rate. Many loans were pre-
      payable in 20 years, and all projects had Section 8 or rental assistance. The City will continue to
      emphasize the importance of maintaining and preserving at-risk units; as evidenced by
      Implementation Program H.S in Section 4.0.

2.2.h COST ANALYSIS
In order to provide a cost analysis of preserving “at-risk” units, costs must be determined for
rehabilitation, new construction, or tenant-based rental assistance.
                2.2.h(1) Rehabilitation
                The factors used to analyze the cost to preserve at risk housing units include
                acquisition, rehabilitation, and financing costs.            Both new construction and
                rehabilitation utilize an assumption of 1,000 square foot units, on a typical market
                rate 40 unit project. These figures are estimates since actual costs will depend on
                condition, size, location, existing financing, and the availability of financing.
                Information from similar projects, in addition to the cited sources, has added helped
                in formulate the numbers in the following tables.

                construction in San Benito County. The actual replacement costs for any of the at-
                risk units will depend on many variables such as the number of units, location,
                density, unit sizes, on and off-site improvements, and both existing and new
                financing. Again, local developers have provided information.

2.2.i. PRESERVATION RESOURCES
Efforts by the City to retain low-income housing must be able to draw upon two basic types of
preservation resources: organizational and financial. Qualified, non-profit entities need to be made
aware of the future possibilities of units becoming “at-risk”. Should a property become “at-risk”
3.111 CITY OF HOLLISTER 2005 GENERAL PLAN

3.   HOUSING ELEMENT                                      Final Housing Element, November, 2009
the City maintains an active list of resources in which to preserve that property. A list of potential
organizational preservation resources is provided in Appendix E of this document.
In addition, the City of Hollister has identified procedures for actively monitoring noted at-risk
properties, with the goal of preserving at-risk units. Identified procedures include:
              Monitoring the “Risk Assessment Report” published by the California Housing
               Partnership Corporation (CHPC) to assess federally financed projects.
              Maintain regular contact with the local HUD office regarding early warnings of
               possible opt-outs.
              Maintain contact with the owners and managers of existing affordable housing to
               determine if there are plans to opt-out in the future, and offer assistance in locating
               eligible buyers.
              Develop and maintain a list of potential purchasers of at-risk units and act as a
               liaison between owners and eligible purchasers.
              Ensure that all owners and managers of affordable housing are provided with
               applicable State and federal laws regarding notice to tenants of the owner’s desire to
               opt-out or prepay. State law requires a 12 month notice.
The following is a list of potential financial resources considered a part of the City's overall financial
plan to preserve and retain affordable units. The number and availability of programs to assist
cities and counties in increasing and improving their affordable housing stock is limited, and public
funding for new projects is unpredictable. The following is a list of local, state and federal
programs.
              Hollister Redevelopment Agency- the RDA sets aside 20% of its tax increment funds
               for the production or retention of affordable housing.
              Home Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program and Community Development
               Block Grant Program (CDBG) - The HOME Program was created under Title II of the
               Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act enacted on November 28, 1990.
               The City of Hollister participates in State of California Small Cities program for both
               the HOME funds and for CDBG funds
              Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) - Federal law requires that banks, savings and
               loans, thrifts, and their affiliated mortgaging subsidiaries, annually evaluate the
               credit needs for public projects in communities where they operate. Part of the
               City's efforts in developing preservation programs will be to meet with the
               Community Reinvestment Act Lenders Group organized by the County to discuss
               future housing needs and applicability of the Community Reinvestment Act.
               Although an unpredictable resource, it is important to establish a working
               relationship for future problem solving.
              Low-income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC) - The LIHTC Program provides
               for federal and state tax credits for private and non-profit developers and investors
               who agree to set aside all or an established percentage of their rental units for
               households at or below 60 percent of AMI for no less than 30 years. These tax credits
               may also be utilized on rehabilitation projects, contributing to the preservation
               program.

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                        Final Housing Element, November, 2009
               The Affordable Housing Program (AHP) and Community Investment Program (CIP)
                are facilitated by the Federal Home Loan System for the purposes of expanding the
                affordable housing supply. The San Francisco Federal Home Loan Bank District
                provides service to San Benito County, and throughout California. Subsidies are
                awarded on a competitive basis usually in the form of low-interest loans and must
                be used to finance the purchase, construction, and/or rehabilitation of rental
                housing.
               The Predevelopment Loan Program, conducted through HCD, provides the funds to
                pay the initial costs of preserving existing affordable housing developments for their
                existing tenants. Priority is given to applications with matching financing from local
                redevelopment agencies or federal programs.
               Rural Seed Money Loan Programs, operated through the Housing Assistance
                Council operates revolving loan funds to provide seed money for rural housing and
                development projects intended to benefit very low- and low-income persons.
               Preservation Financing Program, operated through California Housing Finance
                Agency (CHFA), offers tax exempt financing for the acquisition or refinancing of a
                project with an expiring Section 8 contract.
2.2.j. REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY
The City of Hollister has a redevelopment agency to provide staff support for administering
rehabilitation funds for low-income homeowners and other housing programs. By State law, the
Hollister Redevelopment Agency (The Agency) will set aside 20 percent (%) of the gross tax
increment revenues received from the Redevelopment Area into a low to moderate income housing
fund for affordable housing activities. As can be seen in Table 47 below, during the current
housing element period 2009-2014 (calendar years 1010 to 2014), the Agency estimates accruing
$10,150,000 in funds to the low/mod fund account. Estimates of future funding accruals to the
agency are based on the best information available, considering weakening tax revenues and
uncertain government recapture programs aimed at closing the State budget gap. The identified
funding levels are goals set by the Hollister Redevelopment Agency, subject to RDA Board
approval.
Agency funding will continue to be available through the low and moderate income housing set-
aside for affordable housing and housing related purposes. The City of Hollister maintains a
relationship with two primary partners in the development of affordable projects, South County
Housing and Community Services Development Corporation. The Plan’s identified goals,
including housing and housing related goals are as follows:
               To provide a stable, diversified and larger economic base for the Project Area and
                community,
               To conserve and improve existing public facilities and to provide such new facilities
                as needed for the full and complete development of the Project Area,
               To provide a safer, more efficient and economical movement of persons and goods
                within the Project Area and community,
               To provide additional housing opportunities in the Project Area and community,

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                      Final Housing Element, November, 2009
              To enhance the physical environment of the Project Area and to emphasize its
               favorable environmental characteristics,
              To improve the physical condition of the public and private buildings in the Project
               Area including a reasonable level of earthquake resistance.
              To provide for downtown revitalization and the development of vacant sites
               resulting from earthquake or fire,
              To pursue a Redevelopment Plan Amendment.
The Hollister RDA is participating in funding several projects, affordable to lower income groups.
The Agency has been prohibited from moving forward with these projects due to the sewer
moratorium. Since the moratorium has been lifted, the projects are now moving forward and are at
different stages in the development process.
    1. Meadows Vista (formerly known as Bridgevale): 72 Unit very low income senior complex.
        The project received Site and Architectural approval in November, 2007, and is expected to
        be complete in 2010. The RDA has committed $4.2 million from the Low/Mod set aside
        fund.
    2. Hillview: 25 unit SF housing project (low income). The project is expected to be complete in
        2011. The RDA has committed $700,000 from the Low/Mod set aside fund for this project.
    3. The Westside/Palmcourt (approved as one project): a 12 unit low income apartment project.
        The project (agency) is currently in negotiations on an owner participation agreement with
        the developer, and is expected to be finalized in the winter of 2009. The RDA has
        committed $1 million from the Low/Mod set aside fund for the project; the developer is
        requesting an additional $8.5 million.
To target goals in the Hollister Redevelopment Agency (RDA) 2005-2009 Five-Year Implementation
Plan, and in anticipation of the 2010-2014 Five Year Plan, the housing element has identified the
following housing and housing related programs targeting lower income families with LMI Funds
(set-asides).
              Publicize low-income homeowner’s assistance for housing rehabilitation and the
               availability of other funding mechanisms to help with home upkeep and
               maintenance, such as reverse mortgages for seniors on fixed incomes. Utilize
               Redevelopment Agency funds that are available for rehabilitation purposes.
               Facilitate greater participation in the program by increased advertising and by
               encouraging resident participation,
              Facilitate the construction of affordable housing at key sites to meet the City’s
               “Fair Share” of the regional housing need for very low, low and moderate-
               income households. Ensure that local affordable housing developments will be
               competitively positioned to access affordable housing finance sources (such as
               tax credits and tax-exempt bonds). Facilitate the development or rehabilitation
               of affordable housing by using redevelopment set-aside funds to assist in any on
               and off-site mitigation that may be required or to provide gap financing.
              Participate and allocate funds, as appropriate, for nonprofit programs providing
               emergency shelter and related counseling services.

             Renew the Redevelopment Agency funded Owner Occupied
              Rehabilitation program to assist homeowners with necessary home
              repairs and certain limited upgrades.
             Renew the Redevelopment Agency funded Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC)
              program to provide tax relief to first time homebuyers who qualify under the
              program income guidelines.
             Redevelopment Agency funded Residential Foreclosure Reestablishment
              Program to provide assistance where homes have been foreclosed on or
              purchased by institutions. The City will partner with a non-profit developer to
              purchase, rehabilitate and offer first time purchase assistance to place vacant
              homes back in the marketplace and to assist potential purchasers who otherwise
              may not be able to buy a home, enter the market; funded in the amount of $1
              million per year.
             Renew housing program and guidelines for a Redevelopment Agency funded
              program to provide a Fist Time Homebuyers (FTHB) down payment assistance
              program which would provide a silent second mortgage to low and moderate
              income families.
             Develop housing program and guidelines for Redevelopment Agency funded

2.2.k. RESIDENTIAL ZONING AND DENSITY
Zoning districts specify minimum lot size, permitted uses, conditional uses, building height and
front, rear, and side yard setbacks. Zoning districts further the health, safety, and welfare of the
residents. Zoning standards originate from the General Plan. In the City of Hollister, residential
zoning targets all income groups. The City has made it very clear that residential development is
welcome and supported.
                2.2.k. (1) Zoning
                Title 17 of the Hollister City Code provides the zoning provisions for the City.
                Residential zoning for the City of Hollister is defined as follows:
                RE – Residential Estate District (1 du/5 Acres).
                The Residential Estate (RE) zoning district provides for residential development
                at densities up to one dwelling unit per 5 net acres; it is intended to provide for
                very low intensity residential development where all urban services may not be
                required. The RE District is intended to provide sites for larger, distinctive
                residences. The RE zoning district is consistent with the Residential Estate (RE)
                land use category of the General Plan.
                R1 – Low Density Residential District (1-6 du/Acre)
                The Low Density Residential (R1) zoning district includes areas substantially
                developed with existing single family residential residences prior to 2005 with
                densities of one to 6 dwelling units per net acres. The R1 zoning district is
                consistent with the Low Density Residential (LDR) land use category of the
                General Plan.
                R2 – Two Family Residential District (7-12 du/Acres)
                The Two Family Residential (R2) zoning district provides for duplexes or two-
                family dwellings. Areas designated R2 were substantially developed prior to
                2005 with two single-family residential units on a lot or duplexes. The R2 zoning
                district is consistent with the Medium Density Residential (MDR) land use
                category of the General Plan.
                R3 – Medium Density Residential District (8-16 du/Acres)
                The Medium Density Residential (R3) zoning district provides for medium and
                medium to high density residential development at densities from 8 to 16
                dwelling units per net acres.
                Areas designated R3 were substantially developed prior to 2005 and are
                generally characterized by apartments and other high density residential
                development, and planned residential development at a density of 16 dwelling
                units per acre. The R3 zoning district is consistent with the Medium Density
                Residential (MDR) and High Density Residential (HDR) land use category of the
                General Plan.

              R4 – High Density Residential District (12-35 du/Acres)
              The High Density Residential (R4) zoning district provides for high density
              residential development at densities from 12 to 35 dwelling units per net acre.
              Areas designated R4 were substantially developed prior to 2005 and are
              generally characterized by apartments and other high density residential
              development, and planned residential development at a density of 16 or more
              dwelling units per acre. The R4 zoning district is consistent with the High
              Density Residential (HDR) land use category of the General Plan.
              Residential Performance Overlay Zone District (R-1 L/PZ, R-3 M/PZ and R-4
              H/PZ)
              This overlay district applies to vacant land within the City of Hollister. The
              intent of the overlay district is to foster development that meets the range of
              densities for the General Plan land use designation with the option for flexible
              standards to implement policies and programs in the General Plan. A project
              approved in this zone may have a variety of housing types and densities but the
              zoning ordinance requires that the overall average development density of the
              development adhere to range of the minimum and maximum density allowed
              in the applicable district. This means that an apartment complex could be
              constructed in the Low Density Residential R1-L Performance Overlay zone
              along with single family homes as long as the density ranged between one to
              eight units per acre. Conversely, some single family residential units could be
              constructed in the R3-M Performance Overlay zone provided that the
              development density is not less or more than the minimum of maximum allowed
              in the district of eight to 12 units per acre.
              An average development density of one to eight units per net acre is now
              required in the R1 L/PZ overlay zone with a targeted density of at least six units
              per net acre. An average development density of eight to 12 units per acre is
              required in the R3 M/PZ overlay zone and an average of 12 to 35 units per acre is
              required in the R4 H/PZ overlay zone. The overlay zoning will provide an
              incentive for property owners to include a variety of housing types with new
              residential development.
              For example the recent allocation for the project, ‘The Villages’ is a residential
              project in the R1-L/PZ overlay zone. Over four acres of the site is within the 100
              year flood plain. With the performance overlay zone, the allocated project
              integrated flexible lot sizes ranging from 3,200 square feet to 5,500 square feet
              while maintaining an overall net development density of six units per acre and
              avoiding development of the flood hazard area. The varied lot sizes will provide
              a wider range of prices for market rate units. In the past, this type of project
              would typically be approved with either 1) A standard residential development
              with residential lots sizes of 6,000 to 7,700 square feet and avoidance of the flood
              hazard area would have reduced the overall build-out of the property; or 2) a
              Planned Unit Development which would require an amendment to the zoning
              map and longer processing times for City Council ordnance amendments and
              additional application fees.

              The Rajkovich project also provided flexible densities to accommodate a 100 unit
              affordable apartment project in the R1-L/PZ overlay zoning district. The average
              density for this recently allocated project will be eight units per acre
              There are two Housing Programs included in this Housing Element to stimulate
              the construction of affordable multi-family affordable housing particularly in the
              R3-M and R-4 H Performance Overlay zones. Program H.N. commits the City of
              Hollister to establishing a new R4-20 zoning district with a minimum
              development density of 20 units per acre by the end of 2009. Development in this
              district would meet the default density for affordable housing. Program H.O
              triggers a rezone for projects in a Performance Overlay zone that propose a
              portion of the residential development for lower residential development densities
              than the district allows. The City will then initiate the rezoning of a remaining
              portion of the property to the R4-20 zoning district to assure that at least the
              average minimum development density of the property of the applicable zoning
              district is met and that affordable multi-family housing will be constructed.
              The Performance overlay zone also provides flexibility to accomplish other
              general plan goals. General Plan policy calls for transitions between established
              neighborhoods. With the performance overlay zone, the Rajkovich project was
              designed to place larger market rate homes next to an established neighborhood
              with similar lots sizes. The interior of the development was designed with small
              lots which provided space for an on-site recreation area and again more diversity
              in the size and types of single family homes.
              The overlay district calls for the following measures:
                       a.  A variety of lot sizes and choices for housing types in all zoning
                           districts.
                       b. New development with interesting street patterns, site planning and
                           neighborhood design.
                       c. Connections of the new development with the rest of the City for
                           pedestrians and bicyclists.
                       d. Incorporation of on-site recreation, pedestrian links between
                           adjoining properties, trails or easements in the vicinity of drainages
                           and water courses in new development.
                       e. Clustered development that meets the average General Plan density
                           for the property while avoiding development in areas with
                           environmental constraints such as flood, seismic, liquefaction, special
                           habitat area.
                       f.  Lot design and building orientation to provide solar access.

                      g. Sensitive integration of the scale and mass of new development
                          preserves the character and scale of existing residential
                          neighborhoods.
              Lands with R-1 L/PZ overlay zone predominantly include vacant land within
              the City of Hollister in the Low Density Residential (1-8 units per net acre) land
              use category of the General Plan. An average development density of 1 to 8 units
              per net acre is required in this overlay zone with a targeted density of at least six
              units per net acre.
              Areas with the R-3 M/PZ overlay zone comprise vacant land within the City of
              Hollister in the Medium Density Residential (8-12 units per net acre) land use
              category of the General Plan. An average development density of 8 to 12 units
              per net acre is required in this overlay zone.
              Areas included in the R-4 H/PZ overlay zone encompass vacant land within the
              City of Hollister in the High Density Residential (12-35 units per net acre) and
              use category of the General Plan.
              HO – Home/Office District (8-12 du/Acres)
              The Home Office (HO) zoning district is primarily a medium density residential
              zoning district that provides the option for small scale professional office uses,
              artist/craft studios, beauty salon and specialty cottage businesses in the same
              area around the central core of the community. Residential densities may range
              from detached single-family housing, to lower density multi-family housing. It
              is the intent of this district to preserve the essential historic characteristics of the
              General Plan ‘Old Town Residential Area’ of Hollister while providing a
              transitional zone between the downtown commercial uses and older residential
              uses. The HO zoning district is consistent with the Home Office (HO) land use
              category of the General Plan. The residential development density is 8 to 12
              units per net acre.
              OT – Old Town District
              The Old Town (OT) zoning district applies to the residential neighborhoods that
              include the original town of Hollister, as laid out by the San Juan Justo
              Homestead Association, its early subdivisions, and adjacent older residential
              areas. Within this district are numerous lots of unusual size and shape, many of
              which were originally designed to accommodate stables, barns, and other
              outbuildings. In addition many areas of this district are occupied by a varied
              mix of residential types and densities. The majority of the housing stock was
              constructed prior to World War II. Some of the homes in this district are listed in
              the National Monterey Street Historic District. South of Fourth Street, the Old
              Town (OT-M) zoning district is consistent with the Medium Density Residential
              Land use category of the General Plan with residential development densities
              from 8 to 12 dwelling units per net acre. Areas within the OT-M district could
              have single family homes, duplexes, fourplex, cottages and housing on small
              lots. This district also encompasses the General Plan Old Town Special Planning
              Area. North of Fourth Street, the Old Town (OT-H) district is consistent with the
              High Density Residential category of the General Plan with residential

              development densities from 12 to 35 dwelling units per net acre. The Old Town-
              H district provides for infill development of small lots, apartments and other
              high density residential development.
              The additional purpose of the OT-M district is to provide for the infill of
              detached single family dwellings on small lots and small scale medium density
              dwellings where the minimum density is not less than eight (8) units per net acre
              and the maximum density is not more than twelve (12) units per net acre without
              density bonus.
              The additional purpose of the OT-H district is to provide for the infill of
              detached, attached, medium density and multifamily dwellings where the
              minimum density is not less than sixteen (16) units per net acre and the
              maximum density is not more than thirty five (35) units per net acre without
              density bonus.
              RWF – Residential, West Fairview Road District (2-8 du/Acres)
              The RWF (West Fairview Road district) establishes zoning regulations for the
              area defined by the West Fairview Road Specific Plan. The West Fairview Road
              Specific Plan provides for comprehensive land use, circulation and infrastructure
              plans, development and design policies, housing strategies and implementation
              programs for guiding and ensuring the orderly development of the plan area.
              The intent of these regulations is to implement the specific plan and the City
              General Plan, as well as to allow for a mix of housing types and densities. All of
              the land in the Residential, West Fairview Road District is part of an approved
              667 unit subdivision with 50 very low-income apartments, 50 low-income
              apartments, 60 moderate-income duettes and the balance consisting of market
              rate single family homes.
              Mixed Use
              The City has adopted three new Mixed Use zoning districts, the Downtown
              Mixed Use District, the Neighborhood Mixed Use District, and the West
              Gateway (Mixed Use) District. The mixed use districts will encourage retail
              ground floor uses with a mix of office and residential uses on one to two floors
              above the ground level or a mix of commercial and high density residential
              development in an area.        The mixed use districts are located in the West
              Gateway, in the historic central commercial downtown core of Hollister along
              with industrial re-use areas east and south of downtown, and in infill sites near
              a newer commercial area in the southern area of the city. The three mixed use
              areas are discussed in more detail below. Many incorporated lots that have been
              rezoned to mixed use are currently vacant, while others contain commercial and
              reuse of industrial uses. The City approved a density range of 20 to 35 units per
              acre for the West Gateway mixed use area, 20-25 for the Neighborhood Mixed
              Use areas and a high density of 25 to 40 units per acre for the Downtown
              Commercial Mixed Use area. At this density, additional housing capacity exists
              for the approximate 2,000 units. It is the City’s expectation and goal that a
              mixture of housing prices will be built within the mixed-use districts affordable

              to lower income households as well as moderate and above moderate income
              households.
              Approximately 50 acres of mixed use could be available for reuse over the long
              term as some heavy industrial land uses transition out of the downtown area and
              east of downtown.
              DMU – Downtown Mixed Use
              The Downtown Mixed Use (DMU) zoning district encompasses the historic
              commercial core of Hollister and portions of the district are part of a National
              Historic district. The replacement of the previous General Commercial District
              with a mixed use district now provides for a vertical or horizontal combination
              of commercial and residential uses around the central core of the community.
              The designation is intended to encourage ground floor, pedestrian friendly, retail
              sales and service uses with upper floors of office and residential uses. The DMU
              District should be a unique destination with restaurants, theaters, boutique retail,
              neighborhood convenience stores, restaurants, regionally-oriented specialty
              stores, medical and dental offices, and residential densities of 25 to 40 units per
              net acre. Drive-through windows and outdoor car, truck and auto sales and auto
              repair are prohibited.
              Currently, there are at least 12 historic buildings in the downtown with second
              floors that were previously used for residential units, a hotel or other uses but
              are now substantially vacant. The mixed use district allows re-use of these
              buildings for residential uses, in addition to commercial uses. Within the
              Downtown Mixed Use district, there are also approximately 11 vacant lots that
              are now available for development due to the recent lifting of the sewer
              moratorium.
              NMU – Neighborhood Mixed Use
              The Neighborhood Mixed Use (NMU) zoning district provides for pedestrian-
              oriented commercial uses of low intensity and of a neighborhood character
              which serves the convenience retail and service needs of nearby residents and
              high-density residential at densities of 25 to 35 units per net acre. The properties
              in the NMU district east and south of downtown Hollister are in a transitional
              area where industrial uses are identified to be replaced with mixed use. There
              are also single-family homes on small lots in portions of this district that are
              prime candidates for higher density housing, with participation in the City’s lot
              consolidation program. Capacity for additional units in this area would further
              add to opportunities for residential development, including homes affordable to
              lower income households. The other properties in the NMU district are
              contiguous to the neighborhood shopping centers, on the newer south central
              area of the city (Tres Pinos/Sunnyslope Road) with supporting neighborhood-
              related convenience businesses.

              WG – West Gateway
              The new West Gateway (WG) mixed-use zoning district replaced the previous
              Highway Commercial and Industrial zoning districts at the west entrance to
              Hollister. The change reflects the realignment of Highway 156 away from this
              commercial area. The new West Gateway mixed use district provides for a
              series of parcels with neighborhood commercial, rather than highway
              commercial, and multi-family residential uses as a retail-oriented entry
              boulevard at the west entrance to the City of Hollister near the San Benito River.
              The designation is intended to provide convenience services to regional traffic on
              Highway 156, encourage community shopping, retail and offices with medium
              to high density residential uses at a density of 20 to 35 units per net acre outside
              of downtown Hollister. The City of Hollister Redevelopment Agency has
              committed to installing a gateway sign, landscaping and lighting improvements
              in the West Gateway in 2010. Such improvements include a possible median for
              traffic calming that will enhance the west entrance to the City, improving
              pedestrian corridors and stimulating new development.
              2.2.k. (2) Density
              Residential densities permitted in the City of Hollister are identified in the
              General Plan. The Zoning Code is a tool that implements the densities identified
              in the General Plan Land Use Chapter. They provide the basis for land use
              decision in the City as well as the specific requirements and standards. The City
              recently adopted a new Zoning Code, Title 17 to implement the densities in the
              General Plan, bringing consistency between the two documents.
              The General Plan contains a range of densities providing for rural residential
              uses in the Residential Estate district density of 1 unit per 5 net acres in the lower
              end of the residential densities, up to a 12 to 35 units per net acre in the High
              Density Residential district. The General Plan also makes provision for mixed
              use opportunities; home office uses, open space requirements, and contains
              specific plan overlay designations. All land uses in the General Plan are
              implemented in the new Zoning Code.
              It should be noted that the City Council directed staff to revisit the off-street
              parking standards for multi-family residences to provide a better correlation
              between the number of bedrooms in a multi-family unit and the parking
              requirements. It is possible that the spaces required for studios and one-bedroom
              units will be reduced while spaces for units with three or more bedrooms will be
              increased. The City Council has also directed staff to amend the Zoning
              Ordinance to allow review of proposed mixed use/residential development in
              the Measure Y exemption area on a case-by-case basis rather than with the
              current requirement to use the R4 residential standards (see Program H.E). The
              intent is to stimulate development in the Measure Y exemption area for the
              variety of development types, including re-use of upper floors, infill of small and
              medium vacant lots, and opportunities for lot consolidation.

             Second Units
             A second unit dwelling is a small accessory unit in addition to the main house (dwelling
             unit) on a single lot. Sixteen accessory units were approved during the last program
             period but only five were built due to the moratorium. The City anticipates the
             construction approximately 50 second units during the 2009-2014 Housing Element
             period. The estimate is based on the level of interest demonstrated to the Planning
             Department, and on the desire and willingness of the City to encourage such units. The
             likelihood of the units serving lower income needs is high based on inquiries of property
             owners interested in housing an elderly family member because of high health care costs
             and limited assisted living facilities in the city, but cannot be demonstrated by past

       activity. Therefore, the units may serve moderate and above moderate income needs as
       well. Second units have the following benefits:
           (1) They provide flexibility for the owner of the main home, an apartment for elderly
               parents, or a source of income;
           (2) When rented they can help make home-ownership affordable for the owner of
               the home;
           (3) They can provide flexibility for seniors or other homeowners who rent their
               primary dwelling because they still want to live in the same neighborhood;
           (4) They provide lower cost housing because the units tend to be small and there are
               no extra land costs;
           (5) They typically provide lower cost housing for younger households (under 34)
               and seniors (65 years plus), and these are the demographic groups that have been
               identified as having the most significant low-income housing need in Hollister;
           (6) They are easier to fit into existing neighborhoods since they are small and are
               often attached to the main house.
       In accordance with State law AB 1866, Section 17.22.040 Accessory Secondary
       Residential uses of the City Zoning Ordinance (part of Title 17, adopted in December,
       2008), permits second units in any zoning districts where single family residences are
       allowed as a permitted land use and eliminates the need for a Conditional Use permit or
       any other discretionary review. The Planning Commission has directed staff to initiate a
       zoning ordinance amendment that would allow a second unit in the multi-family and
       mixed use zoning districts where a single family residence has been lawfully established
       prior to the adoption of the current zoning ordinances, the standards of a second unit
       can be met and there is not an opportunity for lot consolidation. Second units must
       conform to all zoning and development standards of the applicable district, identified at
       Section 17.22.040 of Title 17, excluding density standards. The ordinance requires a
       minimum lot size of 7,000 square feet for interior lots and 8,000 square feet for knuckle
       or corner lots. The maximum floor area of a second unit is 850 square feet, and the
       minimum floor area is 150square feet. Off-street parking is required for the second unit,
       in addition to the parking requirement for the main dwelling unit. The second unit is
       required to be architecturally compatible with the main unit, but the process is now a
       ministerial process.
       In order to overcome the burdensome process of abating illegal second units, and face
       the possibility of eliminating an important source of affordable housing, the City
       approved what has come to be known as an “amnesty program” for such units. Under
       Section 17.22.040 of Title 17, Accessory Secondary Residential Structures, through an
       administrate permit only process, are allowed to be converted from an illegal structure,
       to a conforming legal unit. New second units are of course subject to regular building
       permit processing and complying with standards for an accessory second unit.
       The City of Hollister expects second units to continue to be an important source of
       affordable housing. Market rents for such units are typically affordable to low and
       moderate-income families.

       2.2.l. INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABILITY
       2.2.l (1) Wastewater Service and Capacity
                The City currently treats domestic and industrial wastewater at its new regional
                immersed membrane bioreactor (MBR) wastewater treatment plant located on the
                west side of the City, on the north side of San Juan Hollister Road. The plant has
                a design capacity of 5.0 million gallons per day (MGD) and produces effluent that
                meets Title 22 requirements for disinfected tertiary recycled water.
                In accordance with the implementation Long Term Wastewater Management Plan
                (LTWMP) filed with the Water Quality Control Board, the City is currently
                implementing a long-term program of phased improvements for the disposal and
                reuse of reclaimed wastewater including spray fields, non-potable irrigation for
                landscaping, and certain agricultural uses. The new facility expands the City’s
                ability to provide wastewater treatment service for the next 10 years, with an
                additional five years of expansion possible with the expansion of the membrane
                biological reactor. The City will continue to implement efforts to improve water
                quality and also to implement the water conservation measures.
       2.2.l (2) Water Service and Capacity
                The City of Hollister is served by the City water system in the west and central
                area and the Sunnyslope County Water District (SCWD) is the east and southeast
                portion of the City. All the development approved or proposed in the City is
                located within these established service areas and will be served by these
                agencies; therefore, water capacity is sufficient to serve the identified needs
                within the City. In accordance with the implementation measures in the General
                Plan Community Services and Facilities Element, the City will continue to work
                to identify additional water sources in order to provide adequate water for the
                additional housing units projected in the City’s Sphere of Influence as the City
                expands beyond its current City limits.
                The City of Hollister entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with San
                Benito County, and the San Benito County Water District to address the provision
                of adequate water supplies in the City and surrounding areas. The two primary
                measures are to implement a Groundwater Management Plan and to develop and
                implement the Hollister Urban Water (and Wastewater) Master Plan.
                Development of future sources and delivery mechanisms, paid for by future
                development projects, will ensure adequate water supplies through this Housing
                Element period. Measures being considered by the City to ensure adequate future
                water supplies include the following:
                       Purchase additional water supplies
                       Obtaining access to water from the San Felipe Project
                       Percolation of the San Felipe Project water into the underlying aquifers

SECTION 2.2.b
2009-2014 SITES INVENTORY
In addressing the estimated housing needs identified in the Housing Needs Assessment section
of this housing element, State law requires that this element contain “An inventory of land suitable
for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment...” This
inventory must identify adequate sites which will be made available through appropriate
zoning and development standards and with public services and facilities needed to facilitate
and encourage the development of a variety of housing types for households of all income
levels.
According to the State Department of Housing and Community Development’s “Housing
Resources – Q&A,” - “The analysis of the relationship of suitable sites to zoning provides a means for
determining the realistic number of dwelling units that could actually be constructed on those sites
within the current planning period of the housing element. The analysis should also identify the zones
the locality believes can accommodate its share of the regional housing needs for all income levels.”
The City of Hollister falls under the jurisdiction of, the San Benito County Council of
Governments (San Benito COG) for purposes of the RHNA determination. San Benito County
COG uses a predominately demographic formula to allocate the regional housing needs among
the incorporated cities (Hollister and San Juan Batista) and the unincorporated county. This
process results in a Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) and the number reflected in
that assessment must be considered when the housing element is prepared.
         2.2.a. Hollister RHNA (2007-2014)
         The Council of San Benito County Governments Regional Housing Needs Allocation for
         the period January 1, 2007 to August 31, 2014 determined that 10.9 percent of the
         households in Hollister are classified as extremely low-income, 10.9 percent very low-
         income, 17.4 percent low income, 19.7 percent moderate income and 41.1 percent above
         moderate income. In establishing the percentage of extremely low income households,
         following the California HCD recommended methodology, half of the very low income
         (10.9 percent), have been estimated to be extremely low income; therefore, 10.9 percent
         make up the very low income category.
         For the period 2007 to 2014, the City of Hollister has been given a construction need of
         3,050 new housing units. The specific need by income group is depicted in the following
         table. Construction need is annualized for each of the seven years of the planning
         period.

       2.2.b. RHNA Allocations and Sites Inventory
       As part of the 2003-2008 Housing Element update, and subsequent revisions, an analysis
       of the residential development potential of vacant and underutilized land in the City of
       Hollister was completed during 2008. Appendix F provides detailed tables by Zoning
       District, of the availability of residentially zoned land and underutilized land
       throughout the City of Hollister that is being utilized to satisfy the RHNA. The City is
       able to count units approved but not yet built, towards the 2007-2014 RHNA. Currently
       there are a total of 1184 housing units that were approved with prior growth
       management programs.
       As indicated in Table 49, 226 of these pending or approved units are in the lower income
       categories, 958 are in the moderate and above moderate categories. The City will utilize
       a combination of these approved pending units, vacant land, and some downtown
       vacant parcels and reuse of upper floors of existing buildings to demonstrate the City’s
       ability to meet the 2007-2014 RHNA goals.
                  2.2.b. (1) Income Group Goals
                  For purposes of this submittal, the City has taken into account the requirement to
                  address all income categories, including the extremely low income category. The
                  purpose of the income group goals is to ensure that each jurisdiction within a
                  COG attains its share of the state housing goal without any relative
                  disproportionate distribution of household income groups. The following
                  household income groups are defined according to the HUD Median Family
                  Income (MFI) and Income Limits Table: Extremely Low Income (less than 30% of
                  MFI); Very Low (less than 50 percent of MFI), Low (between 50-80 percent of
                  MFI), Moderate (between 80-120 percent of MFI) and Above Moderate (greater
                  than 120 percent of AMI).

  This is part of a phased development. The applicant has 20 allocations for single family homes from a prior growth management allocation. The Phase 2 allocation shown in this table would be for 22 small
lots. Phase 3 is for a small commercial center across the street from an elementary school. The closest commercial facilities are about one mile from this residential area. The commercial center will
implement general plan goals to promote pedestrian friendly neighborhoods by providing small-scale retail in an underserved area. Phase 4 is for an apartment complex. The applicant has agreed to a deed
restriction/pending performance agreement that requires Phase 4 to be developed with at least 61 to 113 multi-family units to assure that the average density of the 12.95 acre site is 8 to 12 units per acre in
the R-3M/PZ zoning district.

       2.2.d Available sites from lands zoned for residential and mixed use in the City limits.
              Development Projects
       The City is able to demonstrate site suitability, according to HCD guidelines (further
       discussion below), and has a goal and a vision for a mixture of income levels across
       zoning districts in the City. City policies have been adopted to support this vision.
       Based on the needs in the City, and staff’s knowledge of the types of projects the City
       will support, as well as interest from developers in affordable and other mixed use
       projects, the City has determined that all income categories, including the lower income
       categories, are needed in each of the identified zoning districts. Recent development
       interest also supports the development of units in both the lower income and higher
       income categories in the higher density districts. Units across income categories have
       been identified according to local development history and the vision for the City’s
       future development pattern, including an adaptive reuse program in the downtown
       areas.
       The residential land inventory primarily includes lands with potential for new
       construction from vacant parcels and a small number of re-use properties. Potential also
       exists for additional residential infill development in remaining residential zoning
       districts. Table 51 below lists the residential and mixed use districts based on the type of
       new construction that could occur in the future. Appendix F includes a list of lots in the
       Old Town zoning district with potential for infill development.             All listed zoning
       districts are located within the existing Hollister City limits. Most of the potential units,
       for purposes of this housing element are considered in reserve, and should be
       considered a reserve, particularly the infill, with the exception of the Old Town Infill
       shown below.

       The ability of either vacant or adaptive reuse sites in the Measure Y Exemption Area,
       including the Downtown Commercial Mixed Use (DMU) district, to accommodate the
       development of housing affordable to lower income households is supported by
       information obtained from local real estate agents, discussed in more detail below.
       Current projects being processed by the City that are affordable to lower income
       households within DMU district are as follows:
        Mixed Use- HDR
        All parcels zoned Mixed Use HDR included in the inventory are larger than 3.1 acres;
        lot consolidation is not necessary to facilitate development of these parcels. The sites
        are large enough to support projects serving the housing needs of the community,
        including the ability to serve lower income households, without the need for lot
        consolidation techniques or parcel assemblage.
        The City of Hollister will allow commercial and residential development in the mixed
        use districts. There are about 67 acres of vacant land in the West Gateway and
        Neighborhood Mixed Use districts. The City has taken the following steps in order to
        provide further assurance that mixed use districts will yield residential development.
             The City Council placed on the November 2007 ballot a measure to exempt from
                residential growth management allocations development in the Downtown
                Commercial Mixed Use district.
             Growth management allocations specifically for the mixed use districts to
                stimulate construction of multi-family housing in the districts.
             Housing Element Program H.Y. requires annual monitoring of development in
                mixed use areas. If 50% of the inventory in a geographic area is developed at a
                rate with less than 1 dwelling units per 5,000 sq. ft. of commercial space, then
                the City of Hollister is required to rezone vacant land in the area to the R4 zoning
                district based on a standard to assure construction of a minimum of 1 dwelling
                units per 5,000 square feet of commercial space that has been developed since
                2005.
        Measure Y Exemption Area (Downtown Commercial Mixed Use (DMU-HDR) and
        Neighborhood Mixed Use:
        The City is poised to re-introduce a residential component to the downtown
        commercial area with the new 2008 zoning ordinance, lifting of the sewer moratorium
        and the recently approved ballot initiative Measure Y that exempts all residential
        growth in the Downtown Commercial Mixed Use district and some Neighborhood
        Mixed Use lands south and east of downtown that were included in a recently
        prepared Downtown Strategic Plan. The Redevelopment Agency helped fund, in
        partnership with the Hollister Downtown Association, property owners and
        stakeholders the preparation of the 2008 Hollister Downtown Strategy and Plan. The
        City of Hollister and Redevelopment Agency have taken steps to implement measures
        in the strategic plan. The City of Hollister recently re-established enforcement of
        parking in the downtown area. The Redevelopment Agency contributed funds in 2009
        for a study to explore the establishment of a downtown Property Business
        Improvement District. The 2008 zoning ordinance also includes provisions for a

        reduction in parking standards with payment of in-lieu fees and for affordable housing
        and provisions to satisfy off-street parking requirements with a city-approved parking
        assessment district.
        Two projects in the Measure Y exemption area include the a conversion of former
        second story hotel rooms to five studios and a pending application to construct two
        condos on a small 2,800 square foot infill lot. Staff has also met with property owners
        interested in replacing a single story commercial building with a mixed use building
        and infill development of a small apartment on a large lot.
        Housing Element Programs H.F and H.MM require annual outreach with property
        owners in the Measure Y exemption area to educate property owners about
        opportunities for re-use and development.               Programs H.F. and H.L. require
        amendments to the mixed use standards in the Measure Y exemption area to allow
        more flexibility to increase densities on smaller lots with upper floors of residential
        housing including waiving the minimum parcel size requirement, allowing zero-lot line
        development, reducing the off-street parking requirements and review of projects on a
        case by case basis.
        City staff conducted a recent survey (August of 2009) of properties in the downtown
        Measure Y Exemption area and discovered rental units above existing ground floor
        retail. The units are affordable. The property owners stated that most renters are long

        and facilitating affordable upper floor units of this same type. A list of units follows:

        Projected unit capacities for sites in the Measure Y Exemption area are based on a
        combination of vacant ground floor infill parcels, on demolition and accompanying re-
        use of property, and on re-use of the upper level commercial buildings in the historic
        downtown core. A residential allocation is not required for residential development in
        this exemption area. The City’s identified capacity of additional units is based on a
        combination of factors – 1) voluntary inventory of resources in the downtown
        completed by the City in the summer of 2008; 2) additional building with unsurveyed
        upper floors; 3) infill sites including vacant lots and underutilized parking lots and
        parking areas on private property. There are an estimated 160 sites that are available
        for immediate development. Appendix G includes a list of vacant and underutilized
        properties (176 sites) in the Measure Y exemption area, including vacant infill in the
        Downtown Mixed Use district, upper floor units in Downtown Mixed Use, and vacant
        infill opportunities in Neighborhood Mixed Use.
        Implementation of the newly adopted Mixed Use standards in Hollister will act as a
        draw to incentivize the completion of projects in the DMU-HDR and NMU – HDR
        districts, carrying out the City’s vision for the downtown core. Application of the
        appropriate historical building codes will further ease the development of properties
        that would otherwise face higher costs due to stricter code requirements.
        Housing Element Programs H.F. and H. MM require annual outreach with property
        owners in the Measure Y exemption area to educate property owners about
        opportunities for re-use and development. Program H.E requires an amendment to
        the mixed use standards to increase densities by reducing the minimum lot size
        requirements on smaller lots and for buildings with potential for upper floors of
        residential housing in the Measure Y exemption area.
        As future reserve (not included in this inventory, but shown in the table with an
        equivalent of “0” units) are some re-use sites primarily associated with a former tar
        paper facility and an existing cannery in the DMU-HDR and NMU sub-table. The
        timing for re-use of these properties is uncertain so the City did not include these sites
        as new construction sites. The City also proposed to use a calculated realistic capacity
        based on the minimum allowable density in the mixed use district. Going forward, the
        City will continue to monitor new construction to assure that acreage will be utilized
        for residential.

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                      Final Housing Element, November, 2009
        Old Town Infill:
        The Old Town zoning district comprises much of the original housing stock in the City
        of Hollister. The City developed slowly over time with the piecemeal development of
        individual lots. Remaining in the Old Town zoning district are some large lots with the
        potential for infill development. A number of vacant lots are also present.
        Development would need to be oriented on the property and designed to retain the
        historic character of this area of the City. The zoning ordinance includes design and
        architectural standards for the Old Town zoning district insuring proper design and
        orientation. Issuance of a building permit for a single family residence is ministerial,
        not subject to any discretionary action. Architectural review for Old Town standards
        would be incorporated into any Site and Architectural Review for a multi-family units
        in the Old Town district.
        High Density Residential- R4-H/PZ
        Future development of parcels zoned R4-H/PZ have been calculated based on the
        lowest allowable density for a total of 417 units, with one exception, a site on North
        Street. As a general rule, the City of Hollister has a generally flat topography; however,
        the North Street site is located on a small hill known as Park Hill. The combination of
        possible fault hazard non-buildable areas and site slopes act as a constraint to
        development at this location. Therefore, the City has reduced the realistic capacity at
        this location by approximately 45% percent (the calculation based on 12 UPA, the
        minimum density, would otherwise be 270 units). The reduction makes allowance for
        the necessary infrastructure and site standards (increased non-buildable areas) due to
        the slope, and fault hazard building exclusion leading to reduced densities.
        The City’s new Zoning Ordinance, along with the Density Bonus program will serve to
        incentivize development of the R4-H/PZ parcels. Several parcels in the High Density
        (R4-H/PZ) district are 1 acre or smaller; therefore, the City encourages lot consolidation
        to permit such development to advance. The City’s support of the consolidation of
        small lots into larger parcels is evidenced by a recent demolish and rebuild project, the
        Westside Apartments. By consolidating several smaller lots into one, the project
        utilized a density transfer, gaining 11 additional units. A direct result of one of the
        City’s goals, the new Zoning Ordinance supports interconnections between properties,
        resulting in increased projects involving combined lots. Flexible zoning standards such
        as stepped back second floors, reduced setbacks, and parking placed behind the
        building also provide additional opportunities to develop such projects. All parcels in
        the R4-H/PZ district are eligible to participate in the City’s Density Bonus Program.
        The City’s Growth Management allocation program awards points for projects that
        provide a density mix with housing for lower income groups, including extremely low
        income households, acting to provide incentive for and encourage higher density
        projects, including projects involving lot consolidation.

        Lot Consolidation efforts
        A supplement to the sites inventory (Appendix H) has been included to more
        accurately portray the status of parcels within the downtown Measure Y exemption
        area and multi-family zoning districts with a strong potential as candidates for lot
        consolidation.
        Most of the downtown sites are vacant and contain no structures. In the Measure Y
        exemption area, former derelict structures have been cleared, and in one instance, a
        building burned down. In other instances, open lots are paved that were used for
        parking lots for former automobile dealerships. In order to increase the viability of
        these lots for more intensive development, the City will be allowing reduced parking
        (see Program H.H) up to and including exemptions from otherwise applicable parking
        requirements. Several of these lots present opportunities for lot consolidation as a
        means to make development even more attractive to potential developers. Lots that are
        prime candidates for consolidation, due to a property line adjacency have been
        highlighted. With the removal of parking requirements and incentives to draw project
        developers to the downtown, the City is able to demonstrate the suitability of these
        underutilized sites for the development of housing for lower income households.
        Appendix H lists seven other areas in the West Gateway and other multi-family zoning
        districts that are prime candidates for lot consolidation efforts. For example, five lots
        between Jan Avenue and Fourth Street could be assembled into about 3.5 acres. Parcels
        included in the High Density Residential inventory that are ripe for lot consolidation
        are located along Line Street, Valleyview/Sunnyslope, West Second, Locust Avenue
        and Central Avenue. A number of these parcels are less than one-half acre and are well
        suited to affordable projects, subject to joining two or more parcels to create one larger
        more attractive piece of property. The City has included programs as part of this
        housing element to give priority to projects that consolidate smaller lots into more
        developable parcels, (see Programs H.F H.Q and Appendix H).
        In accordance with Government Code Section 65583.2 (c)(3)(B), the City is able to
        demonstrate the suitability of the higher density zones for the development of
        affordable housing. In other words, the higher density zones are suitable to provide
        housing for lower income households, thereby meeting the “appropriate zoning” test as
        outlined in the HUD guidelines. The “default density” for Hollister, i.e. San Benito
        County, is 20 units per acre. The R4, High Density Residential District allows for
        densities from 12 to 35 units per acre; the Mixed Use West Gateway, (WG) (R4-H/PZ)
        allows densities from 20 to 35 units per acre, and the Mixed Use (MU-HDR) district and
        the DMU, Downtown Mixed Use District allow for densities of 25-35 units per acre.
        The new R4-20 zoning district that will be implemented for Program H.N will allow for
        densities of 20 to 35 units per acre.
        The High Density Residential Zoning Districts have the lowest cost of construction per
        unit and would therefore offer some built in market incentives for very low and low-
        income construction, although the City’s development strategy includes moderate and
        above moderate income units in the high density residential districts as well. In
        anticipation of their development strategy in the mixed use districts, the City has made
3.140 CITY OF HOLLISTER 2005 GENERAL PLAN

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                     Final Housing Element, November, 2009
        further reductions in the calculated capacity of the mixed use zones (equating to 50% of
        the total acreage). Calculations based strictly on the minimum allowable densities in
        the mixed use zones would allow for a greater number of units; however, the City is
        mandating a reduction to allow for commercial development in addition to residential
        development.
        Realistic density calculations for the Low Density (single family 1-6 UPA) and Medium
        Density (8-16 UPA), zoned land also rely on the lowest allowable density, as per the
        zoning. However, for Low Density, an adjustment has been made based on the
        historical development densities of single family projects recently completed in
        Hollister. Therefore, the realistic capacity has been calculated based on 4.5 units per
        acre for the LDR parcels, rather than the lowest allowable density of 1 unit per acre, as
        per the zoning. The City fully expects these development trends to continue on future
        projects, and to be a realistic predictor of land development patterns as the City
        continues to grow.
        In order to provide further assurance that mixed use districts will yield residential
        development, the City requires annual monitoring of development in mixed use areas.
        Additionally, the City will initiate a rezoning to high density residential if commercial
        development constrains residential growth.
        For the 2007-2014 RHNA period, the City is not relying on non-vacant (mixed use
        reuse) sites, nor is the City relying on areas in the Sphere of Influence. Therefore, no
        schedule of annexations or other programs specific to annexation have been included
        with this submittal to meet new construction needs for the 2009-2014 program period.
        Annexations in Hollister were stalled between about 1995 and 2001 because there was
        not a property tax exchange agreement between the City of Hollister and San Benito
        County. Most residential annexations were stalled again between 2002 and December
        of 2008 due to the sewer moratorium. Program H.W. prioritizes annexation of 75 acres
        of unincorporated islands in order to assure a sufficient inventory of sites for the next
        Housing Element revision.
        In conclusion, all parcels in the sites inventory are located within the City limits of
        Hollister, with utility service and other city services readily available, subject to the
        extension of service laterals only. The majority of sites in the inventory are vacant and
        free of encumbrances that would limit the properties’ ability to be developed;
        remaining non-vacant parcels are noted as such. All non-vacant parcels and under-
        utilized properties are noted in the inventory, with prime reuse sites being highlighted,
        and the appropriate consistent methodology applied, either for vacant sites, upper floor
        units in the Downtown Commercial (City survey), or non-vacant underutilized parcels
        in the Measure Y exemption area, including Mixed Use (HDR), to provide a sufficient
        number of units to satisfy the RHNA. The newly adopted Zoning Ordinance identifies
        flexible development standards to facilitate development of infill (non-vacant) parcels.
        The Growth Management rating scale and implementing Housing Element programs
        provide incentives and act as a catalyst to encourage the adaptive reuse of such non-
        vacant infill parcels.

SECTION 2.3
CONSTRAINTS, EFFORTS, AND OPPORTUNITIES
       The purpose of this chapter is to analyze potential and actual governmental and non-
       governmental constraints on the maintenance, improvement and development of housing
       in the City of Hollister. A discussion of Hollister’s efforts to remove constraints and to
       promote energy conservation is included.
       2.3.a. GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
              2.3.a (1) Federal, State, and Local Policy
              Actions or policies of governmental agencies, whether involved directly or indirectly
              in the housing market, can impact the ability of the development community to
              provide adequate housing to meet consumer demands. For example, the impact of
              federal monetary policies and the budgeting and funding policies of a variety of
              departments can either stimulate or depress various aspects of the housing industry.
              Local or state government compliance or the enactment of sanctions (sewer
              connection or growth moratoriums) for noncompliance with the federal Clean Air
              and Water Pollution Control Acts can impact all types of development.
              State agencies and local government compliance with statutes can complicate the
              development of housing. Statutes such as the California Environmental Quality Act
              (CEQA) and sections of the Government Code relating to rezoning and General Plan
              Amendment procedures can also act to prolong the review and approval of
              development proposals by local governments. In many instances, compliance with
              these mandates establishes time constraints that cannot be altered by local
              governments.
              Local governments exercise a number of regulatory and approval powers which
              directly impact residential development within their respective jurisdictional
              boundaries. These powers establish the location, intensity, and type of units that
              may or may not be developed. The City of Hollister’s General Plan, zoning
              regulations, project review and approval procedures, development and processing
              fees, utility infrastructure, public service capabilities, and development attitudes all
              play important roles in determining the cost and availability of housing opportunities
              in Hollister.
              2.3.a (2) Land Use Regulations
              The General Plan is the primary land use policy document. This policy document
              not only establishes the location and amount of land that will be allocated to
              residential development, but also establishes the intensity of development (in terms
              of unit densities and total number of units) that will be permitted. While nearly all
              components or elements of the General Plan contain goals and policies that influence
              residential development, it is the Land Use Element that has the most direct
              influence.
3.143 CITY OF HOLLISTER 2005 GENERAL PLAN

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                        Final Housing Element, November, 2009
              The City regulates the use of land within the city limits through the Hollister General
              Plan, Municipal Code, and the Uniform Building Code. The Zoning Ordinance
              establishes development standards, intensity of development, minimum site
              requirements consistent with the 2005-2023 Hollister General Plan. These
              regulations are considered necessary to protect and preserve the existing housing
              stock and to ensure the orderly development of available land.
              The 2005-2023 General Plan envisions a more compact development pattern than
              the prior 1999-2005 General Plan; a smaller planning area, increased residential
              densities, and the addition of new mixed use land use designations to areas that were
              previously commercial or industrial land use designations. Various residential zones
              have been established along with a minimum set of requirements for densities,
              setbacks, lot coverage, and parking. In addressing the requirements of Government
              Code Section 65583(a), the City has developed standards that do not impede the
              City’s ability to meet maximum allowable densities. For example, in the higher
              density residential zones and the mixed use zones, the standards provide for
              allowable heights up to 45 feet and 50 feet, respectively, permitting up to four (4)
              stories. The City also has mechanisms in place to allow flexible setbacks and
              reduced parking requirements for projects meeting affordability levels.
              The following summary is provided to highlight certain aspects of the Zoning Code,
              but is not meant to be an all-inclusive description of the zoning districts.
              A summary of the City’s residential districts and mixed use districts, including
              housing and permit requirements is detailed in Table 2.1-48, on page 3.120 of
              Section 2.2.a of the Housing Element. A narrative summary of the Residential
              zoning districts is also provided in Section 2.2.a. Housing is permitted by right for
              construction of single family homes on existing lots of record in the Residential
              Estate and R1 Low Density Residential zoning districts. In mixed use commercial
              districts and residential zoning districts, new construction of mixed use or multi-
              family development is subject to Site and Architectural Review. Further discussion
              of General Plan designations and Zoning districts, including off-street parking and
              other development standards, is provided in Section 2.2a.
              Residential zones: According to the Zoning Code most new residential development
              in a residential zoning district will be located in a Performance Overlay Zone, which
              applies to all vacant residential lands in Hollister. The intent of the overlay district
              is to use flexible standards to foster development that meets the range of densities
              for the applicable General Plan land use designation to implement policies and
              programs in the General Plan. Programs and policies call for a variety of lot sizes
              and housing types in all districts, pedestrian connections between properties, solar
              access, clustered development to meet the average General Plan density for the
              property while avoiding development in areas with environmental constraints
              (e.g. flood, seismic, liquefaction, and habitat): or providing on-site amenities (trail
              easements, recreation), and to protect the character and scale of existing
              residential neighborhoods.

              Lot sizes may be varied in the Performance Overlay zone with a performance
              agreement to a minimum of 2,500 square feet where the base General Plan
              designation is Low Density Residential or Medium Density Residential. A more

              3.119. In the High Density General Plan designation, the lot size may be reduced
              to less than 2,500 square feet and the building height may be increased to 75 feet.
              A variety of housing types, setbacks and densities are allowed within a
              development with a performance agreement provided that the development
              density is consistent with the applicable General Plan land use designation for the
              property. Lot size is required to be similar to existing residential development
              unless the lot is within a zoning district and General Plan designation with a
              different density or transitional setbacks and landscaping are incorporated into the
              project design to assure that the new development is of a scale and character that
              is compatible with the existing residential neighborhood.
              An average development density of one to eight units per net acre is now required
              in the R1 L/PZ overlay zone with a targeted density of at least six units per net
              acre. An average development density of eight to 12 units per acre is required in
              the R3 M/PZ overlay zone and an average of 12 to 35 units per acre is required in
              the R4 H/PZ overlay zone. The overlay zoning will provide an incentive for
              property owners to include a variety of housing types with new residential
              development.
              Infill: The City is planning for infill residential development in established
              residential districts, especially in the Old Town zoning districts. Chapter 4, of the
              Zoning Ordinance establishes minimum lot sizes ranging from one housing unit per
              5 net acres in the Residential Estates district to 40 units per acre in the Downtown
              Mixed Use districts. The R1 low density district requires 5,500 square feet and
              6,500 square feet for corner units, the R2 medium density residential district requires
              8,000 square feet per unit, the R3 medium density multi-family district and Old
              Town medium density residential district require a minimum of 5,000 square feet
              per unit, 8,000 square feet for two units, and 11,000 square feet for three units and
              3,600 square feet for each additional unit. The R4 medium density high density
              district requires a minimum of 5,000 square feet for a one unit, 8,000 square feet for
              two units, and 9,000 square feet for three units 1,200 square feet for each additional
              unit.
              Mixed Use: In addition, to the residential districts, housing is allowed in the new
              mixed use Neighborhood Mixed Use (25- 35 du/ac), West Gateway (20-35 du/ac)
              and Downtown Commercial Mixed Use (25 – 40 du/ac) zoning districts.
              The recently adopted zoning ordinance provides additional areas for housing
              development and for the expansion in the supply of affordable housing units. In
              addition, amendments to the Zoning Map have been made to provide additional land
              for medium and high-density multi-family housing, and high density residential land
              uses in areas formerly zoned solely for commercial or industrial use in the new
              mixed-use districts.

              2.3.a (3) Local Entitlement Fees and Exactions
              Development Fees
              Local fees are necessary to process development applications; however,
              particularly after Proposition 13, cities must be concerned with the need to
              recover processing costs. Line item fees related to processing, inspection and
              installation services are limited by California law to the cost of the agencies
              performing these services. Table 2.3-52 shows typical planning and entitlement
              fees in Hollister, with a focus on residential fees.
              In addition to planning fees, Hollister has established a number of development
              impact fees in order to pay for the increased demand for City facilities such as
              waste water treatment, water, park development, storm drains, sewer lines, police
              and fire protection, and transportation improvements. Hollister has seen a growing
              need for infrastructure improvements, and costs to develop the City’s
              infrastructure and expand City services have been substantial.
              Like all local governments, Hollister also charges plan check fees for building,
              electrical, plumbing, and mechanical permits. Plan check fees based on project
              evaluation according to the Uniform Building Code are calculated at 65% of the
              prescribed building permit fee. An overall comparison of the total fees charged
              for a single-family and multi-family project is shown in Table 2.3-53. Per unit
              fees for a typical multi-family development are $32,788 for a 1,000 square foot
              unit; fees for a 2,000 square foot single family home are $51,196. Impact fees
              have increased to pay for necessary infrastructure, particularly the new
              wastewater treatment plant. Hollister’s development fees are passed on to project
              proponents; the schedule is appropriate to recapture the costs of services provided
              and maintain the standards set by the community. In order to encourage the
              development of affordable housing, the City has approved lower traffic and sewer
              impact fees for multi-family development.

                  Hollister has updated traffic, sewer and water connection fees between 2004 and
                  2008. The City’s planning fees are comparable to other jurisdictions in San
                  Benito County, (See Table 2.3-54). Fees are set up so that applications/projects
                  with administrative approval have a lower cost; projects with a higher dollar cost
                  are identified as major projects, and are therefore, charged a higher fee. As a
                  general rule, these fees do not act as a constraint against building affordable
                  housing, as they are set so as to recapture the cost of processing. Table 2.3-54
                  shows the fees charged for typical entitlements in the City of Hollister and
                  neighboring jurisdictions.

                   Fees, land dedications, or improvements are also required in most instances to
                   provide an adequate supply of public parkland and to provide necessary public
                   works infrastructure (streets, sewers, and storm drains) to support the new
                   development. Such costs are charged to the developer; however, costs are ultimately
                   passed to the consumer in the form of higher home prices or rents.
                   The significance of the necessary public works infrastructure improvements in
                   determining final costs varies greatly from project to project. The improvements are
                   dependent on the amount of existing improvements and nature of the project.
                   However, developers are required to install improvements necessary to serve their
                   project in order to not overburden the City’s systems, and continue to provide for
                   future growth.
                   The San Benito Joint Unified School District serves the City of Hollister. The
                   School District assesses a school impact fee on all new residential and
                   commercial development. As of 2008, multi-family and single-family fees are
                   $2.63 per square-foot and Commercial/Industrial fees are 0.42 per square foot.
                   In some instances, developers must weigh the benefits of building smaller units at
                   the maximum allowable density or fewer larger units at a density less than the
                   maximum. Either solution can have different impacts on the housing market.
                   Governmental laws and regulations have the potential to increase development
                   costs in any city. Requirements which relate to site coverage, landscaping,
                   parking, and open space within developments can indirectly increase costs by
                   limiting the number of dwelling units which can occupy a given piece of land. In
                   Hollister, the City Council has determined that required improvements are
                   necessary to maintain a uniform high level of quality community-wide. If the
                   City maintains certainty about their development requirements and they are
                   applied uniformly, the requirements function more as an expected development
                   standard, rather than existing as a constraint.

              Building a higher number of small units can reduce costs and provide additional
              housing opportunities for smaller households but does not accommodate the needs
              of larger families. Larger units can be made available to families, but because of
              their size and lower density, the cost of these units is higher.
              Other development and construction standards can also impact housing costs. Such
              standards may include the incorporation of additional design treatments
              (architectural details or trim, special building materials, landscaping, and textured
              paving) to improve the aesthetics of the development. Other standards included in
              the Uniform Building Code lists regulations regarding noise transmission and energy
              conservation. While some of these features (interior and exterior design treatments)
              are included by the developer to help sell the product in the competitive market,
              some features (e.g., energy conservation regulations) may actually reduce monthly
              living expenses by cutting heating and cooling costs in the long term.
              2.3.a (4) Processing and Permit Procedures
              Like all jurisdictions, the City of Hollister has procedures and regulations for
              project review and approval, some of which are mandated by State law. Virtually
              all development projects require some type of formal local approval and
              environmental assessment, many of which require public review and noticing and
              public hearings. A project proposed in Hollister is typically involved in some
              combination of the following review processes: environmental review; site and
              architectural review; subdivision maps; rezonings; residential unit allocation; use
              permits; and building permits. Average processing times for various planning
              activities in the City of Hollister are shown in Table 55. A conditional use permit
              and site and architectural review application process takes on average, about 45 to
              60 days if no environmental review is required. The City requires the plans to be
              prepared by a design professional. Tentative map review often requires
              environmental review, which extends the processing time by about 90 to 120
              days. The City of Hollister encourages pre-application meetings to help
              streamline the application processing time and costs by clarifying General Plan
              and zoning issues and resolving particular site development issues early on in the
              application process.
              All filing procedures are codified in Section 17.24.070 of the Zoning Ordinance;
              projects are required to follow application submittal procedures contained therein.
              For both a single family subdivisions and multi-family project, the required
              entitlements and review time in Table 55 apply. The primary difference is that
              multi-family projects require Site and Architectural review in addition to other
              requirements
              The City’s Residential Unit Allocation process prioritizes applications and grants
              development approval under the Growth Management Ordinance. The process is
              a separate review and action, which comes first, taking approximately 8 months
              for both single family and multi-family development. The remaining process is
              compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and
3.151 CITY OF HOLLISTER 2005 GENERAL PLAN

              entitlements, including the tentative map process, and the Site and Architectural
              review (for multi-family only). Usually, Planning Commission consideration of
              these actions takes place at one (1) meeting. The discretionary approvals would
              only be considered by the City Council if there is an appeal of a decision. The
              Site and Architectural review and tentative map process under a best-case
              scenario, takes approximately 60 days to 18 months depending on the requirement
              for environmental review. Finally, building permit issuance takes approximately
              two weeks.
              The adopted General Plan prioritizes infill development within the City of
              Hollister and then the Sphere of Influence. There is sufficient land within the
              City limits that is planned for residential development to comply with the City of
              Hollister’s new construction need requirements. The growth management rating
              system prioritizes approvals for projects located within the City of Hollister that
              are consistent the adopted general plan land use plan and zoning map.
              A General Plan Amendment, rezone or prezoning for annexation of property must
              be submitted by a property owner for review and approval by the Planning
              Commission and City Council. City Council authorization is required to initiate
              the amendment process and the legislative change requires City Council approval
              after a recommendation from the Planning Commission. When this occurs, it can
              add an additional 3-5 months to the process if annexation is not proposed. There
              may be an additional two to three months for approval of an annexation by the
              Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO). Program H.W. commits the
              City of Hollister to annexing at least 75 acres of land in the Sphere of Influence to
              assure that ample sites are available for the next Housing Element revisions.
              Total processing time for residential subdivisions and multi-family projects, from
              beginning to end, takes approximates 12 months at best, plus an additional two
              weeks for building permits. When advance review of a General Plan Amendment
              is required, the processing time becomes 25 months. The City recognizes that
              undue delays in processing project applications increases development costs and
              should be avoided, and will continue to actively work with the development
              community
              Development Review Committee
              All development applications are reviewed by the Development Review
              Committee (DRC). The DRC reviews the application within the first weeks of its
              submittal and helps determine whether the application is complete for pocessing.
              The DRC is an advisory level review body only, and has no discretionary ability;
              rather it is the equivalent of a staff level review. DRC members include staff
              from City departments and local agencies (e.g. water district, health department,
              transportation agency). Hollister’s planning application form encourages pre-
              development meetings to analyze proposals and resolve issues prior to a formal
              application submittal. If the city receives a complete application, the project is
              scheduled to appear before the committee with a draft Planning Commission staff
              report and draft conditions of approval. The DRC meetings are scheduled to

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                     Final Housing Element, November, 2009
              occur two weeks after receipt of the application packet and about 24 days before
              the Planning Commission meeting.               Staff routinely places preliminary
              applications at no cost on the Development Review Committee agenda to help
              resolve site specific issues prior to submittal of an application. This strategy helps
              assure submittal of a complete application and helps avoid re-submittals of
              applications and associated consulting costs.
              Project applicants file a standard application form with the City and are also
              required to submit conceptual site plans, and other supplemental information,
              such as architectural drawings. The City strives to issue a written response to the
              project proponent of the decision and/or recommendations of the DRC within five
              (5) working days following the DRC committee meeting.
              Site and Architectural Review
              The City requires Site and Architectural Review for new construction of multi-
              family residential and mixed use buildings. Site and Architectural Review is
              required to review traffic congestion and safety, mutli-modal facilities, drainage,
              orientation of buildings in relation to surrounding land uses, design and
              landscaping. Development of mixed use projects require Site and Architectural
              review identically to other new construction; no Conditional Use Permit or other
              prerequisite is placed on mixed use projects. In summary, mixed use projects are
              treated the same as other new construction.
              Section 17.24.190 of the Zoning Ordinance contains the City’s procedures for Site
              and Architectural Review, and specifies materials, treatments, and overall
              architecture. Supplemental procedures are also contained in the City’s uniform
              application form. Applicants are aware at time of project application what is
              required for Site and Architectural review. During the Development Review
              Committee hearing, discussed above, staff provides applicants with feedback on
              their proposal as well as any requests for additional information. Review then
              follows the same hearing process and is submitted to the Planning Commission.
              No City Council approval is required for Site and Architectural review.
              Program H.OO has been included as part of this housing element to monitor the
              Site Plan and Architectural review process for possible adverse impacts on the
              development of affordable housing. If the processes are determined to be a
              constraint, the City will take adequate measures to modify the program or
              otherwise mitigate the constraints.
              Environmental Review Procedures
              According to State environmental law (CEQA), discretionary actions (such as a
              General Plan Amendment, Zone Change, and Specific Plan), which may have an
              effect on the environment, require the preparation of an Environmental Impact
              Report (EIR) or a Negative Declaration, (Neg. Dec.) or Mitigated Negative
              Declaration (MND) prior to project approval. The need to prepare the necessary
              environmental review can substantially lengthen the development review process,

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                    Final Housing Element, November, 2009
              often taking up to one year to obtain project approval. The local environmental
              review procedures are contained in Section 17.24.100 of the Zoning Ordinance,
              and are reflective of statewide standards. For projects requiring a CEQA
              document, the review is part of the multi-part application package.
              The construction of individual single-family dwellings is Categorically Exempt
              from CEQA requirements (CEQA Guidelines Section 15303) and most multi-
              family residential projects can be approved with the issuance of a Negative
              Declaration. Conditional Use Permits and Second Dwelling Units may also be
              exempt from CEQA, depending on whether the individual project can be
              considered infill development.
              The amount of time required to process CEQA environmental review documents
              in Hollister is comparable with other jurisdictions across the state, and is not
              considered a significant constraint to the development of housing. The City will
              continue to take constructive steps to help facilitate new development and
              improve the efficiency of the review process, including the periodic review and
              monitoring of review processes to identify potential constraints.

                 The amount of time required to process permits in Hollister is not considered a
                 significant constraint to the development of housing. The City has taken
                 constructive steps to help facilitate new development and improve the efficiency
                 of the review process, and will continue to do so.
                 2.3.a (5) Growth Management
                 The City of Hollister first adopted Growth Management Ordinance 550 in 1982
                 because of a concern that the rate of growth and development was outpacing the
                 City’s ability to provide services, particularly water and wastewater, police, fire,
                 parks, schools, and storm drainage. In the intervening years, Ordinance 550 was
                 amended and a variety of growth management programs have been used to
                 regulate the creation of lots for residential subdivisions or for construction of
                 multi-family residential development in Hollister.
                 The Hollister General Plan became integral to the implementation of the growth
                 management system. In addition to the community’s concern about utility
                 services, citizens also desired to create a higher quality of development and to

              ensure the provision of units across all income categories. According to a study
              completed in 2004 by the Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy, out of the
              University of Michigan, entitled, “Growth Management Policy in California
              Communities”, the City of Hollister generally “fits the profile” of California cities
              with growth management systems. While much of the focus of the study was on
              cities with growth boundaries, or urban limit lines, a feature the City of Hollister
              does not share, lessons can be drawn from this study and applied to Hollister. In
              many of the cities cited in the study, urban limit lines were part of a larger growth
              management strategy. The growth management strategy employed in Hollister
              still yields the same result with respect to growth management in general.
              One of the findings contained in the study is that growth management, in a high
              number of cases, results in increased densities within the community. Logic
              follows that if growth outward is limited, either by an urban limit line, or by
              awarding projects higher points for proximity to the City center and multi-
              family/mixed use housing, the approach taken by Hollister, more compact
              development and increased densities are encouraged and promoted. The study
              concluded that communities with growth management tend to grow slower than
              communities without, and that they grow increasingly more dense over time.
              Chapter 2, Section 1.a of this Housing Element documents that even with growth
              management, the City of Hollister was one of the fastest growing communities in
              the area between 1990 and 2008. The growth management program has not
              inhibited the construction of affordable housing projects in the City of Hollister.
              Rather, between 1984 and 1999, 950 affordable housing units were approved and
              constructed in Hollister (56 small lot manufactured homes, 327 very low-income,
              units, and 542 low-income affordable units). Units developed included a
              combination of apartments, approximately 230 self-help housing units, single
              family homes, and first-time homebuyer affordable units
              According to the University of Michigan report, other cities’ experience with
              growth management in many ways reflects the City of Hollister’s experience; that
              rather than creating an artificial limitation on the development of affordable units,
              there is a higher propensity for lower income projects to be approved. The City
              has developed growth management scoring and ranking criteria that reserves
              allocations for affordable housing as well as categories to foster multi-family
              housing (mixed zoning district where the minimum density of 20 to 25 units per
              acre meets the default density for affordable housing and the multi-family zoning
              districts). The scoring awards projects higher points for providing higher
              affordability levels (density mix); the system also awards higher point scores for
              the provision of amenities that work to carry out principles of walkabilitity and
              sustainability, including green building principles, efficient transportation
              infrastructure, and the provision of green space.
              Now that the City has emerged from the wastewater treatment capacity related
              moratorium on growth, the growth management program can continue to function
              as it has in the past, allowing for and encouraging a wide range of residential
              development across all income categories.

              In addition, the City is committing additional resources to removing barriers to
              affordable projects, and actively encouraging such developments in many parts of
              the City. Included as part of this Housing Element are incentives to further
              facilitate the development of affordable units, most notably within the Measure Y
              Exemption area. Financial incentives have been included that will reward
              projects for boosting density and for developing projects where one or more
              smaller lots are consolidated to create a larger lot. The programs will work to
              encourage affordable projects in the Measure Y. Program H. F also prioritizes
              future growth management allocations or exemptions in the multi-family, mixed
              use and Old Town districts.
              As indicated above, the City’s successful experiences functioning under a growth
              management program since 1982, serve to demonstrate that there are minimal
              adverse impacts associated with the additional processing time associated with the
              growth management program. In addition, the first allocations since emerging
              from the moratorium (multiple year allocation) should not unduly hamper
              development. As of the drafting of this revised document in August, 2009, the
              allocations have been processed by the City. Appendix I is included indicating
              where those allocations have taken place in the context of the ‘realistic capacity’
              for the inventory of potential housing sites identified by the City in Appendix F.
              The City has a pent up demand for construction and all parties are operating
              equally under the new system. However, the City will remain mindful of the
              potential for the rating and ranking system to place an extra burden on the
              development community, particularly affordable multi-family developers. The
              City will remain flexible within the parameters of the Growth Management
              Ordinance to amend the process to relieve any potential constraints. Program
              H.PP commits the City to remaining vigilant about identifying and mitigating any
              adverse constraints the program may have on the development of housing
              affordable to lower income families.

              Measure U Growth Initiative
              In 2002, the voters of the City of Hollister approved a Growth Management
              initiative. The Declaration of Intent at Section 16.64.010 provides the following
              stated intents of the initiative:
                      To encourage a rate of residential growth within the City which will not
                       exceed the City’s ability to provide adequate and efficient public services,
                       including sewer, water, police, fire, streets, parks, general administration,
                       and maintenance of public facilities, or the ability of the local economy,
                       including the City’s financial capacity, to support such growth, maintain
                       and improve the quality of the environment considering the City’s natural
                       setting, including water courses, viable agricultural/open lands,
                       recreational , historic and scenic areas;
                      To encourage and promote a balanced community with adequate housing
                       to meet the needs of local employment and residents;
                      To encourage the construction of an appropriate share of the regional need
                       for housing;
                      To encourage and promote housing programs and activities to enable the
                       City to meet the needs of all economic segments of the community,
                       including the provision of adequate levels of rental housing; and
                      Provide and maintain a sound economic base for the City.
              Under the Measure U Ordinance, the City is able to award allocations of 254
              units/building permits per year, of which 40 units are reserved for low and very
              low income housing. Measure U will expire in January, 2012. It should be noted
              that Section 16.64.30 specifically identifies residential projects that are exempted
              from the Growth Management Program. These exemptions include the following.
                   1. Replacement residential units or the relocation of an existing dwelling unit
                       to a legal lot of record;
                   2. Single family residential units to be constructed on single legal lots of
                       record in existence prior to July 1, 2000; and
                   3. Secondary residential units, i.e. second units, subject to the provision of
                       Section 17.44.180 of the code.
              In addition, Section 16.64.025 provides the following definitions of types of
              residential projects that are covered by the Growth Management Ordinance:
                   1. Affordable Housing: housing units affordable to families with incomes at
                       or below one hundred twenty (120) percent of the county median income,
                       including very low, low, medium and moderate income units;
                   2. Below market rate housing: housing units with prices or rental levels
                       established at less than market rate, and affordable to families with
                       incomes below one-hundred twenty (120 percent of the county median
                       income;

                      3. Market rate housing: housing units selling or renting for prices or levels
                             set by the housing market;
                      4. Senior Housing: housing that is available only to seniors, in accordance
                             with state and federal housing laws and guidelines; and
                      5. Small residential project: a residential project consisting of no more than
                             eight single family residential units or lots, or a subdivision of land into no
                             more than eight lots.
                 Measure Y Exemptions: The City Council placed Measure Y on the November
                 2008 ballot to amend Measure U to exempt from the growth management
                 program residential development projects in the 148.5 acre downtown area of
                 Hollister (See Figure 1). The voters passed Measure Y. The approved residential
                 exemption area encompasses all of the Downtown Commercial Mixed Use zoning
                 district and lands in the Neighborhood Mixed Use zoning district located east and
                 south of downtown. An estimated 160 units in these two (2) districts will be
                 generated by 2014.
                 Measure U Allocations during the program period: The Hollister City Council
                 approved a rating scale in December 2008 for a three-year allocation based on the
                 Measure U growth rates. However, based on an existing ordinance and a
                 performance agreement, the first year allocation is reduced by 23 units. The
                 purpose of the three-year allocation is to streamline the permit review process,
                 approve an ample supply of allocations to provide certainty for applicants,
                 approve a variety of housing densities and types and ensure enough allocations
                 for viable projects. The City Council allocated 700 building units for calendar
                 years 2008, 2009, and 2010 in July of 2009. An additional 20 affordable units
                 remain available for allocation immediately. Staff is meeting with affordable
                 housing providers for possible sites. The City Council determined that the priority
                 for allocations for 2008, 2009 and 2010 should be distributed by General Plan
                 designations, with the exception of small projects of no more than eight (8) total
                 units. The priorities have been established as follows:

              Growth Management Scoring and Rating: For the 2008, 2009 and 2010
              allocation period, the rating criteria has been developed to prioritize infill
              development where services are available and (5) categories: a) Conformance
              with Land Use Goals, General Plan compliance and the provision of Critical
              Infrastructure; b) satisfying the need for balanced Transportation/Circulation; c)
              the utilization of Green Building Concepts; d) providing for a Housing Density
              Mix; and e) an ample use of high quality Design Elements (please see Rating
              Criteria in Appendix T-F.. The guiding principle for each of the five categories is
              to provide amenities/elements above and beyond the minimum necessary to
              satisfy the established requirement. This process will facilitate scoring and
              ranking of proposed projects. A copy of the full text of the Growth Management
              Project Rating Scale is included as Technical Appendix T-F to this Housing
              Element. The City of Hollister Planning Commission will made recommendation
              to the City Council for building unit allocations based on the ranking.
              As noted above, the City has allocated 3 years’ worth of growth allocations in a
              single year. Table 2.2-50 has been included in Section 2.2b on page 3-129 and
              130, (along with a narrative discussion) as part of the City’s Sites Inventory
              analysis. The table shows projects that received growth allocations for the years
              2008-2010, and the accompanying project densities. One-hundred of the 678
              allocations were allocated to an affordable project (Rajkovich), located in an R1
              overlay zone. Still other allocations were for multi-family and mixed-use projects
              in the Neighborhood Mixed Use, West Gateway Mixed Use, R4-H/Performance
              Overlay Zone and R3-M/Performance Overlay Zone districts. The two mixed use
              projects (148 units) had densities of 20 units per acre or higher. An additional 20
              units have been reserved for an affordable project and allocations can be awarded
              immediately.
              Applicants that are awarded allocations will be required to enter into a
              performance agreement. The agreement will require the applicant to pursue
              development in a timely manner or the allocations will be re-issued to another
              party.
              The City of Hollister will re-assess and amend as needed the approved 2008-2010
              growth management scoring and rating program prior to accepting applications
              for 288 allocations for the 2011-2012 period. Program H.Q. contains language
              requiring that at least 60% of the allocations (293) to be awarded to development
              with densities of at least 20 units per acre of which 80 will be reserved for
              affordable housing and 50 units will be reserved for a lot consolidation project.
              Allowable Units under Measure U during the Housing Element Period: As
              illustrated in Table 2.3-57, the City will realize sufficient Growth Management
              Allocations and accompanying building permits to be able to construct the
              required number of units according to the RHNA. While the City is restricted to a
              maximum of 240 allocations/permits through the year 2012; thereafter the
              General Plan provides that, post sunset of Measure U, a sufficient number of units
              (254 annually), plus exempt units in the downtown infill area, and those from

Note:
(1) Program H.T requires a study to determine whether or not growth management is
      warranted after the expiration of Measure U and to assure adequate allocations are
      available to meet the City’s remaining housing need by all income levels. Any growth
      management program for the remainder of the program period shall include allocations for
      at least 254 dwelling units per year. If residential development is less than expected in the
      Measure Y exemption area, additional allocations at densities of 20 units per acre or more
      shall be awarded to assure that the New Construction needs can be fulfilled by 2014 per
      Program H.T.
                Approximately 57% of the allocations are prioritized for multi-family and mixed
                use designations, helping to reduce an existing shortage of multi-family housing.
                In the last two years of Measure U, a second round allocation for 488 units will
                occur for the years 2011 and 2012.

              Post Measure “U” Growth Management: Program: H.N. requires a study in
              2011 to assess whether or not a growth management program is warranted when
              Measure U expires based on type and prices of housing generated between 2009
              and 2011. If it is determined that a growth management program is warranted,
              Program H.N. includes possible types of exemptions (e.g. 100% affordable,
              certain types of infill, lot consolidation, downtown mixed use Measure y
              exemption area) and requires any growth program to be consistent with general
              plan growth rate of at least 254 dwelling units per year, as shown in Table LU1 of
              the General Plan Land Use and Community Design Element. If development
              continues at the projected rate shown in Table LU1 of the City of Hollister
              General Plan, approximately 508 new residences are realized based on 254
              dwelling units per year.
              2.3.a (6) Building Codes and Code Enforcement
              The City of Hollister has adopted the California Building Code (2007) part of the
              Uniform Building Code that sets minimum standards for residential development
              and all other structures. The standards may add material and labor costs, but are
              accepted state-wide as necessary minimum standards of safety. They do not pose
              a special constraint to the production of housing, but rather, protect the
              community.
              Building code compliance for pre-existing units is limited to the enforcement of
              health and safety standards, rather than new construction building codes. The
              City’s Code Enforcement Department will continue to abate, on a complaint
              basis, illegal second units that pose significant life-endangering conditions. In
              these cases, the City enforces an ordinance that requires owners of illegal units to
              provide three months rent to displaced renters.
               As part of the City’s ongoing program to encourage legalization of illegal units
              where life safety is not an issue, the City, through the RDA will offer
              rehabilitation loans to homeowners to make necessary repairs and modifications
              to illegal units to encourage conformance with the City’s new second unit
              development standards, subject to the availability of Affordable Housing funds.
              The City of Hollister has experienced a high per capita foreclosure rate recently.
              The Council approved a vacant house ordinance to avoid public nuisance and
              potential destruction of property associated with vacated homes. Members of the
              City Council, Redevelopment Agency staff in partnership with San Benito County
              staff, continue to participate in town hall meetings for educational outreach to the
              community about how foreclosures can be avoided.
              The City maintains an ongoing program of inspection and enforcement with its
              Code Enforcement officer and temporary staff. Redevelopment and Code
              Enforcement personnel staff work as partners in the process to identify and
              convert substandard and dilapidated housing conditions. The Code Enforcement
              division conducted an average of 42 inspections for “substandard housing”
              violations over the past four (4) years; activity is currently done on a complaint

              basis. As funding permits, enforcement related to dilapidated housing within the
              City will be done on a proactive basis in an effort to reduce the number of
              dilapidated and unsafe structures in the City. One full time officer and one part
              time person work through the Community Development Department handling
              Code Enforcement Violations. The City has a past practice of referring
              residential rehabilitation violations to the Redevelopment Agency for potential
              housing rehabilitation assistance and will continue to do so. The City has
              identified the need to implement proactive code enforcement, as funding permits,
              to further enhance the City’s ability to maintain the affordable housing stock.
              2.3.a (7) On- and Off-Site Improvements
              For residential projects, the City requires both on- and off-site improvements.
              These include: curb/gutter and drainage facilities, sidewalks, paved streets,
              landscaping and water and sewer service. Such improvements are required as a
              condition of the subdivision map, or if a map is not required, improvements are
              required as part of the development project. These on- and off-site improvements
              promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public.
              Curbs/gutters and drainage facilities direct storm and runoff water out of
              residential developments. City roadways are required to be paved. Pavement
              creates an all-weather roadway, facilitates roadway drainage, and reduces dust.
              Pavement also produces a high-speed circulation system and facilitates relatively
              safe traffic movement. Roadways are classified by the City according to traffic
              needs, as follows:
                     Urban Arterial Highway: highway with 4 lanes and left turn pockets
                     Major Highway: highway with 4 lanes and left turn pockets
                     Secondary Highway: highway with 4 lanes
                     Collector: highway with 2 lanes
              Arterials, highways, and collector streets are designated in the Hollister General
              Plan Circulation Element according to existing and projected needs. Developers
              are responsible for the development of roadways associated with their residential
              project. Development impact fees are in place to pay development’s fair share of
              costs for infrastructure needs, including traffic, fire, parks and recreation, water,
              sewer, and other public facilities.
              2.3.a (8) Wastewater Treatment
              The City has put in place a Long-term Wastewater Management Plan (LTWMP),
              and has completed construction of a new state-of-the-art wastewater treatment
              plant and reclamation facility, that began operation in September, 2008. A more
              detailed discussion of the City’s new wastewater treatment plant can be found in
              Section 2.2 of this document.

              2.3.a (9) Off-Street Parking/Garages
              Off Street Parking
              Detached single family homes are generally required to provide two spaces per
              dwelling unit. The provision of off-street parking for multiple family uses is
              determined by the use. The City is currently reviewing the parking standards for
              multi-family housing to link the standard to number of bedrooms. Parking based
              on the number of bedrooms would reduce off-street parking requirements for
              studios and one bedroom apartments. The City will continue to implement
              recently adopted measures to reduce the required parking freeing up more land
              area for the provision of housing, particularly in the downtown and mixed use
              zones. Measures include creating shared parking where feasible, utilizing
              compact spaces, and providing a waiver of the parking requirement for low
              income housing. Off-street parking requirements for second units include
              development of a total of four spaces for both the primary and secondary unit,
              although the planning commission may authorize a total of three spaces if one of
              the units has one bedroom or less and require one off-street parking space in
              setback areas per studio unit. Off-street parking requirements and other
              development standards are included in Section 2.2a; for reference the Residential
              Sections of the Zoning Ordinance are also included within Technical Appendix T-
              G to the housing element.
              Garages
              The City of Hollister encourages minimizing the visual impact of garages and/or
              covered carports. As stated in the Hollister General Plan, garages and driveways
              are to be located to the side of buildings and recess, or along rear alleyways or
              below the building in some higher density developments. The City discourages
              home designs in which garages dominate the public façade of the home.
              2.3.a (10) Open Space
              Residential
              Residential development should include open space as an integral part of a project
              or with the dedication of land for open space, and identify limitations to uses in
              those areas, such as restrictions on ornamental landscaping, structures and fences.
              Private/Public Open Space
              Through the development review process, the City of Hollister General Plan states
              that the City will preserve open space areas and encourage the dedication of open
              space areas that are adjacent to public open space. In addition, when potential
              open space is not contiguous to existing public open space, the preference is to
              retain the open space in private ownership. When portions of a site are retained as
              private open space, the City ensures the preservation and management of that
              open space through appropriate means, including required maintenance, as
              determined through development review. The City will work with other public
              and non-profit agencies to identify sources for acquisition and maintenance of

               open space. A minimum of 450 square feet of usable private yard area per unit is
               also required.
               2.3.a (11) Persons with Disabilities
               The City of Hollister conscientiously and specifically, implements and monitors
               compliance with SB 520 (Article 10) in the review of its General Plan, zoning
               ordinances, development codes, construction and re-construction regulations, and in
               the development of multi-family housing.
               In order to provide exceptions in zoning and land use for housing persons with
               disabilities, the City has adopted written procedures as of October, 2008 to handle
               written land use and zoning decisions and procedures for formal requests for
               “Reasonable Accommodation” related to siting, development, funding and use of
               housing for person with disabilities. A copy of the Resolution and written
               procedures is included as Technical Appendix T-H to this housing element. It is
               incumbent on the City to strive to make sure the health and safety of adjacent
               residents are not jeopardized, by granting reasonable accommodation exceptions.
               The zoning ordinance requires submittal of a vehicular and pedestrian plan for new
               development with requirements for American with Disabilities Act accessible
               connections between sidewalks, buildings and adjoining properties, shaded
               (deciduous acceptable) corridors, separation of paths from internal roads and
               contrasting paving (no paint) where crossing through an internal road cannot be
               avoided.
               Supportive multi-family or single-family housing for the disabled is specifically
               permitted in any residential zone that permits multi-family complexes. Depending
               on the size of the development, they are required to provide handicapped parking
               spaces. The City is flexible and works with the developers of special needs housing
               and will reduce parking requirements if the applicant can demonstrate a reduced
               need for parking. The new Zoning Code, Title 17 (see Table 17.04-1) establishes a
               residential care facility for seven (7) or fewer occupants as a permitted use in all
               residential districts; facilities for eight (8) or more and supportive housing are
               permitted with a Use Permit in the High Density districts.
       2.3.b. NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
       The ability to address the needs of underserved citizens of the City of Hollister must
       overcome a variety of obstacles, many of which are beyond the scope of municipal
       government. The responsibility for identifying, responding to, and mitigating these needs
       rests with the agencies providing services. Funding limitations exist at all levels.
       Market forces influence the stability of housing units and rental prices. This includes
       existing and new dwelling units. While actions within the public sector play important parts
       in determining the cost of housing, pricing in the private sector is still the primary
       determinant of residential markets due to development costs (e.g., land, construction
       materials, financing) and consumer preference.

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                              Final Housing Element, November, 2009
         State law requires an analysis of potential and actual governmental and non-
         governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing
         for all income levels. The Housing Element must identify ways, if any, to reduce or
         overcome these constraints in order to meet the City’s housing needs.
                  2.3.b (1) Land and Construction Costs
                  A number of costs are involved in the development of housing. These include the
                  cost of land, materials, labor, financing, fees and associated development
                  requirements, sales and marketing costs, and profit. Because many of these costs
                  are determined by economic markets, it is difficult for a local government to
                  mitigate or reduce them. A jurisdiction’s land use policies, however, do directly
                  influence the value of developable land.
                  The City of Hollister has not approved a subdivision with one acre lots. Larger
                  lots of one-half and 1 acre or more are found outside of the city’s limits in the
                  unincorporated area of San Benito County. As an example of 2005 land costs, a
                  developer of a 297-acre subdivision containing 35 lots, improved with
                  undergrounded utilities, is currently marketing 1+ acre lots for $320,000 to
                  $335,000. These are intended to be improved with high-end homes that are
                  affordable to above-moderate incomes.
                  Developable land under the City’s control is currently subjected to the General
                  Plan, Zoning, and other development policy. In 2005, according to local realtors,
                  a lot zoned R-1 with a lot size between 4,500 and 6,500 square feet typically sold
                  between $150,000 and $160,000.
                  According to a local engineer, R-1 lots may be valued around $100,000 to
                  $125,000 but the real estate market is in uncharted waters. Local land values have
                  been suppressed by the high number of foreclosures in Hollister2. Lenders are
                  repossessing homes faster than they are being sold causing declining market
                  values in the City of Hollister. As of January 1st, 2009 the median home sales
                  price for San Benito County has dropped 35.19% from 2007 to $259,250.00
                  increasing the number of negative equity at-risk homeowners. According to the
                  San Benito County Assessors’ Office, some older homes on 6,000 square foot lots
                  in Hollister are now selling for $150,000 - $180,000, which is close to the value
                  of a vacant lot.
                  Construction costs vary depending upon the type of materials and finishes used.
                  According to local developers, hard construction costs for housing typically range
                  from $60 to $70 per square foot. Including the cost of land, site improvements,
                  and development fees, a typical house will cost approximately $200 per sq. ft. or,
                  for example, $400,000 for a 2,000 sq. ft. single-family unit. However, a local

  Based on rough estimates from the City of Hollister Code Enforcement between 3000 and 5000 foreclosures have
occurred in Hollister over the past couple of years.

              engineer has stated that due to the current market conditions, a 2000 square foot
              home may sell for $350,000.
              Other than owner-builders, there may be little incentive to construct market rate
              homes for re-sale until land values stabilize in the first part of the program period.
              The City of Hollister is seeking partnerships with the Redevelopment Agency, the
              San Benito County Housing Coordinator, San Benito County, non-profits and
              Economic Stimulus funding to address the foreclosure issues in order to avoid
              additional foreclosures and stabilize land values
              2.3.b (2) Availability of Financing
              An important factor in determining the availability of affordable homeownership
              opportunities is the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates. Interest
              rates are determined by the market and are affected by the general health of the
              economy, Federal Reserve Board policy, the current and expected rates of
              inflation, Federal fiscal policy, and other factors. In recent years, interest rates
              have been at historical lows. Currently 30-year conventional mortgage rates are at
              around 6%; lower interest rates are available for a variety of financing options.
              It has become increasingly difficult for homebuyers without sufficient assets or
              home equity to qualify for financing without above-moderate incomes. Even
              those with above moderate incomes are finding it more difficult to obtain
              financing. The median price for a house in Hollister was $426,275 in May 2008.
              Assuming a 10% down payment and an interest rate of 6% with a 30 year fixed
              loan, the monthly payment of the median priced home would be $3,011. A
              monthly payment of $3,011 would require a household income of $120,000 to
              qualify for the loan. The median household income for a family of four is
              currently $67,100.
              2.3.b (3) Condominium Conversions
              As the availability of land decreases and the cost of land increases, there is a trend
              by developers to actively pursue the conversion of rental stock into more
              affordable homeownership condominium units. Condominium conversions can
              become one of the ways the City of Hollister can meet the demand for first time
              home buyer housing. However, while it does address the demand for home-
              ownership, the conversions can remove necessary rental housing targeted to those
              households in the moderate incomes who may not be able to afford to buy a
              house.
              The City adopted and will continue to enforce the condominium conversion
              ordinance No. 1022 in 2007 that links the rate of conversion to the generation of
              new multi-family housing rental stock. Until the number of multi-family units in
              the housing stock increases to above 20%, the conversion rate will be limited to
              25% of the yearly average of multi-family rental units constructed in the previous
              to years. The conversion rate increases to 50% when the multi-family stock
              increases to above 20% of the citywide housing stocks.

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                     Final Housing Element, November, 2009
               City recognizes that some of the housing stock that may be converted would
               otherwise be affordable to tenants with low or moderate income, thus removing
               viable rental stock from the City’s rental market. The City has approved projects
               that will generate 205 affordable rental units (Vista Meadows, Westside
               Apartments and Award Homes). In 2009, the City of Hollister will approve
               allocations for up to 709 dwelling units for 2008, 2009 and 2010. The approved
               rating scale priorities allocate 58% of the dwelling units to General Plan
               designations with medium to high density residential densities, which will help
               encourage the construction of additional multi-family rental housing stock.
               Furthermore, the City will continue to seek assistance of other affordable housing
               developers, primarily through partnerships, in the rehabilitation and preservation
               of these units while establishing affordability covenants to ensure the affordability
               of the project over time.
       2.3.c. CONSTRAINT REMOVAL EFFORTS
       Cost implications for developers of low-income housing can be significant when any
       increase inhibits the ability to provide units affordable to their clients. To offset
       developer’s costs, fees may be lowered or eliminated by the Department Director on a
       case by case basis. The City continues to participate in funding programs to facilitate the
       development of affordable housing; the City will also actively seek funding from all
       sources to facilitate affordable housing development. Concurrent processing and
       development processing assistance for affordable projects will assist the development
       community to reduce costs and time associated with the approval process.
       The City continues to offer cost reductions to developers, primarily through the activity
       of the Hollister Redevelopment Agency. The Agency offers cost savings, including
       financing options for affordable housing, through its Hollister Second Mortgage Program,
       the Owner Occupied Rehabilitation Program, and is implementing new programs as part
       of this housing element to increase the supply and availability of affordable housing
       opportunities. New programs include Tenant Based Rental Assistance, and the
       Foreclosed Home Reactivation Program to return foreclosed homes to the active market.
       The City has also participated either directly or indirectly in the following efforts to
       reduce other potential constraints on housing development in the City.
               2.3.c (1) Traffic
               Hollister’s tremendous growth in the 1990’s has impacted the City’s ability to
               maintain roadways with acceptable levels of service. State Highway 25, the City’s
               major east-west two-lane corridor that currently runs through the downtown area,
               has become increasingly dangerous and congested. Historical records indicate
               seventy collisions on Highway 25 annually.
               In response to the well documented safety concerns, Highway 25 is currently
               being rerouted around the downtown section of Hollister with a recently
               completed “Highway 25 By-Pass”. The bypass is anticipated to provide a north-

              south corridor connecting commuters to residential areas and reduce traffic
              congestion in the downtown area, improve safety conditions in and around
              downtown and help foster a transition to a mixed use downtown. The City of
              Hollister Redevelopment Agency partnered with the Hollister Downtown
              Association to fund a strategic plan for downtown Hollister that was completed in
              2008. The plan includes concepts for a post-bypass pedestrian oriented corridor
              on Main Street.
              At the west entrance to Hollister, the Redevelopment Agency has prioritized a
              project to construct streetscape, traffic calming, landscaping and lighting in the
              West Gateway mixed use district.
              The San Benito County Council of Governments is preparing a Pedestrian and
              Bicycle Master Plan. Gaps in connectivity for pedestrian and bicycle corridors
              have been identified as an issue with public outreach for the Master Plan and the
              Housing Element Update at community meetings.
              Partnerships between the city, local organizations, the redevelopment agency, the
              San Benito County Council of Governments for a combination of pedestrian,
              parking, and streetscape improvements should enhance the economic vitality of
              the downtown, the West Gateway, and make the area more desirable
              neighborhood for future residents and visitors, thereby mitigating what has
              otherwise been a constraint on development in Hollister.
              2.3.c (2) Fee Reductions and Other Considerations
              Cost implications for developers of low-income housing can be significant when any
              increase inhibits the ability to provide units affordable to their clients. To offset
              development costs, fees may be lowered by the City. Further, cost reductions can
              occur in the form of increased densities and concessions such as flexibility in site
              development standards and zoning code requirements, and financial aid from the
              Redevelopment Agency. The City continues to allow the deferment of impact fees
              until time of Certificate of Occupancy. The City will continue to employ
              constraint removal efforts to facilitate increased opportunities for the development
              of affordable housing.
              2.3.c (3) Wastewater Treatment Capacity
              The City has put in place a Long-term Wastewater Management Plan (LTWMP),
              and has completed construction of a new state-of-the-art wastewater treatment
              plant and reclamation facility, that began operation in September, 2008 that has
              capacity for the 2023 build-out of the general plan and expansion capacity.
              2.3.c (4) Density Bonus Program
              The City adopted as part of the revised Title 17 a Density Bonus program in
              accordance with the current provisions of State law. The density bonus
              provisions will encourage an increase in the supply of housing for lower income
3.170 CITY OF HOLLISTER 2005 GENERAL PLAN
3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                      Final Housing Element, November, 2009
              groups, including very low and low income households. Well designed housing is
              important for all economic segments of the population. The entire Density Bonus
              program is contained in Technical Appendix T-G to this document. The program
              contains provision to allow bonuses of at least 25 percent for projects containing
              affordable units, and provides other incentives/concessions, including, but not
              limited to the following:
                      Up to 15% reduction in landscaping requirements;
                      Reduction in required off-street parking;
                      Waiver of fees;
                      Approval of mixed use buildings or development in conjunction with the
                       residential development, if non-residential land uses will reduce the cost
                       of the residential development, and if the City finds that the proposed non-
                       residential uses are compatible with the residential development and with
                       existing or planned development in the area where the proposed residential
                       development will be located; and
                      Up to 15% reduction in lot dimensions.
              The City has identified the need to amend Title 17 to comply with recent
              amendments to State Law. Program H.HH requires the amendments to be
              completed by January 2010 and subsequent amendments are warranted by
              changes to state law.
              2.3.c (5) Growth Management Rating Scale
              As discussed above, beginning on page 11, the City has adopted the Growth
              Management Rating Scale, which will allow the City to score and rank
              development projects. The rating scale for the years 2008- 2010 supports the
              construction of high density and mixed use housing (see Technical Appendix T-
              F). Measure Y, passed in December, 2008, exempts new units in the Downtown
              Commercial Mixed-Use District and portions of the Neighborhood Mixed Use
              district east of downtown from the allocation program.
              2.3.c (6) Mixed Use Zoning
              As part of Title 17, the City adopted Mixed Use development standards to make
              possible affordable housing projects as part of a mixture of other uses, such as
              second and third story residential uses over commercial uses and offices on the
              ground floor. Overall, the Mixed Use, with flexible zoning standards, such as
              height bonuses, alternative parking arrangements, and other City concessions, the
              City will have at its disposal another tool to encourage and facilitate the
              development of housing affordable to all income groups including lower income.
              To provide further incentive for mixed use development in the Measure Y
              exemption area, a program has been included to adopt a Zoning Ordinance
              amendment to review infill projects on a case-by-case basis.

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                      Final Housing Element, November, 2009
                2.3.c (7) Second Units
                As discussed at length in Section 2.2.a of this housing element, the City has
                completely revised its regulation of second units to make eliminate the
                requirement for a conditional use permit and allow second units in the City with a
                building permit if performance standards can be met, thereby creating another
                opportunity for affordable housing opportunities in the City.
                The City does not allow construction of single family residences and in-turn
                accessory second units in mixed use and the R3, R4 zoning districts in order to
                assure that land is not underdeveloped. A Program (Section 4.0 H.E)
                recommends amending the zoning ordinance to allow accessory second units with
                a building permit in the R3, R4 and Mixed Use zoning districts if there is
                evidence that an existing single family residence has been constructed on a lot
                that is less than 8,000 square feet in size, there is not potential for lot
                consolidation and performance standards for the accessory second unit can be
                met.
                2.3.c (8) Lot Consolidation Incentives
                For projects where several smaller lots are consolidated to create a more
                developable site, Programs H.F, H.Q, H.BB, include incentives including
                Redevelopment Agency participation to offer financing assistance for projects
                that provide affordable units.
                 2.3.c (9) Infill Development
                To stimulate infill development, the City is offering incentives such as reducing
                and or eliminating off-street parking requirements, adopting flexible development
                standards, and creating a new R4-20 Zoning district with allowable densities of
                20-35 units per acre (see Program H.H, H.I, and H.N).
       2.3.d. OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
       Housing elements are required to identify opportunities for energy conservation. The
       increasing cost of energy highlights the importance of reducing energy use by
       homeowners. Energy conservation reduces monthly housing costs and helps to ease the
       energy shortage. Programs that promote the use of renewable energy technologies can
       further minimize the use of nonrenewable resources.
       The City of Hollister seeks to encourage energy conservation for homeowners. Title 24
       energy conservation requirements are required for all new construction. The standards
       may increase initial construction costs, but over time result in energy savings and reduce
       utility costs for residents.
       Conservation can be accomplished by reducing the use of energy-consuming items, or by
       physically modifying existing structures and land uses. The California Energy Commission

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                      Final Housing Element, November, 2009
       first adopted energy conservation standards for new construction in 1978. These standards,
       outlined in Title 24 of the California Administrative Code, contain specifications relating to
       insulation, glazing, heating and cooling systems, water heaters, swimming pool heaters, and
       several other items. Specific design provisions differ throughout the State depending upon
       local temperature conditions.
       The City of Hollister promotes the following to encourage conservation:
              LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Program Green
               Building Rating System is a voluntary, consensus-based national standard for
               developing high-performance, sustainable buildings. LEED provides a complete
               framework for assessing building performance and meeting sustainability goals.
               Based on well-founded scientific standards, LEED emphasizes state of the art
               strategies for sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency,
               materials selection and indoor environmental quality.              LEED recognizes
               achievements and promotes expertise in green building through a comprehensive
               system offering project certification, professional accreditation and training.
              PG&E. PG&E sponsors a variety of programs designed to encourage energy-
               efficiency by consumers and the building industry. The company sponsors a
               comprehensive rebate program for qualifying ENERGY STAR labeled products,
               which include home appliances, home audio equipment, office equipment,
               compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs), lighting fixtures, air conditioners,
               furnaces, windows and roofing products. Through the
               California ENERGY STAR Homes Program, builders may qualify for rebates up
               to $700 per single-family home and $150 per multi-family unit by incorporating
               energy-efficient features into new residences. To qualify for the incentives,
               builders must be accepted into the program before beginning construction and
               exceed Title 24 requirements by at least 15 percent. PG&E also provides a
               recycling program for old, energy inefficient refrigerators and offers a $35
               incentive, free pick-up and environmentally-safe disposal.

SECTION 3.0
       HOUSING NEEDS, ISSUES, AND TRENDS
3.1    STATE ISSUES AND POLICIES
       On January 1, 2007, the State Legislature amended Article 10.6, reauthorizing the
       Government Code regarding Housing Elements, first enacted in 1980. By reauthorizing this
       statute, the legislature continues to find that "the availability of housing is of vital statewide
       importance, and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for
       every California family is a priority of the highest order. The early attainment of this goal
       requires the cooperative participation of government and the private sector in an effort to
       expand housing opportunities and accommodate the housing needs of Californians of all
       economic levels. Local and state governments have a responsibility to use the powers
       vested in them to facilitate the improvement and development of housing to make adequate
       provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community..."
       A May 22, 2000 update to the statewide (1996-2000) Housing Plan indicates that California
       may have to accommodate 45 million people by 2020. To meet the enormous needs for
       housing and other services, the State will have to use all the resources at its disposal.
       The five-year housing strategy is intended for the utilization of federal resources toward
       housing needs in the State. Three broad objectives are identified for the use of federal
       funds:
               Meeting low-income renters needs
               Meeting low-income homeowners needs
               Meeting the needs of homeless persons and households requiring supportive services
       Within the five year strategy is a sub-list of strategies that are intended to address housing as
       a statewide concern:
      Development of New Housing (assisting local governments in preparing and implementing
       housing elements of their general plan, expedited permit processing for affordable housing,
       funding resources, and fostering partnerships between housing providers).
      Preservation of Existing Housing and Neighborhoods (rehabilitation of existing homes, code
       enforcement, preserving government-assisted housing projects, and mobile home
       ownership).
      Reduction of Housing Costs (development on surplus and under-utilized land, self-help
       construction and rehabilitation programs, tax-exempt bonds for development and
       rehabilitation financing and modular homes, eliminating duplicative environmental review
       procedures, and revising regulations that add to the cost of housing development).
      Much higher levels of housing construction are needed to adequately house the State’s
       population.

3.   .HOUSING ELEMENT                                      Final Housing Element, November, 2009
       High housing cost burdens are increasingly an issue for both owners and renters. The
        combination of upward price pressure in the housing markets and relatively tight urban
        housing markets has led to increasing cost burdens, particularly for low-income renter
        residents.
       In some portions of the State, the level of overcrowding has dramatically increased.
       A substantial portion of affordable rental housing developments statewide are at risk of
        conversion to market rate use.
       Significant numbers of temporary agricultural workers migrate throughout the State, facing
        housing challenges that impact their welfare.
       Homeless individuals and households face significant difficulties in obtaining shelter and
        reintegrating themselves into the broader society.
3.2.    TRENDS
        The following is a summary of housing trends which emerged or are continuing to
        emerge in Hollister that will affect the production of housing and other housing related
        opportunities, including housing rehabilitation, and the provision of services to special
        needs housing groups over the course of the 2009-2014 Housing Element:
       Over the last Housing Element period, the Hollister Housing Program was effective in
        establishing a dialogue and setting goals toward meeting the Regional Housing Needs
        Assessment (RHNA) goals for new construction. The City desires to create a balanced
        community with housing opportunities for all segments of the population. The City will
        continue to implement its vision for reinvestment in the downtown in order to revitalize
        not only the downtown but the entire City; housing is a key component of any
        revitalization effort. A managed growth approach taking into account the specialized
        need of Hollister, is of key importance to the community.
       Seven key household trends impacting Hollister’s housing stock and the development of
        new housing are:
              An increasing need for affordable units of all types in the community, including
                 affordable single family units, and rental units.
              A continuing demand for farmworker housing.
              A continued and increasing demand for housing for homeless persons and those
                 threatened with homelessness.
              An increased supply of affordable rental senior housing.
              The need for partnerships to facilitate high density residential growth where a
                 range of transportation options are available as well as support services such as
                 child care and after school care.
              Increased needs for duplexes, condominiums, and apartments to provide increased
                 housing opportunities for all income levels.
              Shifting commuting patterns as an increasing number of Hollister residents
                 commute to areas outside the County for employment opportunities, and the

                 impacts on housing affordability for residents that work in San Benito County
                 where wages are generally lower.
       According to the 2008 determination, 16.7 percent of Hollister’s housing is in need of
        minor repairs, 2.0 percent is in need of moderate repairs, and .01 percent (5 units) is in
        need of substantial repairs.
       One project, with a total of 19 units, is considered “at-risk” of converting to market rate
        over the next five (5) years. Another 212 units contained in four (4) projects are at a
        “lower risk” of converting, meaning they may convert to market rate in the next 10 years.
        The City will continue to monitor “at-risk” units on an annual basis.
3.3.    POLICY GOALS
        The goals, objectives, and programs of the 2009-2014 City of Hollister Housing Element
        focus on: maintaining and increasing housing affordability; pursuing increased mixed use
        development opportunities, providing a mix of densities and affordability levels; to
        encourage and facilitate redevelopment activity, including housing, in the downtown; and
        continuing the efforts of the Redevelopment Agency to both work independently and through
        partnerships with non-profit and for-profit affordable housing developers to meet the needs of
        special needs populations.
        The objectives in this update will be quantified to meet the RHNA for the City, as prescribed
        by San Benito County Council of Governments.
        The City of Hollister’s housing goals are as follows:
        1. Work together to build a sense of community and achieve housing goals.
        2. Maintain and enhance existing housing and blend well-designed new housing into
            neighborhoods and communities.

3.4.     QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
         The quantified objectives of this Housing Element for new construction, rehabilitation
         and conservation are included below; anticipated affordable units as a result of the City’s
         Second Mortgage program (HSMP) are also included. The number of units rehabilitated
         by income category is based on the percentages of units rehabilitated in each income
         category during the prior housing element period. Current market conditions may limit
         the City’s ability to realize the level of construction shown below in the Quantified
         Objectives.

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                     Final Housing Element, November, 2009
4.0    HOUSING PROGRAM
       4.1    KEY HOUSING STRATEGIES
       A.     Enhance existing housing and neighborhoods.
              Hollister’s neighborhoods should be preserved and strengthened so that they
              continue to improve over time. As new housing is developed, the City shall be
              proactive, so that changes continue to enhance Hollister, making it an ever-
              increasingly attractive place to live. Design policies for multifamily housing will
              help to ensure enhancement of neighborhood identity and sense of community so
              that new housing will have a sensitive transition or scale and compatibility with
              the surrounding neighborhood.
       B.     Continue to provide for affordable housing funding.
              The City’s Redevelopment Agency provides low-interest loans for first-time
              homebuyers for down payment assistance and for low-income residents to
              rehabilitate their homes for both owners and renters of all ages, including seniors.
              The Redevelopment Agency has also provided funding for several affordable
              housing developments in Hollister. Redevelopment funding should continue to
              address the affordable housing needs of the community, especially for lower
              income households, including extremely low income, who are having the hardest
              time finding affordable housing in Hollister. Future Redevelopment Agency
              funding levels are subject to Redevelopment Agency Board approval.
       C.     Foster land for multi-family housing and for housing mixed with non-residential
              land uses.
              Abundant land is available for development in and around Hollister, but most of
              the existing stock is single family residential. About 75% of the existing housing
              units are single family detached residential, about 5% is attached and the
              remaining 20% is multi-family housing. Forty seven percent of the sites approved
              or allocated for residential development are single family residential. The 2005-
              2023 General Plan prioritizes infill development and a more compact
              development pattern than the previous General Plan. The City of Hollister
              recently adopted a new zoning map that reduced the acres of land zoned for single
              family residential use from 88% to 71%, and at the same time increased the
              percentage of lands zoned for higher density residential, including mixed use
              zoning districts. Programs proposed in this Housing Element will foster the
              development of all types of housing, including multi-family housing, and carry
              out the General Plan goals of more dense development patterns. Mixed use
              housing and adaptive reuse of underutilized sites will be encouraged and
              facilitated to increase housing opportunities for lower income households.
              Mixed-use areas, especially in and around the downtown area, will support
              multiple City objectives for economic development as well.

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                     Final Housing Element, November, 2009
       D.     Create Partnerships to facilitate effective implementation of affordable housing
              programs.
              Maintain resources for effective partnerships involving neighborhoods,
              businesses, civic and service organizations, and the County in addressing housing
              needs. Housing policies should be written so that affordable housing is targeted
              to a variety of economic levels, integrated into projects and dispersed throughout
              the community.
       E.     Generate affordable housing with a variety of strategies, which may include
              utilizing the Performance Overly Zoning District and Mixed Use Districts to
              allow flexible densities and flexible standards to provide a mix of housing types
              and prices for all income levels.
       F      Address growth and infrastructure needs to be able to meet the City’s Regional
              Housing Needs Allocation.
              Housing policies must be integrated with related issues, such as land use, design,
              traffic capacity, economic development, and adequate infrastructure, to ensure a
              comprehensive approach.
       G.     Encourage appropriately designed second units.
              Second units shall be encouraged as a means of developing small, affordable units
              throughout the community. Second units can provide a significant source of
              affordable housing. Often smaller than typical homes, second units can provide
              housing for younger persons, seniors, single parents, and lower-income
              households. They can also provide a source of income for the owner of the main
              home, making housing more affordable for the primary homeowner as well.
       4.2    HOUSING ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
              State law requires the Housing Element to include quantified objectives for the
              maximum number of units that can be rehabilitated, conserved, or constructed.
              Policies and programs establish the strategies to achieve these objectives. The
              City’s quantified objectives are described under each program. Assumptions are
              based on past program performance, infrastructure constraints, construction
              trends, land availability, and anticipated future program funding. A timeline and
              description of the City’s housing policies and implementing measures are
              included in the matrix and organized according to the following goals:
              Goal H1         Work together to build a sense of community and achieve housing
                              goals.

              1-Year Time Frame (2010)
              H.A    Develop program guidelines to establish a Foreclosed Home Reactivation
                     Program.
                     The City will continue and implement a program to provide financial
                     assistance to return foreclosed homes to the active market.
                     Redevelopment Agency (RDA) funds will be used to purchase and
                     rehabilitate homes, either to be done by the Agency or in partnership with
                     a non-profit home builder/developer. Homes will be offered to very-low,
                     low, and moderate income purchasers; such sales may be packaged with
                     Hollister Second Mortgage Program (HSMP).A is proposing to
              H.B    Develop program guidelines to establish a Tenant Based Rental Assistance
                     (TBRA) Program.
                     The Redevelopment Agency (RDA) will establish and implement a
                     program to provide financial assistance to help tenants with rent payments.
                     The program will be structured to assist those in the lower income
                     categories, including extremely low income, so no rental payments exceed
                     30% of a tenants’ income. The RDA is proposing to fund the TBRA
                     program in the amount of $100K annually. The Program will be
                     established and operational by July 2010.
              H.C    Implement development impact fees and planning fees that encourage the
                     construction of units affordable to lower income households.
                     The City has adopted fees on a sliding scale for multi-family projects.
                     Lower fees are charged to encourage development, while maintaining
                     adequate funding levels for infrastructure and public services. The City
                     will approve projects based on lower fees to lower the overall costs of
                     multi-family housing. The City will evaluate additional measures that can
                     be taken to further reduce costs and continue to allow lower sewer and
                     water connection fees and lower traffic impact fees for multi-family
                     development, in an ongoing effort to reduce the cost of development.
              H.D    A new Zoning Ordinance was adopted by the City in December, 2008. As
                     per Section 17.22.120, Homeless Shelters and Transitional Housing,
                     identified as Small or Large Temporary Residential Shelter (LTRS or STRS),
                     are permitted in the North Gateway (NG) zoning district provided that each
                     establishment meets specified objective location and operational standards.
                     In order to comply with SB2, the words “by right” shall be added to the code
                     section, clearly indicating homeless shelters are allowed by right without any
                     discretionary approval. The City shall also identify sufficient capacity to
                     develop one homeless shelter within a year.

                              where there is no potential for lot consolidation, and development
                              standards for the second unit can be met. The Zoning Ordinance
                              revision shall be completed by August, 2010.
                             To encourage infill development on small lots, re-use of property and

                     examine small lot housing, infill and mixed use near established
                     neighborhoods to determine criteria for sites suitable to lower income
                     households. Criteria to include building bulk requirements, enhancing
                     sense of place, minimizing the impacts of garages on the streetscape, and
                     enhancing the sense of place. The City will meet with non-profit housing
                     developers working in Hollister to request assistance identifying any
                     additional development standards that will facilitate the development of
                     housing affordable to lower income households. At least two developer
                     meetings shall be set up by the end of 2010 with the goal of establishing
                     criteria by December of 2011.
                              a.    Building Bulk Requirements.
                                    In multi-unit buildings, require designs to break up the
                                    building mass and reduce bulk, including the use of upper
                                    story step backs and landscaping. Ensure a human scale in
                                    new development, and when possible create multi-family
                                    buildings that have the appearance of single-family homes.
                                    Windows, doors, and exterior treatment, for example, are
                                    an important element of building design and are an
                                    indicator of overall building quality.
                              b.    Street Patterns.

                                    Incorporate transitions in height and setbacks from adjacent
                                    properties to respect adjacent development character and
                                    privacy. Design new housing so that it relates to the
                                    existing street pattern and creates a sense of neighborliness
                                    with surrounding buildings.
                             c.     Enhance the “Sense of Place”.
                                    Design new housing around natural and designed focal
                                    points, through direct pedestrian, transit or automobile
                                    connections. Respect existing landforms, paying attention
                                    to boundary areas and effects on adjacent properties.
                             d.     Minimize the Visual Impact of Parking and Garages.
                                    Encourage driveways and garages to be located to the side
                                    of buildings and recessed, or along rear alleyways or below
                                    the building in some higher density developments.
                                    Discourage home designs in which garages dominate the
                                    public façade of the home.
                             b.     Use Quality Building Materials.
                                    Building materials should be high quality, long lasting,
                                    durable and energy efficient.
              H.K    Partner with water purveyors to continue to provide for future water
                     system capacity to meet housing needs.
                     Identify additional water sources in order to provide adequate water for
                     the additional development projected under the General Plan (see
                     programs in the Community Services and Facilities Element).
                     The City will create a schedule that will lay out the procedure and policy
                     decisions necessary to set up the MOU and the approximate time frame to
                     complete. The Schedule shall be completed by August, 2011.
              H.L    The City shall research funding opportunities with PG&E and other
                     sources for the development of a program similar to the solar ‘Berkeley
                     First’ program.
                     The City will continue to encourage conservation by awarding growth
                     management allocations to projects with energy conservation measures.
                     The City shall establish and adopt a program including pictures of lighting

                     construction to offer incentives to developers to utilize solar technology to
                     offer cost savings in affordable and market rate housing. The City shall
                     provide bi-lingual education materials and explore site review standards
                     for solar access for new development by August, 2011.
              H.M: Process Zoning Ordinance            amendment        for   mobile   homes  and
                     manufactured homes.
                     Comply with State Government Code by amending the Hollister Zoning
                     Ordinance to establish manufactured homes on foundations as permitted
                     uses in residential zones, subject to the City’s applicable zoning standards.
                     The amendment shall specifically identify manufactured housing on a
                     permanent foundation to be an approved housing type in the R-1 Single
                     Family, and RA Residence Agricultural districts, subject to the same
                     standards as other types of permitted housing. Zoning amendment to be
                     completed by July, 2011.
              H.N    The City of Hollister shall amend the Zoning Ordinance standards to
                     provide incentives for the construction of affordable housing.
                        Amend standards for minimum lot size in the Downtown Mixed use
                         zoning district and Neighborhood Mixed Use District in the Measure
                         Y exemption area and standards for residential units on the upper
                         floors of a mixed use building to increase opportunities for infill
                         development.
                        Amend the zoning ordinance to establish a new R4-20 zoning district
                         with a minimum density of 20 units per acre and a maximum density
                         of 35 units per acre.
                     The Zoning Ordinance amendment shall be completed by July of 2011.
              H.O    The Residential Development Performance Overlay (PRZ) zoning district
                     shall be used to fulfill General Plan goals to provide a variety of housing
                     types and lot sizes for all income levels, to allow transitional densities
                     between established neighborhoods and to facilitate the construction of
                     affordable housing throughout the City of Hollister. When the
                     development density of a portion of a project in a PRZ is lower than the
                     average development density, the City shall initiate the rezoning of a
                     portion of the property to the R4-20 zoning district to assure that the
                     average minimum development density of the property, based on the
                     applicable zoning district, is met and that affordable multi-family housing
                     will be constructed.

              H.P    Prepare an expedited development review process for affordable housing
                     development by the following means. The process for affordable housing
                     review shall be completed by the City by July 2010 and will be used on an
                     ongoing basis thereafter.
                     a.      Priority Processing.
                             Affordable housing developments shall receive the highest priority.
                             Efforts will be made by staff and decision-makers to: (1) provide
                             technical assistance to potential affordable housing developers in
                             processing requirements, including community involvement; (2)
                             consider project funding and timing needs in the processing and
                             review of the application; and (3) provide the fastest turnaround
                             time possible in determining application completeness.
                     b.      CEQA Review
                             Use mitigated Negative Declarations, the General Plan EIR, or
                             specific area EIR’s to assess potential impacts and mitigation
                             measures. Specific actions include: (1) conduct environmental
                             review and, as appropriate, prepare an EIR for General Plan
                             Amendments and Rezonings for identified key sites; and (2)
                             specify appropriate densities, design guidelines and development
                             standards to avoid known potential environmental impacts or to
                             mitigate potential impacts.
                     c.      Review strategies to meet parking standards in the mixed-use
                             districts and Downtown Hollister.
              3-Year Time Frame (2012)
              H.Q    In June/July of 2009 the City will award 678 allocations for the years
                     2008, 2009, 2010 based on the Measure U growth rate of 254 units per
                     year and prior performance agreements. One hundred twenty (120) of the
                     allocations will be for lower income households. Fifty eight percent of the
                     sites are targeted for the multi-family and mixed use zoning district.
                     In 2010, the City will award 488 allocations for the last two years of the
                     Measure U growth initiative – 2011 and 2012. At least 50 allocations
                     shall be for lot consolidation projects in a multi-family or mixed use
                     zoning district with a density of 20 units per acre or higher. Pursuant to
                     Measure U, at least 80 units shall be for affordable housing. At least 60%
                     (293) of the allocations shall be awarded to projects with a density of at
                     least 20 units per acre.

              H.R
                     The City shall amend the zoning ordinance to ensure that local zoning,
                     development standards, and permit processing procedures for farmworker
                     housing comply with Health and Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and
                     17021.6, which generally require the following:
                      “Any employee housing consisting of no more than 36 beds in a group
                     quarters or 12 units or spaces designed for use by a single family or
                     household shall be deemed an agricultural land use designation for the
                     purposes of this section. For the purpose of all local ordinances, employee
                     housing shall not be deemed a use that implies that the employee housing
                     is an activity that differs in any other way from an agricultural use. No
                     conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be
                     required of this employee housing that is not required of any other
                     agricultural activity in the same zone. The permitted occupancy in
                     employee housing in an agricultural zone shall include agricultural
                     employees who do not work on the property where the employee housing
                     is located.” The City shall also ensure that such procedures encourage and
                     facilitate the development of housing for farmworkers. The Zoning
                     Ordinance amendment shall be adopted by July of 2012.
              H.S    Participate in partnership fashion with both South County Housing and
                     Community Services Development Corporation to facilitate the
                     development of affordable housing opportunities.
                     The City will form a partnership with local developers to assist in
                     achieving the City’s housing goals and implementing various programs
                     proposed in this Housing Element. Guidelines for partnering activities
                     shall be in place by July, 2012.
              H.T    Measure U expires in January 2012; six months thereafter (June 2012) the
                     City will amend the Growth Management Ordinance. In 2011, the City of
                     Hollister will initiate a study to determine the need for a growth
                     management program based on the number of residential housing units
                     generated during the program period as of 2011, by type and affordability
                     level. The study shall evaluate not only what the appropriate rate of future
                     growth may be, but should consider the need for a on-going residential
                     growth management program in relationship to other types of
                     development (i.e. commercial and industrial uses). The information shall
                     be used to assess unmet needs for housing types and prices and ensure
                     adequate allocations are available to accommodate the City's remaining
                     regional need by income level throughout the remainder of the planning
                     period.
                     Possible exemptions shall be considered including: 1) extension of the
                     exemption to growth limits in the Downtown Area; 2) exemption for

3.  HOUSING ELEMENT                                     Final Housing Element, November, 2009
                     affordable housing projects; 3) exemption for infill residential
                     development on parcels less than two acres in size; and, 4) exemption of
                     lot consolidation projects with a density of 20 units per acre or more; 5)
                     exemption for minor subdivisions in the Low Density Residential General
                     Plan land use designation. Any growth management program shall allow
                     construction of at least 254 dwelling units annually to ensure sufficient
                     allocations are available to accommodate the City's remaining regional
                     need by income level throughout the remainder of the planning period. In
                     addition, as the City is relying on growth in the Measure Y exemption area
                     to accommodate a portion of its lower-income need, if by 2012 growth is
                     lower than expected, additional allocations will be made available for
                     projects at densities of 20 units per acre or more equal to the City's
                     remaining unmet need shall be made available to assure that sufficient
                     New Construction needs for lower-income households can be fulfilled.
              H.U    The City of Hollister will assess the need to adopt an Inclusionary
                     Housing Ordinance to coordinate with the expiration of the Growth
                     Management Measure U, in 2012. Until such time as an Inclusionary
                     Housing Ordinance is adopted, the City will continue to utilize the
                     inclusionary requirement that is a part of the Condominium Conversion
                     Ordinance and allocations for 40 affordable housing units per year as
                     required in the growth initiative Measure U.
                     The City will undertake this action by December 2012, but the process of
                     evaluation will begin no later than June, 2012.
              5-Year Time Frame (2014)
              H.V    Protect “at-risk” units.
                     The City has identified 19assisted units that are at risk of converting to
                     market rate within the next five years. The City/Redevelopment Agency
                     will pursue State and Federal funding sources, such as the HOME
                     program, to keep units affordable. The City/Redevelopment Agency will
                     also continually engage property owners to take advantage of deferred
                     loan programs for rehabilitation, mortgage refinancing, and acquisition to
                     keep units affordable long term (typically 55 years).
              H.W    The City recognizes that the annexation of residential land for residential
                     development will be necessary to meet the needs of the community going
                     forward and also to meet the future RHNA requirement.
                     By 2012, the City of Hollister will seek to annex land located within the
                     City’s 2005 Sphere of Influence, specifically, those parcels contained in
                     eight (8) unincorporated islands comprising approximately 75 acres. In
                     addition, the City will target other lands in the City’s SOI for annexation

                     to be in declining or substandard condition, offer inspection services, and
                     advertise on the City’s web site and via direct utility bill mailing,
                     promoting programs that will assist in funding needed work. The City
                     will also continue to enforce the property maintenance ordinance that
                     authorizes more rigorous enforcement of codes pertaining to deteriorated

      sibling or being homeless. Living with sibling invades sibling’s privacy and
      removes independence of senior.
     Counseling & Support Services
     Education for retirement
Public’s Ideas:
     Senior housing should not be confined to senior developments or ethnic groups.
      Senior housing should be included in all housing programs. (Tony Ruiz)

                                     Appendix A
     Senior housing should be built so that it can be utilized by persons with wheel
      chairs or walkers (doorways, door handles, bathroom, bedroom).
     The City should explore Tenants and owners development corporation of San
      Francisco
     Senior services should be integrated into senior housing projects (Gabriel Torres)
     National Council of Aging provides jobs if you are SOIC. They ask a return on
      their investment. Jobs are minimum wage and 20 hours per week. Typically jobs
      help community – there are for local residents and help non-profit organizations.

community needs. Mary Paxton distributed a flyer on the “Housing Element Revisions
Community Outreach” and explained the goals and vision of the Housing Element. By
updating the Housing Element it will be easier to go for more grants. Hoping to hear what
the special housing needs are in the community. What programs are working and what
needs to be updated. A lengthy discussion ensued and topics discussed were:
1. Special Needs Housing:
    a. Childcare: Kendra Bobsin discussed the need implementing childcare into the
       plan. This was a need in the past that has been put on hold. Lack of childcare puts
       a huge strain on families without a stable childcare system. Developers could
       contribute to a childcare fund. Kendra has models that can be used.
    b. Visit Ability: Gifford Swanson discussed the “Visit Ability” movement in Europe
       and the minor changes that can be made to homes to assist individuals with
       disabilities i.e., no steps to enter the front door, wider hallway & doorways.
       Eliminating steps is a huge deal. Gifford stated that he would like to see in the
       future is that 100% of homes are built this way. Check out these web-sites:
       http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/Agencies/community/ADA/visit_ability.html
       http://www.ap.buffalo.edu/idea/visitability/designforlifespan/primerva6.htm
       http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/hhstmpl.asp?url=/content/hhs/ads/Design
       ForLife/DesignForLifeMontgomery.asp
    c. Foreclosure: CJ Valenzuela stated that he is targeting families facing foreclosures
       and is working to educate them on their options. It is important to know if
       families have special needs in order to better assist them. In the present market
       many clients don’t qualify for aid because they own property & vehicles. Many
       have never used federal programs and don’t know where to go to find assistance.
    d. Farm Worker Housing, In-Fill & Transitional Housing: MaryAnne Hughes
       discussed the need for more “In-Fill” homes (enables many low and moderate
       income families to become first-time homebuyers) & transitional housing based
       on a fee scale. Needs to be staff & office space in the housing developments to
       provide support to assist residents with their transition. For more information on
       In-Fill homes see: http://infill.gisc.berkeley.edu/report_vol-1.pdf.
    e. Youth Centers & Play Areas: MaryAnne Hughes and Diane Ortiz discussed the
       need for Youth Centers & play areas within the housing complexes that would be
       a safe place for youth to go, especially older youth. The outside areas should
       include: playgrounds, outside playing area (basketball, softball, etc). Inside areas
       should include: a full kitchen, computer hookups, lots of electrical outlets, extra
       rooms for counseling, etc. Gifford discussed a program he was involved with that
       provided computer skills training for adults & youth that was funded through
       small grants, the city & school districts. If there is collaboration between city,
       county& non-profits, there is funding available.
    f. Foster Youth: Kay Gibson discussed emancipated foster youth and the lack of
       options available to them causing them become homeless on their 18th birthday.
       Discussed purchasing housing for these youth. Foster youth could be a special
       housing needs group.

                                          Appendix A
          g. Studio Apartments for College Age: Betty Mason discussed the need for Studio
              apartments and boarding houses for young people who can’t afford to move out.
              Often the young people can only afford $500/month rent. Discussed
              implementing a program where people with larger homes would be willing to rent
              their rooms for a transition period. This could be done by educating the public on
              the needs of the community.
          h. Affordable Housing: The lack of affordable housing has created a problem with
              garage living & “couch surfing”. Couch surfing is families moving from one
              family member/friend to another until they find permanent housing. 5% of youth
              in schools are considered homeless.
          i. Housing Survey: Mary Paxton discussed distributing a survey through the
              Community Pantry, Public Authority, CSWD, HHSA etc. Survey must be in
              English/Spanish and should be kept to one page. Planning Department personnel
              should contact the Homeless Taskforce Manager, Cindy Parr to ask if she and
              homeless shelter staff could interview the homeless at Dunne Park and Park Hill.
          j. Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): Discussed the CDBG grant
              that the city can’t apply for because of the lack of a Housing Element. Diane
              discussed the CDBG funding standstill with the city.
          k. Zoning Law: Mary Paxton discussed a recent law that was passed that mandates
              implementing homeless shelters and transitional housing into a zoned district and
              how this affects the city draft plan. Mary Paxton explained that with the adoption
              of the 2005 General Plan, a Housing Element has been included and the Planning
              Department is hoping to have the Housing Element certified by next June.
          l. Self-Sufficiency: Kendra Bobsin distributed a copy of the self-sufficiency report
              for San Benito County. Discussed the self-sufficiency standards for San Benito
              County. For a 1 adult family with 2 children the self-sufficiency rate is $54,000 a
              year! Check out the Insight Center for Community Economic Development web-
              site at: http://www.insightcced.org/.
          m. Schools: Discussed the need for permanent, accessible schools to support new
              neighborhoods. It is important that sidewalks be included in new neighborhoods,
              especially around schools. Crosswalks are also important.
          n. Downtown Housing: Mary Paxton discussed the inventory of the upper level of
              the downtown in order to reuse the property for low-income housing. MaryAnne
              Hughes stated that it is important that downtown markets provide more nutritional
              options in their store for those without transportation.
          Kendra thanked Mary Paxton & her group for coming, and offered to review their
          draft plan once it is completed. The CAN would like to invite the planning members
          back in the future for an update on the General Plan.
VI. Review Strategic Plan:
    A. Survey Report: MaryAnne Hughes reported that she is still working with Community
       Foundation and the Compass Point for non-profit training on community building. The
       Packard Foundation is providing the training to Hollister as a gift. The training title is

                                     Appendix A
   “Community Action 101”. They are hoping to schedule the training in September or
   October and are encouraging every non-profit to attend. Once the dates are set the survey
   and invitation will be sent out. Suggestions for a training site are: the Presbyterian
   church, Bolado Park, San Juan Oaks, or Ridgemark.
B. Packard Foundation: Andi Anderson reported on the Community Foundation’s request
   to film Hollister Youth Alliance (HYA) for a DVD production sponsored by the Packard
   Foundation. This will be used to market the HYA agency and community to other
   Foundations as a way to promote funding services in our County. What is really great
   about it is that HYA was selected as THE youth agency representative of SBC!! The
   Community Foundation, GoKids, & YMCA are all creating a DVD as well. Discussed
   having all non-profits come together for one major fundraiser and dividing the funds
   between them. Rochelle Callis & Kendra Bobsin will form a committee to discuss
   further.
C. 40 Developmental Assets (40DA): Dennis Kurtz reported that there has been no action
   on the 40DA grant since the last meeting. Unfortunately, the person writing the grant was
   laid-off. Dennis is hoping he will have more to report at next meeting. Discussed
   purchasing the 40DA brochures and distributing them into the community. Rochelle has
   some of the materials that were purchased and housed at the YMCA.
D. Foster Youth Services (FYS): Frank not present items will be tabled to the next
   meeting.
   1. Current Activities/Update: Frank Beitz will provide an update on Foster Youth
       Services.
   2. College Tour: Frank Beitz invited the student who participated in the college tour to
       share at the June meeting, however; the meeting was cancelled due to the “Kids at the
       Park” event. Discuss rescheduling the college student.
   3. Advisory Meeting: Frank Beitz will report on outcome of the Foster Youth Advisory
       Council meeting with Behavioral Health that was held in June.
E. Committee Reports:
   1. Education Committee: (Margie Barrios, Dennis Kurtz, Rochelle Callis & Diane
       Ortiz) Due to time constraints, this item will be tabled to next month:
       a. Rotary: Discuss having the CAN present to Rotary for their support.
       b. 40DA Brochures: Kendra Bobsin will report on possible funding sources to
            purchase the 40DA brochures.
       c. 40DA Training: Continue discussion about training CAN members on how to
            present the 40DAs, and distributing the information to the community.
   2. Marketing: Andi Anderson made changes to the CAN brochure. Andi has requested

Housing Enabled by Local Partnerships - The HELP Program employs a loan-to-
lender approach to provide 10-year, 3% simple interest rate per annum, minimally
restrictive loans to local government agencies. The program challenges local agencies to
prioritize their unmet housing needs and to design housing programs that target their
particular priorities. This approach allows the local agency to more closely match local
housing policy and accountability with project performance. Increasingly, the program is
being used to facilitate affordable housing within more targeted comprehensive local
programs for neighborhood revitalization.
Home Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program was created under Title II of the
Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act enacted on November 28, 1990.
HOME funds are made available on an annual competitive basis through HCD’s small
cities program. Individual grants of up to $3 million are available annually to develop
and support affordable rental housing, and $800,000 for home acquisition assistance to
cities, counties and nonprofit community housing development organizations (CHDOs).
Activities include acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, and rental assistance.
Of particular note with respect to the HOME Program are the Rental Rehabilitation
and/or Acquisition Program and the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) Program.
In the Rental Rehabilitation and/or Acquisition Program, funds are provided to a HOME-
eligible city or county to assist owners of multi-unit rental housing that is in need of
rehabilitation to meet federal, State, or local building codes, or to assist in the purchase
and rehabilitation of multi-unit rental housing that is in need of rehabilitation. In the
TBRA Program, funds are provided to a HOME-eligible city or county to administer a
program to provide rent subsidies to eligible households. This latter activity is commonly
undersubscribed, according to staff at HCD.
Coupled with the HOME Program is a federally subsidized program called the American
Dream Downpayment Initiative, created in 2003. ADDI aims to increase the
homeownership rate, especially among lower income and minority households, and to
revitalize and stabilize communities. ADDI helps first-time homebuyers with the biggest
hurdle to homeownership: downpayment and closing costs. The program was created to
assist low-income first-time homebuyers in purchasing single-family homes by providing
funds for downpayment, closing costs, and rehabilitation carried out in conjunction with
an assisted home purchase. ADDI provides downpayment, closing costs, and
rehabilitation assistance to eligible individuals. The amount of ADDI assistance provided
may not exceed $10,000 or six percent of the purchase price of the home, whichever is
greater.
Joe Serna, Jr. Farmworker Housing Grant (JSJFWHG) Program finances the new
construction, rehabilitation and acquisition of owner-occupied and rental units for
agricultural workers, with a priority for lower income households.
Homeowner Grants: For rehabilitation or new home construction: Lien restrictions are
required for twenty years. If the unit is sold to a non-farmworker buyer before completing
the tenth year, the full grant amount must be repaid under most circumstances. Between
the 10th and 20thanniversaries, the grant is forgiven at a rate of 10 percent per completed
year; it is fully forgiven after completing 20 years.
Rental Construction Grants or Loans: Lien restrictions for assisted units are required for
40 years. If assisted units are sold for uses other than farmworker housing before the 40th

year, under most circumstances, the grant must be repaid in full. Loans may be made in
conjunction with low-income tax credit financing only.
Rental Rehabilitation Grants or Loans: Lien restrictions for assisted units are required for
20 years. If assisted units are sold for uses other than farmworker housing before the 20th
year the grant must be repaid in full, under most circumstances. Loans may be made in
conjunction with low-income tax credit financing only.
Those eligible include local government agencies, nonprofit corporations, cooperative
housing corporations, and limited partnerships where all the general partners are
nonprofit mutual or public benefit corporations.
Multifamily Housing Program (MHP)
 MHP assists the new construction, rehabilitation and preservation of permanent and
transitional rental housing for lower income households. Projects are not eligible if
construction has commenced as of the application date, or if they are receiving 9%
federal low income housing tax credits. MHP funds will be provided for post-
construction permanent financing only. Eligible costs include the cost of child care, after-
school care and social service facilities integrally linked to the assisted housing units; real
property acquisition; refinancing to retain affordable rents; necessary onsite and offsite
improvements; reasonable fees and consulting costs; and capitalized reserves.
Local public entities, for-profit and nonprofit corporations, limited equity housing
cooperatives, individuals, Indian reservations and rancherias, and limited partnerships in
which an eligible applicant or an affiliate of an applicant is a general partner. Applicants
or their principals must have successfully developed at least one affordable housing
project.
FEDERAL PROGRAMS
The Affordable Housing Program (AHP) and Community Investment Program
(CIP) are facilitated through the Federal Home Loan System for the purposes of
expanding the affordable housing supply. The San Francisco Federal Home Loan Bank
District provides local service. Subsidies are awarded on a competitive basis usually in
the form of low-interest loans and must be used to finance the purchase, construction,
and/or rehabilitation of rental housing.
Farmworker Housing Assistance Program provides grants to public and private non-
profits to assist farmworkers in securing temporary or permanent housing. Provides
technical assistance to farmworker and farmworker housing agencies. Program also
provides counseling, technical assistance, but does not actually fund housing production
or rehabilitation.
Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
HUD offers a variety programs and services which include direct financing and
management of the redevelopment or construction of low-income rental housing and
single-family housing, providing homeownership to the low-income. A subsidy for
public housing provides an annual subsidy to help public housing agencies (PHAs) pay
some of the cost of operating and maintaining public housing units
.
Low-income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC) - The LIHTC Program allocates
federal and state tax credits for private and non-profit developers and investors who agree
to set aside all or an established percentage of their rental units for households at 60
percent of AMI or below for no less than 55 years. These tax credits may also be utilized
on rehabilitation projects, contributing to the preservation program. The program begins
when developers and investors apply for an allocation of tax credits from the California
Tax Credit Allocation Committee (CTCAC). Tax credits are awarded on a competitive
basis each year. Compliance is monitored according to Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
rules and regulations.
USDA Rural Development - USDA housing programs have helped over 2 million low-
or moderate-income rural Americans buy homes. USDA also finances construction of
apartments and other multiple family housing in rural communities that lack sufficient,
affordable rental housing. Other programs finance the development of affordable farm
labor housing wherever it is needed.
The Self-Help Housing program enables low-income families to become homeowners
by helping to build their own homes. Their "sweat equity" becomes their downpayment.
Home improvement loans and grants help low-income, often elderly, people remove
health and safety hazards from their homes.
