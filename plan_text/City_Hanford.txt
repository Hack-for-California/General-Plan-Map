CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Purpose of the General Plan
A general plan is the foundation for establishing a local community’s purposes regarding land use, major
transportation routes, and general location and size of future community facilities. It expresses the
community’s development goals and embodies public policy relative to the distribution of future land uses.
All other city policies must be consistent with the general plan. A city’s general plan has often been referred
to as a city's constitution for its growth and development.
Every city and county in California is required to prepare and maintain a general plan. A general plan states
a desired vision for the community’s future. It contains policies that guide the way land is developed and
used. State law requires that each city adopt a general plan “for the physical development of a city and any
land outside its boundaries which bears relation to its planning.”
Hanford’s General Plan is long-range in scope, planning out to the year 2035. Its goals and policies are
general in nature, but also comprehensive, and are intended to guide Hanford for the next 20 years. Since
actions by the City of Hanford must be consistent with the General Plan, regular on-going use of the Plan
is essential. The General Plan can be amended by the City Council up to four times per year, but best
practices suggest that amendments should occur infrequently.
1.2 Organization of the General Plan
1.2.1 General Plan Volumes
The Hanford General Plan is comprised of a number of volumes that together make up the General Plan.
The General Plan Background Report summarizes information on the issues addressed in the General
Plan, focusing on existing conditions and trends as they existed in the year 2013 when the General Plan
Update process began.
The General Plan Policy Document includes goals, policies, maps, and tables that describe how Hanford
plans to grow and develop during the Planning period, which is 2015 to 2035. This document contains
all the required elements of the General Plan, with the exception of Housing and Air Quality.
General Plan Update                                                                                           1

Policy Document
A document containing Hanford’s Housing Element was prepared and adopted separately from the rest
of the General Plan due to its State mandated deadlines for adoption. Hanford has historically joined
Kings County, Corcoran, Lemoore, and Avenal in preparing a combined Housing Element. A combined
Housing Element document was adopted for the years 2009 to 2014. An updated Housing Element was
adopted in 2016 for the time period between January 2016 and January 2024.
A document containing Hanford’s Air Quality Element was prepared and adopted in 2010. No updates
to this document were necessary when the rest of the General Plan was updated in 2017.
1.2.2 Required General Plan Elements
There are seven State-mandated elements in a general plan. They are land use, circulation, housing, open
space, conservation, noise, and safety. Cities within the San Joaquin Valley are also required to have an air
quality element. Hanford’s General Plan also contains an economic development element and a public
facilities and services element. All elements of the General Plan have equal weight and status. One element
is not superior to any other. The goals and policies within each element are consistent with each other
and with the goals and policies in the other elements of the General Plan.
The general plan’s maps, diagrams, and development policies form the basis for the zoning ordinance,
subdivision ordinance, design guidelines, and the capital improvement program – tools which implement
the general plan. Under California law, no specific plan, zoning, subdivision map, or public works project
may be approved unless the City finds that it is consistent with the adopted general plan.
The land use element designates the type, intensity, and general distribution of uses of the land for
housing, business, industry, open space, education, public buildings and grounds, waste disposal facilities,
and other categories of public and private uses. The land use element is found mostly in Chapter 3 of
both the Background Report and the Policy Document.
The circulation element is correlated with the land use element and identifies the general location and
extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, and terminals for all modes
of transportation. The circulation element is found mostly in Chapter 4 of both the Background Report
and the Policy Document.
The housing element is a comprehensive assessment of current and projected housing needs for all
segments of the community and all economic groups. In addition, it embodies policies for providing
adequate housing and includes action programs for that purpose. By statute, the housing element must be
updated and certified on a schedule set by the State Housing and Community Development Department.
The housing element is prepared as a separate document in conjunction with the County of Kings, and
the cities of Lemoore, Corcoran, and Avenal.
The conservation element addresses the conservation, development, and use of natural resources,
including water and soils. The conservation element is found mostly in Chapter 5 of both the Background
Report and the Policy Document. This chapter also contains goals and policies for parks and recreation.

                                                                                     Chapter 1 – Introduction
The open space element describes measures for preserving open-space for natural resources, the
managed production of resources, outdoor recreation, and agricultural land. The open space element is
also found mostly in Chapter 5 of both the Background Report and the Policy Document.
The noise element identifies and appraises noise problems within the community and forms the basis for
land use distribution. The noise element is found mostly in Chapter 7 of both the Background Report and
the Policy Document.
The safety element establishes policies and programs to protect the community from risks associated
with seismic, geologic, flood, extreme heat, and fire hazards. The safety element is found mostly in Chapter
7 of both the Background Report and the Policy Document.
The economic development element identifies trends in the local economy and sets general direction
for improving the community’s economic sustainability and prosperity. The economic development
element is found mostly in Chapter 2 of both the Background Report and the Policy Document.
The public facilities and services element identifies publicly owned facilities and service infrastructure.
It sets policies to facilitate continued service to the community as it grows and develops. It sets a general
direction for citywide school site planning, law enforcement and fire protection services, sewer and water
infrastructure, and other local public facilities and buildings. The public facilities element is found mostly
in Chapter 6 of both the Background Report and the Policy Document.
1.2.3 Relationship of General Plan to Other City Policies, Plans, and Ordinances
The General Plan is the overarching document for all of the City’s policies, plans, and ordinances. A
number of the policies in the General Plan require the City of Hanford to prepare and maintain other
more detailed plans, such as a sewer master plan or a zoning ordinance. The General Plan sets a general
policy direction while the more detailed plans and ordinances serve to implement the goals and policies of
the General Plan. They cannot be inconsistent with the General Plan. For example, the location of zoning
designations in the Zoning Ordinance must be consistent with the land use designations in the General
Plan. Similarly the locations planned for new sewer lines in the sewer master plan must be consistent with
the areas planned in the General Plan for new growth, and the City’s capital improvements plan cannot
budget money to build a major thoroughfare that is not shown in the General Plan.
1.2.4 Organization of Policy Document
The City’s General Plan is intended to be used by all members of the Hanford community, including
residents, businesses, land developers, City staff, Planning Commissioners, and Councilmembers. The
General Plan is composed of both text, maps, and tables. The text includes statements of goals and policies,
some of which determine how the maps are to be drawn. The maps define the goals and policies in pictorial
form. The General Plan is intended to present a clear and concise statement of the City’s goals and policies
regarding the physical growth and development of Hanford. Some of the goals and policies have been
carried over from the previous General Plan. For this General Plan, goals and policies are defined as
follows:
General Plan Update                                                                                          3

Policy Document
      • A goal is a description of the general desired result that the City of Hanford seeks to achieve
          through the implementation of its General Plan.
      • A policy is a specific statement that regulates activities of the City, guides decision making,
          and directs on-going efforts toward the achievement of the goals. The policies set out the
          general standards that will be used by the City of Hanford in their review of land
          development projects and in their own City actions related to the physical development of
          Hanford.
In the Policy Document, goals are grouped under a topic heading and then numbered consecutively in
each chapter with the first letter of the chapter’s title preceding the number. For example, the first two
goals of the Economic Development chapter (Chapter 2) are written as:
Economic Development and Employment Goals
Goal E1: A diverse and robust local economy capable of providing employment for all
            residents desiring to work in the city.
Goal E2: A diversity of commercial and industrial enterprises which provide goods,
            services, and employment opportunities consistent with Hanford’s small-town,
            agricultural image.
Policies are also numbered consecutively with the first letter of the chapter’s title preceding the number.
Each policy has a topic heading. For example, the first two policies of the Land Use chapter (Chapter 3)
are written as:
Policy L1        Planned Area Boundary
Designate a Planned Area Boundary to serve as the limits of the area to be planned for urban development.
Policy L2        2035 Growth Boundary
Designate a 2035 Growth Boundary to serve as the limits of the area to be developed with urban uses
during the 2015 to 2035 planning period. Locate the 2035 Growth Boundary along major roadways and
other natural or manmade physical features that can serve as a physical boundary between urban and
agricultural uses.
1.3 Public Participation and General Plan Adoption Process
1.3.1 Public Participation Process
At the beginning of the General Plan Update process, a Public Participation Plan was prepared to guide
the process of collaborating with the general public on the contents of the General Plan. A key component
was the creation of a Citizen’s Advisory Committee (CAC) by the City Council. The CAC was composed
of approximately 20 individuals who either lived or owned property in Hanford. The City Council
4                                                                                             City of Hanford

                                                                                  Chapter 1 – Introduction
appointed individuals to the CAC based upon their past civic participation and/or their particular
knowledge or expertise in a certain aspect of Hanford. During the process of updating the General Plan,
the CAC met at the Hanford City Hall roughly once every other month (sometimes more) for scheduled
meetings between November 2013 and September 2015. These meetings were open to the public and
were conducted under the rules of the Brown Act, with agendas and minutes prepared and distributed for
each meeting. The CAC played a key role in the preparation of both the Background Report and the
Policy Document of the General Plan. Their input guided both City planning staff and the City’s planning
consultant in developing the goals and policies that are included in the General Plan.
Besides the opportunities provided for the public to comment at the CAC meetings, Planning Commission
meetings, and City Council meetings, the City staff and the City’s planning consultant met with groups and
individuals to receive additional input on the contents of the General Plan. Some of the these group
meetings included Hanford Chamber of Commerce events and a public outreach booth at the Hanford
Thursday Night Marketplace in September 2014.
1.3.2 Adoption Process
Adoption of the General Plan is considered a quasi-legislative act of the City Council. In considering this
General Plan, the City’s Planning Commission and City Council reviewed the document and its
accompanying Environmental Impact Report (EIR.). The Planning Commission reviewed the EIR and
draft General Plan at a public hearing on March 14, 2017, and recommended that it be adopted. The draft
General Plan was then reviewed by the City Council at a public hearing on April 18 and April 24, 2017.
The City Council certified the EIR and subsequently voted to adopt the General Plan on April 24, 2017.
The public was given opportunity to speak and comment on the draft General Plan at both the Planning
Commission hearing on March 14th and the City Council hearing on April 18th.
1.3.3 General Plan Amendment Procedures
It is recognized that there will be instances where the General Plan may need to be amended. State law
allows general plans to be amended up to four times per year, although best practices encourage that
amendments be infrequent. Amendments must be adopted in accordance with State law, and cannot be
inconsistent with other portions of the General Plan. Every proposal to amend the General Plan must be
reviewed at a public hearing by the Planning Commission, who will make a recommendation regarding the
proposed amendment. The City Council must then review the proposed amendment, along with the
Planning Commission’s recommendation, at a public hearing and either approve or deny the proposed
amendment.
Proposed amendments to the locations of land use designations on the Hanford General Plan Map may
be directly initiated by the property owner(s) within the area of the proposed amendment, consistent with
procedures established by the Community Development Director. All other amendments must be initiated
by a vote of the City Council after being requested either by City staff or any individual making a formal
request consistent with procedures established by the Community Development Director. Initiation of an
amendment by the City Council has the effect of directing City staff to evaluate the proposed amendment,
General Plan Update                                                                                      5

Policy Document
prepare necessary environmental reviews, and bring a recommendation to the Planning Commission and
City Council. Initiation by itself is not intended to indicate support for the proposed amendment. The
City Council has the option to not initiate proposed amendments that are brought before them.
1.4 Hanford’s Overarching Principles
Hanford is a unique community that has become what it is today through the innumerable decisions made
over many years by the individuals, groups, and businesses that have chosen to make Hanford their home,
and who have chosen to invest their time, money, and efforts in its success. Over time, sometimes by
purpose, and sometimes without specific intention, a number of shared overarching principles have
emerged that are generally accepted by the majority of the Hanford community. Many of these principles
were discussed at meetings held during the preparation of this General Plan. Many others can be seen in
the City of Hanford’s description of itself and its purpose on the City of Hanford official website.
These principles have served as a guide in formulating the goals and policies of the General Plan. The
principles are listed in a matrix in Table 1-1. The table illustrates how each principle is related to the
elements in the General Plan. The red X’s in the matrix identify principles that are especially important to
the development of that element. The principles related to each element will be stated again at the
introduction of each chapter in the Policy Document.

CHAPTER 2
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
2.1 Principles Related to Economic Development
The Economic Development Element intends to ensure that Hanford grows and develops in a manner
that is economically sustainable, resilient, and successful. Economic sustainability requires policies that
incorporate wise fiscal thinking into public decision making. The Economic Development Element
establishes goals and policies by which the City of Hanford has and will continue to institutionalize
economic development as a core function of the City.
The City of Hanford intends the Economic Development Element to establish the long-term goals for
the growth and development of the local economy, elaborate the public policies needed to achieve the
goals, and identify key implementation actions. The goals and policies are targeted to Hanford’s desires
for more and better-paying jobs, quality of life improvements, and sound fiscal management.
The guiding principles related to Economic Development and City Growth are as follows:
     • A prosperous community
     • Opportunities for housing and jobs that benefit the existing and future community
     • Enhancement of small town charm
     • Facilitation of a successful business environment
     • Downtown area as the physical, cultural, civic, and commercial center of Hanford
     • Hanford as the regional commercial, service, and government center of Kings County

       • Safe, reliable, efficient movement of people and goods
       • Safety, peace of mind, and high quality of life
       • An expanded and diversified tax base
2.2 Economic Development and Employment
Economic development is the continual growth and restructuring of a local economy toward community-
defined goals for economic well-being. The entire General Plan lays the foundation for the long-term
growth and development of Hanford, including its economy. The General Plan may be fairly described as
Hanford's top-line strategy to grow its revenue base as well as promote general welfare and prosperity.
The City of Hanford recognizes that business enterprises consider the image and reputation of a
community when deciding where to locate or expand their business. Business owners and operators are
generally looking for communities that have desirable places to live, work, visit, and raise a family. While
it is recognized that private investment is the key ingredient in the growth and economic development of
Hanford, the City of Hanford can play a vital role in shaping Hanford’s prosperity through its economic
policies.
Economic Development and Employment Goals
Goal E1: A diverse and robust local economy capable of providing employment for all
            residents desiring to work in the city.

2.3 Industry
The Kings Industrial Park is an industrial area on the south side of Hanford currently home to a dozen
businesses providing 1,500 jobs, including jobs at the Del Monte facility. Many of the sites are vacant and
available for industrial business investment, having only been used for agricultural uses. The industrial park
is located two miles south of Highway 198, which connects to Interstate 5 and State Highway 99. In 2011,
an Industrial Park Study evaluated existing conditions and recommended a marketing plan to accelerate
industrial development. The Study evaluated the City’s policies, programs and projects that support the
economic viability of the Industrial Park, assessing and updating a recruitment strategy as needed to bring
new businesses into the Kings Industrial Park.
Through the creation and implementation of the Kings Industrial Park Strategy, Hanford reaffirmed the
continuing importance of growing the industrial sector as an emerging source of jobs and economic growth
in the City. Policies in this section reinforce that Strategy.
Industry Goals
Goal E4: A diverse industrial sector providing jobs for a well-trained work force.
Policy E16       Sufficient Land for Industry
Reserve sufficient space for industry, recognizing greater land requirements due to methods of operation
and site selection processes.

Policy E22       Transportation Improvements

2.4 Agriculture
Agricultural production and processing has been the major segment of the economic base in the Hanford
region. With farm land on all sides, a land use strategy that promotes infill development and discourages
sprawl development will protect the land that is vital to the agricultural economy. Hanford should make
every effort to encourage the recruitment and expansion of businesses in the agricultural sector. This
would include the promotion of Hanford as an ideal location for agricultural entrepreneurs.

2.5 Commerce

2.6 Downtown
Downtown Hanford is the historic center for Hanford’s commercial activity as well as its hub for public
gathering and interaction. It is the focal point of community activity and pride. A healthy, active downtown
provides a foundation for the community, and conveys a positive message to prospective businesses about
Hanford’s quality of life. Downtowns are typically the most dynamic areas of a city, and they continually
evolve to meet the needs of changing culture over years and decades. The City of Hanford continues to
engage in numerous efforts to make a place where businesses successfully operate, cultural and
entertainment opportunities are enjoyed, and people can interact with each other.

CHAPTER 3
LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN
This chapter constitutes the land use element of the Hanford General Plan. As per California Government
Code Section 65302(a), this land use element includes the proposed general distribution and general
location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, education, public
buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public and private
uses of land. This chapter describes the extent the area planned for future growth of Hanford, as well as
the purpose, general density and location of each type of land use designation.
3.1 Principles Related to Land Use & Community Design
Hanford’s overall guiding principles for land use form the basis for more detailed goal and policy
statements. These principles are derived from existing mission statements of the City of Hanford and its
departments, as well as discussions of the General Plan Update Citizen’s Advisory Committee during the
preparation of this General Plan. Following are the guiding principles related to land use and community
design:
     • A prosperous community
     • Enhancement of quality of life
     • Orderly growth, concentrically located around the historic center of Hanford
     • Responsible management of land resources
     • Coordinated land use and circulation systems
     • Respect for private property rights
     • Enhancement of the historic center of Hanford
     • Preservation of farmland
     • A well-designed, physically integrated, livable community
     • Opportunities for housing and jobs that benefit the existing and future community

Policy Document
      • Enhancement of small town charm
      • Facilitation of a successful business environment
      • Downtown area as the physical, cultural, civic, and commercial center of Hanford
      • Hanford as the regional commercial, service, and government center of Kings County
      • Diversification of industry
3.2 Growth Management
The overall physical expansion of Hanford can be managed by the amount of land that is designated for
development and by designating a boundary that limits the outward expansion of new growth. This
promotes new development on underutilized properties in the city and also limits urban sprawl. If there
is too much land designated for development then the urban boundary is not effective and urban sprawl
is not contained. If not enough land is designated, then land markets are constrained, which causes land
prices to rise unnecessarily and results in the need for housing and other necessary services to not be fully
met. Therefore, the determination of the amount of land to designate for development is a key growth
management tool for the General Plan.
Growth Management Goals
Goal L1: A well planned community that grows in an organized fashion.
Goal L2: Development preference of vacant and underutilized properties.
Goal L3: Limitation of urban sprawl-style development patterns in new growth areas.
After reviewing historical growth rates and projected growth trends, the Citizens Advisory Committee
determined that the General Plan Update would assume Hanford’s average annual population growth rate
should be roughly 2.1%, which would result in a projected population of 90,000 persons in the year 2035.
The estimated population on January 1, 2013, is 55,122 based on California Department of Finance
statistics. This leaves a housing need for 34,878 persons between 2013 and 2035. Using the assumption
of an average 3.0 persons per household, the housing need would be 11,626 total housing units. Since
some land designated for development would not become available for development due to various
environmental or market constraints, an additional 35% of the housing units were added to the projected
need. This results in a target of 15,695 housing units that need to be accommodated. Table 3-1
summarizes these results.

3.2.1 Development Boundaries
Development boundaries limit the outward physical expansion of the city to only occur within the
designated boundaries. The size and location of the boundaries are determined by calculating the amount
of land needed to meet future housing and commercial needs. The locations of the Planned Area Boundary
and the 2035 Growth Boundary are shown on the General Plan Land Use Map, Figure 3-1. The following
policies define the use of these development boundaries for managing growth over the life of the General
Plan.
Policy L1        Planned Area Boundary
Designate a Planned Area Boundary to serve as the limits of the area to be planned for urban development.
Policy L2        2035 Growth Boundary
Designate a 2035 Growth Boundary to serve as the limits of the area to be developed with urban uses
during the 2015 to 2035 planning period. Locate the 2035 Growth Boundary along major roadways and
other natural or manmade physical features that can serve as a physical boundary between urban and
agricultural uses.
Policy L3        Developable Land Inventory
Include enough land within the 2035 Growth Boundary to meet the projected land needs to accommodate
growth through the year 2035, along with a 35% market flexibility factor that acknowledges existing
constraints to development of some parcels.
Policy L4        New Development within Boundary
Approve new urban development only within the 2035 Growth Boundary.
General Plan Update                                                                                   19

Policy Document
Policy L5          Expansion of 2035 Growth Boundary
Consider expansion of the 2035 Growth Boundary only after making the following findings:
     1. There have been building permits issued for more than 11,676 residential housing units within the
          city limits since January 1, 2013.
     2. There is a need for additional land to be made available for urban development.
     3. There is land identified in the urban reserve area Primary Sphere of Influence that should be
          considered for expansion should that need occur.
Policy L6          Agriculture and the Urban Fringe
Recognize and protect the right of agricultural uses within the growth boundary to exist and continue to
operate in proximity to new development on the fringes of the City.
3.2.2 Spheres of Influence
Hanford’s Sphere of Influence delineates the city’s probable physical boundary and service area, as
determined by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) of Kings County. LAFCo’s policy is
to adopt a Primary Sphere of Influence and a Secondary Sphere of Influence. The Primary Sphere of
Influence determines the areas that can be annexed. The Secondary Sphere of Influence identifies areas
where LAFCo recommends land use coordination between Hanford and Kings County. LAFCo makes
the final determination on the location of both the Primary and Secondary Spheres of Influence.
Policy L7           Primary Sphere of Influence
Support and pursue an amendment of the City of Hanford’s Primary Sphere of Influence to be
coterminous to the Planned Area Boundary.
Policy L8          Home Garden Community Services District
Support the continuance of the Home Garden Community Services District as an independent special
district serving the existing Home Garden community. Support the existing location of the Home Garden
Community Services District Sphere of Influence.
3.2.3 City Form
Hanford’s physical city form has been developing over time since the original railroad land plat was laid
out. Locations of railroad lines, major roads, freeways, the downtown, the industrial park, the 12th Avenue
commercial district, and other major physical features have all affected the overall city form. The following
policies identify the direction for guiding the future form of the city.
Policy L9          Center of City
Maintain the historic downtown as the physical center of the community.
20                                                                                            City of Hanford

Policy L10         Residential / Industrial Separation
Discourage designation of land for new residential uses south of Houston Avenue.
Policy L11         Infill Development
Support, encourage, and incentivize, to the extent possible, infill development projects that can effectively
utilize existing transportation and utility infrastructure.
Policy L12         Regional Commercial Centers
Locate regional commercial centers in areas that have access to major highways.
Policy L13         Development Boundary at 13th Avenue
Locate the 2035 Growth Boundary at 13th Avenue to maintain a rural agricultural land use buffer between
Hanford and the communities of Grangeville and Armona.
Policy L14         Fourth High School Site
Coordinate with Hanford High School District to determine the location of a fourth high school site, with
preference given to sites south of Highway 198.
3.2.4 Annexation
Annexation of land into Hanford allows previously undeveloped land to become available for development
and allows the City of Hanford to provide the territory that is annexed with its full range of City services.
The annexation process can serve as an interim growth management tool by limiting annexations to only
the land that is needed for growth at the time. The following policies define Hanford’s process for
annexing new territory.
Policy L15         Initiation of Annexations
Consider initiation of annexation of land into the City of Hanford only when the following criteria are
met:
         1. The land is within the Primary Sphere of Influence.
         2. The capacity of the water, sewer, fire, school, and police services are adequate to service the
              area to be annexed, or will be adequate at the time that development occurs.
         3. Land for development within the City limits is insufficient to meet the current land use needs.
         4. The territory to be annexed is contiguous to existing developed areas.
Policy L16         County Islands
Initiate annexation of County islands when it is found that urban services are needed and can be provided
or made available in the near future.
General Plan Update                                                                                       21

Policy Document
Policy L17        Plan for Services
Prepare and make publicly available a written Plan for Services that describes how urban services will be
provided prior to initiating an annexation.
3.3 Land Use Designations
Land use designations are policy statements the City has developed to guide decisions about the type and
intensity of development envisioned during the life of the General Plan. Unlike zoning districts, which
regulate land uses, building envelopes, setbacks, height limits, and or design standards, land use
designations are intended to be broad descriptions used to plan the physical layout of the city and promote
a logical pattern of development. Ultimately, zoning districts must be consistent with land use designations
included in the General Plan.
Residential land use capacity is measured in terms of density and housing units, while commercial, office,
and industrial land use capacity is measured in terms of floor area ratio and gross building square footage.
There are 19 identified land use designations. They are identified on the Land Use Map (Figure 3-1) and
in Tables 3-2, 3-3, and 3-4. Each designation is described in more detail in sections 3.4 through 3.9 of this
chapter.
Land Use Designation Goals
Goal L4: Adequate land available to meet housing needs for all citizens through the year
             2035.
Goal L5: Stable, high quality neighborhoods with housing integrated with schools, parks,
             and availability of everyday commercial goods and services.
Goal L6: A wide range of housing choices that insure opportunities for a variety of age
             groups, lifestyles, and income levels.
Goal L7: Residential densities that encourage both compact and infill development.
3.3.1 Land Use Designation Map
The land use framework of the General Plan is illustrated in the General Plan Land Use Map (Figure
3-1), which is a graphic representation of the goals and policies in the Land Use Element of the General
Plan. The Map designates the proposed general location, distribution, and extent of land uses. The varying
land use designations are shown as color patterns on the Map.

Policy Document
These density/intensity assumptions are used to determine circulation, public infrastructure, and service
needs. The Map is to be used and interpreted in conjunction with the text and other figures contained in
the General Plan. The legend of the General Plan Map includes the land use designations described below,
which represent an adopted component of the Plan. Although the boundaries between land use
designations often follow existing property boundaries, the Land Use Map is not necessarily parcel specific.
3.3.2 Land Use Designation Acreages and Densities
Table 3-2 identifies by acreage the amount of developed, undeveloped, underutilized, and available land in
each land use designation. Table 3-3 uses the amount of available acres to estimate the capacity of the
land for residential growth, as measured in housing units, and commercial and industrial growth, as
measured in gross building square footage. The terms used in Tables 3-2 and 3-3 are defined below.
“Developed land” is land that is occupied by a permanent structure or urban use.
“Undeveloped Land” is land that is mostly vacant of structures and is currently unused for any purpose or
is being used for agricultural or open space use.
“Underutilized Land” is land with a structure or structures that occupy only a small portion of the land
and are being used significantly below its potential use.
“Available Land” is a combination of undeveloped land and underutilized land. The acreage is calculated
as 100% of the undeveloped land plus 20% of the underutilized land because it is assumed that not all
underutilized land will redevelop.
“Density” is the ratio of the number of dwelling units per gross acre in a given area or development.
“Floor Area Ratio” or “FAR” is a ratio of the total gross square feet of floor space of a building divided
by the total square feet of the lot or parcel. For example, a 1-story building covering half of a lot would
have a FAR of 0.5, while a 2-story building covering half of a lot would have an FAR of 1.0.
 “Approved Tentative Subdivision Map Adjustment” is the difference between the estimated number of
units that a parcel of land can accommodate using an average density calculation and the actual approved
number of lots in an approved tentative subdivision map.
Table 3-4 pairs the new General Plan land use designations with the corresponding land use designations
from the 2002 General Plan. As shown in the figure, Low Density and Very Low Density Residential has
been combined to Low Density Residential, and Planned and Community Commercial has been combined
to Regional Commercial. Educational Facilities, Airport Protection, and Area of Interest land use
designations are new designations. Agriculture and Urban Reserve land use designations from the 2002
General Plan would be retired.

Policy Document
3.4 Residential Land Use
The residential land use districts vary primarily through development densities as well as the street
improvements required in each district. The higher residential densities occur within the city’s center core
and along arterial roadways. Residential land use designations are organized into the following categories:
Low Density Residential, Medium Density Residential, and High Density Residential. The placement of
these designations on the Land Use Map establishes distinct residential land use categories that identify
where certain density categories may occur. While the General Plan outlines overall development
parameters, the Zoning Ordinance implements these designations through regulations for specific districts
and allowed uses.
Residential Land Use Designations Goals
Goal L8: A range of residential building types suitable for a variety of lifestyles, ages,
            affordability levels, and design options.

offices, and homes (dwelling units) in close proximity, thereby allowing residents to work and shop close
to home and reduce the length and frequency of trips between home, work, shopping, and services. This
contributes to opportunities to increase the use of public transit, reduce auto dependency, provide a wider
range of housing choices, and promote activity during more hours of the day. Both vertical and horizontal
mixed-use developments are encouraged in the mixed use designations. The Hanford Zoning Ordinance
provides the enforcement mechanism to implement the identified policies.
34                                                                                            City of Hanford

An infill development site is defined as any parcel or group of parcels that are vacant or underdeveloped
and surrounded by development on at least 75% of its perimeter. Infill sites may include previously
developed sites that may/will be redeveloped. Examples include:
      • Mixed use development in the Downtown and/or in areas within walking distance to transit,
          employment centers, and commercial services where the environmental impacts of the
          development would be minimized;
      • Residential infill in/near established neighborhoods;
      • Increased densities on sites that can accommodate the increases without having an adverse
          effect on adjacent properties;
      • Targeted residential infill development that address the needs of seniors, lower income
          households, single households and empty nesters, young professionals, and other special
          needs groups; and,
      • Rehabilitation of older apartment complexes.

CHAPTER 4
TRANSPORTATION & CIRCULATION
The circulation element of the General Plan describes the general location and extent of existing and
proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, airports, and railroads. The chapter also
responds to the new State requirement to plan for “complete streets.” Hanford must plan for “a balanced,
multimodal transportation network that meet the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways for safe
and convenient travel in a manner that is suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context of the general
plan.” Users include bicyclists, pedestrians, children, motorists, persons with disabilities, the elderly, users
of public transportation, and commercial goods movers. The circulation element focuses on improving
mobility for all forms of transportation in existing transportation networks as well as identifying new routes
and systems to support future growth during the Planning period.
4.1 Principles Related to Transportation & Circulation
The guiding principles related to transpiration and circulation are:
     • Coordinated land use and circulation systems
     • Safe, reliable, efficient movement of people and goods
     • Less reliance on private motorized transportation
     • A prosperous community
     • Downtown area as the physical, cultural, civic, and commercial center of Hanford
     • Hanford as the regional commercial, service, and government center of Kings County
     • Enhancement of quality of life
     • Respect for private property rights
     • Enhancement of the historic center of the City
     • A well-designed, physically integrated, livable community

Policy Document
Overarching Transportation and Circulation Goals
Goal T1: A comprehensive, multi-modal motorized and non-motorized transportation
            system that improves the quality of life and facilitates the efficient movement of
            people and goods.
Goal T2: Increased use of shared and non-motorized transportation alternatives resulting
            in a per capita reduction in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and greenhouse gas
            (GHG) emissions.
4.2 Streets and Highways
Streets and highways provide opportunities for most of modes of transportation, including walking, biking,
personal vehicles, public transit buses, and heavy freight trucks. They are the most utilized infrastructure
in the transportation network and can most easily adapt to changing needs.
Streets and Highways Goals
Goal T3: City streets that meet the needs of bicyclists, pedestrians, children, motorists,
            persons with disabilities, the elderly, users of public transportation, and
            commercial goods movers.
Goal T4: State highways that provide effective mobility to regions outside the Planning
            Area.
4.2.1 Road Classification System
All street and highway facilities serve two basic functions; mobility and land access. Mobility refers to the
provision of vehicle movement, and Access refers to parking, storage or driveway access at the origin or
destination of a person's trip to identify the specific function of roadways in terms of access and mobility,
the following classification system for streets and highways is commonly used:
State Highways. State Highways and Freeways place much greater importance on moving traffic than
providing access to adjacent land. Often direct access to land is limited or prohibited.
Arterial Streets. Arterials provide a high level of mobility with limited access to adjacent properties.
Arterials connect highway interchanges and support the principal roadway system. Arterials provide access
to collectors and some local streets.
Collector Streets. Collectors provide a balance of land access and mobility functions within residential,
commercial, and industrial land uses. Collectors connect local streets to arterials.
Local Streets. Local streets provide direct access to adjoining land and connections to collectors.
Alleys. Alleys are public rights-of-way, at the rear or side of property, permanently reserved as a secondary
means of vehicular or pedestrian access to abutting property. Alleys typically only occur in and near the
downtown and are not currently used in contemporary development projects.

CHAPTER 5
OPEN SPACE, CONSERVATION &
RECREATION
Hanford’s natural and open space environment forms an important part of the city’s unique character.
The open space element addresses four basic areas: (1) Open space for the managed production of
resources, such as agricultural and mineral resources; (2) Open space for outdoor recreation, including
parks and recreational facilities; (3) Open space for public health and safety, such as flood prone and
wildfire areas; and (4) Open space for the preservation of natural resources, such as natural habitat for
plants, fish, and wildlife. The conservation element is required to address issues such as preservation of
waterways, soils, wildlife, natural and riparian habitats, and historical and cultural resources. This chapter
combines both elements together, and also includes recreational topics such as provision of parks and
recreational programs.
5.1 Principles Related to Open Space, Conservation &
Recreation
The guiding principles related to open space, conservation, and recreation are:
     • Safe and secure recreational facilities
     • Superior, innovative recreational opportunities
     • Collaborative relationship with citizens
     • Protection and preservation of natural resources
     • A prosperous community
     • A strong sense of place and community image

5.2 Agricultural Resources
An important facet of Hanford’s economy is agriculture. A wide variety of vegetables, stone fruits and
nuts thrive in the area’s fertile soil and are packed, stored and shipped to areas throughout the world. The
City’s climate, water availability and proximity to transcontinental transportation routes have made it a
premier location for agricultural land development for over a century. Most of the land surrounding the
urbanized area of Hanford was converted to agricultural use decades ago, leaving very little undisturbed
natural landscape.
Agricultural Resources Goal
Goal O1: Conservation and long term protection of agricultural resources and soils located
            outside of the Planned Area Boundary.
5.2.1 Agricultural Land Protection
Policy O1        Boundary between Urban and Agricultural Uses

Policy O4         Interim Agricultural Use
Retain existing agricultural areas as an interim use inside the Planned Area Boundary and support
agricultural operations until such time that the areas are needed for logical urban expansion.
5.2.2 Williamson Act
Much of the agricultural land that surrounds Hanford is subject to the California Land Conservation Act
of 1965, also known as the Williamson Act. Under the provisions of the Williamson Act, the property
owner and the County enter into a ten year agreement, that renews itself every year for another ten years,
to keep the property in agricultural use. In exchange for this guarantee, the property owner receives a
property tax reduction.
Policy O5          Farmland Mitigation Program
In collaboration with the County of Kings and other cities in Kings County, determine the feasibility and,
if feasible, consider adoption of a countywide farmland mitigation program that is tailored to the needs
and goals of the Kings County agricultural region to mitigate the urban conversion of agricultural lands
that are outside adopted urban growth boundaries.
Policy O6         Removal of Land from Williamson Act
Encourage use of Notices of Nonrenewal as the preferred method of removal of land within the Planned
Area Boundary from Williamson Act Land Conservation Contract.
Policy O7         Cancellation and Succession to Williamson Act Contracts
Adopt and periodically update a set of policies that govern the cancellation of Williamson Act contracts,
and define the circumstances that the City would be willing to succeed to an active contract.
Policy O8         Annexation of Williamson Act Lands
Consider annexation of Williamson Act lands only if the land is within the 2035 Growth Boundary and
only if such annexation is necessary to provide for logical urban development, job creation, or the
provision of municipal services.
Policy O9         New Williamson Act Contracts
Oppose new Williamson Act contracts on land within the Planned Area Boundary.
5.2.3 Deed-Restricted Agricultural Sites
Policy O10        Existing Deed-Restricted Agricultural Sites
Designate sites with existing deed agreements that limit the land to agricultural use with the Open Space
land use designation.

Policy O11      New Deed-Restricted Agricultural Sites
Discourage new deed agreements that restrict land to agricultural use on land inside the Planned Area
Boundary.
5.2.4 Soils
Policy O12      Soil Erosion
Require new development to implement measures to minimize soil erosion related to construction.
5.3 Mineral and Energy Resources
The Planning Area contains few if any non-renewable resources that could be used for energy generation.
Solar power is the most likely renewable source, given Hanford’s climate.
Mineral and Energy Resources Goal
Goal O2: Conservation of non-renewable energy resources and maximization of the use of
            renewable energy resources.
5.3.1 Mineral Resources
Mineral resource extraction involves the removal of natural resources from their place of discovery. At
this time there are no known significant deposits of minerals, and no active mines. The only mineral
commodities that have been found within the Hanford Planning Area are sand and gravel that could be
used for road and building construction. The Monterey Shale lies beneath Kings County and contains
both oil and natural gas deposits. However, there have been no efforts to date to attempt extraction of
these resources within or near the Planning Area.
5.3.2 Energy Resources
Energy resources are those natural resources or environments that can be used to produce energy.
Nonrenewable energy includes petroleum oil, natural gas, and coal. Renewable resources are those that
the supply is unlimited or it can be replenished. This includes solar and wind energy, and, if properly
managed, hydroelectric and geothermal power. There are no known oil, gas, or coal resources within the
Planning Area. The only potential renewable energy generation potential would be the conversion of solar
energy.
Policy O13      Solar Power Generation
Support and encourage solar generation facilities that support residential, commercial, and industrial uses.
5.3.3 Energy Conservation
The goal of energy resource conservation is to reduce consumption of non-renewable resources. This
may be achieved either by the more efficient use of these resources, or by replacing them with renewable

5.4 Water Resources
Hanford is located in the Tulare Lake Hydrologic Region, which encompasses all of Kings County, most
of Tulare and Fresno counties, and most of the Valley portion of Kern County. All of Hanford’s water
supply for urban uses comes from groundwater extraction. The Region’s groundwater has been in critical
overdraft for at least 35 years despite efforts made by local groundwater management agencies.
Historic natural watercourses in the Planning Area include the Mussel, Sand, and Lone Oak Sloughs.
Remnants of the sloughs still exist as areas for collecting stormwater, but due to previous grading for
agricultural and urban development they are no longer connected in the form of any type of water course.
The People's Ditch, an irrigation canal dug in the 1870s, traverses Hanford from north to south inside the
Planning Area. The Kings River is about four miles north of Hanford, outside of the Plan Area.
Water Resources Goal
Goal O3: A reduced per capita use of water used by residential and non-residential uses
            through water conservation measures.
General Plan Update                                                                                     81

5.4.2 Water Pollution Prevention
Hanford’s storm drain system prevents flooding by channeling rainwater runoff into collection basins
interspersed throughout the City. Oil, pesticides, and other residues in runoff can contaminate stormwater.
Wastes that people pour directly into the drains or creeks are other sources of stormwater pollution.
Policy O30       Storm Water Pollution Prevention
Implement the NPDES Stormwater Permit and for those properties exempt from the Permit, require a
storm water pollution prevention plan, including use of best management practices, to control erosion and
sedimentation during construction.
5.5 Biological Resources
Although not common, it is possible that the Planning Area could be inhabited by rare, threatened, or
endangered species. There are also resources as such as wetlands and oak trees that could be disturbed by
new development activity that results from city growth. Such disturbance would also have the potential to
adversely affect species that inhabit these types of areas, including various amphibians, mammals, song
birds, and raptors. Endangered or threatened species potentially within the Planning Area include the
hoary bat, Swainson’s hawk, Western pond turtle, and San Joaquin Kit fox.
Biological Resources Goal
Goal O4: Protection of natural habitat and other biological resources.
5.5.1 Natural Habitat

Goal O9: Parks provided at a combined ratio of 3.5 acres per 1,000 residents.
Goal O10: Recreational programs that promote and support a healthy lifestyle and sense of
             community in Hanford.
5.7.1 Park Classifications
The City of Hanford uses a hierarchy to classify the types of parks and park standards that are desirable
for various locations in the city. This hierarchy is a local adaptation of the National Recreation and Park
Association Open Space Standards.
Private Recreational Space. Private recreational space includes land within a multi-family residential
development that is dedicated to recreational use for the residents within the development. It can take the
form of a tot lot with play equipment, and swimming pool, volleyball or tennis court, or other developed
recreational space. Typically, only residents and their guests are allowed to use the space.
Mini-Park or Pocket Park. A Mini-Park is typically less than two acres in size and intended to serve the
needs of a specific neighborhood. Mini-parks are usually landscaped with trees and turf, with urban-style
parks also including hardscape. Besides residential neighborhoods, they can also be found in downtown
areas to provide places to relax or eat. Mini-parks are not required in new developments, but developers
may choose to add them as an additional amenity for the neighborhood.
Neighborhood Park. This type of park is primarily for children and families in the nearby vicinity. The
Neighborhood Park is usually 2 to 5 acres in size. A neighborhood park serves a half-mile radius. The
typical size ratio is 1.0 acre per 1,000 population.
Community Park. A Community Park is intended to serve the needs of the entire city, especially those
living within about a 2-mile radius of the park. Being larger in size, it usually provides outdoor and indoor
facilities that accommodate a much wider range of recreational interests than a Neighborhood Park.
Facilities usually include fields and courts for various sports. A community park’s typical size ratio is 2.0
acres per 1,000 population.
Regional Park. A regional park is a large open space facility designed for active and passive uses. It can
be a large natural open space area, or an improved area with fields and courts that usually include lighting.
A regional park serves the entire community and often draws people from outside the community,
especially for special events. Typically, regional parks are established by counties to benefit both city and
county residents, but they can also be established be cities. The Hanford Joint Use Softball Complex is a
regional park.
Special Use Park. Special use parks provide a specific type of recreational activity and are meant to serve
the entire community. The BMX Track, Harris Street Ball Park and The Plunge/Skate Park site are
examples that provide special programmed park spaces.
Dual-Purpose Storm Water Basin/Park. Some neighborhood, community and regional parks, include
storm water detention basins to use the land more efficiently. This allows the site to be used to control

Policy Document
urban flooding, recharge groundwater systems and provide recreational use. Careful design can allow the
storm basin to be used for recreation when not filled with water.
Indoor Recreation Facilities. Indoor recreation facilities allow for public gathering places for a variety of
social and recreational activities. Larger facilities serve the entire community while smaller facilities may
serve a large neighborhood or a certain portion of the community. The Civic Center Auditorium, Coe
Hall, Longfield Center, St. Brigid’s Teen Center, and the Veterans-Senior Center, are examples of indoor
recreational facilities.
School Parks. All school sites have limited public access since their primary purpose is to support their
educational mission. These facilities are sometimes accessible to the public after school hours.

Policy O53        Parkland Ratio Calculation
When determining the parkland ratio of acres per 1,000 population, include the acreage of city-owned
mini, neighborhood, community, regional, special use, and storm water basin parks, along with 50% of the
acreage of school playgrounds and play areas within the Planned Area Boundary.
Policy O54        Multi-use Storm Water Basins
Where appropriate, support dual-purpose storm water detention basins for multiple use as parks.
5.7.2 Mini-Parks
Policy O55        Mini-Parks
Allow mini-parks between 0.25 acres to 1.0 acre in size to be built at locations that are easily accessed by
the residents of the neighborhood. Mini-parks do not contribute to the citywide park ratio goal and are
considered an optional addition, and not an alternative to neighborhood and community parks.

Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) is a multi-disciplinary approach to deterring
criminal behavior through environmental design. It seeks to dissuade offenders from committing crimes
by manipulating the physical environment in which those crimes might occur. The three most common
built environment strategies applied in CPTED are natural surveillance, natural access control, and natural
territorial reinforcement. Proper design and effective use of the built environment can lead to a reduction
in the incidence and fear of crime. The CPTED principles are:
     • Use design elements to define space physically or symbolically and control access to property.
     • Design activities and spaces so that users of the space are visible rather than concealed.
     • Employ certain elements to convey a sense of arrival and ownership and guide the public through
         clearly delineated public, semi-public, and private spaces.

Natural hazards are naturally occurring event’s that put health, safety, and property at risk. The following
natural hazards are ones that are most likely to occur in the Hanford area.
Natural Hazards Goal
Goal H3: Reduced risk to public health and safety and disruption of social, economic, and
             environmental welfare resulting from natural hazards.
7.3.1 Drought
Droughts are widespread events that, when they occur, affect all of Kings County and surrounding
counties. Impacts include water restrictions on homes and businesses, agricultural and livestock losses,
negative economic impacts, and increased costs for water. Secondary effects include increased
groundwater pumping that can contribute to land subsidence problems and degraded water quality.
Policy H14         Reduction in Individual Domestic Well Use
Consider policies and investments in the City water system that will allow homes using individual wells to
connect to the City water system.
7.3.2 Earthquakes
No major fault systems are known to exist in Kings County. Ground shaking is the most likely damaging
effect of an earthquake for Hanford. The community’s vulnerability is increased due to its large number
of unreinforced masonry buildings, many of them historic properties.
General Plan Update                                                                                      109

Policy Document
Policy H15       Building Codes and Standards for Earthquakes
Maintain and enforce current buildings codes and standards to reduce the potential for structural failure
caused by ground shaking and other geologic hazards.
Policy H16       Hazardous Buildings Upgrade
Develop policies to assist in the upgrading of seismically hazardous (unreinforced masonry) buildings
within the City.
Policy H17       Geologic and Soils Studies
Require geologic and soils studies to identify potential hazards as part of the approval process for all new
development prior to grading activities where questionable conditions exist.
7.3.3 Extreme Heat
Prolonged, high temperatures in the summer can lead to conditions of extreme heat. Field workers and
other outdoor workers are susceptible to heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Elderly residents who live alone
and have limited mobility are also vulnerable during heat waves. Problems with power loss and water
distribution also can occur during periods of extreme heat. Kings County has adopted an Extreme Heat
Emergency Plan that identifies cooling stations to avoid extreme heat conditions. The sites include the
Hanford Mall, Hanford Branch Library, the Kings County Government Center, and the Salvation Army.
The Plan calls for the City of Hanford to declare a local heat emergency when the National Weather Service
Hanford office predicts the daytime temperatures will exceed 105F.
Policy H18       Extreme Heat Emergency Plan
Support the maintenance and implementation of the Kings County Extreme Heat Emergency Plan to
support vulnerable populations during times of extreme heat.
Policy H19       Cooling Centers
Periodically evaluate the effectiveness of existing cooling centers and determine the need for additional
cooling centers as population increases.
7.3.4 Floods
Hanford has several natural drainage courses and irrigation canals, but 100-year flooding is not a hazard in
the Hanford area. The major irrigation ditches that run through Hanford are the Peoples Ditch and
Lakeside Ditch. These ditches are operated and maintained privately by the Peoples Ditch Company and
Lakeside Water District respectively. The National Flood Insurance Study for Hanford concluded that the
Peoples Ditch and Lakeside Ditch are not flood hazards. The most likely flooding that could occur would
be localized flooding resulting from the failure of the storm water drainage system.
110                                                                                         City of Hanford

Require new development to provide onsite drainage or contribute towards their fair share cost of off-site
drainage facilities to handle surface runoff.
Policy H21        Stormwater System Maintenance
Provide ongoing stormwater maintenance activities such as routine inspections, cleaning, and preventive
repairs.
7.3.5 Dam Failure
The Hazard Mitigation Plan for Kings County concludes that dam inundation is not a significant hazard
due to the very low probability of dam failure and distance of Hanford from existing dams.
7.3.6 Fog
The San Joaquin Valley has a unique fog problem. The Tule fog season in Kings County is typically
December through February. Fog contributes to transportation accidents and is a significant life safety
hazard. Disruptions from fog include delayed emergency response vehicles and school closures. Highways
and busy intersections during traffic rush hours become hazardous areas during severe fog events.
Policy H22        Maintenance of Traffic Control Devices
Maintain a traffic signage and striping system that helps drivers navigate during Tule fog events.
Policy H23        Driving Techniques in the Fog
Educate the public on driving techniques for navigating in the Tule fog.
7.3.7 Freeze
Although Hanford is considered to have relatively mild winters, periods of extreme cold or freeze can
occur. Freezes can cause water pipes to rupture, resulting in building flooding. Crops can be damaged or
lost. People with inadequately heated homes can be subject to health risks.
Policy H24        Warming Centers
Periodically evaluate the effectiveness of warming center and determine the need for additional warming
center as population increases.
7.3.8 Wind and Dust Storms
Hanford is in the Very Low Risk category for tornados. However, wind and dust storms can occur,
resulting in property losses and a mild health risk.
Policy H25        Debris Management
Enhance strategies for debris management after windstorm events.
General Plan Update                                                                                    111

7.4.3 Hazardous Materials and Toxic Waste
Proper storage, use, disposal, and transport of hazardous materials are necessary to reduce the risk of
contamination to surface and groundwater, land resources, air, and environmentally sensitive areas. Serious
injuries, loss of life and economic disruption can occur as a result of accidents related to hazardous
materials. Used motor oil, paint, solvents, lawn care and gardening products, household cleaners, gasoline,
and refrigerants are among the diverse range of substances classified as hazardous materials.
Policy H29       Household Hazardous Materials
Coordinate with other public agencies to educate consumers about the proper household use and disposal
of hazardous materials.
Policy H30       Industrial Hazardous Materials
Require industrial uses that rely extensively on the use of hazardous materials to adopt an acceptable use,
storage, disposal, and emergency response program that has been approved by appropriate agencies.
112                                                                                         City of Hanford

Disclosure Law.
7.4.4 Hazardous Waste Transport
Large quantities of hazardous materials are transported along SR 198, SR 43, and freight rail lines that pass
through Hanford, making it susceptible to hazardous spills, releases, or accidents. Given the capacity of
the Kettleman Hills facility and the many waste generators shipping hazardous materials to that facility,
there is a significant potential risk to Hanford from transportation of hazardous waste.
Policy H36        Transport of Hazardous Materials
Promote the safe transport of hazardous materials through Hanford by designating hazardous material
carrier routes to direct hazardous materials away from populated and other sensitive areas, and prohibiting
vehicles transporting hazardous materials from parking on City streets. Coordinate with the California
Highway Patrol to maintain designated travel routes through the Hanford Area for vehicles transporting
hazardous materials.
7.4.5 Brownfields
Policy H37        Property Clean Up
Ensure that hazardous materials are cleaned up before a property is developed or redeveloped.
General Plan Update                                                                                      113

Policy Document
Policy H38       Brownfield Site Inventory and Remediation Policies

Policy Document
8.2 Coordination with Housing Element
The Housing Element of the Hanford General Plan is prepared separately from the rest of the General
Plan in accordance with the timelines required by the State of California Department of Housing and
Community Development (DHCD). Hanford typically joins with the other three Kings County cities and
Kings County to prepare a combined Housing Element that covers all five jurisdictions in Kings County.
The latest Housing Element is currently being prepared in this manner. Its planned adoption date is
January 2016, and it will cover the time period from 2016 to 2024. The Housing Element remains a
separate document, but it is still a full functioning Element of this General Plan
8.3 Coordination with Air Quality Element
Hanford adopted an Air Quality Element as a standalone document in 2010. The intention was that this
Element would be incorporated into the General Plan Update. The Air Quality Element remains a separate
document, but it is still a full functioning Element of this General Plan.
Air quality elements are optional elements in California, except for jurisdictions located within the San
Joaquin Valley. Section 65302.1 of the California Government Code requires all 59 cities and eight counties
within the boundaries of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) to include air
quality elements or air quality goals, policies, and implementation strategies within other elements of their
general plans. The City of Hanford (City) has opted to provide a separate Air Quality Element of the
General Plan as a means to highlight the importance of this issue to City residents. In addition, the Air
Quality Element conveys the interconnectedness of land use, transportation, and air quality in a single
location in the General Plan. The City has also taken this opportunity to simultaneously address
greenhouse gases and climate change issues in the Air Quality Element. Most of the actions to reduce air
pollutant emissions also reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
