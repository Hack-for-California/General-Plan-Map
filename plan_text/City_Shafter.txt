                           Table 7.B – Description of Compatibility Zones
The following general guidelines are used in establishing the compatibility zone boundaries for a civilian airport.
Modifications to the boundaries may be made to reflect specific local conditions, such as existing roadways,
property lines, and land uses.
    A.   The boundaries of this Zone are defined by runway protection zones and the airfield’s building restric-
         tion lines.
         Runway protection zone dimensions and locations are set in accordance with FAA standards for pro-
         posed future runway location, length, width, and approach type as indicated on an approved Airport
         Layout Plan. If no plan is approved, the existing runway configuration is used.
         The building restriction line indicated on an approved Airport Layout Plan is used where such a plan ex-
         ists. Where no Airport Layout Plan exists, the zone boundary is set at the following distances measured
         laterally from the runway centerline.
         Visual runway for small airplanes:                      370 feet
         Visual runway for large airplanes:                      500 feet
         Non-precision instrument runway for large airplanes: 500 feet
         Precision instrument runway:                            750 feet
         These distances allow structures up to approximately 35 feet in height to remain below the airspace sur-
         faces defined by FAR Part 77.
    B1. The outer boundary of the Approach/Departure Zone is defined as the area where aircraft are com-
         monly below 400 feet above ground level (AGL). For visual runways, this location encompasses the
         base leg of the traffic pattern as commonly flown. On instrument runways, the altitudes established by
         approach procedures are used. Zone B1 also includes areas within 1,000 feet laterally from the runway
         centerline.
    B2. The Extended Approach/Departure Zone includes areas where aircraft are commonly below 800 feet
         AGL on straight-in approach or straight-out departure. It applies to runways with more than 500 opera-
         tions per year by large aircraft (over 12,500 pounds maximum gross takeoff weight) and/or runway ends
         with more than 10,000 total annual takeoffs.
    C. The outer boundary of the Common Traffic Pattern Zone is defined as the area where aircraft are com-
         monly below 1,000 feet AGL (i.e., the traffic pattern and pattern entry points). This area is considered to
         extend 5,000 to 10,000 feet longitudinally from the end of the runway primary surface. The length de-
         pends upon the runway classification (visual versus instrument) and the type and volume of aircraft ac-
         commodated. For runways having an established traffic solely on one side, the shape of the zone is
         modified accordingly.
    D    The outer boundary of the Other Airport Environs Zone conforms to the adopted Planning Area for each
         airport.

    noise analysis to be prepared. Require
    appropriate noise mitigation when the
    proposed project will exceed General Plan
    noise objectives, or cause an audible (3.0
    dBA) increase in noise in areas where
    General Plan noise objectives are already
    exceeded as the result of existing devel-
    opment.
7. Utilize site and architectural design fea-
    tures to mitigate noise impacts, where
    feasible. In addition to sound barriers,
    consider:
        Increasing building setbacks to further
         separate the noise-sensitive use from
         the noise source.
        Locating uses that are the most toler-
         ant of noise closer to the noise source
         and use the buildings housing these
         uses as noise barriers.
        Orient delivery, loading docks, and
         outdoor work areas away from noise-
         sensitive uses.
        Place noise-tolerant uses, such as
         parking areas, and noise-tolerant
         structures, such as garages, between
         the noise source and sensitive recep-
         tor.
        Cluster office, commercial, or multi-
         family residential structures to reduce
         noise levels within interior open space
         areas.
        Provide double-glazed and double-
         paned windows on the side of the
         structure facing a major noise source,
         and place entries away from the noise
         source to the extent possible.
8. Where feasible, use noise barriers (walls,
    berms, or a combination thereof) to reduce
    significant noise impacts. Where noise
    barriers are constructed, require appropri-
    ate landscaping treatment to be provided.
9. Continue enforcement of California Noise
    Insulation Standards (Title 25, Section
    1092, California Administrative Code).

    ties in order to avoid or mitigate noise im-
