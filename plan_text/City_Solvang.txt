                                         Conservation/Open Space Element
    1
1.0 INTRODUCTION
The rich natural, historical and cultural resources of the Santa Ynez
Valley enrich the lives of Solvang residents and visitors alike. The
area’s oak covered hillsides, creeks and rich agricultural lands create
a striking landscape and distinctive city backdrop that continues to
attract thousands of visitors each year. Accordingly, the protection of
these resources is essential for the wellbeing of City residents and for
the health of the local economy.
The combined Conservation/Open Space element (COSE) promotes
the balanced management of these resources based on an
overarching theme of sustainability. When used in this COSE,
sustainability is defined as the ability to meet the needs of the current
generation without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their needs. In practical terms, a sustainable approach reduces
resource consumption, avoids pollution, and helps people live
healthier lives. In addition, sustainable practices will better position
the City to respond to the growing challenges associated with climate
change.
1.1        ORGANIZATION OF THE
           CONSERVATION/OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
The Conservation/Open Space Element is organized by topical
sections that address the range of natural and cultural resources
within and surrounding the City’s Plan Area 1. Each section begins
with a brief overview of the topic and its relevance to land use
decisions in Solvang. Maps are provided to help illustrate the extent
of these resources within the City’s Plan Area. Lastly, each topical
section contains goals, policies and action items to guide future
decision making:
         Goal: The ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is
         general in nature and immeasurable.
         Policy: A specific statement in text or diagram guiding action
         and implying clear commitment.
         Action Item: An action, procedure, program, or technique
         that carries out general plan policy.
1 The City’s Plan Area consists of land designated by the City’s General
Plan Land Use Element Map and includes the current City limits and
adopted sphere of influence.

                                       Conservation/Open Space Element
1.2        GENERAL PLAN BACKGROUND REPORT
For the goals and policies of the Conservation/Open Space Element
to provide effective guidance for the management of the City’s
natural and cultural resources, they must be founded on a thorough
understanding of the type, extent, and sensitivity of these resources
within the City’s Plan Area and within the region. A description of
these resources is provided in the City of Solvang General Plan
Conservation, Open Space and Safety Elements Background Report
which is published separately and available on the City’s website.
The findings and conclusion of the Background Report are
summarized in the topical sections that follow. This information is
intended to provide context to the reader and was used to inform the
goals, policies and action items.
1.3        REGULATORY SETTING
Statutory Requirements
The combined Conservation/Open Space Element is one of several
topics (“Elements”) that comprise the City’s General Plan.
Government Code sections 65302(d) and (e) describe the issues that
the Conservation and Open Elements must cover which includes the
following:
Conservation Element
•    The conservation, development, and utilization of natural
     resources including water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils,
     rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals, and
     other natural resources.
•    The reclamation of land and waters.
•    The prevention and control of the pollution of streams and other
     waters.
•    Regulation of the use of land in stream channels and other areas
     required for the accomplishment of the conservation plan.
•    Prevention, control, and correction of the erosion of soils.
•    Protection of watersheds.
•    The location, quantity and quality of rock, sand, and gravel
     resources.
Open Space Element
Government Code section 65564 requires the Open Space Element
of a city’s general plan to contain an Open Space Plan which sets
forth “…an action program consisting of specific programs which the
legislative body intends to pursue in implementing its open-space
plan”. The goals, policies and actions items of this
Conservation/Open Space Element constitute the open space plan
                                                      Solvang General Plan 2

                                       Conservation/Open Space Element
for the City of Solvang. In addition, the Open Space Element must
address the following:
    •   The preservation of natural resources including, but not
        limited to, areas required for the preservation of plant and
        animal life, including habitat for fish and wildlife species;
        areas required for ecologic and other scientific study
        purposes; rivers, streams, bays and estuaries; and coastal
        beaches, lakeshores, banks of rivers and streams, and
        watershed lands.
    •   Open space used for the managed production of resources,
        including but not limited to, forest lands, rangeland,
        agricultural lands and areas of economic importance for the
        production of food or fiber; areas required for recharge of
        groundwater basins; bays, estuaries, marshes, rivers and
        streams which are important for the management of
        commercial fisheries; and areas containing major mineral
        deposits, including those in short supply.
    •   Open space for outdoor recreation, including but not limited
        to, areas of outstanding scenic, historic and cultural value;
        areas particularly suited for park and recreation purposes,
        including access to lakeshores, beaches, and rivers and
        streams; and areas which serve as links between major
        recreation and open-space reservations, including utility
        easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails, and scenic
        highway corridors.
    •   Open space for public health and safety, including, but not
        limited to, areas which require special management or
        regulation because of hazardous or special conditions such
        as earthquake fault zones, unstable soil areas, flood plains,
        watersheds, areas presenting high fire risks, areas required
        for the protection of water quality and water reservoirs and
        areas required for the protection and enhancement of air
        quality.
    •   Open space for the protection of places, features, and objects
        described in Sections 5097.9 and 5097.993 of the Public
        Resources Code (cultural resources).
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
Section 65300.5 of the California Government Code requires the
General Plan and its Elements to be “an integrated, internally
consistent and compatible statement of policies...” The
Conservation/Open Space Element is closely linked to several
Elements of the General Plan. The Land Use Element designates the
general distribution of land uses within the Plan Area, as well as
standards for population density and building intensity. The Land Use
Element also contains policies to ensure that the protection of natural
resources is considered in decisions involving land use. The Parks
and Recreation Element provides an inventory of park land within the
Plan Area along with standards and action items to ensure all of the
                                                    Solvang General Plan 3

                                       Conservation/Open Space Element
City’s neighborhoods have access to parks. The Circulation Element
is aimed at providing a safe and efficient system of transportation
serving the City which helps improve air quality and conserve fuel.
The Community Design Element provides guidance for the features
desired in new development to protect and enhance the character
and scenic qualities of the City. Lastly, one of the purposes of the
Conservation/Open Space Element is to preserve open space for
public health and safety, including areas that require special
management and regulation because of hazardous or special
conditions (e.g., earthquake fault zones, flood plains, unstable soil
areas, and high fire risk areas). These issues are addressed by the
Safety Element.
1.4       LIMITATIONS
The Conservation/Open Space Element is based on a general
evaluation of the natural and cultural resources within the City’s Plan
Area. The identification and evaluation of resources is based on
information available at the time of the Element’s preparation; no site
specific evaluations were performed.
The maps in this Element show the general areas of the extent and
location of resources, but should not be interpreted as to precisely
define potential natural and cultural resource areas. The
Conservation/Open Space Element is intended to be used for
general land use planning purposes only, and should be used to
identify where detailed site investigations would be required for new
development.

2.0 WATER RESOURCES
The effective management of water resources is essential for the
protection of sensitive resources and to provide the domestic water
supplies necessary for buildout of the City’s General Plan Area.
2.1 LOCAL WATER RESOURCES AND WATER
       QUALITY
Watersheds
Solvang is located in the western Santa Ynez Valley which is drained
primarily by the Santa Ynez River and its tributaries. The Santa Ynez
River flows westerly approximately 90 miles to the Pacific Ocean,
draining a nearly 900 square mile watershed bounded on the south
by the Santa Ynez Mountains, on the north and east by the San
Rafael Mountains and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The City’s
Plan Area is crossed by three tributary creeks: Alamo Pintado Creek,
Alisal Creek, and Adobe Canyon Creek.
The Santa Ynez River watershed (Figure 1) consists of steep
mountains with a dense cover of chaparral and oak woodlands. The
watershed above Bradbury Dam (Lake Cachuma) is primarily
undeveloped open space under the jurisdiction of the Los Padres
National Forest and the Lake Cachuma County Park. Lands
downstream of Bradbury Dam are mainly in private ownership and
fall under the jurisdiction of Santa Barbara County.
The Santa Ynez River watershed provides habitat to a wide variety of
fish and wildlife species. Ten fish species are native to the river
basin, four in freshwater and six in estuarine habitats. Two species
are listed as federally endangered: steelhead trout and tidewater
goby. Historically, the Santa Ynez River supported one of the largest
runs of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in California prior to
the construction of Bradbury Dam (Lake Cachuma), Gibraltar Dam
and other anthropogenic migration barriers. Efforts to restore
steelhead habitat on the River have been ongoing since 1993.
Groundwater Resources
Solvang is located within the Santa Ynez River Valley Groundwater
Basin (Figure 2). The total storage capacity of the Basin is estimated
                                                     Solvang General Plan 5

                                                     Conservation/Open Space Element
at 2,700,000 Acre-feet (af) (Bader 1969; DWR 1975a). Recharge is
derived from infiltration of precipitation, stream flows, and percolation
of irrigation water and wastewater effluent.
In accordance with requirements set forth by the State Water
Resources Control Board, water is released from Cachuma Reservoir
to recharge the basin based on water levels in monitoring wells and
"credits" of water held in reservoir storage. In addition, small amounts
of recharge can occur when water is released from Lake Cachuma to
the riverbed as required by the Endangered Species Act to support
certain listed species. Thus, the Cachuma Project at certain times
influences basin water levels. The Basin is not subject to overdraft
(i.e. a progressive long-term drop in water levels) because the
average annual flow to the Santa Ynez River (the main recharge
source) is greater than the volume of the basin.
On September 16, 2014, the Governor signed into law a three-bill
legislative package, composed of AB 1739 (Dickinson), SB 1168
(Pavley), and SB 1319 (Pavley), collectively known as the
Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA). The SGMA
provides a framework for sustainable management of groundwater
supplies by local authorities, with a limited role for state intervention
only if necessary to protect the resource. The act requires the
formation of local groundwater sustainability agencies (GSAs) that
must assess conditions in their local water basins and adopt locally-
based management plans. The act provides substantial time – 20
years – for GSAs to implement plans and achieve long-term
groundwater sustainability. The SGMA protects existing surface
water and groundwater rights and does not impact current drought
response measures.
Water Quality
Water quality is determined by factors such as the native condition of
groundwater and surface water and sources of contamination
(natural and human induced). Surface and groundwater quality in the
Santa Ynez Valley is variable but generally of high enough quality for
reasonable use; water quality in the Santa Ynez River Groundwater
Basin is generally good although the federal standard for Total
Dissolved Solids (TDS) 2 is periodically exceeded. The City derives a
portion of its water supply (discussed below) from the State Water
Project (SWP) which has the highest quality water in the county.
Although stormwater runoff is part of the natural hydrologic cycle,
human activities can alter natural drainage patterns, introduce
pollutants, and increase erosion, thereby degrading natural habitats.
Uncontrolled runoff can also cause flooding. The Federal Clean
Water Act requires municipal agencies to obtain National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits to manage
2 The federal drinking water standard for total dissolved solids is 500 mg/L.
                                                                         Solvang General Plan 6

                                              Conservation/Open Space Element
stormwater runoff. In July 2013, the Central Coast Water Board
adopted Order R3-2013-0032, with new, more stringent Post-
Construction Requirements (PCRs). Projects that create or replace
2,500 square feet or more of impervious area are subject to the
PCRs.
The PCRs mandate that development projects use Low Impact
Development (LID) to detain, retain, and treat runoff. LID
incorporates and conserves on-site natural features, together with
constructed hydrologic controls to more closely mimic pre-
development hydrology and watershed processes. In accordance
with the requirements of the Water Board, the City requires new
development to incorporate appropriate Best Management Practices
(BMPs) and LID to control the volume, rate, and potential pollutant
load of stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment
projects as may be appropriate to minimize the generation, transport
and discharge of pollutants.
2.2 CURRENT WATER SUPPLY AND FUTURE
       DEMAND
Solvang derives its water supply from a variety of sources that
include groundwater, Santa Ynez River underflow, an interconnect
with the Santa Ynez River Water Conservation District (ID-1), and the
State Water Project. Each of these sources is described in detail in
the Background Report. Table 1 provides a summary of the City’s
annual water production in 2015 and the anticipated long-term
production to supply build-out of the City’s General Plan Area.

                                           Conservation/Open Space Element
The City’s future demand for water is estimated by adding current
water demand to the water demand associated with the remaining
development capacity of the City’s general plan (buildout). According
to the Solvang General Plan, the number of existing dwelling units at
the time of General Plan adoption was approximately 2,452 units.
These existing dwelling units plus the approximately 497 additional
units at buildout total 2,949 units. The number of existing dwelling
units in the City as of January 2011 was approximately 2,485 units.
The difference between the buildout total of 2,949 units and the 2011
existing units of 2,485 was 464 future units. Based on the California
Department of Finance housing estimates for January 1, 2010 (Table
E-5), the estimated persons per household (unit) was 2.353. Using
these numbers for planning purposes, and an average water demand
of approximated at 236 gallons per capita per day, an estimated
additional 289 AFY will be required at buildout. The historic long term
average demand for Solvang is 1,691 AFY. Therefore, the projected
future water demand at buildout is 1,980 AFY. Table 2 presents
current and historic long-term average production (demand), as well
as projected annual demand at buildout.

2.3 OPTIONS FOR MEETING FUTURE DEMAND
The City will pursue a range of options for meeting future demand
that includes water conservation and the development of additional
supplies.
Water Conservation
                                                           Solvang General Plan 8

                                       Conservation/Open Space Element
For several years now the City of Solvang has actively promoted
water conservation. The City’s water conservation efforts include the
following:
     •  Water Conservation Program. Title 9, Chapter 3, Article D of
        the Solvang Municipal Code sets forth the City’s regulations
        for the conservation of water resources. The program
        includes standards for water use during a drought as well as
        penalties for water waste. In addition to conservation, use of
        reclaimed water from on-site grey water systems, can reduce
        the need to use fresh water for landscaping and other non-
        potable uses.
     •  Water Management Program. The Water Division of the
        Public Works Department has initiated a Water Management
        Program. The aim of the program is to make people and
        businesses aware of their water use and to suggest ways to
        monitor and reduce the amount of water that’s being wasted.
        Periodically tips are being offered in the Santa Ynez Valley
        News.
     •  Toilet Rebate Program. The Public Works Department (Water
        Division) periodically implements a Toilet Rebate Program.
        As part of the City of Solvang, Water Conservation Project,
        City water customers may be eligible to receive a 60% rebate,
        up to $120 through the City’s Ultra Low Flow Toilet (ULFT)
        Rebate Program.
     •  Landscape Rebate Program. The Public Works Department
        (Water Division) is implementing a 2-year program to provide
        rebates to customers who replace grass with low water use
        landscaping. Rebates up to $1,000 are offered.
     •  Water Meter Change-Out Program. The City is currently
        involved in a 'meter change-out' program. Staff is replacing
        older meters with new ones as part of a regular maintenance
        program. The new meters are easier to read and enable staff
        to accurately investigate possible water leaks in the service
        lines.
Water conservation BMPs currently being implemented include:
     •  Metering of all water deliveries;
     •  Promotion of native and drought tolerant landscaping;
     •  An ongoing public information campaign through utility bill
        inserts, newspaper ads, City vehicle advertisements and
        mailers to businesses and homeowners, and conservation
        pricing (high water rates).
These measures have been very successful; average per capita
water use has dropped in recent years. Although not subject to the
requirements of AB797 and SB7 relating to Urban Water
Management Planning, the City intends to continue to promote water
conservation and make efforts to achieve an additional 20%

conservation by the year 2020 on top of the reductions achieved
through the measures outlined above. In addition to continuing
current BMPs, the City intends to promote and implement school
education, and adopted enhanced conservation pricing (tiered rate
structure) in November of 2011. The City also works collaboratively
with other agencies to provide water management and conservation
information.
Options for Additional Water Supply
The City’s Water Supply Master Plan (2011) identifies the following
options for meeting future water demand through buildout of the
City’s general plan.
        Priority 1 - Santa Ynez River Wells. This water source
        appears to be more reliable during droughts than the State
        Water Project. Reliance on this water source also commits
        the City to water treatment and the installation of a filtration
        plant.
        In order to expand the use of this source of water for any use
        in the future, the City must add new wells and demonstrate an
        increased reliance on this water source for beneficial use.
        Failure to do so will risk limiting the SWRCB permit for
        expanded future use. The present permit allows the City to
        withdraw and use as much as 5 cfs (approximately 3.22 mgd).
        The City presently has capacity to withdraw only 450 gpm
        (340+110) which is equivalent to approximately 1.00 cfs or
        0.65 mgd. Several additional wells must be installed to allow
        full beneficial use of this source. Installation and use of
        additional wells is necessary to avoid reduction of the supply.
        Priority 2 - State Water Project Supply. The City has
        committed to the capital costs of providing this water source
        to City customers. The Solvang turnout (metered connection)
        to the State Water Pipeline went into service in 2002. The
        overall water quality of this source is good. Although drought
        reliability of this source is less than for the Santa Ynez River
        Wells, the predominance of urban users of this water
        throughout the State indicate a high political ability to maintain
        the supply at some reduced level even during sequential dry
        years. In addition, the pipeline capacity that Solvang owns in
        the State Water system can be used to deliver supplemental
        water that Solvang purchases from other cities and water
        districts in central and northern California.
        Priority 3 – Solvang Upland Wells. The water produced from
        Well 4 is relatively high in dissolved minerals, but in
        compliance with California Department of Public Health (DPH)
        regulations. Water from Well 4 can be provided without further
        treatment. Although the well continues to produce reliably, it
                                                        Solvang General Plan 10

                                       Conservation/Open Space Element
       is relatively old. Currently the delivery cost of water from the
       City’s Upland Wells is similar to the Santa Ynez River Wells.
       However, if treatment is implemented for the River Wells the
       delivery cost of water from the river wells will be significantly
       greater than that of the Upland Wells. As a result of historic
       drought conditions the City implemented an emergency
       Upland Wells project. Five (5) new upland wells were drilled
       in 2014 and 2015. The City intends to put one or two new
       wells into service immediately.
       Priority 4 - Improvement District No. 1 Interconnects. Due to
       the high cost of this source, the two ID-1 connections are now
       used as a last resort, when other supplies are inadequate to
       maintain the volume of supply needed. This philosophy will
       likely be continued unless a reduced wholesale water rate can
       be negotiated with ID-1. The water available from this source
       is of similar quality and reliability as the City’s own Santa
       Ynez River Wells. Even with treatment, water from the City’s
       wells will cost substantially less than water from ID#1 based
       on their current rates.
This evaluation of supply and demand suggests that the City has a
dependable supply of water adequate for buildout of the City’s
general plan. The City’s primary sources of water supply will continue
to be provided by wells along the Santa Ynez River and the State
Water Project. The availability of alternate sources, such as the
SYRWCD-ID No.1 connections and current/new Upland Wells,
provides assurance that the City will continue to serve its customers
with safe and adequate water during highly unusual climate events
such as prolonged drought.

Goals, Policies and Action Items
Goal 2.1
TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE THE QUALITY OF WATER FROM
LOCAL WATERSHEDS, GROUNDWATER BASINS, AND
SURFACE WATER BODIES INCLUDING CREEKS AND THE
SANTA YNEZ RIVER.
Policy 2.1
The City shall promote the protection of surface and groundwater
water resources within the local watershed and the Santa Ynez
River.
     Action Item (A)
     Continue to work with local, state, and federal agencies and
     other watershed organizations to manage groundwater
     resources and improve water quality in accordance with the
     Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) and the
     Department of Water Resources Sustainable Groundwater
     Program (SGP).
     Action Item (B)
     Require new development to protect the quality of water bodies
     and drainage systems through adaptive site design, stormwater
     management, and the implementation of best management
     practices (BMPs). Apply the following principles of Low Impact
     Development in the review of development projects for
     purposes of minimizing runoff and potential water quality
     impacts:
     a. Make Sensitive Choices in Site Layout. Identify the most
         sensitive natural areas and, where possible, leave them
         undeveloped. To the extent possible, set back development
         from creeks, wetlands, and riparian habitats. Preserve
         significant trees. Conform the site along natural land forms,
         avoid excessive grading and disturbance of vegetation and
         soils, and mimic the site’s natural drainage patterns. Where
         possible, concentrate development on portions of the site
         with less permeable soils, and preserve areas that can
         promote infiltration. To the extent possible, limit overall
         coverage of paving and roofs by designing compact
         structures, narrower and shorter streets and sidewalks,
         smaller parking lots, and indoor or underground parking.
         Where possible, detain and retain runoff throughout the site.
         Use drainage design elements such as depressed
         landscape areas, vegetated buffers, and bioretention
         facilities (consisting of a shallow surface reservoir, a layer of
         imported planting medium, and a gravel underlayer with
                                                      Solvang General Plan 12

                                      Conservation/Open Space Element
        perforated pipe underdrains) as amenities and focal points
        within the site and landscape design.
   b. Use Pervious Surfaces. In new buildings and major retrofits,
        evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of green
        roofs. Identify where permeable pavements, such as
        crushed aggregate, turf block, unit pavers, pervious
        concrete, or pervious asphalt could be substituted for
        impervious concrete or asphalt paving.
   Disperse Runoff to Adjacent Pervious Areas. Where possible,
   direct roof downspouts across pervious areas. A maximum 2:1
   ratio between impervious and pervious surfaces is
   recommended. Receiving pervious areas should be relatively
   flat, and soils should be amended as needed to promote
   infiltration. Similarly, parking areas should be designed so that
   runoff can sheet flow to landscaped areas. Where feasible, use
   curb cuts or no curbs to allow runoff to flow to vegetated areas.
c. Direct runoff to bioretention facilities, flow-through planters, dry
   wells, or cisterns. On densely developed sites, and where runoff
   from impervious roofs and paved areas cannot be dispersed to
   landscaping, consider directing runoff to facilities designed to
   detain and treat runoff before letting it seep away slowly.
   Action Item (C)
   Work toward the elimination of existing septic tanks within the
   City’s Plan Area and as properties are annexed.
   Action Item (D)
   Continue to use the California Environmental Quality Act
   (CEQA) process to identify and avoid (or mitigate) potential
   groundwater pollution problems resulting from new urban
   development.
   Action Item (E)
   Regularly monitor water quality in City wells for evidence of
   toxics, saltwater intrusion, and other contaminants.
   Action Item (F)
   Implement watershed awareness and water quality educational
   programs for City staff, community groups, potential
   developers, and the public.
   Action Item (G)
   Continue to implement the City’s water conservation regulations
   and programs.
   Action Item (H)
   Protect important groundwater recharge areas as open space.
   Prohibit land uses that may adversely impact groundwater from
   locating on or near groundwater recharge areas. Where
   applicable incorporate groundwater recharge into the design of
   new development.

3.0 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
3.1 WILDLIFE HABITATS IN THE SOLVANG AREA
Land within and surrounding the City’s Plan Area supports a rich
assortment of habitats for plants and wildlife which contribute to the
quality of life In Solvang. Wildlife habitats provide food, shelter,
movement corridors, and breeding opportunities for wildlife species.
Species that are limited to a single habitat type are more vulnerable
to habitat loss and disturbance than are generalists and, therefore,
may be more at risk to experience population declines. Figure 3
shows the various types of habitats found within the City’s Plan Area.
The acreage of each habitat type is summarized on Table 3.

3.2 SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES
Special-status species are plants and animals that are legally-
protected under the Federal and State Endangered Species Acts, or
other regulations, and species that are considered sufficiently rare by
the scientific community to qualify for such listing. A number of
special-status species have the potential to occur in the City’s Plan
Area and in the vicinity. A complete listing of listed species with the
potential to occur in the Solvang area is provided in Section 2.5 of
the Background Report. These species include the California red-
legged frog (Rana draytonii), foothill yellow legged frog (Rana boylii),
least Bell’s vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus), Southwest willow flycatcher
(Empidonax traillii extimus), Southern steelhead (Oncorhynchus
mykiss irideus), and the black-flowered figwort (Scrophularia atrata).
The analysis of potentially-occurring species is intended as a general
overview. The presence of sensitive species should be determined
by qualified biologists on a site-specific basis.

4.0 CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL
          RESOURCES
The Solvang area has a rich cultural history beginning with the first
human occupants and continuing to the 20th century.
4.1 PRE-HISTORY AND HISTORY
The Chumash
Based on mortuary practices and the development of artifacts used in
social activities, archaeologists estimate that Chumash society
developed within its historic boundaries for over 7,500 years. This
long period of development of the Chumash society was possible
because the Santa Barbara Channel area contained a higher
concentration of resources than adjacent areas, and the society
occupying this area was more powerful than the surrounding
societies. In addition, compared to the majority of societies which
acquired their territories more recently, the length of time during
which the indigenous Santa Barbara Channel society developed was
relatively long. By the time the first Europeans made contact with the
Chumash, the society was uniquely adapted to its environments and
well organized as a result of its evolution over this long period of
time.
At the time of historic contact, the Alisos Canyon area was occupied
by the Ynezeño branch of the Chumash, who were a Hokan speaking
people. Chumash people occupied an area that extended south
along the California coast from San Luis Obispo County into Los
Angeles County, and east to the fringes of the San Joaquin Valley,
and included the Channel Islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa
Cruz and Anacapa. The Ynezeño Chumash were subdivided from
their culturally similar neighbors to the north and south, the Obispeño
and Barbareño Chumash, on the basis of linguistic dialects (noted by
the early Spanish missionaries of the area) rather than on any
apparent difference in social or economic organization. The Ynezeño
(so named because of their association with Mission Santa Ynez)
spoke one of four Chumashan dialects considered as forming a core
group of more closely related forms. Chumash society developed
over the course of some 9,000 years and has been described as
having achieved a level of social, political, and economic complexity
                                                      Solvang General Plan 22

                                        Conservation/Open Space Element
not ordinarily associated with hunting and gathering groups.
Traditionally, the Chumash were noted by the Spanish for their large
domed houses, wood and stone craftsmanship, basketry, and
foremost for the plank canoe (tomol). Ethnographic information on
Chumash culture is most extensive for the coastal populations, and
the culture and society have been well documented for groups such
as the Barbareño and Ventureño Chumash. Much of what is known
of the Ynezeño has been provided by the journals of early Spanish
expeditions and by accounts of Chumash informants.
Historical Overview
The introduction of the Spanish mission system into Ynezeño territory
brought about dramatic changes in the aboriginal way of life.
Between the time of the establishment of the Mission Santa Ynez
and that of Mexican independence, and the secularization of mission
lands (1834), ancient lifeways gradually began to disappear. Villages
were abandoned, hunting and gathering activities were disrupted as
newly introduced agricultural practices altered the landscape, and
large portions of the native population had been assimilated into the
missions, died of introduced disease, or fled to other areas. This
cultural decimation continued and perhaps was amplified during the
post mission or Mexican period, until their near cultural extinction in
the later Anglo (American) period.
In 1846, United States forces occupied California, and in 1848, the
U.S. formally gained control with the signing of the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo. By 1850, the population, accelerated by the Gold
Rush, had increased enough to justify admission to the Union.
Following the brief mining frenzy, the economic focus began to shift
from cattle ranching to farming, and between 1860 and 1900, farming
became the major industry of the area. Completion of the Southern
Pacific Railroad line through the area in the 1880s accelerated
growth by making access easier for immigrants. Potentially important
sites from the American Period could include locations or structures
from the early farming era (1850–1940s) and other structures from
the early twentieth century associated with significant events,
persons, or early industry.
To a great extent, the Danish American period in Solvang was an
expression of events and family traditions which began in Denmark.
Danish migration to the United States prior to 1870 was a highly
individualistic affair, and the motivating forces were largely religious
and political persecution in the homeland. Danish migration was
mostly to Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa; however, at the Danish
Lutheran Church Convention it was announced that a new Danish
colony would be established on the west coast. On January 23, 1911,
final papers were signed to purchase 9,000 acres in the Santa Ynez
Valley, and included land from what is now Alisal Road on the east to
Santa Rosa Ranchero on the west.

Greatly influencing present day Solvang's street and parcel layout
was the first division of land for the town in 1911. Up until the end of
World War II, Solvang looked like any other rural town. At the end of
World War II, the Saturday Evening Post ran an article on Solvang
prompting the curious to visit. Ferd Sorensen, known as the "father"
of Solvang's Danish architecture, constructed the first Danish style
buildings on Copenhagen Drive (then Main St.), and transformed the
California Mission style archways of Rasmussen's into a Danish
colonade. In 1945, he built an authentic Danish provincial home and
windmill on Old Mill Road. Solvang's present downtown consists of
row-type structures with Danish facades. Around the town, numerous
subdivisions and other structures have emerged since World War II
to provide housing and services to Solvang's local residents.
4.2 ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORIC
       RESOURCES IN AND AROUND SOLVANG
Archaeological Resources
The area in and around Solvang has a rich history of native and non-
native settlement. Due to the extent of Native American settlement,
archaeological resources are found over a wide area, particularly in
those locations where permanent water supplies were available.
These resources range from limited activity sites such as resource
extraction camps, rock shelters with dwellings, burial grounds, and
ceremonial structures. Previous archaeological surveys conducted in
the area, and in particular in the vicinity of Mission San Ines, along
Alamo Pintado Creek, Alisal Creek and the Santa Ynez River have
revealed significant pre-historic resources. Other important finds
include portions of the Mission aqueduct system and the “Mission
corral”.
Based on the pattern and extent of pre-historic and historic
settlement patterns, development within the City’s Plan Area could
reveal previously undiscovered archaeological and/or historic
resources. The areas with the highest likelihood to contain such
resources are considered “areas of high sensitivity” and are generally
associated with the banks and terraces overlooking the Santa Ynez
River, Alisal Creek, Alamo Pintado Creek and Adobe Canyon Creek
(Figure 4).

                                       Conservation/Open Space Element
Historic Resources
There are more than a dozen buildings and landmarks in and around
Solvang that reflect various periods of Solvang’s rich heritage as the
site of an early California Mission, late nineteenth century American
settlement and early twentieth century Danish settlement.
Some historic structures in Solvang such as Mission Santa Ines, are
of statewide significance, while other resources, such as the large
concrete "milk bottle " remaining from the Burchardi Dairy and the
Easter cross on Alisal Heights, have more local significance. Figure 5
shows seventeen important historic buildings still remaining in the
Solvang area.
Paleontological Resources
A search of the collections curated by the University of California
Museum of Paleontology indicated that there are no known resources
of paleontological significance in the City’s Plan Area or in the
vicinity.

Goals, Policies and Action Items
Goal 4.1
TO PROTECT THE CULTURE AND HERITAGE OF NATIVE
PEOPLES.
Policy 4.1
The City shall provide for the protection of both known and potential
archaeological resources. To avoid significant damage to important
archaeological sites, all available measures shall be explored at the
time of a development proposal. Where such measures are not
feasible and development would adversely affect identified
archaeological or paleontological resources, mitigation shall be
required in accordance with the relevant provisions of federal and
State laws.
      Action Item (A)
      Continue to refer development proposals that may adversely
      affect archaeological sites to the Central Coast Information
      Center at the University of California Santa Barbara for review
      and comment.
      Action Item (B)
      Continue to comply with the requirements Government Code
      Sections 65352.3 and 65352.4 which require the City to consult
      with Native American tribes with respect to the possible
      preservation of, or the mitigation of impacts to, specified Native
      American places, features, and objects.
      Action Item (C)
      Do not approve any public or private project that may adversely
      affect an archaeological site without first consulting with
      applicable State and local agencies and organizations,
      conducting a site evaluation as may be indicated, and mitigating
      any adverse impacts according to the recommendations of a
      qualified archaeologist. City implementation of this action item
      shall be guided by Appendix K of the State CEQA Guidelines.
      Action Item (D)
      Ensure the protection of archaeological sites that may be
      culturally significant to Native peoples, even if they have lost
      their scientific or archaeological integrity through previous
      disturbance; sites that may have religious value, even though
      no artifacts are present; and sites that contain artifacts which
      may have intrinsic value, even though their archaeological
      context has been disturbed.
      Action Item (E)
      Prior to approval of development within an archaeologically
      sensitive area, require a preliminary site survey by a qualified
                                                     Solvang General Plan 28
                                  Conservation/Open Space Element
archaeologist knowledgeable in Native American cultures, prior
to a determination of the potential environmental impacts of the
project. Where a preliminary site survey finds substantial
archaeological resources, before permitting construction, the
City shall require a mitigation plan to protect the resources.
Possible mitigation measures include:
      o   Requiring the presence of a qualified professional
          during initial grading or trenching; project redesign;
      o   Covering with a layer of fill; excavation, removal and
          curation in an appropriate facility under the direction of
          a qualified professional.
Where substantial archaeological resources are discovered
during construction or grading activities, all such activities in the
immediate area of the find shall cease until a qualified
archaeologist knowledgeable in Native American cultures can
determine the significance of the resource and recommend
alternative mitigation measures.
Action Item (F)
Establish and maintain archaeological site records about known
sites. Specific archaeological site information shall be kept
confidential to protect the resources. The City shall maintain, for
public use, generalized maps showing known areas of
archaeological sensitivity.
Action Item (G)
Impose the following conditions on all discretionary projects
which may cause ground disturbance:
   “The Planning Department shall be notified immediately
   if any prehistoric, archaeological, or fossil artifact or
   resource is uncovered during construction. All
   construction must stop and an archaeologist that meets
   the Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualifications
   Standards in prehistoric or historical archaeology shall
   be retained to evaluate the finds and recommend
   appropriate action.”
   “All construction must stop if any human remains are
   uncovered, and the County Coroner must be notified
   according to Section 7050.5 of California’s Health and
   Safety Code. If the remains are determined to be Native
   American, the procedures outlined in CEQA Section
   15064.5 (d) and (e) shall be followed.”

Goal 4.2
TO PRESERVE AND ENHANCE SOLVANG’S HISTORICAL
HERITAGE.
Policy 4.2
The City shall set as a high priority the protection and enhancement
of Solvang’s historically and architecturally significant sites and
buildings.
      Action Item (A)
      Work with property owners in seeking registration of historical
      structures and sites as State Historic Landmarks or listing on
      the National Register of Historic Sites.
      Action Item (B)
      Support the efforts of property owners to preserve and renovate
      historic and architecturally significant structures. Where such
      buildings cannot be preserved intact, the City shall seek to
      preserve the building facades.
      Action Item (C)
      Consider demolition of historic resources as a last resort, to be
      permitted only if the following findings are made: rehabilitation
      and/or relocation are not feasible; the demolition of the resource
      is necessary to protect the health and safety of the public; or
      the public benefits of demolition outweigh the cost of preserving
      the resource. In all instances, the City shall gather and report
      input from the public prior to preparing a recommendation (for
      or against demolition) to decision-makers.
      Action Item (D)
      Continue to implement the City’s Community Design Element
      through the development review process.

5.0 AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE
          CHANGE
Protecting air quality is essential for human health and to sustain the
productivity of plants that provide food and fiber. Clean air supports
the rich mosaic of vegetation that forms the City’s natural setting and
contributes to a healthy lifestyle for Solvang residents.
A related issue to air quality is the effect of certain human-induced
atmospheric gases on the local, regional and global climate.
Compelling evidence suggests that the emission of these so-called
“greenhouse gases” is adversely affecting the climate. Although
climate change is a global phenomenon, the City can help take steps
to reduce the generation of greenhouse gases.
5.1 AIR QUALITY IN THE SOLVANG AREA
Air Pollution Control In Santa Barbara County
The Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (SBC APCD)
shares responsibility with the California Air Resources Board (CARB)
for ensuring that all State and Federal ambient air quality standards
are attained within the county.
Air Pollutants and Air Quality Standards
Air pollution is hazardous to human health, diminishes the production
and quality of many agricultural crops, reduces visibility, degrades
soils materials, and damages native vegetation. State and national
ambient air quality standards were created to protect the public
health and welfare, and to minimize the other effects mentioned
above. The standards address pollutants in the ambient air—the air
that people breathe outside of buildings, as they go about their daily
activities.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and California
Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) are standards that define
the upper limits for ambient airborne concentrations of pollutants. The
standards are designed to protect all aspects of the public health and
welfare, with a reasonable margin of safety. The NAAQS and
CAAQS are established for “criteria pollutants”. Table 4 provides a
summary of State and Federal Ambient Air Quality Standards. On

   October 1, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   announced a new eight-hour standard of 70 ppb for ground-level
   ozone, one of the principal components of smog. Based on current
   data, the county is in attainment of the new federal standard; the EPA
   has indicated it will make attainment/non-attainment designations for
   the new standard in October 2017 and that these designations will
   likely be based on 2014-2016 air quality data.

Attainment Status of Santa Barbara County
According to the 2013 Clean Air Plan (CAP), air quality in the county,
measured by the number of days exceeding the State 1-hour and 8-
hour ozone standards, has improved steadily since the first clean air
plan was adopted in 1988. As a result, Santa Barbara County is in
attainment of all applicable federal air quality standards and has
attained the State 1-hour ozone standard. However, the county
violates the state 8-hour ozone standard as well as the annual
arithmetic mean and 24-hour state standards for PM10. Accordingly,
the emission reduction strategies of the 2013 CAP are aimed at
reducing the generation of particulates and ozone precursors. The
main sources of ozone precursors are marine shipping, on-road
motor vehicles and other mobile sources, followed by stationary
sources such as oil and gas production, coatings and solvents and
area-wide sources which include consumer products, pesticides and
farming waste.
Current Ambient Air Quality
The SBC APCD is required to monitor air pollutant levels to assure
that the air quality standards are met, and if they are not met, to also
develop strategies to meet the standards. According to data collected
by the SBC APCD, the 8-hour ozone levels and PM10 levels have
exceeded the State standard each year from 2011 to 2013.
5.2 CLIMATE CHANGE/GREENHOUSE GAS
       EMISSIONS
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The earth’s natural warming process is known as the “greenhouse
effect.” Certain atmospheric gases act as an insulating blanket that
trap solar energy to keep the global average temperature in a
suitable range. These gases are called GHGs because they trap heat
like the glass walls of a greenhouse. The greenhouse effect raises
the temperature of the earth’s surface by about sixty degrees
Fahrenheit.
California's major initiatives for reducing climate change or GHG
emissions are outlined in Assembly Bill 32 (signed into law 2006),
and Senate Bill 375 (signed into law 2008). These efforts aim at
reducing GHG emissions for the State to 1990 levels by 2020—a
reduction of approximately 30 percent, and then an 80 percent
reduction below 1990 levels by 2050. Local governments such as the
City of Solvang will play a role in achieving the emission reduction
goals mandated by AB 32 and SB 375. The ability to influence land
use decisions, provide services to the population (e.g., recycling
service, waste management, and waste water treatment), and
                                                     Solvang General Plan 33

                                        Conservation/Open Space Element
provide public education and incentives (e.g., energy conservation,
agricultural practices) to citizens are options for local governments to
reduce GHG emissions generated within their jurisdictions.
Santa Barbara County Energy and Climate Action Plan (ECAP)
In 2009, the County Board of Supervisors adopted the County
Climate Change Guiding Principles and directed staff to “take
immediate, cost effective and coordinated steps to reduce the County
of Santa Barbara’s collective greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.” The
Energy and Climate Action Plan is the second phase of the county’s
Climate Action Strategy which seeks to reduce GHG in the
unincorporated county. The ECAP includes a baseline GHG
emissions inventory, a forecast of emissions to both 2020 and 2035,
a GHG reduction target of 15% below baseline emissions by 2020, a
set of emission reduction measures (ERMs, Measures) to meet the
target, and a methodology for tracking and reporting emissions in the
future. Environmental Review Guidelines for the SB APCD (revised
April 30, 2015) indicate “a proposed stationary source project will not
have significant GHG impact, if operation of the project will emit less
than the screening significance level of 10,000 metric tons per year
(MT/yr) CO2e.”
ECAP implementation will assist the state in meeting its statewide
GHG reduction established by AB 32, as well as the statewide
energy reduction goals in California’s Long-Term Energy Efficiency
Strategic Plan. The ECAP and proposed changes to the County
Comprehensive Plan’s Energy Element would commit the County to
meeting a 15% reduction target including implementation of the
County’s Sustainable Communities Strategy.
Santa Barbara County Regional Transportation Plan and
Sustainable Communities Strategy
SBCAG is required by federal and State law to prepare and update a
regional transportation plan (RTP) every four years. The RTP is a
long-range transportation plan that must plan ahead for a minimum of
twenty years. SBCAG now has the responsibility to prepare a
Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) as part of the RTP,
pursuant to the requirements of California Senate Bill 375 as adopted
in 2008. The SCS sets forth a forecasted development pattern for the
region, which, when integrated with the transportation network and
other transportation measures and policies, is intended to reduce

6.0 SUSTAINABILITY AND
          ENERGY USE
6.1 EFFORTS TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY IN
      SOLVANG
The City of Solvang has incorporated elements of sustainability in a
number of its codes, ordinances and practices and encourages the
use of sustainable practices citywide.
Reducing Motor Vehicle Trips/Transportation Options
Solvang is small in area and conducive to the use of alternate forms
of transportation, including walking and bicycling. In addition, transit
service is available to City residents and visitors through Santa Ynez
Transit which is a joint-powers agency funded by the Cities of
Buellton and Solvang in conjunction with Santa Barbara County.
Green Buildings/Green Building Code
Green buildings are sited, designed, constructed, and operated to
enhance the wellbeing of their occupants and to minimize negative
impacts on the community and the natural environment. The most
widely used benchmark for sustainable building in the commercial
and institutional sectors is the Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, established by the US
Green Building Council. For residential construction, the commonly-
accepted standard is the Green Point Rated system developed by
Build it Green. Green buildings typically minimize energy and water
usage, utilize recyclable materials, limit use of non-renewable
resources, and minimize use of toxic materials in construction and
operation.
The City adopted the statewide green building code (“CalGreen”),
and also adopted “Tier 1” standards for residential development that
goes above and beyond the baseline requirements.
Green Business Program of Santa Barbara County
The City participates in the Santa Barbara County Green Business
program. The GBP offers incentives and assistance to encourage
businesses to implement voluntary actions to protect, preserve, and
improve the environment beyond what current laws require.
                                                      Solvang General Plan 41

                                        Conservation/Open Space Element
Businesses meeting these criteria can be certified as green
businesses. The Green Business Program:
     •  Provides guidebooks, resources, and assistance to
        businesses wanting to be green
     •  Certifies businesses through on-site visits and evaluation, and
     •  Highlights certified businesses so that local consumers can
        shop green.
Solid Waste Reduction and Recycling
Waste reduction and recycling reduce consumption and disposal,
thereby conserving natural resources and landfill capacity and
avoiding production of greenhouse gases in the landfill. The City has
adopted regulations to encourage recycling and prohibit the disposal
of recyclable materials under Title 5, Chapter 2, Article 5-2-5 of the
Solvang Municipal Code. Some of the main elements of these
regulations include:
     •  It is unlawful for commercial businesses to dispose of
        cardboard in a trash receptacle;
     •  It is unlawful to dispose of “green waste” in a garbage or trash
        can.
     •  It is unlawful for a refuse collection franchise operating in the
        City to dispose of recyclable trash.
To date (October, 2014) there are three certified Green Businesses
in Solvang.
Urban Forest
A healthy urban forest contributes to a sustainable city. Trees
consume carbon dioxide and absorb air and water pollutants. They
also provide shade (which reduces energy consumption), absorb
runoff, reduce soil erosion, provide habitat for plants and animals,
and make walking more pleasant. The City has hundreds of trees in
the right-of-way, street medians and parks. Trees make an important
contribution to the aesthetics of the city and the character of
Solvang’s neighborhoods, as well as the natural environment.
Other Programs
The City has also implemented programs and regulations to protect
water quality from the harmful effects of runoff from urban areas
(discussed in Section 2. Water Resources, goal 2.1 and policy 2.1).
and a robust program of water conservation (discussed in Section
2.).

6.2 ENERGY USE
Despite historically high gas prices, concerns over energy security,
air quality, and climate change, energy demand continues to increase
in California. Energy conservation and use of renewable energy
sources are tangible steps many cities including Solvang have taken
to reduce fossil fuel consumption, improve air quality, and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
Electric service in Solvang is provided by Pacific Gas & Electric
Company (PG&E) which is a leader in its use of renewable, non-
polluting energy sources. Therefore, the energy used by the City and
its residents is on average much less polluting than an equivalent
amount of energy used by a city and its residents in other regions of
the country, where a greater percentage of power comes from the
combustion of hydrocarbons (coal, natural gas, etc.).
The overall trend in energy consumption is reflected in electricity
demand countywide as reported by the California Energy
Commission. Table 5 provides an estimate of energy consumption in
Solvang by applying the countywide per capita consumption to the
City’s historic population. The actual demand in Solvang reflects a
larger proportion associated with the non-residential sector because
of the greater proportion of visitor-serving businesses and the role of
tourism in the local economy. Nonetheless, the data in Table 5
provide an order of magnitude for energy consumption in Solvang
while illustrating the overall trend of energy use.

7.0 MINERAL RESOURCES
Mineral resources are those occurring in the Solvang area that have,
or are expected to have, economic value. These include sand and
gravel, limited oil and gas resources used for fuels and diatomaceous
earth which is used as filtering material and for insulation. The State
General Plan Guidelines encourage continued accessibility to native
minerals, while avoiding significant harm to the environment or
human health from their extraction.
7.1 SAND AND GRAVEL
Extracted sand and gravel resources are primary construction
materials used in nearly all forms of urban development, from road
construction to building construction. Thus, the use of sand and
gravel is directly related to urban growth rates. A major share of the
cost associated with sand and gravel usage involves transportation
costs, As a result, the more economically viable deposits of sand and
gravel are often located in areas where pressures for urban
development are greatest.
The California State Mining and Geology Board requires that mineral
land classification reports for regions containing construction
materials include "An estimate of the total quantity of each such
construction material that will be needed to supply the requirements
of both the county and the marketing region in which it occurs for the
next 50 years.” According to the 2011 Update Of Mineral Land
Classification: Concrete Aggregate In The San Luis Obispo-Santa
Barbara Production-Consumption Region, California, an estimated
263 million tons of aggregate will be needed to satisfy future demand
in the San Luis Obispo-Santa Barbara region through the year 2060.
In 1992 the California Geological Survey (CGS) conducted a study of
the Santa Ynez Valley area to identify areas with the potential for
economically viable mineral resources is highest. That study
concluded that one of the areas of greatest potential for sand and
gravel production is along the Santa Ynez River. Accordingly, two
sand and gravel operations, Buellflat Rock Company and the Mission
Ready-Mix Concrete company, are situated in the Santa Ynez River

7.2 OIL AND NATURAL GAS
There are no oil and gas fields identified within or near the city of
Solvang, The nearest oil extraction occurs at the Zaca Oil Field
located approximately eight miles to the north of the city. The field is
known to contain heavy crude oil. Oil is also extracted at the Barham
Ranch Oil Field located approximately eight and one-half miles to the
northwest of Solvang.
7.3 DIATOMACEOUS EARTH
Diatomite deposits are found in several locations within or near the
city. Also known as diatomaceous earth, such deposits consist of the
remains of microscopic plants of marine origin known as diatoms.
Diatomite deposits are loosely packed to form a light, highly porous,
and permeable rock. The primary uses of diatomite are filtering
media, insulation material, fine abrasives, and absorbents. Diatomite
deposits are located northwest of Solvang's city limits in the Chalk
Hill area, in Solvang's Alisal Heights and Mission Oaks
neighborhoods, and just east of the city in the vicinity of Highway 246
and Alamo Pintado Creek. According to the California Geological
Survey, these deposits are composed largely of impure, coarsely
stratified and massive diatomite, and are of little or no commercial
value. Thus, there are no diatomite mining activities currently
underway in the Solvang area.
Goals, Policies and Action Items
Goal 7.1
ACHIEVE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE RECLAMATION
OF PAST MINERAL-EXTRACTION SITES.
Policy 7.1
The City shall require the reclamation of past mineral extraction sites
within the City’s Plan Area and shall encourage other agencies in the
area to do the same.
         Action Item (A)
         Apply land use designations for old mineral-extraction sites
         that reflect the associated risks. These should generally be
         limited to “Open Space”, or “Agriculture” designations on the
         Land Use Element map.
         Action Item (B)
         Secure and reclaim previously active mineral extraction sites
         in conjunction with any development approvals for the land on
         which they are located. “Securing” means preventing access
         that entails unacceptable risk. “Reclamation” means re-
         establishing ground contours and vegetation to the extent

       feasible, use of erosion control measures to enhance and
       protect soil stability, water and air quality, wildlife habitat
       values and views.
Goal 7.2
ENSURE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE OPERATION AND
RECLAMATION OF ANY MINERAL EXTRACTION THAT MAY
OCCUR IN THE VICINITY OF SOLVANG.
Policy 7.2
On sites with mineral-extraction potential, the City will:
   A. Prohibit mineral extraction and surface entry for extraction of
       oil or gas within open space owned by the City in fee or as an
       easement.
   B. Encourage other agencies with jurisdiction to permit mineral
       extraction only if significant impacts to human health and the
       environment will be avoided and site restoration will be
       assured. Impacts to be addressed include air and water
       quality, noise, habitat disruption, aesthetics and geologic
       stability. All phases of the activity, including site access, must
       be addressed.

8.0 OPEN SPACE AND SCENIC
          RESOURCES
8.1 OPEN SPACE RESOURCES IN THE SOLVANG
       AREA
City of Solvang
Section 65560 of the California Government Code broadly defines
open space land as land designated for:
     •   The preservation of natural resources;
     •   The managed production of resources (e.g., lands for
         agriculture, pasture, recharge of groundwater basins);
     •   Outdoor recreation (e.g., parks, scenic highway corridors,
         areas with outstanding scenic, historic, and cultural values);
         or
     •   The protection of public health and safety (e.g., floodplains,
         unstable soil areas).
Open space can be further classified on the basis of its permanence.
Permanent open space includes land developed with parks, golf
courses, and school playgrounds. Such lands include Hans Christian
Andersen Park, Solvang Park and the Alisal Golf Course. Other types
of permanent open space in the Solvang area include the Santa
Ynez River and lands where the development rights have been
permanently extinguished by way of a conservation or open space
easement. Such conservation lands have been preserved in
Fredensborg Canyon, the north edge of the Alisal Green and
Meadow area and the canyon in the Nyborg area.
Interim open space areas are typically private properties that are
currently vacant or underutilized. In Solvang, the vacant land located
south of Mission Santa Ines between Alamo Pintado Creek and Alisal
Road is an example of interim open space since it is designated for
future residential development.
Table 6 and Figure 6 summarize the park and open space resources
within the City’s Plan Area.

Other Open Space Lands In the Region
The Santa Ynez Valley Community Plan governs the use of land in
the unincorporated County surrounding the City. The Community
Plan designates these lands for a variety of uses that include
residential development at urban densities within the community of
Santa Ynez to the east, and agriculture on parcel sizes ranging from
5 acres to over 320 acres (Figure 7). As shown on Figure 7, the
majority of the properties adjacent to the City’s Plan Area are
designated for agricultural use.
Parks and open space lands in the region include small community
parks in Santa Ynez as well as Lake Cachuma Regional Park located
about 10 miles east of the City.
Other open space and recreational land is provided by the Los
Padres National Forest which includes several thousand acres in the
mountains surrounding the Santa Ynez Valley.
The Land Trust for Santa Barbara County is a non-profit organization
that works to preserve land with natural, agricultural, scenic,
recreational and/or historical significance by acquiring properties (or
the development rights on properties) from willing sellers through
negotiated transactions. Since 1985, the Land Trust has protected
nearly 24,000 acres of land in the Santa Ynez Valley area.

8.2 SCENIC RESOURCES
Solvang is located in the western Santa Ynez Valley whose rich
agricultural croplands, rolling hills, open spaces, rural character,
scenic roadways, and natural features have attracted residents and
visitors for decades. Preserving scenic features, including both
natural and working landscapes, enhances the scenic values and
economic development potential of the area and adds to the quality
of life for existing and future residents. Scenic resources visible from
the City include views of agricultural farms, vineyards and rolling
hillsides in the foreground and more distant views of the Santa Ynez
Mountains to the south and the Purisima Hills and San Rafael Range
to the north.
Cropland and rangeland have high scenic value in the Santa Ynez
Valley. The growth of the wine industry and the proliferation of
vineyards has added a scenic quality to the area and has become an
important component of the regional economy. Many of the scenic
resources consist of views of agricultural areas, such as pastures,
orchards, vineyards, ranches, barns, and farms with cattle and
various livestock. Most roadways in the region offer some views of
rural agricultural landscapes. During late winter and early spring, the
rolling hillsides become a verdant green color and transition into the
prototypical California landscape of yellow and brown dried
grasses during summer and fall. The dense chaparral and oak
woodlands on the north facing slopes of the Santa Ynez Mountains
provide a rich green backdrop throughout the year.
The unique architectural character of the City is another important
scenic resource. The Mission Santa Ines provides a visual landmark
and is a cultural and historic resource of statewide importance. Views
of the Mission and views from the Mission contribute to the visual
character of the City and the Santa Ynez Valley.
Scenic Highways
Many of the highway corridors in the Solvang area contain elements
that can make a highway “scenic,” such as the natural landscapes
that can be seen by traveling along the highway, the quality of the
landscape, and the extent to which development intrudes upon a
traveler’s enjoyment of the view. Several of these highway corridors
lead residents and visitors to the area’s recreational amenities
including Lake Cachuma and Figueroa Mountain, and many ranches
and wineries.
State Highway 154 is a State Scenic Highway as designated by the
State of California (Figure 8). State Highway 101, which passes
through Buellton about 5 miles west of Solvang, is considered eligible
for State designation. Santa Barbara County has adopted a Scenic
Highways Element of the general plan that designates rural and

9.0 Glossary
Acre-foot (AF). The volume of water required to cover one acre of
land (43,560 square feet) to a depth of one foot. One acre-foot is
equal to 325,851 gallons or 1,233 cubic meters. Historically, an acre-
foot represents the amount of water typically used by one family
during a year.
Aquifer. A geological formation or structure that stores and/or
transmits water, such as wells and springs. Use of the term is usually
restricted to those water-bearing formations capable of yielding water
in sufficient quantity to constitute a usable supply for people.
Alluvial/Alluvium. Erosion caused by wind or rain introduces soils,
materials, and rock fragments into streams and rivers. These
materials are reduced by the action of water movement and mixed
with debris as they are washed down the mountains and hills. They
are deposited as sediment that spreads out in a fan shape when the
watercourse reaches a relatively level area. Such deposits are called
alluvial materials or alluvium. The fan-shaped zone of deposited
sediment is called an alluvial fan.
Ambient Air Quality Standards. These standards measure outdoor
air quality. They identify the maximum acceptable average
concentrations of air pollutants during a specified period of time.
These standards have been adopted at both State and Federal
levels.
Asbestos. A general term for naturally occurring fibrous silicate
minerals. The most common type of asbestos in California is from the
serpentine mineral group, commonly found in ultramafic rocks.
Beneficial use. Use of water either directly by people or for their
overall benefit as legally defined and identified.
California Climate Action Registry (CCAR). The California Climate
Action Registry is a nonprofit voluntary registry for sources and
producers of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
California Scenic Highway Program. The California Scenic
Highway Program was created by the State Legislature in 1963 to
preserve and protect scenic highway corridors from change that
would diminish the aesthetic value of lands adjacent to highways.
Carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon Dioxide is an odorless and colorless
greenhouse gas. Outdoor levels of CO2 are not high enough to result
in negative health effects. CO2 is emitted from natural sources (the
decomposition of dead organic matter; respiration of bacteria, plants,
                                                       Solvang General Plan 63

animals, and fungus; evaporation from oceans; and volcanic
out‐gassing) and man‐made sources (the burning of coal, oil, natural
gas, and wood).
Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). A distinct measure for
describing how much global warming a given type and amount of
greenhouse gas may cause, using the functionally equivalent amount
or concentration of CO2 as the reference.
Carbon Sequestration. Carbon storage (sequestration) occurs in
forests and soils, primarily through the natural process of
photosynthesis. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is taken up through
leaves and becomes carbon in the woody biomass of trees and other
vegetation.

Conservation Easement. A legal agreement between a land owner
and another party that limits uses of the land in order to protect its
biological and other resource value.
Coordinate. To solicit, consider, and respond to comments from
other agencies, organizations, or groups in order to bring common
actions, movements, or conditions. Coordinate is used in the context
of the general plan to direct an organized approach to addressing
inter-jurisdictional issues that are not solely under the purview of the
City of Solvang. This does not imply that the City is superior or
subordinate to other agencies, organizations, or groups. Rather, it
indicates that the City will confer with other agencies, organizations,
or groups for the purpose of identifying and potentially implementing
mutually-agreeable solutions. It does not commit the City to any
specific course of action or interagency relationship. “To coordinate”
or “coordination” does not have the same meaning as found in the
appellate court decision of California Native Plant Society v. City of
Rancho Cordova (2009) 172 Cal. App. 4th 603.
This general plan does not contain fundamental, mandatory, and
specific land use policies, standards, objectives of implementation
standards similar in character to policies which form the basis of the
holding in Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural Etc. County v. Bd. Of
Supervisors (1988) 62 Cal. App. 4th 1332. The determination of
whether or not an approval or action is consistent with this general
plan is guided by the holding in Sequoyah Hills Homeowners v. City
of Oakland (1993) 23 Cal. App. 4th 704.

Critical Habitat. Specific areas designated by the U.S. Fish and The
most prevalent regulatory method of preserving farmland in the State
of California, as well as the area around Solvang governed by Santa
Barbara County Wildlife Service (USFWS) as essential to the
conservation of a Federally-listed species and which may require
special management considerations or protection. On city, county,
state, or private land where there is no Federal involvement, a critical
habitat designation has no regulatory impact. In other words,
designation of critical habitat generally does not affect non-Federal
land unless and until the property owner needs a Federal permit or
requests Federal funding for a project.
Discharge. A rate of water flow, typically expressed as a unit volume
of water per unit of time (e.g., cubic feet per second (cfs)).

Greenbelts. Areas where vegetation is removed around
structures and/or replaced with more fire resistant vegetation.
Greenhouse Effect. The earth’s natural warming process is known
as the “greenhouse effect.” Certain atmospheric gases that trap heat
in the atmosphere, causing the greenhouse effect, are referred to as
greenhouse gases (GHGs).
Greenhouse Gases (GHG). Gases that contribute to the greenhouse
effect. Some GHGs such as carbon dioxide occur naturally, and are
emitted to the atmosphere through natural processes and human
activities. Other GHGs (e.g., fluorinated gases) are created and
emitted solely through human activities. The principal GHGs that
                                                      Solvang General Plan 65

enter the atmosphere because of human activities include: water
vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
Chlorofluorocarbons         (CFCs),     and      fluorinated     gases
(hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur
hexafluoride (SF6)).
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory. A greenhouse gas (GHG)
inventory is an accounting of the amount of greenhouse gases
emitted to or removed from the atmosphere over a specific period of
time (e.g., one year) for a specified area. Inventories may be global
or local. A GHG inventory also provides information on the activities
that cause emissions and removals, as well as background on the
methods used to make the calculations. Policy makers use GHG
inventories to track emission trends, develop strategies and policies,
and assess progress in controlling GHG emissions.
Groundwater. Water that occurs beneath the land surface,
specifically within pore spaces of saturated soil, sediment, or rock
formations. Groundwater does not include moisture held by capillary
action in the upper, unsaturated areas of aquifers.
Groundwater basin. An aquifer or series of aquifers with defined
lateral boundaries and bottom layer. In some cases the boundaries of
successively deeper aquifers may differ and make it difficult to define
the limits of the basin.
Groundwater          recharge.     The     natural     or    intentional
infiltration/percolation of surface water into the zone of saturation
(i.e., into groundwater).
HCP. Habitat Conservation Plan
Important Farmlands. A collective term for farmlands designated as
Prime, Unique, or as Farmlands of Statewide Importance under the

Methane (CH4). CH4 is highly flammable GHG, and may form
explosive mixtures with air. Methane has both natural sources (such
as in swamplands) and anthropogenic sources (such as growing rice,
raising cattle, using natural gas, mining coal, fossil‐fuel combustion,
and biomass burning).
Mobile Source. A moving source of air pollution such as on road or
off road vehicles, boats, airplanes, lawn equipment, and small
equipment engines.
Nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O, also known as laughing gas, is a
colorless greenhouse gas. Nitrous oxide is considered harmless in
small doses, but heavy exposure can cause brain damage.
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx). NOx are composed of nitric oxide (NO),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and other oxides of nitrogen. NOx are
primarily created from the combustion process and are a major
contributor to smog and acid rain formation.
NMFS. National Marine Fisheries Service
Non-point source. A pollution source that cannot be defined at a
discrete location; a dispersed or spread out source area.
Official State Scenic Highway. A scenic highway officially
designated by the State Scenic Highway Advisory Committee after
application from a local jurisdiction, and only when the highway is
identified on State Scenic Highway Master Plans.
Open Space Land. Open space land is any parcel, area, or
waterway that is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open
space use. Under Section 65560 of the California Government Code,
open space land is broadly defined as land designated for the
preservation of natural resources(e.g., lakeshore and watershed
lands); managed production of resources (e.g., lands for agriculture,
pasture, forestry, recharge of groundwater basins);outdoor
recreation(e.g., parks, scenic highway corridors, areas with
outstanding scenic, historic, and cultural values);or public health and
safety(e.g., floodplains, unstable soil areas).
Ozone Precursors. There are several chemical steps in creating
ozone. Ozone precursors are chemicals that lead to the eventual
creation of ozone. Ozone precursors occur either naturally, or as a
result of human activities such as the use of combustion engines.
Ozone is a pungent, colorless, toxic gas created in the atmosphere
rather than emitted directly into the air. Ozone is produced in
complex atmospheric reactions involving oxides of nitrogen and
reactive organic gases, acting with ultraviolet energy from the sun in
a photochemical reaction.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The Safety Element provides policy direction to help minimize the risk
to life and property from natural and human-caused hazards affecting
the City’s Plan Area1. Natural hazards are processes such as
earthquakes, landslides, flooding, and wildfires, and have been
occurring for thousands, even millions of years. These natural
processes have played an essential role in shaping the topography
and landscape of the Solvang area, and become “hazards” when
they disrupt or otherwise affect the lives and property or people.
Human-caused hazards can be a consequence of technology, such
as aircraft operations, or result from the construction and use of
infrastructure such as dams and highways.
Any assessment of hazard necessarily involves an understanding of
risk, which can be thought of as the exposure of people or property to
danger, harm or loss. While there are many hazards affecting the
environment, not all pose a risk to residents or visitors to Solvang.
Accordingly, for purposes of this Safety Element, the risk associated
with natural and human-caused hazards can be separated into three
general categories:
         Acceptable Risk. The level of risk below which no specific
         action by the City or other responsible agency is deemed to
         be necessary to further reduce the consequences of a
         hazard.
         Unacceptable Risk. The level of risk above which specific
         action is deemed necessary to protect life and property.
         Avoidable Risk. A risk that can be averted while still
         achieving the individual or public objective.
The Safety Element provides policy guidance to address what would
generally be regarded as unacceptable and avoidable risks.
The cost of protecting life and property generally increases with the
severity of the hazards and the level of risk reduction that is desired.

At some point, however, the cost of providing protection becomes
prohibitive when compared to the benefits derived. Scientific
expertise can determine the magnitude of the hazard and estimate
the probable effects, but the public ultimately determines how much
risk to assume and the acceptable level of protection.
To evaluate what is considered to be “acceptable” risk, the following
factors should be considered:
         Severity of Potential Losses -- Will the loss from an event
         be large or small? Potential losses include loss of life, injury,
         or property; environmental damage, and loss of function.
         Probability of Loss -- How often is the event expected to
         occur? The probability that hazards will occur should be
         evaluated in light of their possible effect on structures or
         human activities.
1.1        ORGANIZATION OF THE SAFETY ELEMENT
The Safety Element is organized by topical sections that address the
range of hazards affecting the City’s Plan Area. Each section begins
with a brief overview of the topic and how it may affect life or property
in Solvang. Where relevant, maps are provided to help illustrate the
extent of hazards affecting the City. Lastly, each topical section
contains goals, policies and action items to guide future decision
making:
         Goal: The ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is
         general in nature and immeasurable.
         Policy: A specific statement in text or diagram guiding action
         and implying clear commitment.
         Action Item: An action, procedure, program, or technique
         that carries out general plan policy.
1.2        GENERAL PLAN BACKGROUND REPORT
For the goals and policies of the Safety Element to provide effective
guidance for the protection of life and property they must be founded
on a thorough understanding of the extent, causes and potential
effects of the hazards that may affect City’s Plan Area. A description
of these hazards is provided in the City of Solvang General Plan
Conservation, Open Space and Safety Elements Background Report
which is published separately and available on the City’s website.
The findings and conclusion of the Background Report are
summarized in the topical sections that follow.

1.3       REGULATORY SETTING
Statutory Requirements
The Safety Element is one of several topics (“Elements”) that
comprise the City’s General Plan. Government Code section
65302(g) sets forth a list of topics that the Safety Element must
cover, if they pertain to conditions in the City’s Plan Area. These
topics include:
       Seismically induced conditions including ground shaking,
        surface rupture, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam
        failure;
       Slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides;
       Subsidence, liquefaction, and other geologic hazards;
       Flooding;
       Wild land and urban fires; and
       Evacuation routes.
While the Safety Element is required to focus on these mandatory
topics, jurisdictions may address any safety issues that are
considered relevant. The following additional issues are addressed in
this Element:
       Hazardous Materials;
       Airport Safety;
       Law Enforcement and Crime;
       Disease Vectors and Pesticides;
       Hazardous Trees
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
Section 65300.5 of the California Government Code requires the
General Plan and its Elements to be “an integrated, internally
consistent and compatible statement of policies...” The Safety
Element is closely linked to the Land Use, Circulation and Open
Space Elements of the General Plan. The Land Use Element
designates the general distribution of land uses within the Plan Area,
as well as standards for population density and building intensity. The
Land Use Element also contains policies to ensure that
environmental conditions, including hazards, are considered in
decisions involving land use. The provision of viable evacuation
routes to be used in an emergency is directly related to the planned
circulation system described in the Circulation Element.
Lastly, one of the purposes of the Open Space Element is to
preserve open space for public health and safety, including areas
that require special management and regulation because of
                                                     Solvang General Plan 3

hazardous or special conditions (e.g., earthquake fault zones, flood
plains, unstable soil areas, and high fire risk areas).
Required Consultations
In accordance with Government Code Section 65302 (g), the
California Geology Survey and the State Office of Emergency
Services were contacted to advise them that preparation of the City’s
Safety Element was about to commence and to solicit advice
concerning plan preparation (See Appendix). In June, 2015, a draft of
the Safety Element was sent to their offices for consideration, and no
further action is needed.
1.4       LIMITATIONS
The Safety Element is based on a general evaluation of the hazards
affecting the City’s Plan Area and the risk they pose. The
identification and evaluation of hazards and their associated risks is
based on information available at the time of the Element’s
preparation; no site specific evaluations were performed.
The maps in this Element show the general areas of potential
hazards, but should not be interpreted as to precisely define hazard
areas. The Safety Element is intended to be used for general land
use planning purposes only, and should be used to identify where
detailed site investigations would be required for new development.

2.0 EMERGENCY PREPARATION
         AND RESPONSE
Emergency preparedness refers to the coordinated efforts by the City
and other agencies to prevent, prepare for, respond to, recover from,
and mitigate natural and human-caused disasters and emergencies.
The City employs a range of regulatory tools to protect life and
property from natural and human-caused hazards. This Element
does not repeat in detail the regulatory framework currently in place.
Instead, it contains broad policies and action items reflecting the
City’s commitment to achieving acceptable levels of risk.
2.1 Disaster Preparedness and Avoidance
The most effective and least costly approach to protect life and
property from hazards is avoidance. However, many hazards such as
earthquakes and wildfire affect a large area and the affected area
cannot always be predicted with certainty. For these types of hazards
a pro-active approach of preparation, mitigation and avoidance is
needed. Disaster preparedness typically involves the development of
response procedures, the identification of evacuation routes, design
and installation of warning systems, purchase of emergency
equipment, and training of emergency personnel. In addition to
advance preparation, the risks and adverse effects of hazards can be
wholly or partially mitigated with proper planning, adherence to
current building codes, and through the effective management of
resources when an emergency does occur.
To guide the City’s emergency response efforts, the City adopted an
Emergency Management Plan in 2014. The Plan establishes the
emergency organization, assigns tasks, and specifies policies and
general procedures to be followed in an emergency. The Plan also
provides for the coordination of planning efforts among the various
emergency staff and service elements utilizing the California
Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS), the Federal
National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the Incident
Command System (ICS).

                                                              Safety Element
In October, 2011, the City adopted a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan
(LHMP) to identify strategies for mitigating the natural and human
caused hazards affecting the City. The LHMP contains a capability
assessment, an assessment of vulnerabilities and a complete hazard
mitigation strategy to protect life, property and the City’s critical
facilities from hazards associated with (among other things)
earthquakes, wildfires, flooding, dam failure, and landslides. Critical
facilities in Solvang are shown on Figure 1. The LHMP was adopted
by Resolution 12-886 which is included in the Appendix.
In addition to providing important strategies for the protection of life
and property, adoption of a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan enables the
City to be eligible for a higher percentage of relief funding following a
disaster. With few exceptions, the California Disaster Assistance Act
limits the state share for any eligible disaster relief project to no more
than 75% of total state eligible costs. Legislation adopted in 2007
(AB2140) authorizes the state share to exceed 75% when certain
eligibility requirements are satisfied, including:
         The City has adopted a local hazard mitigation plan and has
          incorporated the LHMP into the Safety Element of the general
          plan.
         The LHMP addresses the specific elements described in the
          Planning and Zoning Law.

2.2 DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
Solvang General Plan
The City’s General Plan Land Use Element designates land for
various uses based in part on the underlying physical features and
constraints affecting portions of the City’s Plan Area. By limiting
development density in areas that may be subject to significant
geologic and other safety hazards, the risk of loss of life and property
can be minimized.
Recognizing that avoidance is often the most cost-effective
approach, areas affected by flooding, steep slopes or other
constraints are designated Open Space/Recreation or Agriculture.
Development Review
The City exercises discretionary approval authority over certain types
of new development. Standards contained in the City’s Zoning
Ordinance help ensure that new development meets minimum public
safety standards for access and fire protection. Compliance with the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that the City
identify significant environmental constraints affecting a development
site and to incorporate mitigation measures to reduce those impacts.
Building Codes
For all new construction, the City implements the California Building
Code (CBC) through the building permit process (Solvang Municipal
Code, Title 10, Building Regulations). Chapter 16 of the CBC deals
with General Design Requirements, including (but not limited to)
regulations governing seismically resistant construction (Chapter 16,
Division IV) and construction to protect people and property from
hazards associated with excavation cave-ins and falling debris or
construction materials.
The CBC defines different building regions in the state and ranks
them according to their seismic hazard potential. There are four types
of these regions: Seismic Zones 1 through 4, with Zone 1 having the
least seismic potential and Zone 4 having the highest seismic
potential. The City and its Plan Area are in Seismic Zone 4;
accordingly, any future development would be required to comply
with all design standards applicable to Seismic Zone 4.

3.0 GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC
          HAZARDS
Solvang is subject to a variety of potential geologic and seismic
hazards that affect the suitability of land for various uses.
3.1 SEISMIC HAZARDS AND SEISMIC RISK
Earthquakes
A number of active and potentially active faults affect the Solvang
area (Figure 3). The Santa Ynez River Fault, which bisects the City’s
Plan Area, and the Santa Ynez Fault are both considered potentially
active and capable of producing damaging earthquakes. The
presence of active faults and the number of historic earthquakes
experienced in the area suggest a high probability that the City will be
subject to the effects of one or more potentially damaging
earthquakes in the future. According to the 2007 Uniform California
Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF), the Solvang area has
between a 5% - 10% probability of experiencing an earthquake of
magnitude 6.7 over the next 30 years.                                        Types of Faults
The most serious direct earthquake hazard is the damage or collapse
of buildings and other structures caused by groundshaking. Urban
development on alluvial deposits in the Solvang area is likely to
experience a greater degree of ground shaking than hillside areas.
Properties near the Santa Ynez River are located on alluvium
deposits of varying depths which can increase the potential from
groundshaking damage.
Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings and structures located in
geologically hazardous areas are subject to structural failure during
geologic events such as earthquake fault displacement, landslide, or
soil liquefaction. URM buildings are considered the foremost threat to
life because of their poor performance during earthquakes. Although
not every URM building will collapse in a significant earthquake, a
large number of these building types will have some degree of life
threatening failure. All unreinforced masonry buildings in Solvang
have been retrofitted to meet current building codes except for the
Santa Ines Mission.
                                                        Solvang General Plan       13

                                                           Safety Element
Liquefaction
Liquefaction is the loss of soil strength due to seismic forces acting
on water-saturated granular soils. This loss of strength leads to a
“quicksand” condition which causes many types of ground failure.
When the liquefied granular layer occurs at the surface, objects can
either sink or float depending on their density.
The evaluation of potential for liquefaction is complex and must
consider soil type, soil density, groundwater table, and the duration
and intensity of shaking. Liquefaction is most likely to occur in
deposits of weak saturated alluvium or similar deposits of artificial fill.
In Solvang, the potential for liquefaction exists in low-lying areas
along the Santa Ynez River and tributary streamcourses composed
of unconsolidated, saturated, clay-free sands, and silts (Figure 4).
The area along Alamo Pintado Creek is of particular concern due to
the historical presence of high groundwater levels.                         The process of liquefaction.
Settlement
Settlement is the compaction of soils caused by groundshaking. It
occurs irregularly and may be partly controlled by bedrock surfaces,
and old lake, slough, swamp, and stream beds. The amount of
compaction may range from a few inches to several feet. Irregular
compaction is most widespread and extreme in major earthquakes. It
may occur as much as 75 to 80 miles from the epicenter of an
earthquake and may amount to several feet even at that distance. In
the City’s Plan Area compaction is most likely to occur in areas which
are underlain by soft water-saturated low-density alluvial material,
such as along the Santa Ynez River and the creeks that pass through
the City.
Lurch Cracking and Lateral Spreading
Lurch cracking refers to fractures, cracks, and fissures produced by
groundshaking, settling, compaction of soil, and sliding and may
occur many miles from the epicenter of an earthquake. These effects
are characteristic of earthquakes large enough for significant ground
motion to occur. The larger the earthquake magnitude, the more
extensive the effects tend to be. Thus, a major earthquake may
damage streets, curbs, sewer, gas, and water lines.
Lateral spreading is the horizontal movement or spreading of soil
toward an open face such as a stream bank, the open side of fill
embankments, or the sides of levees. Artificial fill areas which are
improperly engineered or which have steep, unstable banks are most
likely to be affected. The potential for lurch cracking and lateral
spreading is highest in areas where there is a high groundwater
table, relatively soft and recent alluvium deposits, and where creek
                                                     Solvang General Plan               14

                                                             Safety Element
banks are relatively high. In Solvang these areas are located along
the Santa Ynez River, Adobe Canyon Creek, Alisal Creek and Alamo
Pintado Creek.
Landslides
Landslides are the downslope movement of geologic materials. The
stability of slopes is related to a variety of factors, including the
slope's steepness; the strength of geologic materials in terms of
resistance to the downslope stress of gravity; the characteristics of
bedding planes, joints, and faults; surface water and groundwater
conditions; changes in loading (eg., building construction); changes
in vegetation (eg., wild-fire, grading, and overgrazing); exposure to
weathering; and susceptibility to disturbances such as seismic
shaking. Portions of the City’s Plan Area with steep slopes and
unstable soils may be subject to the effects of landslides (Figure 5).
                                                                            Components of a landslide.
In addition to landslides, another slope stability problem found in
                                                                            Source: USGS
hillside areas is soil creep, the slow downslope movement of
individual soil particles at varying rates. This type of movement does
not involve sudden slippage such as that associated with landslides,
but instead involves the gradual movement of soil particles which
eventually changes the surface of affected hillsides. Several areas in
Solvang have been identified where soil creep is a concern.
3.2 SOIL RELATED HAZARDS
All soils have certain engineering properties and characteristics such
as erosion potential, shrink-swell behavior, and permeability, which
determine their suitability and constraints for building sites, loads,
grading, and drainage systems. The susceptibility of certain land
areas to erosion and ground failure is in part determined by the type
of soils present.
Soil Erosion
Erosion refers to the removal of soil from exposed bedrock surfaces
by water or wind. Erosion occurs naturally in most systems, but is
often accelerated by human activities that disturb soil and vegetation.
The rate at which erosion occurs is largely a function of climate, soil
cover, slope conditions, and inherent soil properties such as texture
and structure. Erosion potential is generally higher in the hillside
areas of the City, but should be identified on a case-by-case basis,
depending on the aforementioned factors. Soil units found within the
City’s Plan Area generally have a slight to moderate potential for
erosion. According to soil data compiled by the Natural Resource
Conservation Service, small areas with a severe potential for erosion
occur along Adobe Canyon Creek and in the area north of Highway
246 and west of Alamo Pintado Road.

Certain soils which include clay materials tend to swell when their
moisture content increases and shrink when moisture decreases. As
moisture content varies, the resultant shrinking and swelling of the
soils (expansive soils) can cause extensive damage to structures
built over such material.
Figure 6 shows areas of the City with expansive soils. In particular,
soils in the Plan Area associated with the Positas, Santa Ynez,
Tierra, Cropley and Diablo formations typically have a moderate to
high shrink-swell potential. These areas are generally north of
Highway 246 in the area east and west of Alamo Pintado Road.
Naturally Occurring Asbestos
Naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) can take the form of long, thin,
separable fibers which can be broken down into microscopic particles
and suspended in the air through natural weathering or human
disturbance. There is no health threat if asbestos fibers in soil remain
undisturbed and do not become airborne. When inhaled, these thin
fibers irritate tissues and resist the body's natural defenses.
Asbestos, a known carcinogen, causes cancers of the lung and the
lining of internal organs, as well as asbestosis and other diseases
that inhibit lung function.
Naturally Occurring Asbestos has been identified as a toxic air
contaminant by the CARB. Under the CARB Air Toxics Control
Measure (ATCM) for Construction, Grading, Quarrying, and Surface
Mining Operations, prior to any grading activities, a geologic
evaluation should be conducted to determine if NOA is present within
the area that will be disturbed. This may include development of an
Asbestos Dust Mitigation Plan and an Asbestos Health and Safety
Program for approval by the APCD.
Naturally occurring asbestos may be found in ultramafic rock
formations of the Los Padres National Forest located about 30 miles
east of the City and outside the City’s Plan Area. Accordingly,
continued development within the City’s Plan Area is not likely to be
affected by naturally occurring asbestos.

Goals, Policies and Action Items
Goal 3.1
PREVENT LOSS OF LIFE, INJURY, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE
DUE TO GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC HAZARDS.
Policy 3.1
The City shall require earthquake resistant designs for all structures
and utilities and especially critical structures such as hospitals, police
substations, fire stations, emergency communication centers, private
schools, high occupancy buildings and bridges.
     Action Item (A)
     Require and enforce all standards contained in the current
     California Building Code related to construction on unstable
     soils. The City should make a determination as to site suitability
     of all development projects during the building permit review
     process. Do not approve proposed development sited within
     areas of known or suspected instability until detailed area
     studies are completed that evaluate the extent and degree of
     instability and its impact on the overall development of the area.
     Action Item (B)
     Require the preparation of geotechnical reports and impose
     appropriate mitigation measures to ensure, within the limits of
     technical and economic feasibility, that new structures are able
     to withstand the effects of seismic activity, including
     liquefaction, slope instability, expansive soils or other geologic
     hazards.
     Action Item (C)
     Require the design of underground utilities, particularly water
     and natural gas mains, to resist seismic forces in accordance
     with state requirements.
     Action Item (D) Adopt new California Building Code
     requirements, when necessary, to promote the use of updated
     design standards.
     Action Item (E)
     Encourage        investigations      to   improve    the     existing
     characterizations of faults in areas of existing or proposed
     development, and their potential to generate damaging
     earthquakes, for the purpose of assisting in the design of
     structures to resist seismic loads. Implement appropriate design
     standards and building codes that address local seismic
     conditions.

       Action Item (F)
       Identify and abate existing structures which will be hazardous
       during an earthquake event, especially high occupancy
       structures that have the greatest potential affect on public
       safety.
       Action Item (G)
       Consider historic community resources in the abatement of
       unsafe structures and strive to preserve the essential qualities
       of historic buildings while improving structural safety.
Policy 3.2
The City shall locate new development away from active and
potentially active faults to reduce damage from fault rupture. Fault
studies may need to include mapping and exploration beyond project
limits to provide a relatively accurate assessment of a fault’s activity.
       Action Item (A)
       The City will continue to enforce the California Building Code
       and the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act that require
       geologic studies to be performed so that habitable structures
       and essential facilities will be sited away from active and
       potentially active faults.
Policy 3.3
The City shall require design professionals to evaluate the potential
for liquefaction or seismic settlement to impact structures in
accordance with the currently adopted California Building Code.
       Action Item (A)
       Enforce current Building Code requirements that require the
       potential for liquefaction to be addressed in the design of
       structures.
       Action Item (B)
       Require geotechnical studies to be performed for habitable or
       important structures (as defined by the building code) sited in
       areas having moderate to high liquefaction potential. The
       geotechnical study should evaluate the potential for liquefaction
       and/or seismic related settlement to impact the development,
       and mitigation to reduce these potential impacts, if needed.
Policy 3.4
The City will avoid development in areas of known slope instability or
high landslide risk when possible, and continue to encourage that
developments on sloping ground use design and construction
techniques appropriate for those areas.

Action Item (A)
For developments in areas of known slope instability,
landslides, or slopes steeper than 20 percent, the stability of
slopes shall be addressed by registered professionals
practicing in their respective fields of expertise. For
subdivisions, such studies should be performed prior to
delineating lot lines and building envelopes.
Action Item (B)
Prohibit new development in areas of known landslide activity
unless development plans indicate that the hazard can be
reduced to a less than significant level prior to beginning
development.
Action Item (C)
Prohibit the expansion of existing structures or developments in
areas of known landslide activity except when it will reduce the
potential for loss of life and property.
Action Item (D)
Require development to mitigate the impacts that their project
contribute to landslides and slope instability hazards on
neighboring property, and appurtenant structures, utilities, and
roads; such as emergency ingress and egress to the property,
and loss of water, power or other lifeline facilities.
Action Item (E)
Enforce current building code requirements and applicable
ordinances that pertain to development on sloping ground.
Action Item (F)
Require slope stability evaluations for developments in areas of
moderate or higher landslide risk.

4.0 FLOODING
Flooding occurs in response to heavy rainfall, when creeks and
drainage channels overflow. Flooding may also occur in low-lying
areas that have poor drainage, or when culverts become blocked,
even during moderate storms. Flood severity can be increased by
fires in the watershed, structures or fill placed in flood-prone areas,
and increased runoff resulting from development of impervious
surfaces (such as parking lots, roads, and roofs).
4.1 FLOOD HAZARDS AFFECTING THE CITY’S
       PLAN AREA
Solvang is located in the western Santa Ynez Valley which is drained
primarily by the Santa Ynez River and its tributaries. Flooding is most
likely to occur in the late fall and winter as a result of extended
periods of precipitation. In Solvang, hazardous flooding events are
most commonly associated with the Santa Ynez River, Adobe
Canyon Creek, Alisal Creek, and Alamo Pintado Creek. Another
potential source of flooding is the City’s location downstream of
Bradbury Dam (Lake Cachuma), Gibraltar Dam and reservoir and
Alisal Creek Dam.
Historic Floods In the Solvang Area
Historical records indicate that serious flooding has occurred
repeatedly on the Santa Ynez River. At least five major floods were
recorded during the period of 1812 to 1907. Since 1907, reliable
records have been compiled for the river as summarized in Table 1.
Historical data for Alamo Pintado Creek, Alisal Creek, and Adobe
Canyon Creek are not available. As seen in Table 1, flood events
have typically occurred in the winter following periods of intense
storms.

                             After 4 days of rain, flood flows on the Santa Ynez
                             River engulfed the entire Lompoc Valley. The floods
            Santa Ynez

            River

                             washed out.
                             This was a major flood event for much of Southern
            Region wide/
                             California, including Santa Barbara County. The Santa

                             The 1969 storm was equivalent to a 100‑year storm in
            Region wide/

            River
                             tributaries of the Santa Ynez River overflowed.
                             The 1970 floods were caused by a series of Pacific
                             storms that brought severe, widespread damage to the
            Santa Ynez
  1970                       Central Coast and the rest of California. Damage was
            River
                             most severe in the Salinas River Basin, in the Santa
                             Ynez River Group
                             Along the Santa Ynez River, 700 acres of agricultural
                             land were damaged with 10 feet of silt and water
            Santa Ynez

                             Plant was damaged, including wells, lines and ponds.
                             Five days of heavy rains during January 7-11, 2005,
                             caused widespread flooding throughout much of
                             Southern California. On February 4, 2005, President
                             Bush declared seven counties in Southern California
                             disaster areas, including Santa Barbara County. Run-
            Region wide/     off was high from this event because the ground was
  2005      Santa Ynez       saturated from heavy storms preceding it. A slow
            River            moving Pacific storm moved into Santa Barbara
                             County in late December and brought with it copious
                             amounts of rain by the time it had moved on in mid-
                             January. By January 12, 320% of normal rainfall totals
                             had been made. All three of the reservoirs on the
                             Santa Ynez River were full and spilling.

Flood Hazard Areas
Official floodplain maps are maintained by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA determines areas subject to
flood hazards and designates these areas by relative risk of flooding
on a map for each community, known as the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM). FIRM maps for the Solvang area were most recently
updated December 4, 2012.
A 100-year flood is considered for purposes of land use planning and
protection of property and human safety. The 100-year flood is
defined as the flood event that has a one percent chance of occurring
in any given year. It is important to note that the delineation of areas
within the 100-year floodplain represents a statistical probability for
the long-term average occurrence of flooding. Actually, flooding can
occur in a 100-year floodplain more or less frequently than once in a
one hundred year period. Smaller floods have an even greater
chance of occurring in any year and pose hazards as well. Areas that
are sporadically flooded only become inundated as a result of more
uncommon and extreme precipitation/runoff events.
The boundaries of the 100-year floodplain (Figure 7) are delineated
by FEMA on the basis of hydrology, topography, and modeling of
flow during predicted rainstorms. In mapping the 100-year floodplain,
FEMA applies two levels of analysis. Where flooding has the greatest
potential to adversely affect life and property, FEMA uses detailed
hydraulic analysis to determine the 100-year floodplain. In other
areas, approximate methodologies are employed. The analysis of
predicted flooding does not account for the effects of continued land
subsidence or the rise in sea level associated with climate change.
The 500-year flood hazard area (Figure 7) is also established by
FEMA in the same manner as the 100-year flood hazard area.
However, the 500-year flood is defined as the flood event that has a
0.2 percent chance of occurring in any given year. As with the 100-
year floodplain, it is important to note that the delineation of areas
within the 500-year floodplain zone represents a statistical probability
for the long-term average occurrence of flooding.
Department of Water Resources (DWR) Awareness Floodplains
The DWR Awareness Floodplain maps are for areas that are not
currently mapped as a regulated floodplain by FEMA but, based on
approximate assessment procedures. These areas are shown simply
as flood prone areas, without specific water depths or other flood
hazard information. Figure 8 depicts the DWR Awareness Floodplain
areas within the City’s Plan Area. The awareness floodplain areas
are generally narrow corridors along stream channels that are
connected to, and typically extend up stream/up valley from, the
identified FEMA high risk (100 year) floodplains. These DWR
                                                      Solvang General Plan 26

                                                           Safety Element
mapped floodplains, while developed from approximate methods, are
useful indicators of flood prone areas to be avoided and/or studied in
detail prior to potential development.
Dam Failure
Another potential source of flooding affecting the City is dam failure.
Dam failure can result from numerous natural or human activities,
such as earthquakes, erosion, improper siting, rapidly rising flood
waters, and structural and design flaws. Flooding due to dam failure
can cause loss of life, damage to property, and other ensuing
hazards.
There are three dams on the Santa Ynez River upstream from the
City: Bradbury Dam (Lake Cachuma), Gibraltar Dam and reservoir
and Juncal Dam and reservoir. A fourth dam is located on Alisal
Creek about five miles to the south. Lake Cachuma is the largest
reservoir along the Santa Ynez River, with a drainage area of 421
square miles upstream of the Bradbury Dam. Gibraltar Reservoir has
a drainage area of 214 square miles upstream of Gibraltar Dam.
A comprehensive analysis of the potential for dam failure and
possible downstream effects for these upstream dams has not been
undertaken for this Background Report. However, the Bureau of
Reclamation completed an Emergency Action Plan for Bradbury Dam
in 1999 which was subsequently updated in 2010. In addition, a
significant seismic retrofit of Bradbury Dam was completed in 2006
which brought the dam up to federal standards for seismic safety.
Flooding associated with dam failure on one of the local or upstream
dams is considered to have a low probability for occurrence. Figure 9
shows areas of the City that could be subject to dam inundation in
the event of a failure of Bradbury Dam and Alisal Dam which are
closest to the City.

DAMAGE DUE TO FLOODING.
Policy 4.1
The City shall not approve new development in areas subject to a
100-year flood event, based on Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) or on other updated mapping acceptable to the City,
unless and until the flood hazard has been mitigated. Such mitigation
may be accomplished by one, or a combination of, the following:
         Compliance with Title 13, Chapter 1 of the Solvang Municipal
          Code, Flood Plain Management.
         Avoidance of flood prone areas.
       Action Item (A)
       Continue to participate in the National Flood Insurance
       Program. To this end, the City shall ensure that its regulations
       are in full compliance with standards adopted by the Federal
       Emergency Management Agency.
       Action Item (B)
       Prepare and adopt flood management plans and practices
       aimed at protecting life and property from the harmful effects of
       flooding. As part of this effort, the City shall establish criteria for:
          Evaluating whether new development should be located in
           flood hazard zones;
          Identifying construction methods or other methods to
           minimize damage if new development is located in flood
           hazard zones, and
          Maintaining the structural and operational integrity of
           essential public facilities during flooding.
       Action Item (C)
       The City’s first priority in preventing risks to life and property
       resulting from flooding shall be to designate appropriate land
       uses in areas subject to flooding. Only when this land use-
       based approach is not sufficient to reduce hazards to life and
       property to acceptable levels will the City support the
       construction of new flood control projects.

     Action Item (D)
     Require any development on land subject to a 100- year flood
     event, based on Federal Emergency Management Agency
     (FEMA) or on other updated mapping acceptable to the City, to
     conform to National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
     standards.
     Action Item (E)
     Require new residential development, including mobile homes,
     to be constructed so that the lowest floor is at least 12 inches
     above the 100-year flood level.
     Action Item (F)
     Require new non-residential development to be anchored and
     flood-proofed to prevent damage from the 100-year flood or,
     alternatively, elevated to at least 12 inches above the 100-year
     flood level.
     Action Item (G)
     The City shall ensure that new essential public facilities are
     located outside of flood hazard zones whenever feasible,
     including hospitals and health care facilities, emergency
     shelters, fire stations, emergency command centers, and
     emergency communications facilities or shall identify
     construction methods or other methods to minimize damage if
     these facilities if located within flood hazard zones.
Policy 4.2

5.0 FIRE HAZARD
Fire is a natural component of the environment and plays an
important role in maintaining the diverse mosaic of plant communities
in the region. The threat of a wildland fire affecting Solvang is high
due to the presence of dense, flammable vegetative fuels and
especially along the City’s wildland urban interface, where structures
and other human development meet or intermingle with wildland or
vegetative fuels. In these areas fuel management, proper site design
and emergency access are critical to the protection of life and
property.
This section was prepared in part based on the recommendations of
the Office of Planning and Research's publication "Fire Hazard
Planning, General Technical Advice Series".
5.1 FIRE HAZARDS AFFECTING THE CITY’S
       PLAN AREA
Type and Location of Fires That May Affect Solvang
Structural fires in urban areas typically pose an immediate hazard to
the affected structure's occupants and any nearby structures. Such
fires can have a variety of ignition sources that include kitchen fires,
the use of yard equipment, electrical problems and even arson. The
type and scale of development within the City helps minimize the
danger associated with structural fires. Residential development
consists largely of one- and two-story single family dwellings on
individual lots with front, rear and side yards that afford accessibility
for fire protection. Commercial buildings in the Village area consist
largely of two-story structures with access from the adjoining street
and from the rear. The relatively compact size of the City affords
quick response times for firefighting. As a result, structural fires are
brought under control quickly by the County of Santa Barbara Fire
Department.
Wildfire is an uncontrolled fire spreading through vegetative fuels and
exposing or consuming structures. The hills surrounding the City
support dense stands of chaparral, oak woodlands and grassland
that are the primary fuel source for wildfires in the region. The low
annual precipitation (about 15 inches per year), highly flammable
                                                      Solvang General Plan 34

                                                           Safety Element
vegetation and high velocity “Santa Ana” winds create ideal
conditions for major wildfires.
Fire Hazard Severity Zones
California Public Resources Code Sections 4201 - 4204 and
California Government Code Sections 51175 89 direct Cal Fire to
map areas of significant fire hazards based on fuels, terrain, weather,
and other relevant factors. These zones, referred to as Fire
Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ), then define the application of
various mitigation strategies to reduce risk associated with
wildland fires.
The fire hazard severity is mapped for three categories (Figure 10):
Moderate, High and Very High. As shown on Figure 10, areas
outside and immediately adjacent to the City’s Plan Area are mapped
as Moderate and High fire hazard severity. The steep hillsides to the
south and west of the City possess dense oak woodland and
chaparral vegetation and are mapped as Very High fire hazard
severity areas.
Fire Protection
The City of Solvang is within the boundaries of the Santa Barbara
County Fire District which provides for fire protection services.
Station No. 30 is located at 1644 Oak Street. The Fire Department
has 9 full time equivalent personnel, with 3 firefighters on duty at all
times. Station 30 apparatus include:
       Type 1 Structure Engine
       Type 3 Brush Engine
       Type 1 Reserve Engine
       A utility vehicle
Response times throughout the City are 3 to 5 minutes; there are no
paramedic services provided.
Fire protection for the land between Solvang and the City of Buellton
is also provided by Santa Barbara County Fire Department. Fire
protection for other land surrounding the City is provided by the
Santa Barbara County Fire Department.
Fire History
Fire history is an important component in understanding fire
frequency, fire type, significant ignition sources, and vulnerable
areas/communities. Figure 11 shows the major fires affecting the
Solvang area from 1915 through 2009 (the most recent mapped
data). As shown in Figure 11, large-scale wildfires have occurred
                                                     Solvang General Plan 35

                                                        Safety Element
infrequently and have mostly occurred in the mountainous area south
of the Santa Ynez River in the Santa Ynez Mountains.

6.0 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Hazardous materials include a wide range of solids, liquids, and
gases that are flammable, explosive, corrosive, or toxic. Because
hazardous materials may be shipped through the Solvang area,
transportation accidents pose the most significant hazardous material
risk to City residents and the environment.
6.1 SOURCES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Public exposure to hazardous materials can result from their use by
industry, agriculture, and services. Some businesses in Solvang
transport, store, or use toxic or hazardous chemicals posing potential
safety hazards. The most prevalent hazardous materials in Solvang
are above- and under-ground storage tanks containing materials
such as gasoline and diesel fuel. Dry cleaning operations can also
lead to soil and groundwater contamination by solvents, including
perchloroethylene (PCE), tetrachloroethene (TCE), and chromium.
The Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB)
is currently the oversight agency for contaminated sites of this type in
the City and its Plan Area.
Hazardous Waste Disposal
The nearest Community Hazardous Waste Collection Center is
located at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB).
Households in the cities of Goleta, Santa Barbara, and Solvang, as
well as the unincorporated areas may dispose of household
hazardous waste (HHW) on Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
and on Sundays from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
The Medical Waste Management Program (MWMP), in the
Environmental Management Branch of the California Department of
Public Health, regulates the generation, handling, storage, treatment,
and disposal of medical waste by providing oversight for the
implementation of the Medical Waste Management Act (MWMA). The
MWMP permits and inspects all medical waste off-site treatment
facilities and medical waste transfer stations. In addition to the
treatment methods specifically allowed in the MWMA, there are more
than a dozen alternative medical waste treatment technologies
approved for use in California.

7.0 OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY
          ISSUES
7.1 AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS
The Santa Ynez Airport is a general aviation airport located
approximately 5 miles east of the City; there are no commercial air
services using the airport. In 1993, the Santa Barbara County Airport
Land Use Commission (ALUC) adopted an Airport Land Use Plan
(ALUP) that establishes safety zones around the airport to protect the
public from potential noise and safety impacts associated with aircraft
operations (Figure 12). The ALUP also designates allowable and
conditionally allowable land uses for the different safety zones. The
currently adopted safety zones do not affect the City’s Plan Area.
The ALUC is currently working on an update of the 1993 ALUP. The
Draft Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (2012) identifies an “airport
influence area” (AIA) surrounding the airport (Figure 13). The AIA
defines the jurisdiction of the ALUC and is the area where airport-
related noise, safety, airspace protection, and overflight factors may
significantly affect land use compatibility or necessitate restrictions on
certain land uses as determined by the ALUC. Land use actions that
affect property within the AIA will be subject to the compatibility
policies and criteria in this Compatibility Plan, when adopted. If a
residential property is located within the AIA, a real estate disclosure
must be provided as a condition of the sale or transfer of the
property. As shown on Figure 13, a portion of the Plan Area outside
the current city limits but within the sphere of influence lies within the
draft AIA. If adopted, residential properties within this area would be
subject to the disclosure requirements of the ALUP.

7.2 LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIME
The City contracts with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s
Department for law enforcement services. The City of Solvang
Substation is located at 1745 Mission Drive and is staffed by 7.2
fulltime equivalent personnel. There is one patrol person on duty at
all times of the day or night; response times throughout the City are
estimated to be less than 3 minutes. Police units are currently
dispatched to City emergencies through the Santa Barbara County
dispatch which is provided on a contract basis. Upgraded repeater
stations were installed in Buellton and Los Olivos in 2014 that will
help improve emergency communications.
The Solvang Substation will respond to requests from other agencies
outside the city limits when necessary. Other agencies who may
request assistance include the California Highway Patrol, the State
Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the County Parks Department.
Solvang experiences a relatively low level of crime, according to the
Uniform Crime Reports compiled by the police department and
submitted to the California Department of Justice. Over the five year
period from 2009 to 2013 a total of 180 felonies were reported, an
average of 36 felonies per year, or a rate of 6.8 felonies per 1,000
population per year.
7.3 Traffic Safety
Solvang experiences few traffic accidents on streets and
intersections serving the City, based on data compiled by Safe
Transportation Research and Education Center at the University of
California, Berkeley. Between January, 2003 and December, 2011,
there were 142 collisions reported, an average number of reported
collisions of 18 per year, or about 1.5 per month. Mission Drive/State
Route 246 carries the highest traffic volumes in the City. Accordingly,
the majority of collisions have occurred on Mission Drive. Although
low vehicle speeds generally reduce the potential for accidents,
during the period of 2003 to 2011, collisions resulted in a total of two
fatalities on State Route 246 in the Solvang vicinity. One occurred
west of the City in 2012 and the other occurred within the City limits
in 2005 west of Nykobing Drive.
Continued implementation of the goals, policies and action items of
the Circulation Element will ensure the safe operation of the City’s
circulation system.

7.4 Disease Vectors and Pesticides
A disease vector is any organism capable of transmitting the
causative agent of human disease or capable of producing human
discomfort or injury, including mosquitoes, flies, fleas, cockroaches,
mites, rats, or fungi.
West Nile Virus
West Nile virus is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) most
commonly spread by infected mosquitoes. West Nile virus can cause
febrile illness, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis
(inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord). There are no
medications to treat, or vaccines to prevent, WNV infection.
Fortunately, most people infected with WNV will have no symptoms.
About 1 in 5 people who are infected will develop a fever with other
symptoms.
Since 2005, a total of seven cases of West Nile Virus have been
reported in humans in Santa Barbara County. The control of
mosquitos along with ongoing monitoring and public education are
the most effective approaches to addressing the risk of West Nile
Virus.
Valley Fever
Dry, low rainfall areas such as land within the Santa Ynez Valley may
harbor the fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis, commonly known
as Valley Fever. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC
2013), Valley Fever can infect the respiratory system and may, in
rare instances, spread from the lungs to the rest of the body and
cause more severe conditions such a meningitis or even death. The
spores2 that cause Valley Fever live in the soils of the southwestern
United States in areas of low rainfall and may become airborne when
the soil is disturbed by such things as farming, construction activities
and wind. Infection rates are highest in California from June to
November when soils are driest.
According to the Santa Barbara County Department of Public Health,
cases of valley fever have been reported recently in the Santa Maria
area, but have not been reported in the Santa Ynez Valley. Although
the potential exists for the spores to be present, the absence of
reported cases suggests a low hazard to Solvang residents.
Pesticides
Pesticides are a major source of groundwater pollution that can
contaminate drinking water and irrigation wells. Accordingly, pesticide
2
  A spore can be thought of as a cell that is dormant (asleep) but may come to life
with the right conditions.
                                                              Solvang General Plan  47
                                                              Safety Element
use on lands surrounding the City poses a potential risk to the City’s
water supply and to its residents. Pesticide use is regulated by the
federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and locally by the
County Agriculture Commissioner. Compliance with federal and state
regulations for the use, transport and storage of pesticides helps
ensure a margin of safety for City residents. In addition, the City’s
water supply is tested daily to ensure compliance with federal and
state safe drinking water standards.
7.5 Hazardous Trees
Trees help make Solvang an attractive place residents for and
visitors and provide roosting and nesting habitat for birds and other
wildlife. However, as trees age and/or become affected by disease,
particularly massive or tall ones, they pose a risk from dropping limbs
or toppling. Strong winds, and saturated soils or erosion around
roots, contribute to the hazard. Falling branches or whole trees can
harm people, damage property, obstruct access, clog storm drains,
and interrupt power and communications.
For some types of pines in the Solvang area, pine bark beetles and
pitch canker can kill trees in a relatively short time. The weakened or
dead trees increase the hazard.
The City trims trees along streets and on City parks and grounds,
with safety as one objective. The City also works with property
owners and State agencies to deal with trees along creeks.

OF DISEASE VECTORS AND PESTICIDES.
Policy 7.3
The City shall work to reduce the potential for pesticide exposure and
the spread of disease to humans and the environment.
      Action Item (A)
      Collaborate with the Santa Barbara County Public Health
      Department’s efforts to systematically collect, track, and
      analyze community health and social, economic, and physical
      environmental data.
      Action Item (B)
      Work collaboratively with other agencies to control vectors such
      as mosquitos to protect Solvang residents from vector-borne
      diseases.
      Action Item (C)
      Require soil sampling and analysis to determine the presence
      and extent of any residual herbicides, pesticides, and fumigants
      on historically-farmed land in the City’s Plan Area that would be
      subject to ground-disturbing activities. The analysis shall be
      prepared in consultation with the Santa Barbara County Public

      Health Department and the work shall be conducted by an
      appropriate California-licensed professional and samples sent
      to a California Certified laboratory. At a minimum, the analysis
      shall document the areas proposed for sampling, the
      procedures for sample collection, the laboratory analytical
      methods to be used, and the pertinent regulatory threshold
      levels for determining proper excavation, handling, and, if
      necessary, treatment or disposal of any contaminated soils.
      The analysis shall be submitted to the City and the Santa
      Barbara County Public Health Department for review and
      approval at least 60 days before construction. Results of the
      laboratory testing and recommended resolutions for excavation,
      handling, dust control, and treatment/disposal of material found
      to exceed regulatory Practices shall be submitted to the City
      prior to construction.
Goal 7.4

INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH
FALLING TREES.
Policy 7.4
The City will work to minimize danger to people and property from
trees that are weakened and susceptible to falling or limb loss during
storms.
      Action Item (A)
      Identify, and maintain or remove, trees on City property to
      minimize hazards, and work with property owners to do the
      same.

8.0 Glossary
Alluvial/Alluvium. Erosion caused by wind or rain introduces soils,
materials, and rock fragments into streams and rivers. These
materials are reduced by the action of water movement and mixed
with debris as they are washed down the mountains and hills. They
are deposited as sediment that spreads out in a fan shape when the
watercourse reaches a relatively level area. Such deposits are called
alluvial materials or alluvium. The fan-shaped zone of deposited
sediment is called an alluvial fan.
Asbestos. A general term for naturally occurring fibrous silicate
minerals. The most common type of asbestos in California is from the
serpentine mineral group, commonly found in ultramafic rocks.
Assets at Risk. Assets at risk due to wildfires in California
include life and safety; timber; range; recreation; water and
watershed; plants; air quality; cultural and historical resources;
unique scenic areas; buildings; wildlife; and ecosystem health.
At risk Community. An interface community within the vicinity of
Federal lands that is at high risk from wildfire, or a group of homes
and other structures with basic infrastructure and services within
or adjacent to Federal land where conditions are conducive to
large scale wildland fire disturbance, or where a significant threat
to human life or property exists as a result of a wildlife fire
disturbance event.
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL
FIRE). The State department charged with protecting the residents
of California from fires, responding to emergencies, and
protecting and enhancing forest, range, and watershed values
providing social, economic, and environmental benefits to rural and
urban citizens.
Defensible Space. The area within the perimeter of a parcel where
basic wildfire protection practices are implemented, providing the key
point of defense from an approaching wildfire or escaping structure
fire. Defensible space is characterized by the establishment and
maintenance of emergency vehicle access, emergency water
reserves, street names and building identification, and fuel
modification measures such as tree trimming and the removal of
brush adjacent to residences.
Exceedance Probability. The probability that a precipitation or
runoff event of a specified size will be equaled or exceeded in any
given year.

                                                              Safety Element
Fault. A fault is a fracture in the crust of the earth, along which rocks
on one side have moved relative to rocks on the other side. Most
faults are the result of repeated displacements over a long period of
time. A fault trace is the line on the earth’s surface defining the fault.
Fault Rupture. A crack or breaking of the ground along a fault during
an earthquake.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency
that oversees floodplain management and the national flood
insurance program.
Fire Hazard. A measure of the likelihood of an area burning,
and how it burns (e.g., intensity, speed, embers produced), without
considering modifications such as fuel reduction efforts. Fire hazard
is a way to measure the physical fire behavior so that people can
predict the damage a fire is likely to cause.
Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ). California Public Resources
Code Sections 4201 4204 and California Government Code Section
51175 89 direct CAL FIRE to map areas of significant fire
hazards based on fuels, terrain, weather, and other relevant
factors. These zones, referred to as Fire Hazard Severity Zones
(FHSZ) then define the range of various mitigation strategies that
could be applied to reduce risk associated with wildland fires.
Fire Risk. A measure of the potential for damage a fire can do to
the area under existing conditions, including any modifications
such as defensible space, irrigation and sprinklers, and ignition
resistant building construction.
Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). Fire and
Resource Assessment Program, a branch of the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Fire Threat. Fire threat is a combination of two factors: fire
frequency, or the likelihood of a given area burning, and potential fire
behavior (hazard). These two factors are combined to create four
threat classes ranging from moderate to extreme.
Five Hundred Year Flood. The flood magnitude that has a 0.02
percent chance of occurring in any given year.
Flood Insurance Rate Map. Prepared by FEMA for flood insurance
and floodplain management
purposes.

                                                             Safety Element
Floodplain. Land adjacent to a stream, slough, or river that is subject
to flooding or inundation.
Floodplain Management. The implementation of policies and
programs to protect floodplains and maintain their flood control
function.
Frequency. How often a streamflow of particular magnitude will
occur, expressed as its return period or exceedance probability.
Fuel. Vegetative material, live or dead, which is combustible during
normal summer weather.
Fuel Break. Fuel breaks are wide strips of land on which trees and
vegetation have been permanently reduced or removed. These areas
can slow, and even stop, the spread of a wildland fire because they
provide less fuel to carry the flames. They also provide firefighters
with safe zones to take a stand against a wildfire, or retreat from
flames if the need arises.
Greenbelts. Areas where vegetation is removed around
structures and/or replaced with more fire resistant vegetation.
Groundshaking. The vibration which radiates from the epicenter of
an earthquake.
Holocene Period. The geologic time period including the last 11,000
years. Generally, faults that have experienced activity during this
period are considered to be active.
Lateral Spreading. The horizontal movement or spreading of soil
toward an open face such as a stream bank, the open side of fill
embankments, or the sides of levees.
Level of Protection. The degree of protection that a drainage or
flood control measure provides,
typically expressed as the largest frequency flow event that can occur
without flooding.
Level of Service (LOS). The Level of Service (LOS) rating is a ratio
of successful fire suppression efforts to the total fire starts. It divides
the annual number of small fires extinguished by initial attack by the
total number of fires. Success is defined as those fires that are
controlled before unacceptable damage and cost are incurred. This
is a relative system, attempting to measure the relative impact
of fire on the various assets at risk. The level of service rating (the
score of successes in initial attacks) can be used to compare one
area of the state with another, recognizing that the assets at risk may
be quite different.

Liquefaction. The loss of soil strength due to seismic forces acting
on water-saturated granular soils. This can lead to a “quicksand”
condition, which causes many types of ground failure. Liquefaction
typically occurs in areas underlain by soils containing unconsolidated,
saturated, clay-free sands and silts.
Lurch Cracking. Fractures, cracks, and fissures produced by
groundshaking, settling, compaction of soil, and sliding.
Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) Scale. A 12-point scale of
earthquake intensity based on local effects experienced by people,
structures, and earth materials. Each succeeding step on the scale
describes a progressively greater amount of damage at a given point
of observation. Effects range from those that are detectable only by
seismicity recording instruments (I) to total destruction (XII).
Moment Magnitude (Mw). A logarithmic scale that is used by
modern seismologists to measure the total amount of energy
released by an earthquake. This scale has largely replaced the
Richter Scale as the primary scale for the measurement of
earthquakes because it conveys more precise information to geologic
and structural engineers.
One Hundred Year (100year) Flood. The flood magnitude that has
a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.
Pre-Quaternary Period. The geologic period preceding over 1.6
million years ago, preceding the Quaternary period.
Quaternary Period. The geologic time period including the last 1.6
million years. This period can be further divided into the Early
Quaternary period (between 700,000 and 1.6 million years ago) and
the Late Quaternary period (within the last 700,000 years).
Regulatory Floodplain. Typically refers to the floodplain area that
would be inundated by the 100 year flood event and is designated by
FEMA. It also refers to the floodplain area as determined by a State
or local agency as their floodplain management area.
Return Period. The statistical estimate of number of years (#year)
likely between occurrences of a flood event of equal or greater
magnitude.
Richter Scale. A logarithmic scale developed by Dr. Charles F.
Richter and Dr. Beno Gutenberg to measure earthquake magnitude
(M) by the amount of energy released, as opposed to earthquake
intensity as determined by local effects on people, structures, and
earth materials. Each whole number on the Richter scale represents

a 10-fold increase in amplitude of the waves recorded on a
seismogram and about a 32-fold increase in the amount of energy
released by the earthquake.
Seiche. An earthquake-generated wave within an enclosed or
restricted body of water.
Seismicity. The        geographic     and  historical   distribution  of
earthquakes.
Settlement. The compaction of soils caused by groundshaking.
Shrink/Swell Potential. A soil’s potential to shrink and swell
depending on the amount and types of clay in the soil. Soils with
these properties expand when wet and disproportionately shrink
when dry.
Soil Creep. Soil creep is the imperceptibly slow, steady, downward
movement of slope-forming soil or rock. Movement is caused by
shear stress sufficient to produce permanent deformation, but too
small to produce shear failure. There are generally three types of
creep: (1) seasonal, where movement is within the depth of soil
affected by seasonal changes in soil moisture and soil temperature;
(2) continuous, where shear stress continuously exceeds the strength
of the material; and (3) progressive, where slopes are reaching the
point of failure as other types of mass movements. Creep is indicated
by curved tree trunks, bent fences or retaining walls, tilted poles or
fences, and small soil ripples or ridges.
State Responsibility Areas (SRA). Areas classified by the State
Board of Forestry and Fire Protection as being the primary financial
responsibility of the State for preventing and suppressing fires.
These lands include: lands covered wholly or in part by timber, brush,
undergrowth or grass, whether of commercial value or not; lands that
protect the soil from erosion, retard run off of water, or accelerated
percolation; lands used principally for range or forage purposes;
lands not owned by the Federal government; and lands not
incorporated. Lands are removed from SRA when housing densities
average more than three units per acre over an area of 250 acres.
Subsidence. The sinking of land, usually occurring over broad areas,
which typically results from extraction of groundwater, gas, oil, and
geothermal energy, or hydrocompaction, peat oxidation, and fault
rupture.
Wildland Urban Interface. The wildland–urban interface (WUI) is
commonly described as the zone where structures and other human
development meet and intermingle with undeveloped wildland or
vegetative fuels. Often a WUI is an area extending one half mile

to 1 and one half miles from the boundary of an at risk
community, or an area adjacent to an evacuation route for an at risk
community.
W.A.F.L. Score. A tool that calculates the combination of four
fire plan assessment criteria (weather, assets at risk, fuel, and
level of service) into an aggregate score, which can be used to help
target areas with high fire hazard, and prioritize projects for ground
fuel reduction. Theoretically, those areas with the highest W.A.F.L.
score would have the first priority for funding of any given
project or pre fire program.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The Circulation Element is the guide for the City to provide a
balanced circulation system that addresses existing deficiencies and
provides adequate capacity to support the travel demands of future
development. To achieve this, the Circulation Element establishes
acceptable roadway service levels and identifies improvements
required to maintain the service levels. The Circulation Element
promotes alternative modes of transportation, such as transit,
walking, and bicycling to reduce the demand for transportation
system improvements and to improve air quality. The Circulation
Element contains policies to facilitate the development of more
detailed circulation system implementation programs for the future.
The Circulation Element addresses transportation problems, yet
recognizes solutions for these may be beyond the City’s ability to
remedy. As the Santa Ynez Valley continues to develop, traffic
volumes will increase on Mission Drive (State Route 246) through
Solvang. The solution to this problem involves focus on regional
coordination and a joint planning effort between the City, County of
Santa Barbara, City of Buellton, local service districts, the Santa
Ynez Band of Chumash Indians, Caltrans and the Santa Barbara
County Association of Governments.
The Circulation Element is divided into four sections: (1)
Introduction; (2) Goals, Policies, and Action Items; (3) the Circulation
Plan; and Appendix A – Traffic Analysis.
PURPOSE
The Circulation Element is one of seven required elements of a City
or County’s General Plan. State planning law states that a
Circulation Element shall consist of:
       “…the general location and extent of existing and
       proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes,
       terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all
       correlated with the land use element of the plan.”
                                                      Solvang General Plan 1

                                                      Circulation Element
Since the Circulation Element was first required in 1955,
transportation technology and needs in California have changed
greatly, with the emphasis today on the development of a balanced,
multi-modal transportation system.           The Circulation Element
addresses all facets of circulation including streets and highways,
transportation corridors, public and para-public transit, railroads,
bicycle, pedestrian and parking facilities, and commercial and
general airports. The State’s General Plan Guidelines recommend
that the circulation policies and plans:

HISTORY
The City of Solvang’s Circulation Element was last updated in April
1991. The primary change to the previous plan included removing
the planned Elverhoy Way road extension which would have
extended the terminus of Elverhoy Way across the Duff Mesa to the
terminus of Alamo Pintado Road, south of Mission Drive. This was
in response to the approval of Measure Q which was on the ballot in
June 1990. Seventy-five percent of the Voters supported removing
the Elverhoy Way extension from the General Plan. On September
13, 1993, the City Council gave final approval to eliminate the
roadway extension from the General Plan. There have been no
major changes to the policies and proposals as part of the current
Circulation Element update. The update provides new traffic data
and analysis (Appendix A) and incorporates the Parking Element
into the Circulation Element.
KEY ISSUES
The key issues affecting circulation in Solvang have not changed
significantly since the last Circulation Element update. The primary
deficiencies in the existing circulation system include the following:
                                                      Solvang General Plan 2

                                                        Circulation Element
        Local and regional traffic are forced to use Mission Drive as
         the primary east-west route.
        A lack of alternative east-west routes through the City.
        Significant regional traffic traveling through           the   City
         (approximately 65% of Mission Drive traffic).
        Diversion of local and regional traffic through neighborhoods.
The lack of an alternate to Mission Drive (State Route 246) for an
east-west route through the City is resulting in increasing congestion
on Mission Drive and diversion of traffic through residential
neighborhoods. State Route 246 (Mission Drive) is currently
operating at level of service D to E within the City limits. The
signalized intersections on Mission Drive are operating at LOS C or
better, however upon build-out of the residential and commercial
zones within the City, these intersections would be operating at
unacceptable levels.
In the short term, Mission Drive will continue to serve as the major
access route to the Village area and as a through route for regional
traffic.    The Circulation Element proposes minor intersection
improvements and local east-west connectors that will assist traffic
flows to maintain acceptable intersection operations, with a
complete bypass for the Valley, as the desired long-term solution.
Finally, the volume and speed of traffic on residential streets are key
determinants in the quality of life residents perceive of their
neighborhoods. Therefore the circulation system must not only
facilitate the movement of people and goods and be coordinated
with regional facilities, but also maintain an acceptable quality of life
in residential areas.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
Other General Plan Elements
In accordance with State planning law, the Circulation Element must
be consistent with the other General Plan elements. The Land Use
Element, Housing Element and Circulation Element are directly
related. The Land Use Element specifies the type, density, intensity,
and pattern of development, thus establishing the potential
magnitude and pattern of future vehicle trips. The policies and
circulation plans in the Circulation Element identify the
improvements to the transportation system that will be required in
                                                       Solvang General Plan  3

                                                    Circulation Element
order to service traffic generated by the uses allowed in the Land
Use and Housing Elements. In addition, the Circulation Element
promotes alternative modes of transportation to minimize the
regional impacts of planned local development.
The Noise Element contains policies and plans geared towards
easing the adverse effects of noise on the community that are
directly attributable to the future transportation plans contained in
the Circulation Element.        Exposure to noise will be a key
consideration when locating and designing new developments along
roadways and other transportation related noise sources.
Regional Plans
State Route 246 (Mission Drive) is a regional route that provides the
primary connection between U.S. Highway 101 and State Route 154
through the Santa Ynez Valley. The regional traffic plans that the
City must consider include the Metropolitan Transportation Plan
(formerly the Regional Transportation Plan) and the Congestion
Management Program (CMP). Both plans are administered by the
Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG). The
regionally significant transportation improvements contained in the
Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP) for the Santa Ynez Valley
involve improvements to the Highway 101 interchange in Buellton
and a reconfiguration of the intersection at Routes 154 and 246 to
improve safety. In addition, bikeway system improvements and
minor capacity additions to roadways are proposed.
Unresolved in the MTP is the issue of addressing the potential for
congestion along SR 246 (Mission Drive) associated with increased
traffic growth. The two main proposals for addressing congestion
along SR 246 (Mission Drive) are expansion of the roadway to four
lanes and a bypass route that would extend Santa Rosa Road to
bypass Buellton and Solvang. The Buellton City Council has tabled
consideration of the Santa Rosa bypass until the year 2009. The
bypass project is not included in the County’s General Plan and
more recently it has been removed from the MTP. According to the
MTP, the bypass should be a focus of a corridor wide update and
include the two cities, County, SBCAG, and Caltrans. As such the
Santa Rosa bypass is identified in Section 3 of the Circulation
Element as a Plan Proposal.
The SBCAG Congestion Management Program (CMP) is intended
to address congestion problems on State Highways and principal
arterials in a coordinated manner between transportation and land
use agencies, transit providers and air pollution control districts.
The CMP applies to all incorporated cities and unincorporated areas

in the County of Santa Barbara. In Solvang, both SR 246 (Mission
Drive) and the intersection of Alamo Pintado Road and SR 246 are
part of the CMP network. The City must comply with the following
key components of the CMP:
       The annual monitoring of the designated network of CMP
        intersections and roadways (through the collection of traffic
        counts);
       The application of the CMP impact thresholds in the CEQA
        review process for development projects; and
       The Transportation Demand Management (TDM) element
        aimed at reducing the rate of growth in single occupant
        vehicle usage.
EXISTING TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
The City of Solvang is served by a simple network of roadways and
bikeways. Located inland, access to Solvang is possible via three
primary corridors: U.S. Highway 101 and State Routes 154 and
246. These corridors traverse the County in a north, northwesterly
and westerly orientation, creating a triangular network of roads. This
network connects Solvang to the City of Buellton, communities of
Los Olivos and Santa Ynez, the City of Santa Barbara and points
north and south in the State.
Within the limits of Solvang, all of the roads fall under the jurisdiction
of the City, except Mission Drive which is part of the State Highway
system and under the jurisdiction of Caltrans. Outside of the City, in
the adjacent areas of the Santa Ynez Valley, the roads fall under the
jurisdiction of the County of Santa Barbara and are constructed,
maintained and operated by the County Department of Public
Works. In addition to the City, County, and State which build and
maintain roads in the vicinity of Solvang, the Santa Barbara
Association of Governments is responsible for the long-range
planning of transportation facilities in the Valley.
State Highways
U.S. Highway 101 indirectly serves Solvang. Being one of the
major links connecting facilities between San Francisco and Los
Angeles, this freeway carries a considerable amount of north-south
traffic. Located approximately four miles west of Solvang, Highway
101 is primarily a four-lane freeway within the County of Santa
Barbara. Highway 101 is accessible to Solvang by means of State
                                                       Solvang General Plan 5

Route 246 which intersects Highway 101 in Buellton. The average
daily traffic on Route 101 near State Route 246 is approximately
24,000 vehicles.
State Route 246 is a two-lane route that extends in an east-west
direction beginning at the westerly city limits of Lompoc and moving
easterly through the communities of Lompoc, Buellton, Solvang, and
Santa Ynez terminating at State Route 154. Route 246 is Solvang’s
major access route to U.S. Highway 101. Average daily traffic on
this route near the Solvang Village Area ranges from about 22,600
vehicles on weekends during the summer tourist season to 20,630
on a typical weekday.
State Route 154 constitutes a bypass route of U.S. Highway 101
extending from San Marcos Pass in Santa Barbara to north of Los
Olivos. The route passes through the inland communities of Los
Olivos and Santa Ynez. The average daily traffic along the route
near Solvang is approximately 16,000 vehicles daily north of Route
246 and 9,300 vehicles daily south of Route 246. The route is a
two-lane roadway that extends in northwesterly and southeasterly
directions. It accommodates considerable recreational traffic since it
is the only route providing access to Lake Cachuma. The route
does not directly serve Solvang but meets State Highway 246
approximately 5 miles east of the City.
Key Arterials and Local Streets
A description of the major road segments within Solvang’s Village
area is provided in the following section. The existing street network
is illustrated in Exhibit 1 and the existing average daily traffic
volumes on these roadways are presented on Exhibit 2.
Mission Drive is a two-lane east-west roadway that passes through
the Village Area of the City. It is the only direct east-west route
through the City. Mission Drive is an integral segment of State
Route 246 and is under the jurisdiction of Caltrans. It carries a
considerable amount of traffic passing through the City as well as
traffic going to the Village area. This road carries an average daily
traffic volume of approximately 20,630 vehicles, west of Fifth Street,
17,640 vehicles between Fifth and Alisal Road, and approximately
22,190 vehicles between Pine Street and Alamo Pintado Road. This
road is intended to serve as a secondary type of intercity or
community highway, with an engineering design capacity of up to
1,900 vehicles per peak hour. Caltrans reconstructed Mission Drive
through downtown Solvang (from the western side of the Village to
east of Pine Street), which included installation of a traffic signal at
                                                     Solvang General Plan 6

                                                     Circulation Element
Fifth Street, curb, gutters and sidewalks, a median with a left-turn
lane and designated on-street parking spaces.              The project
improved the flow of traffic along Mission Drive by providing
designated left-turn pockets which eliminate the congestion caused
by left-turning vehicles blocking the through travel lane. Traffic
counts conducted along Mission Drive during May 2007 indicate that
all of the signalized intersections are operating at level of service C
or better on weekday afternoon peak hours. Mission Drive road
segments are operating at level of service D to E.
Fifth Street is a two-lane collector street that provides access to
Mission Drive and the central business district. In general, this
street was observed to carry moderate levels of traffic, estimated to
be approximately 2,220 vehicles per day north of Mission Drive and
3,120 south of Mission Drive.
Atterdag Road provides access to the Village area, to Chalk Hill
Road and Ballard Canyon Road which lead to the communities north
of Solvang. Atterdag is a north-south, two-lane roadway which
carries 3,090 vehicles a day, north of Mission Drive. Being a
collector road and providing access to the heart of the City, Atterdag
Road has relatively heavy volumes of traffic.
Alisal Road is a two-lane road which serves local circulation in the
Village area and is also a major access road for traffic moving north-
south within the City as well as out of the City. This street has dual
classification. North of Mission Drive, Alisal Road is classified as a
major arterial road while south of Mission Drive it is classified as a
secondary arterial. The average daily traffic volume on this road is
about 8,080 vehicles immediately south of Mission Drive, decreasing
steadily as you move south and toward Alisal Ranch. It carries
approximately 2,980 vehicles per day north of Maple Avenue.
Copenhagen Drive is primarily a collector street that serves as the
main route through the downtown area. Copenhagen Drive is a two-
lane street with diagonal and parallel parking at various locations on
either side.
Oak Street is an east-west, two-lane collector street that not only
serves as an access road but also as a bypass route to traffic
avoiding congestion in the Village area. Existing weekday traffic
volumes observed on this street were 3,110 vehicles per day.
Alamo Pintado Road is a major north-south arterial which
intersects Mission Drive at a signalized intersection on the eastern
edge of the City and provides access to the communities north of

Solvang. Alamo Pintado has been fully improved as a four-lane
road south of Village Lane but narrows to a two-lane facility north of
Village Lane. Alamo Pintado crosses Mission Drive and ends at a
dead-end about one block to the south. Existing average daily traffic
volumes on Alamo Pintado between Mission Drive and Viborg Drive
are approximately 12,620 vehicles per day and about 5,990 vehicles
per day north of Viborg Drive.
Viborg Drive is a two-lane residential collector street extending in
an east-west direction between Fredensborg Canyon Road and
Alamo Pintado Road. It provides access to the residential areas in
the northern portion of the City. Traffic volumes are estimated to be
approximately 2,500 vehicles per day.
Fredensborg Canyon Road is a two-lane winding rural facility,
which connects Atterdag Road to Viborg Road as well as providing
access to homes farther to the north in Fredensborg Canyon. Traffic
volumes on Fredensborg Canyon Road are estimated to be less
than 2,500 vehicles per day.
Functional Classification
The functional classification of a roadway is intended to establish its
function or role in the overall circulation system. It establishes the
hierarchy of streets in terms of their purpose in relation to movement
of through traffic versus provision of access to adjacent land uses.
Typically, the hierarchy of roadway classifications ranges from
freeways (with full access control, grade-separated interchanges,
high speed/high volume traffic, etc.) to local streets (with unlimited
access to fronting properties, low speed/low volume traffic, and
emphasis on multi-purpose use of the street for travel, parking,
pedestrian and bicycle activity). The City of Solvang’s functional
classification system ranges from Highway to Local. The City has
adopted roadway design standards to conform to the functional
classification descriptions included in the Circulation Element and
requires that all new facilities be implemented in conformance with
those standards.
Table 1 presents the City’s designated roadway classifications and
functional characteristics.      Exhibit 3 illustrates the functional
classifications by roadway.

Public Transportation
Transit service in Solvang is provided by the Santa Ynez Valley
Transit (SYVT), which is administered by the City of Solvang
through a Memorandum of Understanding with the City of Buellton
and the County of Santa Barbara. SYVT operates two fixed routes
and dial-a-ride services connecting the communities of Buellton,
Solvang, Santa Ynez, Ballard, and Los Olivos. SYVT provides fixed
route service Monday through Saturday, between the hours of 7:00
AM and 6:50 PM and on a dial-a-ride basis. Because the
communities in the Santa Ynez Valley are considerable distances
apart, the Transit provides an important service to those persons
unable to drive, such as the elderly, disabled and young.
Route A connects Buellton, Solvang, Santa Ynez, Ballard, and Los
Olivos. It travels in a clockwise loop from Solvang to Los Olivos.
Service originates at Avenue of Flags and Second Street in Buellton
with 90-minute headways. Route B is identical to Route A, although
it provides a counter clockwise loop. Route B also operates on 90-
minute headways. With Routes A and B, a bus arrives along the
route every 45 minutes. Reservation based dial-a-ride service is
available during fixed route service hours within the Santa Ynez
Valley to seniors age 60 and up and ADA certified persons.
Most of the passengers riding the system to Solvang are destined to
Solvang’s Senior Center, commercial areas, and medical facilities.
The 2006 ridership was approximately 35,620 fixed route
passengers and roughly 4,975 demand response passengers. This
reflects a 9.1% increase in the fixed route ridership and a -1%
decrease in the demand response ridership from 2005. Because
Solvang has a high rate of automobile ownership (94 percent of the
residents have access to one automobile or more), the demand for
transit by the general population is minimal.
In addition to the SYVT service, the Chumash Casino provides bus
service to and from the Casino to Lompoc, Santa Maria, and the
South Coast.
Railroads
There are no railroad facilities within the City of Solvang. AMTRAK
provides daily northbound/southbound connecting bus service with
the Pacific Surfliner, a rail passenger service traveling between San
Diego and Paso Robles.

Air Transportation – Commercial, General and Military
There are no airport facilities within the City of Solvang. The nearby
Santa Ynez Airport accommodates general aviation, a small
commuter service and charter service. There are no plans for major
changes in the type of operations at the airport. The current airport
layout plan calls for the extension of the runway 500 feet to the east
and for construction of additional hangars on the north side of the
runway. Scheduled commercial airline flights are available at the
Santa Barbara Municipal Airport and Santa Maria Airport.
Bicycle and Equestrian Trails
Recreational bicycling is popular in and around Solvang. The
Solvang area presently has a Class I bike path (path that is separate
from automobile traffic) located on the north side of SR 246,
between Alamo Pintado Road and Refugio Road. A Class II on-
street painted bike lane is provided on Alamo Pintado Road,
between SR 246 and Alamo Pintado Avenue, linking the
communities of Solvang, Ballard, and Los Olivos. A short segment
of Class II bike lane is also located on Alisal Road, between Fjord
Drive and Elverhoy Way. Atterdag Road, Chalk Hill Road and SR
246 (Mission Drive), east of U.S. Highway 101 to Alamo Pintado
Road are designated as “Alternate Bike Routes”.
As of this writing, SBCAG is in the process of preparing a
countywide bicycle plan.           As part of the plan, specific
recommendations will be provided for improving bicycle facilities in
Solvang.
There is equestrian usage of the street system due to the ranches
and ranchettes within and to the north and east of the City. The
predominant horse area in the City is the Fredensborg
Canyon/College Canyon area. There is a trail easement along
Adobe Creek, but it is unimproved so horse riders utilize the
shoulder of Fredensborg Canyon Road.
Pedestrian Access
There is a general lack of pedestrian incentives and linkages
throughout the City as a whole. Sidewalks have been provided
throughout most of the Village area to accommodate the high
volume of tourist-related pedestrian traffic in the Village. However,
in many of the residential neighborhoods of the City, streets were
constructed without sidewalks, mainly to preserve the rural character

of the City. There is also the lack of a pedestrian connection from
the industrial area to the west of the Village and east of town.
Parking
There are currently five municipal parking lots within the Village
area. Four of the lots are located south of Mission Drive. The fifth
lot is located north of Mission Drive, near the northeast corner of
Mission Drive and Alisal Road. A portion of this lot is designated for
Recreational Vehicle (RV) parking. There are numerous other
private lots owned and operated by the commercial establishments
in the Village, as well as additional off-street parking spaces at
lodging facilities around the City. Most of the private off-street
parking lots are restricted to employees and customers of the
specific businesses/buildings for which the parking was provided
and are generally signed as such. On-street parking is allowed on
most streets in the Village area. There are no parking meters in the
Village area.

3.0 THE CIRCULATION PLAN
The circulation plan proposed for Solvang has been developed to
provide adequate capacity to accommodate the travel demands of
the Land Use and Housing Elements as well as to preserve the
quality of life in Solvang. The plan is based on the issues, goals,
and action items identified in the previous section.
MAJOR PLAN PROPOSALS
Primary Circulation System
The major focus of the plan is on relieving congestion along Mission
Drive through the Village area, with the ultimate goal of providing
additional east-west connections as an alternative to Mission Drive.
The major plan proposals are reflected on Exhibit 4 and include the
following:
      Extend Maple Avenue east to Pine Street. (Goal 1, Policy 1.2,
       Action Item C)

Public Transportation
The City will continue to support improved transit services for the
elderly and disabled persons. The City will also support
improvement and expansion of the existing transit system as
demand increases. A shuttle service may be implemented if/when
remote parking facilities are provided outside the Village area.
Based on the 2006 North Santa Barbara County Transit Plan
prepared by SBCAG, the following Short-Term Service
Improvements will begin in Fiscal Year 2007/08:
      The City of Lompoc Transit (COLT), in collaboration with
       SYVT, will provide three peak-hour road trip extensions
       between Buellton/Solvang and Lompoc. The extended
       service will add potential connections to the SYVT and
       provide Solvang and Buellton residents with direct transit
       service to Lompoc, VAFB, and Santa Maria. (Goal 2, Policy
       2.1, Action Item A)
      The Transit Plan also recommended that SYVT consider
       adding an earlier morning trip on one route on weekdays in
       order to provide a timed connection to the Valley Express
       morning peak runs. (Goal 2, Policy 2.1, Action Item A)
The second phase of the Short-Term Improvements, beginning in
Fiscal Year 2010/2011 includes:
      Adding a second bus to the morning trip that connects with
       Valley Express. (Goal 2, Policy 2.1, Action Item A)
Bicycle and Equestrian Trails
The City shall continue to encourage bicycle use by expanding the
network of bicycle trails and lanes. Specific measures proposed
include the following:
      Consider the opportunity to incorporate bicycle routes or trails
       into the design of new or expanded roadways. (Goal 3, Policy
       3.1, Action Item B)
      Incorporate an east-west bike route through the Valley with
       connections to the Village area as part of the construction of
       a regional bypass. (Goal 3, Policy 3.1, Action Item B)
                                                     Solvang General Plan D-27

                                                      Circulation Element
      Construct two miles of Class II bike lane on Alisal Road from
       the Santa Ynez River Bridge south to the entrance to the
       Alisal Ranch. (Goal 3, Policy 3.1, Action Item A)
      Construct a Class I bike path/Class II bike lane on the south
       side of SR 246 from Nyborg to the eastern City limit. (Goal 3,
       Policy 3.1, Action Item A)
      Extend the Class II bike lane from Alamo Pintado Road to the
       Alamo Pintado Creek bridge. (Goal 3, Policy 3.1, Action Item
       A)
Pedestrian Access
The City will increase pedestrian accessibility by implementing the
following items:
      Installation of sidewalks and wheelchair ramps along new and
       existing roadways where feasible. (Goal 3, Policy 3.2, Action
       Items B and C)
      Consideration of installing signalized pedestrian crossings in
       the Village area where heavy pedestrian activity occurs.
       (Goal 3, Policy 3.2, Action Item D)
Parking
The parking plan has been developed to provide a supply of parking
adequate to meet the parking demands generated by the buildout of
the Land Use and Housing Elements. The parking plan includes the
following:
      Develop a Parking Management Plan. (Goal 4, Policy 4.2,
       Action Item A)
      Study retaining free on-street parking, including diagonal
       parking in the Village area, as part of developing the Parking
       Management Plan. (Goal 4, Policy 4.2, Action Item A)
      Increase requirements for off-street parking in tourist and
       retail commercial areas to 4.0 spaces per thousand square
       feet of gross floor area and encourage private developers to
       consolidate parking in public parking facilities through the
       payment of in-lieu parking fees or through the establishment
       of a new parking district. (Goal 4, Policy 4.1, Action Item A-D)

      Pursue construction of public parking structures on existing
       municipal lots in the Village area at the appropriate time as
       indicated by the Parking Management Plan. (Goal 4, Policy
       4.1, Action Item B-D)
      Identify sites for additional parking facilities in the Village. At
       a minimum, it is recommended that two additional sites be
       located south of Mission Drive and one north of Mission
       Drive. Potential sites could include Oak Street and 2nd
       Street and Alisal Road near Maple Avenue. (Goal 4, Policy
       4.2, Action Item A)
      Identify sites for remote parking facilities, with particular
       attention given to neighborhood protection policies contained
       in the Land Use and Conservation elements of the General
       Plan. (Goal 4, Policy 4.2, Action Item A)
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
The Implementation Program provides actions to implement the
adopted policies and plans identified in the Circulation Element. The
following actions are proposed:
      Work with appropriate County and State agencies to pursue
       development of alternatives to the widening of Mission Drive
       through the Village area most importantly the southern
       bypass. (Ongoing) (Goal 1, Policy 1.1, Action Item H)
      Continue to work with Caltrans to maximize the capacity of
       existing Mission Drive through Solvang as an interim
       measure until a regional alternative is completed. (Ongoing)
       (Goal 1, Policy 1.1, Action Item G)
      Continue to update on an annual basis the Capital
       Improvement Program to plan for and fund future
       improvements to the circulation system. (Ongoing) (Goal 1,
       Policy 1.3, Action Item A)
      Continue the Congestion Management Program (CMP)
       requirement of monitoring traffic volumes and levels of
       service on Solvang roadways to facilitate the maintenance of
       the minimum levels of service specified in the Circulation
       Element. (Ongoing) (Goal 1, Policy 1.1, Action Item J)
      Develop a signage program that directs visitors to Solvang to
       parking facilities in the tourist commercial area via preferred
                                                        Solvang General Plan D-29

                                                        Circulation Element
        routes so as to minimize their intrusion into residential areas
        and their conflicts with local residential road users. (Ongoing)
        (Goal 1, Policy 1.1, Action Item I)
       Develop a phasing program for the implementation of the new
        roadway facilities shown on Exhibit 4, “Proposed Circulation
        Improvements.” The phasing plan should give highest priority
        to facilities which will provide alternate routes to Mission Drive
        for residents’ use and which improve safety conditions for
        motorists and/or pedestrians or bicyclists. The recommended
        highest priority circulation improvement is the southern
        bypass. (Goal 1, Policy 1.3, Action Item B)
FUNDING
The City’s current budget allocations for streets and roads cover
maintenance and operations of existing facilities (e.g., ongoing
maintenance, street highway power and signalization, street
sweeping), but not the construction of new facilities. Under typical
development conditions, the costs of new roadways are paid for by
developers as part of their project cost. The City imposes a traffic
mitigation fee for off-site road improvements on developments within
the City limits. This fee is assessed on a per-peak-hour-trip
generated basis on new developments and is currently $1,665.00
per peak hour trip. This source of revenue should continue, but
should be updated based on projected costs of planned
improvements.
Many of the improvements included in the Circulation Element will
have citywide benefit and may need to be constructed prior to the
development of the contiguous property. The City has developed
alternate funding mechanisms to pay for the construction of
circulation improvements included in the Circulation Element.
Developed methods include allocation of general fund revenues to a
Capital Improvement Program, implementation of Assessment
Districts to assess all benefiting property owners for infrastructure
improvements and passage of a sales tax for road improvements.
The City and County should work out a mechanism to jointly
evaluate the impacts and cost-sharing of mitigation measures for
new developments since projects in one jurisdiction often have
impacts on the other jurisdiction. The major fiscal limitation affecting
the future circulation system is the potential cost associated with the
southern bypass. Right-of-way acquisition and construction costs
are estimated to be in the range of $32 million to $50 million. The
City has amended its traffic mitigation fee resolution to commit $2.5
million toward construction of the bypass.

APPENDIX A – TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
EXISTING TRANSPORTATION DEFICIENCIES
The primary deficiency in the existing circulation system is the lack
of alternate east-west routes through the City. This deficiency is
compounded by the fact that SR 246 not only serves as the primary
access route for local traffic to/from Solvang, but also as the primary
regional connection between Highway 101 and SR 154. It is
estimated that 65% of the traffic on Mission Drive is through traffic.
With both local and regional traffic forced to utilize SR 246 as their
major access route, Solvang residents are negatively impacted in
two ways: (1) local traffic peaks often coincide with peak tourist-
related/regional traffic, causing residents to endure significant
congestion, and (2) those drivers who seek circuitous alternate
routes must use residential streets to travel between the eastern
portion of the City and the central portion of the City, negatively
impacting neighborhoods.
The concentration of traffic on Mission Drive has resulted in poor
levels of service on this roadway and worsening congestion at the
signalized intersections along Mission Drive, including the
intersections at Fifth, Atterdag, Alisal and Alamo Pintado. The key
north-south routes in the City have also been impacted and it has
become increasingly difficult for residents and visitors alike to turn
onto Mission Drive from unsignalized side streets.
In other areas of the City, capacity deficiencies have not yet
developed, although quality of life issues such as the speed and
volume of traffic have become concerns on some residential streets.
This is particularly true of Viborg Road, Fredensborg Canyon Road
and the northern segment of Alisal Road which serves as an
alternate route between the Village area and the northern sections
of the community. In the Village area, the flow of traffic on Alisal at
Copenhagen is often congested due to heavy volumes of
pedestrians crossing Alisal and tour buses seeking parking behind
the Post Office. Local traffic traveling to/from the southern portions
of the City is also forced to use Alisal, the only through roadway to
the south, which further congests the area during peak hours. There
is also a general lack of incentives for walking and bicycle use
around town, which may result in additional vehicular trips.
Level of Service Analysis
A level of service (LOS) ranking scale was used to identify the
operating condition of the major roadways and intersections in the
                                                     Solvang General Plan A-D-1

    City. This scale identifies impacts of traffic volumes verses roadway
    capacity and assigns a letter value to this relationship. The letter
    scale ranges from A to F with LOS A representing free flow
    conditions and LOS F representing congested conditions. In order
    to determine the signalized intersection levels of service, the
    Intersection Capacity Utilization Methodology (ICU) was used and
    the results are shown as a volume to capacity ratio. For the
    unsignalized intersections the Highway Capacity Software (HCS-
    2000) was used and is based on average seconds of delay per
    vehicle. The level of service criteria is summarized in Table A-1.

The Chumash Casino and hotel, located between the City of
Solvang and the unincorporated Santa Ynez community is a
significant visitor destination, and with over 500 employees, is the
major employer in the valley. As a major trip destination, the
Chumash Casino generates traffic that impacts State Route 246 in
both directions. The Chumash Tribal Council has initiated frequent
bus service from the Casino to Lompoc, Santa Maria, and the South
Coast to provide an alternative means of travel.

FUTURE TRAVEL DEMANDS
New land use development is the key determinant of increased
traffic generation. The proposed Land Use Plan will accommodate
additional development, which in turn will generate increased travel
within the City of Solvang. Further, growth in the Santa Ynez Valley
will generate additional traffic which will increase travel through the
City. Increases in job opportunities in the County’s South coast and
general growth in the Buellton/Santa Ynez areas also contribute to
weekday peak hour traffic volumes. The amount of traffic generated
in Solvang by developments outside the City is directly related to the
number of Solvang residents driving to/from those developments or
non-residents passing through the City to reach them.
In order to determine the future traffic that would be generated at
Build-out of the Land Use Plan, all potential development within the
City was identified and categorized into three groups, including, all
“Vacant and Underutilized Land”, pending “Residential” projects and
pending “Non-residential” projects. Fifty-nine projects/sites were
identified within these categories and include the following land
uses:
       Residential (Estate, Single Family, Multi-family)
       General Office
       Tourist Commercial
The projected development by land use is summarized in Table A-4.
Exhibits A-2 – A-5 illustrate the location of the potential development
parcels for commercial and residential uses.

Based on the pending residential and non-residential project list and
development of the vacant and underutilized sites, 8,548 trips will be
generated by build-out of the General Plan. This is a worst-case
scenario which assumes every parcel within the City develops to the
maximum density allowed in the General Plan and includes
implementation of the Housing Element programs.                               The trip

    1.   Assumes proposed General Plan re-zoning.
    2.   Pass-by trip reduction applied to Tourist Commercial uses.
The most significant increases in potential trip making would be
attributable to the residential development. The additional dwelling
units would generate 4,529 new daily vehicle trip ends, 53% of the
citywide increase. The increase in tourist commercial square
footage would generate an additional 3,795 daily trip ends,
approximately 44% of the citywide increase. The remainder of the
additional new trips generated by the Land Use Plan would be
generated by office uses.
In addition to the trips that would be generated at City build-out,
increases in regional traffic will occur as growth continues in the
entire Santa Ynez Valley. The State Route (SR) 246 Transportation
Concept Report (TCR) prepared by Caltrans in May 2004 evaluates
current and projected conditions along SR 246. Based on this
report, traffic volumes through Solvang are anticipated to grow
1.68% annually between 2001 and 2025. In September 2004,
SBCAG prepared the 2030 Travel Forecast for Santa Barbara
County. According to this report, in the Santa Ynez Valley, traffic on
SR 246 is forecast to increase 63% by 2030, taking into account the
                                                                    Solvang General Plan A-D-8

Chumash Casino expansion and the build-out of land use plans in
Buellton, Solvang, and the Santa Ynez Valley. This represents an
average annual increase of 1.6%. Based on an average annual
increase of 1.6%, by 2030, the level of through traffic on SR 246
could increase from approximately 14,425 average daily trips to
approximately 20,780 daily vehicle trips, a 44% increase from
existing (2007) conditions.

FUTURE TRANSPORTATION DEFICIENCIES
The addition of traffic which could be generated by the land uses
included in the General Plan, combined with increased through
traffic associated with regional growth, would increase traffic
volumes on many streets in Solvang but most significantly on
Mission Drive. By 2030, the volume of traffic on Mission Drive could
increase to as high as 31,000 vehicles per day, without the
construction of an alternate east-west route. This would reach the
engineering capacity of Mission Drive causing significant congestion
at all intersections along SR 246 through Solvang. The existing
circulation system, as is, would not be adequate to support the
growth included in the Land Use Element plus regional growth,
without significant negative impacts (i.e., congestion on Mission
Drive and diversion of traffic to other streets). The future roadway
segment levels of service and intersection levels of service are
presented in Tables A-6 and A-7. Exhibit A-6 illustrates the future
levels of service by location.
It should be noted that a significant portion of the traffic growth on
Mission Drive would be a result of regional traffic through the Valley.
As shown in Table 7, the traffic associated with General Plan Build-
out only (excluding regional traffic) would result in three intersections
operating at LOS D or worse. With the addition of regional through
traffic, three additional intersections would be impacted.

PARKING ANALYSIS
A parking study was completed in May 1987 to determine the
existing parking supply and the on and off-street parking demand in
the Village area. The parking study was updated in July 2007 as
part of the Circulation Element update. The parking study area is
generally bounded by Fifth Street to the west, Elm and Fir Avenue to
the north, Alisal Road to the east and Oak Street to the south. To
facilitate the data collection efforts, the parking area was divided into
17 zones. The parking analysis zones are illustrated in Exhibit A-7.
Within this area there are 1,114 parking spaces. Since 1987, there
has been a 10% increase in the number of on-street parking spaces
and a 50% increase in the number of public parking lot spaces.
The majority of the parking is distributed amongst the blocks and
parking lots south of Mission Drive (76% of total spaces) where
tourist commercial activities are concentrated. The downtown
parking supply is summarized in Table A-8 and discussed in further
detail below.
Municipal Parking Lots
There are currently five municipal parking lots within the Village
area. No private lots or private on-street parking spaces were
counted as part of the Parking Study update. The public parking lots
were financed through benefit assessments on existing properties in
the portion of the Village included in Parking District No. 1, which
was formed under the Solvang Municipal Improvement District Act
prior to incorporation of the City. Four of the lots are located south
of Mission Drive. The fifth lot is located north of Mission Drive, near
the northeast corner of Mission Drive and Alisal Road. A portion of
this lot is designated for Recreational Vehicle (RV) parking. There
are a total of 449 spaces within the public parking lots, comprising
40% of the total public parking spaces.
There are numerous other private lots owned and operated by the
commercial establishments in the Village, as well as additional off-
street parking spaces at lodging facilities around the City. Many
tourists leave their cars parked at their motel and walk around the
Village during the day. Most of the private off-street parking lots are
restricted to employees and customers of the specific
businesses/buildings for which the parking was provided and are
generally signed as such. Enforcement of such restrictions however
is very difficult because store managers generally do not have the
time or ability to keep track of customers parking in their lots and
                                                       Solvang General Plan A-D-18
                                                    Circulation Element
most Solvang visitors walk around the Village shopping area
stopping at numerous shops.
On-Street Parking
In the portion of the Village bounded by Fifth Street, Elm Avenue/Fir
Avenue, Alisal Road and Oak Street, Solvang’s on-street parking
supply consists of 665 spaces. Of these, 399 are parallel parking
spaces and 268 are diagonal or angle parking spaces. On-street
parking is allowed on most streets in the Village area. However on-
street parking has been prohibited along certain sections of Mission
Drive (SR 246). Diagonal parking is provided along much of
Copenhagen Drive, Alisal Road, First Street and Second Street.
The use of diagonal parking increases the supply of on-street
parking although at times it causes some additional traffic
congestion problems when large recreational vehicles park
diagonally, extending into the travel lanes. Six spaces are controlled
by a 15-minute time limit. There are no parking meters in the Village
area.

Existing Parking Demand
Parking counts were collected on Thursday, August 16, 2007 from
9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. It should be noted that the counts were
collected during the Zaca Fire, which began on July 4th, 2007,
approximately 15 miles northeast of Buellton. The fire was 100%
contained by early September. During this time, vehicular access
on SR 154 was limited. While the fire did not appear to affect
tourism in Solvang, the parking demand in the Village area was
unusually low for a typical summer peak season.
On average, 59% of the on-street parking spaces were occupied
during the parking survey. The peak parking demand occurred
between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM when 61% of the on-street spaces
were occupied. The public parking lots had an average parking
occupancy of 45%, with a peak of 49%. The parking demand
observed on-street and in the public parking lots is summarized in
Table A-9. The parking demand for the public parking lots is further
broken down by lot in Table A-10.

 t u r a l d i f f e r e n c e between t h e V i l l a g e Area and the remainder o f t h e c i t y .       r
 This can be accomplished by s e t t i n g f o r t h guidelines t o ensure high qual-
 i t y development which maintains the r u r a l character of areas outside of
 t h e Village.            I n so doing, the c i t y can provide f o r even greater d i s t i n c -
 t i o n between t h e V i l l a g e Area and t h e r e s t of t h e c i t y .
 LANDSCAPE
Lands.caping i s an important aspect o f urban form i n t h a t i t serves t o l i n k

 character o f t h e V i l l a g e Area and r e i n f o r c e i t s image as an " o l d world"
 community. Although 1andscaping i s c u r r e n t l y present i n t h e V i 11age Area
 (eg., s t r e e t trees, flower gardens, etc.), i t has n o t been developed based
on a consistent theme. By e s t a b l i s h i n g a general framework f o r landscap-
i n g i n t h e area, t h e c i t y can p r o j e c t a stronger sense o f i d e n t i t y .
                                                                                                              ?
Outside of t h e V i l l a g e Area,          landscaping consists p r i m a r i l y o f e x i s t i n g

STREETSCAPE
Streetscapes are important image-building components which o f f e r immediate
and l a s t i n g impressions o f Solvang's o v e r a l l character.               This i s o f p a r t i -
c u l a r importance i n r e l a t i o n t o t h e experience o f pedestrians. The pedes-
t r i a n ' s perspective includes t h e width and condition o f sidewalks, t h e
a v a i l a b i l i t y o f amenities such as s t r e e t f u r n i t u r e and d r i n k i n g fountains,
the use o f graphics (eg.,             signage), and t h e nature o f s t r e e t crossings.
Streetscapes are a l s o viewed from the perspective of those i n motor vehi-
cles.         This perspective emphasizes features such as parkways, medians,                               i \
roadway signage, and u t i l it y 1ines.                                                                    L

The City Council has adopted a p o l i c y which requires t h a t i n t h e V i l l a g e
Area, any sidewalk replacement o r a d d i t i o n must be o f b r i c k material.
T h i s w i l l be sure t o enhance t h e image o f t h e V i l l a g e Area.                   B r i c k side-

F u r t h e r improvements a r e necessary t o promote t h i s image.                          A l i s a l Road

LANDMARKS AND FOCAL POINTS
Landmarks and f o c a l p o i n t s a r e prominent n a t u r a l o r man-made features t h a t
a r e e a s i l y recognized.              They are important because they provide p o i n t s of
reference t h a t people can use f o r o r i e n t a t i o n purposes. Also, landmarks
o f t e n symbolize t h e i r place of being i n t h a t they can make a l a s t i n g
impression upon v i s i t o r s t o t h e p o i n t where v i s i t o r s tend t o i d e n t i f y t h e

 As shown on E x h i b i t 4, several such f e a t u r e s a r e found i n Solvang, i n c l u d -
 i n g Mission Santa Ines, Bethania Church, Bf rkholm's Bakery, t h e b l u e wind-
 m i l l on Copenhagen Drive, and t h e windmi 11 east o f A l i s a l Road. These
 s t r u c t u r e s a r e considered as landmarks based on considerations such as
 size, v i s i b i l i t y , c o l o r , and shape.

 Given t h e h i g h q u a l i t y o f Solvang's h i l l s i d e areas, a key consideration i s
t h e need t o s e t f o r t h h i l l s i d e development standards.                           Such standards
would ensure t h a t f u t u r e development a c t i v i t i e s i n h i 1 l s i d e areas would
 n o t r e s u l t i n adverse e f f e c t s upon t h e scenic q u a l i t y o f Solvang.
 From a community design standpoint, open space i s necessary t o provide v i s -

2,2,4        Circulation Pattern
As described i n t h e c i r c u l a t i o n element o f t h e general plan, Mission D r i v e
 (Route 246) i s t h e o n l y d i r e c t east-west r o u t e through t h e c i t y and there-

w e l l as through t r a f f i c .           A key concern addressed i n t h e c i r c u l a t i o n e l e -
ment i s t h e p r o v i s i o n o f a l t e r n a t i v e routes t h a t r e s i d e n t s can use t o
bypass t o u r i s t t r a f f i c i n t h e V i l l a g e Area.
As noted i n t h e previous d i scussi on regarding streetscapes (Secti on
2.2.2),         i t i s important t o recognize considerations regarding b o t h motor
v e h i c l e and p e d e s t r i a n t r a f f ic.   The general p a t t e r n o f v e h i c u l a r c i r c u l a-
t i o n i n Solvang r e s u l t s i n t h e concentration o f t r a f f i c on Mission D r i v e
i n t h e V i 11age Area.            The r e s u l t a n t congestion a t s i g n a l i z e d i n t e r s e c t i o n s
(eg., A l i s a l Road and Alamo Pintado Road) has made i t i n c r e a s i n g l y d i f f i -
c u l t f o r residents and v i s i t o r s t o t u r n onto Mission Drive from unsignal-
i z e d side streets.
With respect t o pedestrian t r a f f i c ,                sidewalks have been provided through-
o u t most o f t h e V i l l a g e Area t o accommodate t h e h i g h volumes of t o u r i s t -
r e l a t e d pedestrian t r a f f i c i n t h e V i l l a g e .    I n o u t l y i n g r e s i d e n t i a l neigh-
borhoods, s t r e e t s were constructed both w i t h and w i t h o u t sidewalks. There
i s generally an o v e r a l l l a c k o f p e d e s t r i a n i n c e n t i v e s throughout t h e c i t y .
The lack o f a convenient pedestrian connection between Old Mission D r i v e
and Pine S t r e e t causes pedestrians bound f o r t h e V i l l a g e and students
bound f o r Solvang School t o have t o walk along t h e side o f p o r t i o n s of
Mission Drive,               an undesirable c o n d i t i o n from a pedestrian s a f e t y perspec-

f o u r t h phases of t h e Mission Oaks p r o j e c t w i l l a s s i s t i n implementing t h i s
pedestrian connection.                     The Mission Oaks p r o j e c t includes a b r i c k path,

The p a t t e r n o f c i r c u l a t i o n i n Solvang influences t h e community's sense of
identity.            This i s p a r t i c u l a r l y t r u e i n t h e V i l l a g e Area where excessive
automobile t r a f f i c could diminish t h e o l d world charm o f t h e Village.                      It

theme.         T h i s theme suggests t h e character and f e e l i n g o f a small Danish

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND SETTING
1.1     PURPOSE
The purpose of the Land Use Element is to provide for balanced
development that is responsive to the City’s unique opportunities
and constraints and that respects the values of the community.
The Land Use Element is a tool with which to maintain and
enhance the unique character of the Village Area, the City's
economic health, and the community's desirability as a
residential and recreational area.
1.2     STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
Government code section 65300.5 requires that all elements of
the general plan be consistent with one another. Section
65302(a) states the requirements of the land use element and
discusses that the land use element should address the
distribution of land uses, the location of public facilities, and
identification of areas subject to flooding.
1.3     HISTORICAL SETTING
Prior to the presence of European settlers, the Santa Ynez
Valley area was inhabited primarily by the Chumash tribe of
Native Americans. In 1804, Franciscan missionaries established
Mission Santa lnes within the area now encompassed by
Solvang. During the "Mission Period" of 1804-1850, the area was
dominated by three Mexican ranchos: Rancho Nojoqui, San
Carlos de Jonata, and Rancho Canada de los Pinos. During the
late 1800’s, the westward migration of settlers resulted in the
Alamo Pintado Valley becoming the center of the first
homesteads in the Santa Ynez Valley.
In 1911, the colony of Solvang was established with the
purchase of 9,000 acres in the Santa Ynez Valley by Professor
P.P. Hornsyld, Reverend Benedict Nordentoft, and Reverend
J.M. Gregorson. The community grew rapidly as the Danish
settlers sought to integrate as much as possible into the
                                                  Solvang General Plan 2

                                                     Land Use Element
American environment. Over the ensuing years, Solvang
became the site of an annual "Danish Days" festival in which
Santa Ynez Valley residents gathered to celebrate their
Scandinavian heritage.
Immediately after World War II, Ferd Sorensen's construction of
Danish-style buildings in the Village Area fostered the
transformation of Solvang into a Danish-style community.
Following coverage of the 1947 "Danish Days" festival by the
Saturday Evening Post, an influx of weekend visitors encouraged
the development of Solvang as a tourist destination.
1.4    EXISTING CONDITIONS
The City of Solvang has a well-established identity as an
authentic Danish community and relies heavily upon tourism as
its key economic strength. The majority of the land within City
boundaries has been developed. The bulk of its land is zoned for
residential use. The last of the large vacant residentially zoned
areas were Skytt and Duff Mesas. Duff Mesa has been
developed and Skytt Mesa is currently being developed. Solvang
is separated from neighboring communities by a greenbelt of
agricultural and open space areas.
The Santa Ynez River and Alamo Pintado Creek are sources of
flooding concern for the City of Solvang. Alisal Creek and Adobe
Creek are also potential flood hazards. The flood hazards posed
by the creeks and river are discussed in the Safety Element of
Solvang’s General Plan.
Table 1, Existing Land Use, shows the current distribution of
Solvang’s land uses. Table 2, Land Use Build-out Potential,
shows the number of dwelling units at buildout.

        Baseline residential square footage based on 2005 Growth Management Allocation numbers
     provided in Planning Commission Staff Report dated January 3, 2005. Certificate of Occupancy data
     at the City Planning Department was used to get the number of residential units constructed in 2005
     and 2006.
     2
       Pending development was taken from City building permit issued records and from the Planning
     Commission/City Council Agendas from 2005 till May 2007. Note that 169 units in the Pending
     Category are from the Skytt/Solvang Mesa Development; 9 units are from the Solvang Lutheran Home
     and 8 units are from the Mission Meadows Mixed Use Project.
     3
       Development potential was taken from the Updated Housing Element Table “Estimate of Vacant and
     Under-Utilized Land and Residential Capacity”. Note that the development potential number is less
     than what is in the Housing Element table since some of the properties have pending development on
     them and are accounted for in the Pending Development Category. Note that the Housing Element’s
     33 residential secondary unit projection is included in this total. There may be more residential
     development potential in the City if any existing properties were to be subdivided or if any non-
     residential properties decide to incorporate a mixed-use development. Expected development
     potential under these scenarios is expected to be fairly minimal. Also note the development potential
     numbers do not take into account zoning regulations and site constraints, which may further impact the
     development potential of these properties.
     4
       Baseline non-residential square footage based on 2005 Growth Management Allocation numbers
     provided in Planning Commission Staff Report dated January 3, 2005. There was no additional non-
     residential growth in 2005 and 2006.
     5
       Note that 37,172 sq.ft. is from the Solvang Lutheran Home development; 17,963 sq.ft. is from the
     Alisal Mission; 12,656 sq.ft. is from Mission Meadows Mixed Use Development; and 8,665 is from the
     SYV Cottage Hospital Expansion.
     6
       In the Land Use Element, the allowable development intensity is listed per each land use category.
     For example, Retail Commercial assumes a development intensity of 10,000 feet of gross floor area
     per acre. Given the Housing Element’s inventory of potential vacant and under utilitized sites,
     commercial development potential was calculated using the applicable nonresidential land use
     category and multiplied that by the size of the lot. There is the potential for more development
     potential on other existing sites but it is expected to be very minimal. Also note the development
     potential numbers do not take into account zoning regulations and site constraints, which may further
     impact the development potential of these properties.
                                                                                 Solvang General Plan       5

1.5    POPULATION AND DWELLINGS
According to the United States Census Bureau's 2000 Census
data, there were 5,332 people residing in the City of Solvang.
The majority of Solvang’s land is used for housing their
residents, (Table 1). The bulk of the City’s residential land is in
the Low Density and Medium Density Land Use categories,
(Table 1). There were approximately 2,076 dwelling units as of
2006. There are approximately 210 units pending development
and 322 potential units to be developed for a total of 532
additional units. A total of 2,608 dwelling units are estimated at
build-out. Each dwelling unit houses an average of 2.37 people
according to the 2000 U.S. Census. The estimated population at
build-out is 6,181 people.
1.6    COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LAND
The Village Area is the heart of Solvang’s commercially zoned
land. The Village Area is the main attractor of the tourists which
help to drive the City’s economy. Existing tourist commercial land
is approximately 60.4 acres. Other commercial and office uses
total approximately 86.1 acres. The City has approximately 7.1
acres of light industrially zoned land.
1.7    PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES
The City of Solvang provides water and wastewater services.
Public safety services are provided through a contract with the
County of Santa Barbara’s Fire and Sheriff’s Departments. Other
services are provided through contractual agreements with
surrounding jurisdictions and private agencies. The City’s solid
waste is taken to the Tajiguas Landfill. No new solid waste sites
are planned within the City at this time. The Parks and
Recreation Element discusses City facilities that are available for
use including Hans Christian Andersen Park, Solvang Park, and
the Veteran’s Memorial building.

2.0 DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARIES
2.1    CITY LIMITS AND SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
The City of Solvang is located in the Santa Ynez Valley in the
central part of Santa Barbara County. Solvang is surrounded by
the Purisima Hills to the north, the upper Santa Ynez Valley to
the east, the Santa Ynez Mountains to the south, and the lower
Santa Ynez Valley to the west. Solvang is situated primarily
along an alluvial plain formed by the Santa Ynez River and on
the southeastern edge of the Purisima Hills. It is located almost
equidistant between the communities of Buellton and Santa
Ynez. State Route 246 bisects Solvang and provides a key
regional east-west link between U.S. Highway 101 and State
Route 154.
The City limit is the existing boundary of the City, while the
sphere of influence is the probable future boundary of the City.
The sphere of is “a plan for the probable physical boundaries and
service area of a local government agency." Solvang’s City limits
and Sphere of Influence boundary are shown in Figure 1.
2.2    PLANNING IMPACT AREA
Existing land use in the area surrounding the City consists
primarily of open space, agricultural and ranch uses. This area
includes the undeveloped areas of the Purisima Hills, agricultural
land uses, the Santa Ynez River, and the Santa Ynez Mountains
flanking the southern portion of the City. These lands are the
“planning impact area” potentially affecting Solvang.
Coordination of land use planning between the County of Santa
Barbara, the City of Buellton, and the Santa Ynez Band of
Chumash Indians would be beneficial for the City. For example,
the establishment of a Greenbelt agreement between the City
and the County could be an important step in coordinating the
planning activities of these agencies.

2.3    CHANGES FROM THE PREVIOUS GENERAL
       PLAN MAP
The only major change to the General Plan Land Use Map is the
change in land use category designation of 7.26 acres of Tourist
Commercial, Professional Office, and Medium Density
Residential land to High Density Residential land use due to the
requirement to meet Solvang’s fair share of regional housing
needs. This change was enacted as part of the update to the
Housing Element in 2007. The updated Land Use Map is shown
in Figure 2.

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND SETTING
1.1     PURPOSE
The Noise Element of a General Plan is a comprehensive
program for including noise control in the planning process. It is a
tool for local planners to use in achieving and maintaining land
uses that are compatible with environmental noise levels. The
Noise Element identifies noise sensitive land uses and noise
sources, and defines areas of noise impact for the purpose of
developing and implementing programs to ensure that Solvang
residents will be protected from excessive noise intrusion.
1.2     STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
The State of California has mandated that each county and city
prepare a Noise Element as part of its General Plan. The Noise
Element follows guidelines in Section 65302(f) of the State
Government Code and Section 46050.1 of the Health and Safety
Code. Section 65302(f) of the State Government Code requires
the following:
    1) A noise element that shall identify and appraise noise
        problems in the community. The noise element shall
        recognize the guidelines established by the Office of
        Noise Control and shall analyze and quantify, to the extent
        practicable, as determined by the legislative body, current
        and projected noise levels for all of the following sources:
           A. Highways and freeways.
           B. Primary arterials and major local streets.
           C. Passenger and freight online railroad operations
               and ground rapid transit systems.
           D. Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop,
               and military airport operations, aircraft overflights,
               jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities
               and maintenance functions related to airport
               operation.
           E. Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to,
               railroad classification yards.
                                                       Solvang General Plan 1
                                                               Noise Element
             F. Other ground stationary noise sources including,
                but not limited to, military installations, contributing
                to the community noise environment.
    2) Noise contours shall be shown for all of the sources and
         stated in terms of community noise equivalent level
         (CNEL) or day-night average level (Ldn). The noise
         contours shall be prepared on the basis of noise
         monitoring or following generally accepted noise modeling
         techniques for the various sources identified in
         paragraphs (1) to (6), inclusive.
    3) The noise contours shall be used as a guide for
         establishing a pattern of land uses in the land use element
         that minimizes the exposure of community residents to
         excessive noise.
    4) The Noise Element shall include implementation
         measures and possible solutions that address existing
         and foreseeable noise problems, if any. The adopted
         noise element shall serve as a guideline for compliance
         with the state’s noise insulation standards.
The State Guidelines for Preparation and Content of Noise
Elements of the General Plan indicates that the Noise Element
should present the noise environment in terms of noise contours
and, for those areas identified as containing noise sensitive
facilities, the noise environment should be determined by
monitoring.
1.3      FUNDAMENTALS OF SOUND AND
         ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE
1.3.1 FUNDAMENTALS OF SOUND
Sound is technically described in terms of the loudness
(amplitude) of the sound and frequency (pitch) of the sound. The
standard unit of measurement of the loudness of sound is the
decibel (dB). Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to
sound at all frequencies, a special frequency-dependent rating
scale has been devised to relate noise to human sensitivity. The
A-weighted decibel scale (dBA) performs this compensation by
discriminating against frequencies in a manner approximating the
sensitivity of the human ear.
Decibels are based on the logarithmic scale. The logarithmic
scale compresses the wide range in sound pressure levels to a
more usable range of numbers in a manner similar to the Richter
                                                         Solvang General Plan 2

                                                           Noise Element
scale used to measure earthquakes. In terms of human response
to noise, a sound 10 dBA higher than another is judged to be
twice as loud; and 20 dBA higher four times as loud; and so
forth. Everyday sounds normally range from 30 dB (very quiet) to
100 dB (very loud). Examples of various sound levels in different
environments are shown in Figure 1.
1.3.2 DEFINITION AND IMPACTS OF NOISE
Noise has been defined as unwanted sound and it is known to
have several adverse effects on people. From these known
effects of noise, criteria have been established to help protect the
public health and safety and prevent disruption of certain human
activities. These criteria are based on such known impacts of
noise on people as hearing loss, speech interference, sleep
interference, physiological responses and annoyance. Each of
these potential noise impacts on people are briefly discussed
below:
        Hearing Loss is not a major noise concern because the
        potential for noise induced hearing loss is more commonly
        associated with occupational noise exposures in heavy
        industry or very noisy work environments. Noise levels in
        neighborhoods, even in very noisy airport environs, are
        not sufficiently loud to cause hearing loss.
        Speech Interference is one of the primary noise
        concerns. Normal conversational speech is in the range of
        60 to 65 dBA, and any noise in this range or louder may
        interfere with speech.
        Sleep Interference is a major noise concern because
        sleep is the most noise sensitive human activity. Sleep
        disturbance studies have identified interior noise levels
        that have the potential to cause sleep disturbance. Sleep
        disturbance does not necessarily mean awakening from
        sleep, but can refer to altering the pattern and stages of
        sleep.

        Physiological Responses are those measurable effects
        of noise on people which are realized as changes in pulse
        rate, blood pressure, etc. While such effects can be
        induced and observed, the extent to which these
        physiological responses cause harm or are signs of harm
        is not known.
        Annoyance is the most difficult of all noise responses to
        describe. Annoyance is a very individual characteristic
        and can vary widely from person to person. What one
        person considers tolerable can be quite unbearable to
        another of equal hearing capacity.
1.3.3 NOISE METRICS
Community noise is generally not a steady state and varies with
time. Under conditions of non-steady state noise, some type of
statistical metric is necessary in order to quantify noise exposure
over a long period of time. Several rating scales have been
developed for describing the effects of noise on people. They are
designed to account for the above known effects of noise on
people.
Based on these effects, the observation has been made that the
potential for noise to impact people is dependent on the total
acoustical energy content of the noise. A number of noise scales
have been developed to account for this observation. These
scales are: the Equivalent Noise Level (Leq), the Day Night
Noise Level (LDN), and the Community Noise Equivalent Level
(CNEL). These scales are described in the following paragraphs.
        Leq is the sound level corresponding to a steady-state
        sound level containing the same total energy as a time-
        varying signal over a given sample period. Leq is the
        “energy” average noise level during the time period of the
        sample. Leq can be measured for any time period, but is
        typically measures for 15 minutes, 1 hour, or 24 hours.
        Ldn is a 24-hour, time-weighted annual average noise
        level. Time-weighted refers to the fact that noise which
        occurs during certain sensitive time periods is penalized
        for occurring at these times. In the Ldn scale, those
        events that take place during the night (10pm to 7am) are
        penalized by 10 dB. This penalty was selected to attempt
                                                      Solvang General Plan 5

                                                          Noise Element
       to account for increased human sensitivity to noise during
       the night, when most people sleep.
       CNEL is similar to the Ldn scale, except that it includes an
       additional 5 dBA penalty for events that occur during the
       evening (7pm to 10pm). Either Ldn or CNEL may be used
       to identify community noise impacts within the Noise
       Element.
1.4 NOISE STANDARDS,                    GUIDELINES,           AND
REGULATIONS
The public’s reaction to different noise levels varies from
community to community. Extensive research has been
conducted on human responses to exposure to different levels of
noise.
Intermittent or occasional noise such as that associated with
stationary noise sources is not of sufficient volume to exceed
community noise standards that are based on a time averaged
scale such as the Ldn scale. To account for intermittent noise,
another method to characterize noise is the Percent Noise Level
(L%). L% is the level exceeded a certain percentage of the time
during the measurement period. Examples of various noise
environments in terms of L% are shown in Figure 2.
Noise Ordinances typically utilize L%. Noise Ordinances are
designed to protect people from non-transportation related noise
sources such as music, machinery, and vehicular traffic on
private property. Noise Ordinances do not apply to motor vehicle
noise on public or other transportation-related noise sources that
are preempted by the State or Federal government.
1.4.1 NOISE/LAND USE COMPATIBILITY GUIDELINES
This section presents information on various guidelines and
standards relating to the compatibility of various land uses with
environmental noise. It is from these guidelines and standards
that the City of Solvang Noise Criteria and Standards have been
developed. Noise/Land Use guidelines have been produced by a
number of Federal and State agencies including the Federal
Highway Administration (FHA), the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), the American National Standards Institute,

and the State of California. These guidelines, presented in the
following paragraphs, are all based on cumulative noise criteria
such as Leq, Ldn, or CNEL.
The EPA, in March 1974, published a document entitled
“Information on Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to
Protect Public Health and Welfare With an Adequate Margin of
Safety" (EPA 550/9-74-004). Table 1 shows requisite noise
levels for various land uses from this document. In this table, 55
Ldn is described as the requisite level with an adequate margin
of safety for areas with outdoor uses including residences and
recreational areas. The EPA "levels document" does not
constitute a standard, specification or regulation, but identifies
safe levels of environmental noise exposure without
consideration for economic cost for achieving these levels.
The FHWA has adopted and published noise abatement criteria
for highway construction projects. The noise abatement criteria
specified by the FHWA are presented in Table 2 in terms of the
maximum one hour Leq. The FHWA noise abatement criteria
basically establish an exterior noise goal for residential land uses
of 67 Leq and an interior goal for residences of 52 Leq. The
noise abatement criteria applies to private yard areas and
assumes that typical wood frame homes with windows open
provide 10 dB noise reduction (outdoor to indoor) and 20 dB
noise reduction with windows closed.
The State of California requires each City and County to adopt
Noise Elements as part of their General Plans. Such Noise
Elements must contain a Noise/Land Use compatibility matrix. A
recommended (but not mandatory) matrix is presented in the
"Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of Noise Elements of
the General Plan," (Office of Noise Control, California
Department of Health, 2003. Figure 3 presents this
recommended matrix.

a. Since different types of activities appear to be associated with different levels, identification of a maximum
   level for activity interference may be difficult except in those circumstances where speech communication is
   a critical activity. (See Figure D-2 for noise levels as a function of distance which allow satisfactory
   communication.)
b. Based on lowest level.
c. Based only on hearing loss.
d. An Leq(8) of 75 dB may be identified in these situations so long as the exposure over the remaining 16 hours
   per day is low enough to result in a negligible contribution to the 24-hour average, i.e., no greater than an
   Leq of 60 dB.
Note: Explanation of identified level for hearing loss: The exposure period which results in hearing loss at the
   identified level is a period of 40 years.

This Noise Element utilizes the State guidelines shown in Figure
3 as the basis for its Noise/Land Use Compatibility Matrix, shown
in Table 3. In addition, the criteria shown in Table 3 were the
basis for development of the City’s Interior and Exterior Noise
Standards, shown in Table 4. The standards shown in Table 4
represent City policies related to land uses and acceptable noise
levels. These tables are the primary tools which allow the City to
ensure integrated planning for land use compatibility that
considers outdoor noise. In addition, Title 24 of the California
Health and Safety Code establishes an interior noise standard of
45 dBA CNEL for multiple residential unit and hotel/motel
structures, as reflected in footnote 4 of Table 4.

Noise levels in Solvang are also regulated through the Solvang
Municipal Code (SMC). Section 6-2-7 of the SMC prohibits “loud
and unreasonable” noise during the following times:
    1. The night and following morning of any Sunday, Monday,
       Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday between the hours of
       ten o’clock (10:00) P.M. of such day and seven o’clock
       (7:00) A.M. the following morning; or
    2. The morning hours after twelve o’clock (12:00) midnight of
       any Friday or Saturday, between twelve o’clock (12:00)
       midnight, following such day, and seven o’clock (7:00)
       A.M. the following morning.
Section 6-2-7 of the SMC states that “…a loud and unreasonable
sound shall include any sound created by means prohibited
above which is clearly discernible at a distance of one hundred
feet (100’) from the property line of the property upon which it is
broadcast or which is at any level of sound in excess of sixty (60)
decibels at the edge of the property line of the property upon
which the sound is broadcast…”. The City of Solvang does not
have specific standards for noise and vibration associated with
temporary construction activities other than the prohibitions on
“loud and unreasonable” noise from Section 6-2-7 of the SMC
discussed above.
Section 11-12-21 of the SMC limits hours of construction to
seven thirty o'clock (7:30) A.M. to five thirty o'clock (5:30) P.M.
on weekdays, and does not allow construction on Saturday,
Sunday, state or national holidays except as approved in writing
by the public works director, or his designee, or in the case of an
emergency for the immediate preservation of life, health, or
property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an individual property
owner or tenant solely (not including any volunteer or paid
construction crew) in addition to the above permissible hours of
construction may also construct, repair, or remodel his or her real
property or any structure on such property, pursuant to obtaining
the required permits, during the hours of five thirty o'clock (5:30)
P.M. to eight o'clock (8:00) P.M. on weekdays and eight o'clock
(8:00) A.M. to eight o'clock (8:00) P.M. on Saturday, Sunday and
national legal holidays. All noise or sounds associated with the
construction, gardening and/or maintenance activities of said
property shall not create any inconvenience or annoyance to the
general public beyond the boundary lines of the property.

2.0 NOISE ENVIRONMENT/ISSUE
       ANALYSIS
2.1    EXISTING NOISE ENVIRONMENT
This section contains a detailed description of the existing noise
environment in Solvang. The location of existing noise sources
and noise-sensitive receptors was determined in consultation
with the City and through analysis of the City’s current Noise and
Circulation Elements. A community noise survey was then
conducted, and the results of the survey were compared to and
used to calibrate the results of computer noise modeling of traffic
noise based on existing traffic volumes from the City’s 2008
Circulation Element. The results of the computer noise model
were then used to produce existing noise contour maps of the
community.
Approximately 927 acres of Solvang’s 1,368 acres is residential,
according to Table 1 of the City’s 2008 Land Use Element, and
residential uses are considered the most noise-sensitive. Other
noise-sensitive land uses include schools, hospitals, libraries,
and parks. In some ways the tourist/commercial area is also
considered noise-sensitive. Typical commercial areas are
considered relatively insensitive to noise. However, the tourist
recreation/commercial area in downtown Solvang has attempted
to establish a peaceful, "old world" atmosphere. Tourists spend a
considerable amount of time outdoors either window shopping or
eating at the many outdoor restaurant areas. In addition, this
area contains a number of hotels and motels. Therefore,
downtown Solvang is more sensitive to noise than other
commercial areas. Maintenance of a relatively quiet ambience is
important to maintaining the overall atmosphere of the area.
The predominant noise source in Solvang, as in most
communities, is motor vehicles. Several major arterial roadways
pass through the City. The main roadway of concern is State
Highway 246 (Mission Drive), with Alisal, Atterdag, and Alamo
Pintado Roads also carrying significant traffic volumes. The only
other major source of noise within the City is the batch plant (and
                                                     Solvang General Plan 15

adjacent sand and gravel facility outside City limits) at the west
end of town on the south side of Highway 246.
Other noise sources in Solvang include aircraft overflights, air
conditioning units and other mechanical equipment on buildings,
landscaping equipment, and human speech. None of these
sources significantly contribute to overall noise levels when
compared to traffic noise. The closest airport to Solvang is Santa
Ynez Valley Airport, located approximately 2.25 miles east of
Solvang’s eastern city limits.
2.1.1 COMMUNITY NOISE SURVEY
Identification of major noise sources and noise-sensitive
receptors in the community through discussions with City staff
and review of the City’s existing 1987 Noise Element provided
the initial basis for development of the community noise survey.
Nine sites were selected for measurement of Solvang’s existing
noise environment. The measurement locations were selected
on the basis of proximity to major noise sources, noise sensitivity
of nearby land uses, and obtaining a representative sample of
different noise environments throughout the community. The
results from the community noise survey were used to determine
existing noise levels at noise-sensitive receptors; provide
empirical data for the correlation and calibration of the computer-
modeled noise environment; and obtain an accurate description
of ambient noise levels in various locations throughout the City.
The community noise survey was conducted on Saturday,
October 27th and Monday, November 5th, 2012. The first eight
measurements were taken during on a Saturday between
approximately 10 AM and 4 PM in order to capture weekend
peak hour traffic noise, and the ninth measurement was taken at
approximately 11:15 AM on a Monday near the batch plant and
sand and gravel facility in order to capture noise during
operations. The measurement locations and results are depicted
in Figure 4. Further detail regarding the procedures and
methodology used in the community noise survey are provided in

2.1.2 EXISTING NOISE LEVELS
As shown in Figure 4, eight 20-minute noise measurements were
taken on Saturday, October 27, 2012 using an ANSI Type II
integrating sound level meter. The new noise measurements
were taken in approximately the same locations as the noise
measurements taken for the 1987 Noise Element in order to
facilitate comparison of the change in noise that has occurred
since that time. These noise measurements were taken between
approximately 10:15 AM and 4:30 PM in order to capture noise
during the weekend midday time period which, according to the
City’s current Circulation Element, is the peak period for traffic on
Solvang’s roadways. One additional 20-minute noise
measurement was taken using the same noise meter in the
vicinity of the batch plant and sand and gravel facility at
approximately 11:10 AM on Monday, November 5, 2012, in order
to record noise levels at this location during operations. These
noise measurements provide actual on-the-ground existing
sound levels within Solvang and were used to calibrate the
FHWA noise model. Table 5 identifies the noise measurement
locations and measured noise levels.
The results of these noise measurements support the conclusion
that Highway 246 and the City’s major local roadways continue
to be the main noise sources in the community. The two highest
noise readings (#3 and #5) were taken along Highway 246, and
the next two highest (#4 and #8) were taken along Atterdag
Road in front of Solvang School and along Alisal Road adjacent
to the golf course. The other four readings recorded noise levels
below 55 Leq dBA. Noise from the batch plant and sand and
gravel facility was 52.8 Leq dBA at 100 feet from the facility,
immediately adjacent to existing residential land uses along Via
Reposa Road. Typical daily operations at the facility were
occurring at the time of the noise measurement, including
machinery operation and vehicle trips. This measurement
indicates that operational noise does not expose nearby
receptors to noise levels in excess of the City’s exterior noise
standard for residential uses of 60 dBA CNEL shown in Table 4
in Section 1.4.2.

2.1.3 NOISE-SENSITIVE RECEPTORS
Noise exposure goals for various types of land uses reflect the
varying noise sensitivities associated with each use. Noise-
sensitive land uses include residences, schools, hospitals, long
term medical or mental care facilities, and libraries. The most
common noise-sensitive land use in Solvang is residential
development, which occupies most of the city’s land area and is
considered especially noise-sensitive because (1) considerable
time is spent by individuals at home; (2) significant activities
occur outdoors; and (3) sleep disturbance is most likely to occur
in a residential area. Solvang also has a number of public and
private educational facilities, churches, and hospitals that are
considered noise sensitive. As shown on Figure 4, these
sensitive receptors are located throughout the community, in
areas ranging from quiet residential settings to areas along major
arterial roadways.
                                                                         Solvang General Plan  19

                                                          Noise Element
The tourist recreation/commercial area may in some ways also
be considered noise sensitive. Typical commercial areas are
considered relatively insensitive to noise. However, the tourist
recreation/commercial area in downtown Solvang has attempted
to establish a peaceful, "old world" atmosphere. Tourist spend a
considerable amount of time outdoors either window shopping or
eating at the many outdoor restaurant areas. Therefore, this area
is more sensitive to noise than other commercial areas.
The only public school within Solvang is Solvang Elementary and
Middle School, the main campus of which is located on the west
side of Atterdag Road between Laurel Avenue and Elm Avenue,
with an “upper campus” located diagonally across Atterdag Road
from the main campus. Private schools within Solvang include
the Family Partnership Charter School, which has various
locations on Alisal Road, but outside downtown, and the Santa
Ynez Valley Christian Academy, which is housed in the Trinity
Baptist Church on Laurel Avenue just west of Alisal Road. These
private schools do not have traditional campuses, are not
generally on high-volume, high-noise-level roadways, and are
thus not considered noise-sensitive receptors for the purposes of
this Noise Element.
The only hospital in Solvang is Santa Ynez Valley Cottage
Hospital, which is located on Viborg Road east of Alamo Pintado
Road. Other long term medical or mental care facilities in
Solvang include those associated with Atterdag Village of
Solvang, which is located just north of the upper campus of
Solvang Elementary School, and which provides assisted living
and skilled nursing and rehabilitation services. The Solvang
library is located on Mission Drive (Highway 246) across from
Mission Santa Ynez.
The location of these noise-sensitive receptors within the Plan
Area (except for the private schools, which, for the reasons
mentioned above, are not considered noise-sensitive receptors
for the purposes of this Noise Element) is shown on Figure 4.
The location of noise-sensitive residential receptors is not shown
on Figure 4 because residential neighborhoods are located
throughout Solvang. For example, residences are located in
relatively close proximity to roadways with high traffic volume in
areas near Mission Drive outside the downtown (such as near
Pine Street, or along the parts of Vester Sted or Via Reposa
closest to Mission Drive); along Alisal Road south of Elverhoy

2.1.4 EXISTING NOISE MODELING
Existing roadway noise levels were quantified using the Federal
Highway Administration Traffic Noise Model (TNM®), based on
average daily traffic (ADT) data obtained from Table A-2 of
Appendix A of the City’s 2008 General Plan Circulation Element
for 2007 conditions. The TNM Model noise level estimates are
based on traffic volume, vehicle mix, and vehicle speed to
estimate roadway noise levels in Leq (dBA). Table 6 translates
these Leq levels into CNEL levels to express distances to noise
contours, with peak hour Leq assumed to approximate CNEL,
per HUD regulations (24 CFR See 51.106(a)(1) and
51.106(a)(2)). An attenuation rate of 4.5 dBA per doubling of
distance was used, to account for the fact that the modeled
roadways are relatively lightly travelled and/or surrounded by soft
terrain and intervening structures. Roadway noise level
estimates do not account for intervening barriers or topography
that may shield individual receptors from the noise source.
Therefore, the levels that are presented in this section represent
a reasonable, conservative worst-case estimate of noise levels.
Also, this data is for the purpose of creating noise contours, and
does not represent a specific estimate of sound levels at any
particular site. For further detail regarding the noise modeling
procedures and methodology used to model roadway noise

 The closest field reading was taken on Alisal Road north of Laurel Avenue, and recorded an Leq of 50.2 dBA at a
distance of approximately 50 feet from centerline.

2.1.5 EXISTING NOISE CONTOURS
The results of the noise modeling are shown in Figure 5, which is
an updated map of existing traffic noise contours along the
roadways that are the major source of noise in the community.
Noise contours represent lines of equal noise exposure, just as
the contour lines on a topographic map represent lines of equal
elevation. As shown in Figure 5, existing peak noise levels along
Highway 246 (Mission Drive) are higher than in 1987 (1987 noise
levels are shown in Exhibit 10 of the 1987 Noise Element), with
noise levels now at or slightly above 70 dBA immediately
adjacent to Mission Drive west of Fifth Street and east of Alisal
Road, and exceeding 65 dBA through the downtown between
these segments. Noise levels also exceed 65 dBA along Alisal
Road from Mission Drive to Elverhoy Way and Alamo Pintado
Road north of Mission Drive. Noise levels exceed 55 dBA along
Atterdag Road from Mission Drive to Laurel Avenue, Alisal road
south of Elverhoy Way, and Oak Street from Alisal Road to Fifth
Street.
Comparing these updated noise levels to the City’s exterior noise
standards shown in Table 4, residences in very close proximity to
Mission Drive, such as near Pine Street near Mission Drive, or
along segments of Vester Sted or Via Reposa, are now exposed
to noise levels that exceed the City’s 60 dBA CNEL standard for
residential uses. Hotels, motels, transient lodging, and parks
along Mission Drive are also exposed to exterior noise levels in
excess of the 60 dBA CNEL standard for these types of land
uses. Solvang Elementary School, Atterdag Village, and the
Santa Ynez Valley Cottage Hospital are not exposed to noise
levels that exceed the City’s 65 dBA CNEL standard for these
types of institutional land uses. The Solvang Library is also a
noise-sensitive land use, but one for which the City does not
have an exterior noise standard.

2.2        FUTURE NOISE ENVIRONMENT
This section contains a detailed description of the future noise
environment in Solvang. The location of future noise sources and
noise-sensitive receptors was determined by extrapolating the
findings of the analysis of the existing noise environment
contained in Section 1.5 to future conditions. Because traffic
noise is expected to remain the main source of noise in the
community, the results of the community noise survey were
compared to and used to calibrate the results of computer noise
modeling of future traffic noise based on future traffic volumes
from the City’s 2008 Circulation Element. The results of the
computer noise model were then used to produce future noise
contour maps of the community.
2.2.1 FUTURE NOISE MODELING
Future roadway noise levels were quantified using the Federal
Highway Administration Traffic Noise Model (TNM®), based on
projected ADT data obtained from Table A-6 of Appendix A of
the City’s 2008 General Plan Circulation Element for future
(2030) conditions. The results of the noise modeling for future
conditions are shown in Table 7. For further detail regarding the
noise modeling procedures and methodology used to model
roadway noise levels, please refer to the Technical Background
Report to this Noise Element (Appendix A).
2.2.2 FUTURE NOISE CONTOURS
The results of the noise modeling for future (2030) conditions are
shown in Figure 6. As can be seen by comparing Figure 6 to
Figure 5, noise levels are expected to increase somewhat along
Solvang’s major roadways by the year 2030. For example, noise
levels are expected to increase to the point that some properties
immediately adjacent to portions of Alamo Pintado Road north of
Mission Drive and Atterdag Road north of Mission Drive would
be exposed to noise levels in excess of the City’s 60 dBA CNEL
standard for residential land uses. Along Mission Drive and along
Alisal Road from Mission Drive to Elverhoy Way, the same land
uses would remain exposed to noise levels in excess of the
City’s 60 dBA CNEL standard, with the boundary of this contour
expanding slightly further from the roadway centerline compared
to existing conditions.

2.2.3 FUTURE NOISE INCREASES
In community noise assessment, changes in noise levels greater
than 3 dBA are often identified as significant, while changes less
than 1 dBA are considered not to be discernible to local
residents. In the range of 1 to 3 dBA residents who are very
sensitive to noise may perceive a slight change. The level at
which changes in community noise levels become discernible is
likely to be some value greater than 1 dBA, and 3 dBA appears
to be appropriate for most people.
Table 8 shows the difference between existing traffic noise levels
and those that are projected to occur by 2030, based on the
noise modeling results for existing (year 2007) and future (year
2030) conditions, as shown in Tables 6 and 7. Table 8 shows
that future noise increases along most roads in Solvang through
the year 2030 are expected to be 1.6 dBA or less, and would
therefore be nearly imperceptible. The one exception is Atterdag
Road from Mission Drive to Laurel Avenue, where noise is
expected to increase by 2.6 dBA. While this increase may be
more perceptible, it is still below the 3 dBA threshold of
significance.

                                                          Noise Element
As previously discussed, the sources of noise in Solvang can be
divided into two basic categories, transportation sources
(primarily traffic) and non-transportation sources. A local
government has little direct control of transportation noise at the
source. State and Federal agencies have the responsibility to
control the noise from the source, such as vehicle noise emission
levels. The most effective method the City has to mitigate
transportation noise is through reducing the impact of the noise
on the community (e.g., noise barriers and site design review).
Mitigation through the design and construction of a noise barrier
(wall, berm, or combination wall/berm) is the most common way
of alleviating traffic noise impacts (Figure 7). The effect of a
noise barrier is critically dependent on the geometry between the
noise source and the receiver. A noise barrier effect occurs when
the "line of sight" between the source and receiver is penetrated
by the barrier. The greater the penetration the greater the noise
reduction.
Another common approach to mitigating noise impacts is through
the use of setbacks. This approach may be more desirable for
the City of Solvang due to its relatively low volume roadways and
the desire to avoid a "walled in" look. The setback approach
simply requires that the homes or noise sensitive uses be
setback from the roadway at a distance great enough so that
they are outside the noise impact zone. The setback area is
landscaped. The landscaping actually provides very little noise
reduction, but residents seem to become less aware of the noise
probably because they cannot see, or have an obstructed view
of, the road.

3.0 GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTION
        ITEMS
The following are statements of the goals of the City of Solvang
for the control of community noise.
Goal 1
INCORPORATE NOISE CONSIDERATIONS INTO LAND USE
PLANNING DECISIONS.
Policy 1.1
In order to maintain acceptable limits of noise for various land
uses throughout the community, the City will continue to utilize its
current Noise/Land Use Compatibility Matrix contained in Table 1
of this Noise Element, which specify the maximum noise levels
allowable for new developments impacted by transportation
noise sources operating on public and quasi-public property.
Sources on private property would be subject to the City’s Noise
Ordinance requirements, as described in Policy 3.1 and shown in
Table 2 of this Noise Element.
   Action Item (A)
   Continue to apply the City’s existing standards specifying
   acceptable limits of noise for various land uses throughout the
   city, shown in Table 1 of this Noise Element. These criteria
   are designed to fully integrate noise considerations into land
   use planning to prevent new noise/land use conflicts, and are
   the bases for the Interior and Exterior Noise Standards shown
   in Table 2, which define City policies related to land uses and
   acceptable noise levels. These tables are the primary tools
   that allow the City to ensure that the existing noise
   environment is integrated into land use compatibility planning.
   Action Item (B)
   Incorporate noise reduction features into new development
   during site planning to mitigate anticipated noise impacts on
   affected noise-sensitive land uses. The noise referral zones
   identified in Figures 5 and 6 of this Noise Element, which
                                                     Solvang General Plan 33

                                                          Noise Element
   show areas that are currently and in the future potentially
   exposed to noise levels greater than 55 dBA (CNEL) or
   greater, can be used to identify locations of potential conflict.
   New development will be permitted only if appropriate
   mitigation measures are included such that the standards
   contained in this Element and the City’s Noise Ordinance are
   met.
   Action Item (C)
   Enforce the State of California Uniform Building Code that
   specifies that the indoor noise levels for residential living
   spaces not exceed 45 dB Ldn/CNEL due to the combined
   effect of all noise sources. The State requires implementation
   of this standard when the outdoor noise levels exceed 60 dB
   LDN/CNEL. The Noise Referral Zones (60 CNEL) can be used
   to determine when this standard needs to be addressed. The
   Uniform Building Code (specifically, the California
   Administrative Code, Title 24, Part 6, Division T25, Chapter 1,
   Subchapter 1, Article 4, Sections T25-28) requires that
   “Interior community noise levels (CNEL/LDN) with windows
   closed, attributable to exterior sources shall not exceed an
   annual CNEL or Ldn of 45 dB in any habitable room.” The
   Code requires that this standard be applied to all new hotels,
   motels, apartment houses and dwellings other than detached
   single-family dwellings. Additionally, the standard should be
   applied to single family homes.
Policy 1.2
The City shall require a noise impact evaluation for all projects as
part of the design review process to determine if unacceptable
noise levels will be created or experienced. Should noise
abatement be necessary, the City shall require the
implementation of mitigation measures based on a detailed
technical study prepared by a qualified acoustical engineer (i.e.,
a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California with
a minimum of three years of experience in acoustics).
   Action Item (A)
   All new residential projects to be constructed near existing
   sources of non-transportation noise (including, but not limited
   to, commercial facilities and public parks with sports activities)
   must demonstrate via an acoustical study conducted by a
   Registered Engineer that indoor noise levels will be consistent
   with the limits contained in the Solvang Noise Ordinance.

                                                         Noise Element
Policy 1.3
The City shall not approve projects that do not comply with its
adopted standards.
   Action Item (A)
   Require that new commercial projects, proposed for
   development near existing residential land use, demonstrate
   compliance with the City’s Noise Ordinance prior to approval
   of the project.
Policy 1.4
The City shall consider establishing a periodic noise monitoring
program to identify progress in achieving noise abatement
objectives and to perform necessary updating of the noise
element and community noise standards.
Policy 1.5
The City shall minimize potential transportation noise through
proper design of street circulation, coordination of routing, and
other traffic control measures.
   Action Item (A)
   Provide for continued evaluation of truck movements and
   routes in the City to provide effective separation from
   residential or other noise-sensitive land uses.
Goal 2
ESTABLISH MEASURES TO REDUCE NOISE IMPACTS
FROM TRAFFIC NOISE SOURCES.
Policy 2.1
The City shall require the construction of barriers to mitigate
sound emissions where necessary or where feasible.
   Action Item (A)
   Encourage the use of walls and berms in the design of
   residential or other noise-sensitive land uses adjacent to
   major roads or commercial or industrial areas.
Policy 2.2
The City shall require the inclusion of noise mitigation measures
in the design of new roadway projects in Solvang. This may
include, but not be limited to, the new or extended roadways
included in Section 3.0 of the City’s 2008 Circulation Element,

                                                          Noise Element
including the extension of Maple Avenue east to Pine Street, the
extension of Fjord Drive from Alisal Road west along the Santa
Ynez River then north to Mission Drive, and the regional bypass
road that would be created by extending Santa Rosa Road from
Highway 101 to State Route 154 along the south side of the
Santa Ynez River.
Goal 3
ESTABLISH           MEASURES          TO      CONTROL          NON-
TRANSPORATION NOISE IMPACTS.
Policy 3.1
The City shall continue to enforce its Community Noise
Ordinance to mitigate noise conflicts between adjacent land
uses. The Noise Ordinance establishes noise limits that cannot
be exceeded at the property line. The Noise Ordinance, because
it is a City statute, can only control noise generated on private
property. Therefore, the primary function of the Noise Ordinance
is to control stationary noise sources and construction noise.
    Action Item (A)
    Enforce the Community Noise Ordinance, which is the most
    effective method to control community noise impacts from
    non-transportation noise sources.
Policy 3.2
The City shall evaluate noise generated by construction activities
and subject them to the requirements of the Community Noise
Ordinance.
    Action Item (A)
    Require construction activity to comply with limits established
    in the Community Noise Ordinance.
Policy 3.3
Establish and maintain coordination among the City departments
involved in noise abatement.
    Action Item (A)
    Designate one department in the City to act as the noise
    control coordinator in order to ensure the continued operation
    of noise enforcement efforts of the City.

                                                        Noise Element
Policy 3.4
The City shall ensure the effective enforcement of City, State,
and Federal noise levels by all appropriate City divisions. The
City shall provide quick response to complaints and rapid
abatement of noise nuisances within the scope of the City’s
police powers.
   Action Item (A)
   Encourage the enforcement of State Motor Vehicle noise
   standards for cars, trucks, and motorcycles through
   coordination with the California Highway Patrol and Solvang
   Police Department.
Policy 3.5
The City shall establish noise guidelines for City purchasing
policy to take advantage of federal regulations and labeling
requirements.
Policy 3.6
The City shall coordinate with the California Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) to provide information on
and enforcement of occupational noise requirements within the
City.

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND SETTING
1.1 Why Parks and Recreation are Important
 Recreation and exercise are fundamental to a healthy life. The benefits
 include greater productivity, less disease, and sense of community, of
 belonging and of well-being. As the population grows, competition for
 limited recreational facilities increases. As the development and
 urbanization of our area increases, so must the provision of recreation
 spaces that are available to all people.
 Children are the greatest beneficiaries of recreation. Many life lessons
 are learned in recreational pursuits: social interaction, cooperative
 competition, character building, physical and mental health, and an
 opportunity to escape electronic entertainment.
 Public parks provide people with the opportunity to be physically active.
 Health and fitness experts agree that recreation and exercise result in:
 • more energy and capacity for work and leisure activities
 • greater resistance to stress, disease, anxiety and fatigue, and a better
    outlook on life
 •  increased stamina, strength and flexibility
 •  improved efficiency of the heart and lungs
 •  loss of extra pounds or body fat
 •  help in staying at desirable weight
 •  reduced risk of heart attack
The National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) supports the notion
that having close-to-home access to places where individuals can recreate
is one of the most important factors linking whether people will become
active and stay active.
1.2 Parks and Recreation Mission Statement
GOAL 1
The Solvang Parks and Recreation Department will strive to
create and maintain a parks and recreation system which
provides important environmental, social, personal and
economic benefits central to the City’s residents.
                                                          Solvang General Plan 2

                                                  Parks and Recreation Element
Policy 1.1
The Solvang Parks and Recreation Department is committed to providing
and/or facilitating quality recreational services, including programs,
classes, special events, and facilities to all members of the community in a
courteous and efficient manner.
1.3 Background
The Solvang Recreation Department was formed in 1987, two years after
the City incorporated. At the time of the 1988 Parks and Recreation
Element (PRE), the City had 60 acres of parks and open space. In the
period 1987 to 2008, Solvang added 1,825 new residents. One facility
unforeseen in the 1988 Parks and Recreation Element, but completed in
2006, was Sunny Fields Park.
The city’s parks and recreation facilities, with few exceptions, are
intensively used and well maintained. The city offers a wide variety of
recreation programs and services with a minimal level of staffing.
Increasing demands for parks and recreation services and the ability of
local government to meet those demands is constrained by funding, space
and facility limitations. The Solvang Parks and Recreation Department has
continued to progress with increasingly limited resources. In recent years
the department has focused its efforts in the following critical areas:
•    Development of Sunny Fields Park
•    Maintenance and improvement of existing park lands
•    Exploration of opportunities for acquisition of parkland and open space
•    Preservation of open space not committed to recreation
•    Continued development of athletic fields and support facilities
•    Continued linkage of community bike and pedestrian paths
•    Provision of expanded programs to youth, teens and senior citizens
•    Evaluation of the formation of a Regional Parks & Recreation District
•    Assessment of the need for additional recreation facilities such as
     recreation center, pool, cultural arts, etc.
1.3.1 Regional Participation in City Recreation Programs
It is generally recognized, and confirmed in the 2004 Parks and Recreation
Master Plan, that residents of the City of Buellton (incorporated in 1992),
and the Santa Ynez Valley (which includes unincorporated areas of Santa
Barbara County), regularly cross municipal boundaries to use park
facilities and organized recreation activities and programs.
The Santa Ynez Valley’s total population has increased to more than
23,000 and is anticipated to rise in the future. The Solvang Parks and
Recreation Department has recorded recreation program participation
numbers by place of residence since 1998. Table 1 shows numbers of
participants involved in Parks and Recreation Department Programs
                                                            Solvang General Plan 3

                                               Parks and Recreation Element
including special events, youth camps, field trips, enrichment programs
and adult sports.
Table 1: Parks and Recreation Program Demographics
Generally, citizens of the City of Solvang make up approximately 22-30%
of the total participants. Individuals from the unincorporated areas of the
Santa Ynez Valley, represent 38-56% of the total participants. The City of
Buellton constitutes 22-32% of the total participants and the remainder of
participants are from unspecified areas.
In June 2003 Buellton and Solvang entered into an agreement, governed
by a Memorandum of Understanding, that allows the City of Buellton to
utilize the services of a City of Solvang Recreation Coordinator to oversee
family recreation and leisure related programs for Buellton. The Buellton
recreation program operates and finances recreation programs through
the City of Solvang, while Buellton provides funding to cover the cost of
supervision and related administrative overhead of the Buellton Recreation
Coordinator. The Memorandum of Understanding can be amended or
terminated at any time with adequate notice.
The partnership between the two cities was designed to take advantage of
the existing recreation infrastructure in Solvang and to work toward a more
                                                         Solvang General Plan 4
                                                  Parks and Recreation Element
regional approach to providing recreation programs and activities to Valley
residents.
In addition to the park acreage added by Solvang since 1989, the City of
Buellton was incorporated in 1992. Buellton has Oak Park (2 acres), River
View Park (12 acres), a new Community Recreation Center and is
developing an off leash Dog Park (3 acres). These are important additions
to the overall recreation opportunities in the Santa Ynez Valley, however,
these facilities are basically neighborhood serving and lack major regional
recreation facilities.
1.4 Purpose and Relation to Other General Plan Elements
The Parks and Recreation Element is a component of the City's General
Plan. The original Element adopted in 1988 recognizes the important role
parks play in the make-up of the city's quality of life. The adopted Element
set a goal to meet the needs of the entire community by providing an
adequate level of parks and recreational opportunities.
Government Code Section 65300 et seq. requires the City to have a
General Plan that consists of seven mandatory elements. In addition to
the required elements, the General Plan may include optional elements
that relate to the physical development of the City. The Parks and
Recreation element is an optional element. It is an integral part of the
General Plan. Once adopted, it has the same force and effect as the other
elements of the General Plan.
State law requires that the General Plan be an internally consistent
statement of local government policy. Each element of the General Plan
must be consistent with all other elements. The policies in this plan are
consistent with City General Plan policies and standards.
This document updates the Parks and Recreation Element adopted in
1988. This Element establishes goals and policies for management,
renovation and expansion of existing parks and development of new parks
and recreation facilities in order to meet existing and projected needs and
to strive for an equitable distribution of parks throughout the City.
The purpose of the Parks and Recreation Element is to (1) give policy
guidance for providing of park and recreation services, (2) document the
City's existing park and recreation resources, including those resources
that are outside of the City's management, and (3) facilitate the evaluation
of park and recreation needs during the land use decision process.
The Element does not rezone property, nor does it authorize any public
access to lands described here that are currently in private ownership.
                                                            Solvang General Plan 5
                                                  Parks and Recreation Element
1.5 Adoption and Public Input
Two Public Workshops were conducted in Winter 2009. First, a public
discussion session during the Parks and Recreation Commission meeting
in February 2009 followed by another Community Workshop in March
2009. The workshops were valuable forums to gain insight and receive
public input on park and recreation needs. The following statements
summarize public input received by the City:
    •      There is a shortage of indoor/outdoor recreational facilities for all
           age groups.
    •      There is a desire for improved pedestrian and bicycle access
           to all parks through development of sidewalks and bike lanes.
    •      More neighborhood parks are desired, similar to Sunny Fields.
    •      More pocket parks are desired, particularly south of Mission Drive.
           These are small in size, up to ½ acre or less.
    •      Interest in the long-range development of Lot 72 and desire
           for the City to pursue optimal recreational use of the land.
    •      To ensure continued community involvement in the development
           process, dialogue between the City and neighborhood residents
           should occur throughout all phases of park development.
    •      Senior citizens and special needs adults could benefit from
           expanded programming and facilities to meet their growing and
           diverse needs.
    •      An increase and/or improvement of equestrian trails are desired.
    •      There is a Valley-wide need for a regional Multi Use Sports
           Complex, however no feasible site is available within the city.
    •      A youth fishing pond(s) and community garden are desired.
    •      Environmentally appropriate design, including the use of recycled
           materials are desired to be incorporated into future park
           development.
1.6 Santa Ynez Valley Recreation Needs Assessment Study
The Santa Ynez Valley Recreation Needs Assessment Study conducted in
2003 found that there was a deficiency of nearly all types of recreational
facilities in the Santa Ynez Valley, particularly sport fields.
Specifically, the study found the number of sport fields needed to
accommodate the adult programs is sufficient to meet the demand.
However, this did not take into consideration that many of the facilities are
sub-standard in design and facilities offered are not maintained to
acceptable level. The study identified a significant shortage of sport fields
to accommodate youth sports programs. The Summary Report can be
found in Appendix C.
Currently, schools are the primary source of active recreational areas in
the Valley. One of the potential problems with this arrangement is the loss
                                                             Solvang General Plan 6

                                               Parks and Recreation Element
of fields due to school classroom expansion. Another issue closely tied to
the demand for sports fields is the quality of the facilities and their inability
to effectively host tournaments. Recreation programming is constantly
challenged by a lack of sufficient indoor and outdoor facilities.
                                                            Solvang General Plan  7

2.0 PARKS
2.1 Value and Benefits of Parks
Parks and recreational paths contribute to a higher quality of life and make
our communities more livable. A well-rounded City parks program also
provides the community with a variety of substantial health, social and
economic benefits, including increased property values.
Active recreation opportunities are important to people of all ages to
develop and maintain healthy lifestyles. Our lives can be enriched by
experiencing nature, recreating and exercising regularly, and it is valuable
to have these experiences close to where we live.
Organized sports facilities, community centers and group leagues
accommodate important cultural activities for all ages. The availability and
use of active recreation facilities and sports programs have been shown to
result in a reduction in juvenile crime rates.
2.2 Existing Parks
The City of Solvang Parks and Recreation Department manages a wide
range of park types with recreation opportunities for all ages. The following
list describes each park and facility owned and operated by the City, as
well as joint use facilities and privately owned facilities within the city limits.
A map of the city with the existing parks and facilities identified is in
Chapter 8 of this document.
2.2.1 Parks
• Alisal Commons
         A     passive      use    park     that
         encompasses 2-acres of gently
         sloping land adjacent to Alisal Road
         overlooking the Santa Ynez River
         and Alisal Ranch Property.           A
         pedestrian path runs from Alisal
         Road to Glen Way.         The park is
         landscaped with drought tolerant
         plants and a drinking fountain.

       interaction with the natural landscape through distinct topography
       and riparian habitat of Adobe Creek consisting of oak woodland
       and coastal scrub communities. Approximately 48% of the city is
       within half a mile walking radius from Hans Christian Andersen
       Park.
• Solvang Park

• Kronborg Open Space
        The 2.99 acre site is located in the northwest quadrant of the city
        on Kronborg Drive, bound by Elsinor Drive to the east. The area is
        a steep drainage way within the residential neighborhood of Viking
        Hills. The slope constraints have limited the site to provide open
        views and serve as a wildlife corridor.
• Lot 72 / Duff Mesa
        Lot 72 is a 16.2 acre parcel located to the east of Alisal Road, north
        of Esrom Drive. The parcel is part of the 95 acre Mission Santa

        The Veteran’s Hall is situated on 2 acres. The building and grounds
        are available for a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities. A
        small lawn and picnic area is frequently used by visitors. The hall is
        approximately 10,000 square feet and is used for various
        recreation activities and classes. The general public and
        community organizations use the
        site for fundraisers, cultural
        activities, public meetings and
        special events. The building is
        the only public space in town with
        a large hall for events (Hotel
        Corque also has rental space).
        Half the Veterans Hall Property is
        Owned        By   Santa    Barbara
        County.                             Solvang Veteran’s Memorial Hall

                                                 Parks and Recreation Element
         The Solvang Library and Sheriff’s Station are located on the
         property, but owned and maintained by the county. All of the
         grounds are maintained by the City, except two hedges adjacent to
         the Solvang Library and Solvang Court.
2.2.4 Joint-Use and other Public Recreation Facilities
• Buellton Community Recreation Center, 301 2nd Street, Buellton
         The Buellton Community Recreation Center is a joint project with
         the Buellton Union School District, located on the campus of
         Jonata Middle School. Solvang residents use the facility with
         shared parks and recreation programs. The facility includes a
         weight room, gymnasium, classrooms and office space.
• Solvang Elementary School, 565 Atterdag Road, Solvang
         The City of Solvang rents the Solvang Elementary School sports
         fields. The City applies for use through a written application and
         pays the Solvang Elementary School District a rental fee for
         available fields.
• YMCA, 900 North Refugio Road, Santa Ynez
         The Santa Ynez YMCA is a fairly new facility with indoor swimming
         pool, outdoor basketball court, yoga room, cardio and weight room,
         plus childcare.
2.2.5 Private Recreation Lands
• Alisal Golf Course and Ranch Resort
         Located in the southern portion of the city, this 10,000-acre working
         cattle ranch is considered a one-of-a-kind resort. The ranch
         includes two golf courses, horseback riding, tennis, fishing, first-
         class accommodations, spa services and fine dining.
• Mission Meadows Open Space
         The 4.22 acre site is located at the end of Windmill Court bound by
         Highway 246 to the north, Old Mill Road to the south and the
         Mission Meadows Housing Development to the east . The area is
         an open space for the Mission Meadows Community. The site is
         owned by the City and maintained by the developer. The conditions
         of approval have limited the site to provide a scenic open space.
• Nyborg Estates Recreation Area
         The Nyborg Estates Homeowners Association owns an open
         space area south of Aarhus Street, east of Oster Sted Court. This
         area is a steep canyon with some walking trails.

2.3 How Park Needs are Determined
In the 1970’s as urban and suburban populations began to outstrip the
ability of many communities to add parklands for it residents, national park
standards were developed to help communities plan for adequate park
acreage to meet future demand. The standards were expressed in acres
of parkland per thousand of population. 1
In Solvang, some of the park categories listed in Table 2 do not apply
to a community of 5,000 in population. For example regional parks are
generally provided by the County or, in the case of metropolitan areas,
a regional park district.

2.4 Need for Parks
While the current National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA)
Standards suggest the need for each community to develop its own
relevant standards, the traditional NRPA standards do provide a starting
point for assessing current need. Table 3 applies the 1983 NRPA
Standards from Table 2 to the city’s current park inventory. Table 3 shows
that Solvang’s 59 acres of parkland exceeds the approximate 30-50 acres
necessary to serve the city’s estimated build out population of 6,181
adequately.
Table 3 includes the regional park acreage provided by the County in the
Santa Ynez Valley area, i.e. the future Santa Ines Mission Mills State Park,
Nojoqui Falls County Park, Santa Ynez County Park, Santa Rosa County
Park and Cachuma Lake Recreation Area. The regional facilities also

Valley population.

However, Solvang is generally considered the hub of the Valley
community and provides recreational opportunities for users all over the
Santa Ynez Valley. Hans Christian Andersen Park and Sunny Fields Park
are the primary parks in Solvang used by Valley residents. As a result, the
ratio of park land to population is much different when the service
population is larger than the City of Solvang.
Table 4 includes the approximate neighborhood and community park
acreage for Buellton, Solvang and Santa Ynez combined. The community
facilities do not meet the NPRA Standard. The Santa Ynez Valley would
need to acquire 30-154 acres of neighborhood and community parkland
based on traditional park planning standards.

There is a growing recognition that recreation and parkland demand is
best met by a variety of providers acting in cooperation because, typically,
                                                                   Solvang General Plan  13
                                               Parks and Recreation Element
traditional target acreages for parks are not realistic given funding
limitations.
Planning for parkland acquisition also needs to focus on co-operative and
adaptive strategies. Solvang may be best served by a self-directed
approach based on what citizens in the community determine is the best
and most opportune for themselves.
This Element recommends the implementation of local community park
acreage standards based on community input, local surveys and review of
regional trends. This process is described in Chapter 5 – Providing for
Parks and Recreation. This kind of local approach to assessing need is
consistent with current NRPA recommendations. This approach may
identify the need for additional park acreage for some or all types of parks,
or it may determine that parkland needs are being met. Tables 3 and 4
above are intended to provide some indication of how the community is
doing.
 The Parks and Recreation Facilities Map in Chapter 8 also delineates
areas within one quarter mile radius and one half a mile radius of Hans
Christen Andersen Park and Sunny Fields Park. Areas outside the radius
are considered underserved because they are not within the immediate
service area (walking distance) for a neighborhood park.
Popular new recreational pursuits can create unmet demand in a short
period. For this reason, sometimes the traditional models for what needs
to be in every park need to be reexamined. Given the long planning
timeframe leading to park or facility land acquisition and construction,
recreational facility planning needs to be flexible, adaptive and responsive
to evolving needs. Determining those needs is best accomplished by:
     • Examining regional trends
     • Performing periodic community surveys
     • Conducting local workshops
     • Preparing long range master plans for each facility
2.5 Parks Goals, Policies and Programs
GOAL 2
Provide and maintain park facilities with a range of recreational
opportunities for all ages, as close as possible to where people
live.
Policy 2.1
Continue to maximize the use of each park facility by creatively adapting
the recreation opportunities available, as community needs change and
evolve.
                                                          Solvang General Plan 14

                                               Parks and Recreation Element
    Action Item (A)
    Create Master Plans for each facility and periodically review and
    update the plans and estimate implementation costs to respond to
    changing needs.
    Action Item (B)
    When creating new, or updating existing, park and facility plans, the
    city should consider the effects on surrounding neighborhoods for
    issues such as noise, light and glare, and traffic and parking in order to
    minimize impacts on neighborhood quality of life.
Policy 2.2
Evaluate the feasibility of establishing a Regional Parks and Recreation
District or other agency partnerships to meet park needs.
    Action Item (A)
    Continue to evaluate the feasibility of establishing a Regional Parks
    and Recreation District and request the Local Agency Formation
    Commission (LAFCO) provide alternatives for implementing a Regional
    Parks and Recreation District.
    Action Item (B)
    Identify projects that could benefit from a partnership arrangement
    such as a community aquatic facility, youth or senior facility, and new
    or improved sports fields.
    Action Item (C)
    Maintain open communication with the State, County, City of Buellton,
    local organizations and the local school district to establish mutual
    goals and timelines for achieving the goals.
Policy 2.3
Seek to improve and maintain safety in existing parks and design park
improvements to facilitate security and policing.
    Action Item (A)
    Coordinate with the police department to provide mobile patrols of
    parks and recreation events.
    Action Item (B)
    Coordinate with neighborhoods watch programs to provide added
    security in park areas.
Policy 2.4
Maintain a Potential Park and Facility Project List that is regularly updated
and prioritized with input from the community.
                                                          Solvang General Plan 15
                                               Parks and Recreation Element
   Action item (A)
   Conduct periodic surveys and / or public workshops to update and
   adapt the ongoing project list for park improvements.
Table 5- Potential Park and Facility Project List
• Alisal Road Bike Lane and Pedestrian Path
         Improve bicycle and pedestrian circulation along Alisal Road
         southbound over the Santa Ynez River bridge with a Class I
         or Class II bike lane and pedestrian paths.
• Community Gardens
         Create Community Gardens to educate children and develop
         a community identity through diverse interaction. No site is
         specified.
• Equestrian Trail Improvements
         Improve trail easement along Adobe Creek to be accessible
         to and formalized with signage and trail stabilizing features.
         Currently, horse riders utilize the shoulder of Fredensborg
         Canyon Road.
• Pocket Parks
         Pocket Parks are needed south of Mission Drive and near
         Oak St. (east of 5th street) primarily to serve children under
         12 years of age. Currently no parks exist in these
         neighborhoods and no specific site is identified.
• Regional Sports Complex
         There is a strong desire for a Multi Use Sports Complex that
         could host a range of sports tournaments. The designated
         Lead Agency would need to acquire parkland large enough
         to accommodate needed sports fields. No specific site is
         identified.
• Solvang Library/ Computer Lab
         If the Solvang Library envisions expanding in the future, the
         City could partner with the Library to create a computer lab
         for after school use and various enrichment programs.
• Sports field improvement projects at schools
         There are few parcels available and affordable to the City for
         new parks and needed sport fields. The City should partner
         with the school district to upgrade, improve and intensify
         sports fields and other recreation facilities at Solvang
         Elementary School.

         and trail stabilizing features. The oak woodland and hills are
         unique and valuable resources within the city
• Youth Community Center
         More activities for teenagers should be developed. Ideas
         include an indoor/outdoor Youth Center with indoor soccer,
         aquatic facilities and outdoor multi-use courts.

3.0 RECREATION
3.1 Value and Benefits of Recreation
While parks provide the land, recreation is provided by the particular
amenities and programs provided within the park. Open, green parkland
has value; however, that value is typically increased when the land also
provides amenities that can be used or appreciated. In Solvang the limited
amount of active-use parkland has meant that recreation facilities are
intensively used.
                                  Recreation also includes the various
                                  programs offered year-round by the City
                                  Parks and Recreation Department,
                                  providing exercise and activities for all
                                  age     groups    and     all   economic
                                  backgrounds. A rich variety of recreation
                                  program opportunities teach our children
                                  values, gives opportunities for healthy
                                  exercise for all ages, and provides a
                                  format for healthy creativity and
                                  competition.
3.2. Types of Recreation Opportunities Offered by the City
The City offers a wide range of recreation
opportunities     through   structured     programs
administered by the Parks and Recreation
Department. These include Youth and Teen
Programs, Adult and Senior Programs, and Special
Events and Programs. Annual participation in these
programs and classes is 6,000 persons. The City
benefits from a healthy Volunteer program for
recreation assistants.
3.3 How Recreation Need is Determined
The Parks and Recreation Department prepares a quarterly schedule
of enrichment classes, programs and events. Public interest in
recreation programs is gathered through Parks and Recreation
Commission meetings where the public is encouraged to attend, by
                                                        Solvang General Plan 18
                                                Parks and Recreation Element
tracking regional trends, and informal surveys of participants. Certain
core programs such as youth day camps and adult sport leagues are
operated year to year; the variety of many other classes, events and
programs changes over time in response to needs. The classes,
programs and events are offered quarterly in an Activity Guide
produced jointly with the City of Buellton.
3.4 Recreation Goals and Policies
GOAL 3
Strive to meet the recreational needs of all age groups.
Policy 3.1
Continue to provide a range of programs and services that respond to the
changing needs of the community.
      Action Item (A)
      Record annual recreation program participation changes, review
      regional trends, and evaluate user response to the recreation
      programs and services in order to adapt and develop the City’s
      yearly recreation program offerings.
      Action Item (B)
      Continue to maintain active cooperative relationships with other
      recreation providers, such as the Santa Ynez Valley Sports Leagues,
      the Santa Ynez Valley YMCA and other agencies.
Policy 3.2
Increase resident awareness of available park and recreational facilities
and opportunities.
      Action Item (A)
      Continue to develop public information materials and activity guides
      describing park facilities and recreational opportunities.
      Action Item (B)
      Maintain cooperative relationships with local media outlets and local
      organizations to increase public awareness of facilities and special
      events.

4.0 SPECIAL PLACES
4.1 Special Places Defined
Solvang is fortunate to have a variety of special places within the city limits
and sphere of influence including the open space, agricultural and ranch
uses that surround the city. Solvang open space plays a major role in
defining the perceived edges of town, as well as its overall character. The
special places documented in this plan include City owned sites
designated for recreational use and areas that are privately-owned land
with development rights held by the city, or “open space” areas owned and
maintained by homeowners associations. In some cases, the land is a
predominantly non-buildable slope, with no public access. Such privately
held open space protects sensitive slopes and wildlife habitat areas, while
creating areas of visual relief within the city through spatial buffers.
Pursuant to the City’s Land Use Element Policy 1.4, the Land Use Plan
shall provide riparian and publicly owned open space along the Santa
Ynez River, Alisal Creek, Adobe Creek, Alamo Pintado Creek and other
appropriate locations. These places are unique assets in the City that can
enrich the lives of residents, protect sensitive natural resources, and draw
visitors to the area.
4.2 Mission Santa Ines Historic Landmark District
Mission Santa Ines National Historic
Landmark District was designated a
Historic Landmark District in 1999 by
the National Park Service. The District
is owned by three separate entities: The
Archdiocese of Los Angeles owns Old
Mission Santa Ines (40 acres),
California State Parks owns the Santa
Ines Mission Mills Property (39 acres)
and Solvang owns Lot 72, mentioned in
section 2.2.2 of this document.                                          Lot 72
The district includes historic grist and fulling mills adjacent to Old Mission
Santa Ines.

                                               Parks and Recreation Element
In late 2008, The Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation (SBTHP)
sold 39 acres to California State Parks, taking the first steps toward
creating a new State Park in Solvang. SBTHP has agreed to continue
planning and managing the property on behalf of State Parks. SBTHP and
the City of Solvang are in the process of entering into a long-term lease
agreement to plan for future use and public access of Lot 72 including
pedestrian paths through the property.
4.3 Regional Bike Plan
Since the City’s Circulation Element was adopted in June 2009, the Santa
Barbara County Association of Governments has completed a draft
Regional Bicycle Plan: Santa Barbara County. Recommendations for
providing improved bicycle facilities in the City of Solvang and extending
the regional network of bike lanes is part of the plan. Connecting missing
links in the bikeway network and providing local residents with alternate
forms of commuter transportation is a goal that can be achieved through
the SBCAG Regional Bicycle Plan.
4.3 Special Places Goals, Policies and Programs
GOAL 4
Conserve and enhance the public-owned undeveloped natural
areas of Adobe Creek, Alamo Pintado Creek, Purisima Hills,
and the future Santa Ines Mission Mills State Park for the
passive use and enjoyment of the public.
Policy 4.1
Seek to maintain appropriate recreational activities and services for
residents and visitors at the Santa Ines Mission Mills State Park that are
consistent with the City, State Park Department and Santa Barbara Trust
for Historic Preservation management objectives.
      Action Item (A)
      Evaluate the effects of new uses and services in the undeveloped
      natural areas on natural resources such as plants and wildlife and
      visual quality, in order to conserve and protect natural resources.
Policy 4.2
Create an urban trails plan and program in coordination with neighboring
Cities.
      Action Item (A)
      Evaluate the effects of urban trails on neighboring land uses, wildlife
      habitat and natural resources in order to minimize land use conflicts,
      native vegetation loss and wetland sedimentation.

5.0 PROVIDING FOR PARKS AND
          RECREATION
5.1 Decision Process
Parks and recreation planning is one “special-interest” among many when
a land development proposal is presented to public officials. Sometimes
parks goals can be met and other times competing goals override park
acquisition or expansion.
This chapter outlines a process for choosing the park and recreation
facilities the community needs. This is designed to make certain that
decisions are based upon an understanding of our current fiscal
resources, input from those most affected, and the City’s long-term goals.
5.2 Parks and Recreation Commission
The Parks and Recreation Commission (PRC) advises the City Council
and the Parks and Recreation Director in the policy, planning and
development of the City's park system, including implementation of this
Element. The PRC is made up of five members who are appointed by the
City Council.
Periodically, the Parks and Recreation Director will provide the Parks and
Recreation Commission an update on the status of existing and any
proposed significant new projects. Whenever an individual, public official
or group want significant new recreation facilities, a change in facility use,
a benefactor proposes a gift, or a property of interest becomes available
as part of a land use development proposal, the Parks and Recreation
Director will process and coordinate such requests.
5.3 Parks and Recreation Project List
The list of potential park improvements to existing park lands included in
Chapter 2 on Table 5 was developed with input from the Parks and
Recreation Commission and City staff, as well as through public
workshops, and adopted plans and General Plan elements. This list
represents the range of possibilities at the time of updating the Parks and
Recreation Element and does not necessarily reflect any particular priority
or ranking.

                                              Parks and Recreation Element
Pursuant to Parks and Recreation Element Policies 2.4 and 6.1, this list
will be updated from time to time and reflected in the City’s Ten Year
Capital Improvements Program
5.4 Encourage Private Recreation Facilities
To help ensure the youngest members of the community have access to
recreational activities, residential development projects that are moderate
to high density or are far from existing parks should be encouraged to
provide play areas for younger children within the common area of the
development.

6.0 FUNDING
6.1 Funding Acquisition and Development of Parks
In order for the City to expand the current park and recreation system,
adequate and dependable funding sources will be needed. These funding
sources must equally address acquisition, development and maintenance
costs. This chapter identifies the existing funding sources for the City
Parks Program and considers options for future funding.
The development of parks and recreation facilities within City Parks has
been funded by a variety of sources.
6.1.1 Grant and Park Bond funding
Grants apportioned under the Park Bond
Initiative have provided the City with over
$700,000 in capital funding over the past
several years. State of California Grants
and Propositions provided approximately
$560,000 for the construction of Sunny
Fields Park, The remaining funds collected
are used to upgrade or add new facilities at
parks.                                                  Sunny Fields Park
6.1.2 Development impact fees
The City collects park development impact fees from the Skytt Mesa
project (assessed at $878 per residential unit) when new residential
development occurs. The Skytt Mesa project development impact fees
have been deposited for construction, installations of park equipment and
other improvements at Hans Christian Andersen Park.
6.1.3 Quimby Act Park Dedications and Park In-Lieu fees
The state Quimby Act makes it possible for cities to require new residential
subdivisions dedicate land for parks or provide a fee in lieu of a parkland
dedication. The City does not currently have a Quimby Act Park
Dedication / Park In-Lieu Fees ordinance.

                                                 Parks and Recreation Element
6.1.4 Donations
Gifts have historically been an important source of park acquisition for
many small towns. Donations, or a bequest of land, are an opportunity for
individuals and organizations to give a lasting gift to the community.
6.2 Funding Recreation Programs
The Parks and Recreation Department generates approximately 100% of
the necessary operational revenue for its recreation programs through
user fees. When indirect expenses are accrued, (salaries, insurance,
overhead, etc.) the balance is offset by the General Fund.
6.3 Funding Maintenance
The maintenance of parks, recreation facilities and natural areas within
City parks has been funded by a variety of sources including those listed
following.
6.3.1 General Fund
The General Fund currently contributes all the maintenance cost for parks.
The General Fund also is the primary funding source for nearly all City
services, including such diverse programs as law enforcement, fire
protection and street improvements. The competition for finite fiscal
resources limits its potential to fund new facilities and ongoing
maintenance.
6.3.2 Grant Funds
California Park Bond Acts have provided grants to counties, cities and
special park districts that can be used for major maintenance projects.
While such funds may not be used for daily maintenance needs, like
mowing lawns and cleaning restrooms, they can provide funds for overdue
major maintenance. Major maintenance projects such as paving
deteriorated parking lots and renovating old restrooms can help to reduce
daily maintenance expenses simply by improving the condition of park
facilities. The availability of grants and bond funding fluctuates over time
and is often subject to the vigor of the overall state economy.
6.4 Funding Parks and Recreation
The City’s Parks and Recreation Department faces two funding
challenges. The first is the high cost of funding new facilities. The second
is funding ongoing maintenance of existing and new facilities.
                                                           Solvang General Plan 26

                                                        Parks and Recreation Element
6.4.1 Funding new facilities
From 2004 to 2008 the Parks and Recreation Department accumulated
$463,486 of funding through various grants, (on average of less than
$100,000 per year). Although in good years the average annual revenue
from grants would be $92,697, some years the Parks and Recreation
Department does not receive any grant funding. These grants have been
used for various projects including tennis court improvements, and the
development of Sunny Fields Park.
Due to the City’s climbing property values it is not likely a funding source
could accrue to a point to purchase new park land. In today’s real estate
market, the potential land acquisition costs of a typical 3-acre
neighborhood park for land zoned single family residential would be in the
range of $600,000.
It is estimated that development of a park with basic facilities would cost
roughly $500,000-$700,000. 2 At a total cost of approximately $1.0 to $1.3
million, at best the City would be able to provide one new neighborhood
park every 10-15 years. This figure would not address upgrades at existing
parks that would need to be postponed in order to provide this new facility,
nor the new personnel to provide the necessary maintenance.
6.4.2 Funding maintenance of new facilities
Currently the City’s parks are maintained at a high level, a fact noted by
public participants in the Parks and Recreation Element update process.
However, in times when the cost of maintaining existing facilities exceeds
available funding, determining maintenance priorities can be difficult.
Deferring maintenance during such times generally results in greater
future costs to rehabilitate neglected parks.
6.5 Funding Goals and Policies
GOAL 6
Use a variety of funding sources to expand, acquire, develop,
and maintain the City’s parks, recreation opportunities and
natural areas.
Policy 6.1

        Investigate the potential benefits of a Quimby Act ordinance based
        on remaining vacant residential land in the city.
Policy 6.3
Develop a funding program that balances community need with available
revenues.
        Action Item (A)
        Continue to pursue grants and park bond funding for construction of
        new parks, major park maintenance projects, or to upgrade or add
        new facilities to existing parks.
Policy 6.4
Explore funding arrangements and partnerships with the County,
neighboring cities and the local school district to pool resources and
maximize the overall public benefit for needed park and recreation
facilities.
Policy 6.5
Annually review the recreation program fees and costs to maintain an
appropriate level of cost recovery through program and event user fees.
Policy 6.6

7.0 DEFINITIONS
Active Recreation. Active recreation tends to involve facilities and
usually larger groups of people. Some examples of active recreation
include items such as community centers, a skate park, tennis courts,
sports fields, and a swimming pool. (See also Passive Recreation).
Community Center. Community centers or indoor sports facilities typically
provide indoor area for recreation such as basketball, fitness classes,
crafts, games, and other similar recreational opportunities. While
recreation sites are often limited to a building, parking and exterior
landscaping, these sites may also include some outdoor recreation.
Enterprise Fund.         Enterprise funds are established to finance and
account for the operation and maintenance of facilities and services, which
are self-supporting, by user charges with the use of tax revenues.
General Fund. The General Fund is the main operating fund of the City
accounting for expenditures and revenues for citywide activities.
General Fund Support. General Fund Support is the amount of General
Fund financial support to a given budget unit after revenues and other
funding are subtracted from expenditures.
Goals. Goals are a general expression of community values, an ideal
future result or condition related to the mission statement.
Impact Fees. In Solvang, Development impact fees are assessed only on
the Skytt Mesa Project. These funds are used to make improvements at
Hans Christian Andersen Park.
Linear Parks. Linear parks are located along a corridor such as a river,
creek, or a trail system. These parks tend to be narrow and long in
configuration. Linear parks may link schools, parks or neighborhoods and
may also serve a community’s transportation needs. Often a linear park
derives its shape by conforming to an edge: of the coast, of a river or
creek or an abandoned railroad right of way.
Mini-Parks. Also known as Pocket Parks, mini-parks are the smallest
type of park. They may range in size from a small residential lot, in some
cases as small as 6,000 square feet, up to 1.5 acres. In most cases, mini-
                                                          Solvang General Plan 30

                                               Parks and Recreation Element
parks are usually one acre or less. Because of their small size, mini-parks
may be more passive in nature. Mini-parks serve a distinct neighborhood.
Mission Statement. A Mission Statement is a broad statement, which
defines the agency’s values, principles, and what matters most. An
agency’s Mission Statement should guide goals and policies.
Neighborhood Parks.          Neighborhood parks typically serve nearby
populations consisting of one or more neighborhoods. According to
National Recreation and Parks Association standards, a neighborhood
park may range in size from roughly five to ten acres. In general,
neighborhood parks are within walking distance from the people they are
primarily intended to serve, i.e. one mile or less. Neighborhood parks
usually include passive recreation as well as some active recreation.
Typical facilities might include children’s play equipment, a court game
(such as basketball, tennis or handball), a turf area and individual picnic
areas.
Passive Recreation. Passive recreation tends to be more tranquil and
involve activities that are more individual or involve a small group.
Examples of passive recreation include such items as a walking trail,
individual picnic sites, nature appreciation, and birding. (See also Active
Recreation).
Pocket Parks. See Mini-Parks.
Policies. Policies are statements that guide decision-making and imply a
clear commitment. Policies are based on the information gathered and
analyzed during the preparation of this Element.
Quimby Fees. Quimby fees are collected when new residential lots are
created and can only be used to expand, acquire, rehabilitate, or develop
community-serving parks
Regional Parks. The City of Solvang does not operate regional parks.
Santa Barbara County provides regional parks, for example, Santa Rosa
County Park, Santa Ynez County Park, Gaviota Sate Park, Lake Cachuma
Recreation Area, and Nojoqui Falls County Park.

SUMMARY:
Discussion Topics/Ideas:
BIKE PATHS AND WALKING CONNECTIONS
•  Improve bicycle and pedestrian circulation along Alisal Road with
   Class I or Class II bike lane and walking paths.
•  A critical bike path is needed to Hans Christian Andersen Park.
   Ideas for path from Alisal road toward Nojoqui, through Hans
   Christen Andersen Park to HWY 246.
•  There is some interest in creating a walking path through
   Creekside Open Space.
•  Continue to improve pedestrian access to all parks through
   development of sidewalks and bike lanes.
NEIGHBOROOD PARKS
•  More parks are needed similar to Sunny Fields.
•  A pocket park is needed near Oak street east of 5th to serve
   children under 12 years of age.
•  Pocket parks are needed south of Mission Drive. Currently none
   exist.
POLICIES

REGIONAL PARK & YOUTH COMMUNITY CENTER –long term
•  Strong desire for a Valley Wide Youth Community Center
   to serve teenagers in Buelton, Solvang and Santa Ynez Valley.
•  There is a need for a Superior Multi Use Sports Complex, that
   could host a range of sports Tournaments. Possible site could be
   Farmers property.
INTERESTING RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES
•  People are interested in the following activities: sand
   volleyball, bacci ball, tennis, horse shoe pits, pool, ping pong,
   bowling
•  There is a desire for an Indoor/Outdoor youth center with indoor
   soccer, indoor pool and outdoor multi use court.
•  Special needs adults could benefit from development of a
   Community Center or Special Needs Development Center.
•  Interest in a Community Garden to educate children.
EXISTING FACILITES TO ENHANCE
•  Atterdag Bowl could be a good space to have concerts
   because acoustics are good there. Existing Land use ordinance
   would need to be changed.
•  Alisal Commons could be improved by adding picnic tables.
   There is an opportunity to make the space more of a
   neighborhood park by adding a children’s play structure.
•  Is the Host Home necessary at Hans Christian Andersen Park?
•  The detention basin at Hans Christian Andersen Park could be
   used as a dog park.
•  Senior Center could be enhanced, but City does not partner with
   them
•  Create a Master Plan for Creekside Open Space that includes
   walking trails.
•  Continue to pursue the use of facilities at Solvang School and
   create more after school and summer programs.

                                         Parks and Recreation Element
• Lots 72 could be used as a passive open space, active park or
  special events area.
• The Veteran’s Memorial Hall is currently the only conference Hall
  in Solvang; it is used for weddings etc. If conference spaces
  were moved, and windows were raised, it could be remodeled or
  expanded into a recreation center.
• Half of the Vets Hall is currently owned by the county.
• Solvang Library may be expanding. This creates an opportunity
  to increase programming and create a Computer Center
• Currently, teenagers hang out at the Library after school
  because they do not have a place of their own.

  Recreation Needs
 Assessment Study
       (Summary Report)
SANTA YNEZ VALLEY, CALIFORNIA
         September 2, 2003
          Prepared by MIG Inc.
SUMMARY REPORT
INTRODUCTION     This reports summarizes the findings and conclusions contained
                 in the Recreation Needs Assessment Study for the Santa Ynez
                 Valley.
                 In general, our finding was that there was deficiency of nearly
                 all types of active recreational facilities in the Santa Ynez
                 Valley, particularly sport fields. To further complicate the
                 shortage, many of the facilities are sub-standard in design and
                 facilities offered and are not maintained to acceptable level.
                 We also found scheduling difficulties have compounded the
                 need for more sport fields.
                 Specifically, we found the number of sport fields needed to
                 accommodate the adult programs is sufficient to meet the
                 demand. However, this does not take into consideration the
                 field/facility quality or factors associated with scheduling into
                 consideration. In contrast, we have found a significant
                 shortage of sport fields to accommodate youth programs.
                 This deficiency would be further accentuated if quality and
                 scheduling were taken into consideration. Some of this
                 deficiency is currently being accommodated by the surplus of
                 regulation (adult) sized facilities. While the analysis for sport
                 courts revealed a slight surplus of tennis courts, there was a
                 shortage of indoor and outdoor basketball courts, and
                 volleyball courts. Similarly, the needs assessment revealed the
                 need for outdoor pool space was being met and that there
                 was a slight need for indoor pool space.
                 Currently, schools are the primary source of active recreational
                 areas in the Valley. One of the potential problems with this
                 arrangement is the loss of fields due to school expansion.
                 Many of the schools in the various districts indicated that as
                 growth occurs they would need to expand their facilities into
                 areas currently occupied by sport fields and athletic courts.
                 Another issue closely tied to the demand is the quality of the
                 facilities and their inability to effectively host tournaments.
                 Listed below is a summary of the needs assessment for sport
NEEDS ASSESSMENT fields. This assumes that the fields are used as designed,
                 although some joint use of regulation fields is occurring for
                 youth programs.

                       Sport Fields                The sport field assessment indicated a moderate amount of
                                                   need for most types of sport fields. This need will increase
                                                   over time as the community grows and if a major competitive
                                                   program is initiated. There are several ways this need for
                                                   sport fields can be accommodated. One option is to disperse
                                                   sport fields throughout the community on school playgrounds
                                                   and in city parks (current policy) in all existing and future
                                                   facilities. The second option is to group fields in one or two
                                                   major locations. Since each approach has its merit, they are
                                                   discussed below.
                                                        Option 1 Dispersing Sport Fields
                                                              In this option, fields would be dispersed throughout the
                                                              community on school playgrounds and city/town park sites.
                                                              This approach has the advantage of spreading the fields
                                                              throughout the community, thereby not impacting any one
                                                              area. The disadvantage is that it costs more to maintain
                                                              fields when they are dispersed and it is more difficult to host
                                                              tournaments. The other disadvantage is that parents who
                                                              have more than one child playing sports, may end up
                                                              traveling to several sites.

Recreation Needs Assessment Study                                                                        2003
                                            Due to the lack of publicly owned land, this option would
                                            require the acquisition and development of several large
                                            parks throughout the Valley. Each site would have to be
                                            large enough to accommodate two-three youth ball fields and
                                            four youth soccer fields.
                                       Option 2 Grouping Sport Fields
                                            Grouping sport fields into one location (often called a sports
                                            complex) is easier to manage, cheaper to construct and
                                            maintain and is more conducive to hosting tournaments. The
                                            disadvantage is that a large block of flat land is needed and
                                            finding a suitable location is often hard to find. If not located
                                            properly, they can substantially impact the surrounding area
                                            from noise, traffic and lights.
                                       Recommendations
                                       Due to acquisition costs and local land use regulations, it
                                       was determined that grouping the fields (option 2) in to
                                       one location was the most economical and feasible
                                       alternative for meeting sport field needs. It is important to
                                       recognize that this approach does not alleviate the need to
                                       pursue the acquisition and development of other types of
                                       park and recreation areas (neighborhood, community and
                                       large urban parks) to meet other needs throughout the
                                       valley.
                                       In locating a sports field complex, a total of eight sites
                                       were evaluated. Based on the overall need for sport
                                       fields, the ability to locate a suitable site, cost impacts and
                                       the benefits to the community of offering a facility that
                                       attracts outside visitors, the recommended site for this
                                       complex is the sand and gravel quarry operated by Granite
                                       Construction Company. If a site can be found and the
                                       permits secured, it is recommended that the sport fields
                                       be grouped into a complex. The remaining fields could then
                                       be used exclusively for practice.
               Indoor Recreation   Currently, indoor recreation space is limited to the Veterans
                             Space Memorial Building and school buildings. The Veterans Building,
                                   which is only used for meetings, does not have any small
                                   classroom space suitable for special interest recreation
                                   classes and the school gymnasiums are expensive to rent and
                                   program. Many groups seek access to the gyms for a wide
                                   variety of activities. Since school programs have first priority,
                                   scheduling problems sometimes occur. While gymnasium space
                                   is the greatest need, other needs also exist for other
                                   recreation activities.
Summary Report                                                                                      Page S - 3
Recreation Needs Assessment Study                                                                   2003
                                      Recommendations
                                      It is recommended that a small multi-use recreation center
                                      be developed that offers a wide range of recreation
                                      activities. If designed correctly and with the proper mix of
                                      revenue-producing facilities, the operating impacts could
                                      be minimized. Activity spaces recommended for the
                                      recreation center should include:
                                           •   Total size: about 30,000 square feet of floor area
                                           •   Standard high school size gymnasium suitable for 2
                                               courts
                                      While no specific site has been recommended, the
                                      development of an indoor recreation center should be
                                      centrally located to the population base and have good
                                      access and visibility from adjacent arterial roadway.
                   Aquatic Space
                                  While the Needs Assessment indicated there was a slight need
                                  for additional water area to meet the swimming needs for the
                                  immediate future, several conditions exist that could modify
                                  that conclusion. First of all, the outdoor pool at the High
                                  School is old and has an expected 3-year life. When this pool
                                  closes, there will be a significant need for an outdoor pool.
                                  The YMCA recently constructed a 25-yard 6-lane indoor pool.
                                  While the depth configuration is odd, it is suitable for leisure
                                  swimming and swim lessons, but only marginally suitable for
                                  competitive swimming. However, membership is required
                                  unless a substantial day-use fee is paid.
                                      Recommendations
                                      It is recommended that when the High School Pool reaches
                                      the end of its life, a small outdoor leisure pool complex be
                                      developed. This facility should include the following:
                                           •   25-yard 8-lane outdoor pool with a deep end suitable
                                               for    1-meter diving

Recreation Needs Assessment Study                                                                2003
IMPLEMENTATION                     Listed below is the recommended strategy for meeting active
                                   recreation needs in the Santa Ynez Valley.
STRATEGY
                                   While there are a number of options for managing active park
                     Management    and recreation facilities, it is recommended that a special
                                   service district be formed. This approach would form a
                                   separate taxing district serving a designated area of the Santa
                                   Ynez Valley. The district could be a stand-alone park district
                                   with its own elected board of directors or a County Service
                                   District in which the Board of Supervisors would serve as the
                                   elected authority.
                                   A special service district has the advantage of having its own
                                   taxing authority but would require a vote of the people to
                                   form. Then another election must be held to assess any
                                   operating or development money.
                                   The most feasibly financing option scenario for a service
                         Financing district is the formation of a Landscape and Lighting District
                                   (L&L). This can be created for any geographical area and does
                                   not need to be part of an existing municipality. The
                                   assessment is not based on the assessed value of property
                                   but based on a given rate for each individual parcel. The
                                   advantage of the L&L is that it only requires 50% voter
                                   approval. The money generated can be used either for capital
                                   construction or on-going maintenance. Each year a set amount
                                   is generated from the L&L district. If a larger amount of money
                                   is needed at one time, bonds can be sold and repaid from the
                                   annual money generated. Often two L&L districts are formed;
                                   one to pay for capital construction and one to pay for the
                                   annual maintenance costs.
                                   Because the cost associated with capital construction exceeds
            Capital Development    $37 million, the capital development program has been divided
                                   in to a short-term and a long-term implementation strategy.
                                   Short-term implementation would consist of the development
                                   of a sports field complex, acquisition of future parks land and
                                   renovation/improvements to local fields. Long-term
                                   implementation would include development of future parks
                                   (neighborhood, community and large urban), the development
                                   of a recreation center and the development of a new aquatic
                                   facility.
                                   Listed on the following page is a brief description of the short-
                                   term approach and associated costs.

                                  Sports Complex Development:
                                  The following design program is recommended for a sports
                                  field complex on the Granite Construction site:
                                         4       Baseball Fields in a pinwheel (10.0 acres). 3 fields with
                                                 200’ outfield and one field with a 320’ outfield.
                                                 Unlighted fields.
                                         4       Adult Softball Fields in a pinwheel (12.0 acres), 400’
                                                 outfields but designed to also accommodate girls’
                                                 softball. Lighted fields
                                        12       Soccer fields (18.0 acres) in an open field and
                                                 designed to accommodate a variety of field dimensions.
                                                 Unlighted fields.
                                         3       Small concession buildings for each field complex
                                         1       Large restroom building
                                         3       Small shelter buildings for each field complex
                                       600       Parking spaces (5acres), designed to meet peak parking
                                                 demand for soccer
                                                 Support facilities (2.0 acres) – maintenance area,
                                                 landscaping, paved courtyard
                                        47+      Total (Minimum acres needed)
                                  In the initial design program, the adult softball fields are
                                  lighted to permit play during the late evenings. This will allow
                                  3-4 games to be played per field each evening. Soccer field
                                  lighting has been excluded from the initial design program
                                  because it decreases the flexibility in arrangement and
                                  configuration field layouts. Subsequent phases could
                                  incorporate future soccer field lighting.
                                  Construction costs can vary widely depending upon how it is
                                  developed. In many instances, youth sport groups will
                                  volunteer or seek donations in labor and materials. Estimated
                                  cost for phase 1 is roughly $4,900,000,which includes some
                                  volunteer labor and donations.
                                  Land Acquisition:
                                  In order to meet future active park and recreational needs
                                  additional land will need to be acquired. It is estimate that
                                  roughly 55 acres of additional land will need to be acquired 9
                                  additional sites to provide local facilities (basketball courts,
                                  tennis courts, volleyball court, etc.) and secure sites for an
                                  indoor recreation center and new pool. It is important that the
                                  land for these future parks occur far in advance of their actual
                                  need to insure their availability. Estimate cost for this is
                                  roughly $6,000,000.

                                  the existing school fields require renovation and minor
                                  improvements. Estimated cost for this is $880,000.

                Operating Costs   Assuming a service district is formed to administer and fund
                                  the annual maintenance and operation of active recreational
                                  facilities, the forecasted gross annual operating expenditures
                                  are identified below.
                                  It should noted that a portion of these gross costs would
                                  most likely be offset by user fees associated with field and
                                  facilities rentals. All totaled, this could reduce the overall net
                                  annual operating expenditures by as much as 20-40%.
                                  Maintenance agreements for mowing with sports groups and
                                  school district could further reduce the overall operation
                                  costs.
