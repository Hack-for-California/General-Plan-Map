La Palma: 
A Special Place Where 
People Really Matter 
Getting Acquainted with 
La Palma 
If you are a resident of or business owner in La Palma, this discussion is
intended to represent you. If you are not, this discussion is designed to
communicate to you the kind of community we are today and the
community we aim to be as we move toward 2030. As you see, these two
                                                                      I n t r o d u c t i o n 1‐1

                                     L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                                     conditions are very similar because the core values of La Palmans create a
                                     great community and drive our planning decisions.
                                     You may be interested in learning more about La Palma because it is your
                                     home, or you may be looking for the perfect place to move your family or
                                     business and are attracted by our city’s strategic and convenient location
                                     within the Orange/Los Angeles Counties metropolitan region (see
                                     Planning Area and Regional Location, Figure I-1) In any case, we’d like to
                                     talk a little about La Palma before you read through the rest of our
                                     General Plan.
                                     We became a city in 1955 with a population of only 500 people. The
                                     number of cows in the city—then known as Dairyland—outnumbered
                                     residents. Only 1.6 square miles in size at incorporation, our city now
                                     contains two square miles and is still geographically the smallest city in
                                     Orange County.
                                     Orange County was growing at a phenomenal rate in the 1950s. In fact,
                                     during the year after our incorporation, the county added over 100,000
                                     residents to its population. The place that is now La Palma consisted of
                                     dairies and ranches. With suburban growth pressures threatening
                                     operations, the dairymen and ranchers sought to protect their
                                     businesses. Most of the city’s founding fathers were in the dairy
                                     business. However, the growth in surrounding communities was gradually
                                     squeezing out that activity.
                                    
If you were driving along Valley 
  View Boulevard in the 1940s or 
    ‘50s, you immediately would 
      have noticed that cows and 
  chickens outnumbered people. 
      This part of Orange County 
        supported extensive dairy 
     operations and egg ranches, 
       including 18 dairies within 
            present‐day La Palma.  
                                     Our original population of 500 grew rapidly in the 1960s. By 1970, a
                                     rapid transformation had occurred, with many of the dairy farms gone
                                     and almost 10,000 residents calling La Palma home (which caused us to
                                     change our name to more accurately reflect our suburban character).
                                     Ten years later, most of the residential development you see today was in
                                     place and our population rose to well over 15,000. Since the 1980s, the
                                     city has experienced very little increase in population, given the limited
                                     land area and preponderance of single-family homes. In 2010, the
                                     Census count revealed that 15,568 residents call La Palma home. What
                                     this means, among other things, is that virtually all of our housing was

                                   sense, our Central Park and City Hall complex serves as a community

                                   the city’s core to become a true village center and the heart of the

                                   What makes La Palma unique? As you spend time here, you will notice
                                   characteristics that you might not expect in a small, suburban
                                   community. The first is that we have a number of public events and
                                   celebrations that engage a large number of our residents and business
                                   people. Examples include our Fourth of July Run for Fun, the Summer
                                   Concerts in the Park, and the La Palma Days celebration in the fall. All of
                                   these activities bring our community together.
                                   The second characteristic is the diversity of our population, with many
                                   ethnicities represented: almost half of the population are Asian and
                                   Pacific Islander, with about one-quarter White, 16 percent Hispanic, and
                                   just over five percent Black residents. Thus, when you look at the school
                                   population—a segment of the population that is very important to us—
                                   you will see this diversity reflected.

Another dimension of our community that is not immediately obvious is
that we have our own Police Department, and we are proud of the work
that they do. La Palma enjoys a high degree of personal safety, which is
one reason why many of us have settled here. Of course, we are not
crime-free, but we have one of the lowest crime rates in Orange County.
Drive around our neighborhoods and you will see that our homes are
modest and well maintained. Our residents have a strong ethic of keeping
their properties in top condition; this ethic prevails across all the income
ranges in the city.
Despite the fact that we are served by five different school districts,
education is a strong focus in our community. With so many school
district boundaries and attendance areas to consider, this is a challenge.
But quality education is a high priority. Our parents are involved in the
schools and participate fully. This philosophy extends to other programs,          La Palma has historically 
as evidenced by our robust recreation and community services programs              maintained an in‐house

Through this introduction, you have gotten acquainted with La Palmans              communities in Orange 
and our city. You know something about our size and characteristics.               County.
You understand the qualities that comprise our core values. It is
important to us to convey that we know La Palma is, indeed, a special
place. Our past shaped it, our present maintains it, our future enhances
it, and our vision reflects all three. La Palma is known as the City of Vision
and this General Plan provides the policy direction to achieve that vision.
We invite you to share that vision, whether you are a visitor, a long time
resident or business owner, or a new resident or business owner looking
for a prosperous location.
Join us as we move toward our future and describe what we envision La
Palma to be.
Our Vision for La Palma 
A vision for a community is a mental picture of the future created by
anticipating or conceiving important desired characteristics of the place.
We have crafted our vision of La Palma by examining issues we believe
need to be addressed, assessing our strengths and weaknesses as a
community, and focusing on the core values of the people who live, work,
and own businesses in this community.
Our vision is imaginative in that it conceives of some conditions that do
not now exist, or that would not exist in years to come if care were not
taken in managing community affairs. The vision anticipates the results
of future decisions, events, and actions.
At the same time, our vision is practical in that it reflects the values and
aspirations of the majority of us in La Palma, so it has the support critical
for its implementation. This is only possible over time if the vision
reinforces and generates interest. La Palma’s Vision Statement is:
                                                                           I n t r o d u c t i o n          1‐5

                                          Vision. Family. Pride of Ownership.
                                                     Opportunity. Security.
                                   VISION:                     The power to imagine a future that sustains
                                                               the positive values of the present.
                                   FAMILY:                     People united by common values, convictions,
                                                               and aspirations.
                                   PRIDE OF OWNERSHIP:         Caring enough about one’s home to invest in
                                                               it continually.
                                   OPPORTUNITY:                The chance to prosper according to one’s
                                                               commitment and ability.
                                   SECURITY:                   Freedom from fear of one’s person or
                                                               property being violated.
                                  These ideas express the essence of the La Palma way of life. These values
                                  and priorities have driven the evolution of our community and will
                                  continue to shape it into the future.
                                  A word that often captures these qualities and the positive emotions they
                                  stimulate is Hometown. Perhaps no other label generates a stronger
                                  feeling for a place than this simple word. It reflects our commitment to
                                  our community and identification with it. Some of us have lived in La
                                  Palma for most of its history. Others have returned because of the
                                  qualities and comforts our small town offers. Still others have moved
                                  here more recently because they have the same values they recognize in
                                  La Palma. We all have made the decision to raise our families here, to be
                                  involved in our children’s education, to age in place here, and to be part
                                  of a community of a scale with which we identify. We are La Palma.
         While we don’t have a 
         downtown in the most 
        conventional sense, our 
     Civic Center complex and 
          La Palma Promenade 
           function as a central 
         gathering place in our 
       hometown and are well‐
      loved by the community.

La Palma lies at a strategic location at the western edge of Orange
County, yet within easy reach of almost any place within the larger
Orange County/Los Angeles County region. Long-time residents and
newcomers of many backgrounds find La Palma to be a convenient and
welcoming place within this vast metropolitan spread. Hometown, it turns
out, has appeal in many cultures.
Our motto is The City of Vision. That makes sense when you think back
to the 1950s when this land was farmland. It took real vision to imagine
the dairy farms of Dairyland becoming the La Palma of today. Now, our
vision is one of providing stewardship of we have built, inclusivity and
family, caretaking of our property, opportunities for advancement, and
security as our small town moves forward. To achieve this vision, we
focus in this General Plan on ensuring fiscal and service stability that
allows us to achieve community goals, allowing for incremental changes
in the community that complement existing conditions, and preserving
our quality of life.
                                                                               Our motto is “The City of 
                                                                               Vision.” From our 
                                                                               Dairyland roots, our vision 
                                                                               has guided us to become 
                                                                               one of the best places to live 
                                                                               in the country.
Schools are highly valued here and an important part of what makes La
Palma a great community. Within La Palma are one high school, a junior
high, and three elementary schools and the community is also served by
nearby schools outside the city limits. Regardless of location, we remain
dedicated to working with our school district partners to provide high-
quality education and facilities for our children. Figure I-2 indicates the
district boundaries for the three school districts in La Palma.
Several activities we carry on each year celebrate our hometown as a
place where people really matter and provide opportunities for our
community to gather together. In addition to ongoing recreation
activities, the annual La Palma Days celebration and parade in the fall and
our Summer Concerts in the Park series increasingly attract neighbors
and friends to share in music and fun. We do these things at a scale that
matches our community, and people respond.
Here are the civic virtues and characteristics that create this special
place:
                                                                        I n t r o d u c t i o n           1‐7

                                 L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                                       Involvement. Programs engaging people in a wide variety of
                                        educational and community service opportunities flourish in La
                                        Palma, particularly those serving our youth and aging population.
                                        Our community activities and partnerships with each of the school
                                        districts provide opportunities for families to be involved in city
                                        life.
                                       Cultural Diversity. The rich ethnic heritages in our community
                                        share a common commitment to preserving community qualities
                                        and all aspects of our community are included and involved.
                                       Neighborhoods. Many homes in La Palma have benefitted from
                                        major improvements of all kinds—room additions, new roofs, and
                                        improved landscaping, to mention a few. Only a handful of houses
                                        show signs of deferred maintenance, and the City reaches out to
                                        help these homeowners find appropriate resources.
                                      
            Our neighborhoods are 
      characterized by subdivisions 
      with homes that are well kept 
             and represent pride of 
                        ownership.
                                       Schools. Schools in La Palma are a valuable community asset.
                                        School quality draws people to our city. We remain committed to
                                        working with the school districts to achieve mutually beneficial
                                        goals.
                                       Identity and Appearance. Our streetscapes and public spaces
                                        help distinguish our city from our neighbors. We use these
                                        spaces to create a distinct identity, and to lead by example
                                        regarding the quality we demand.
                                       Safety. Our residents and business owners know that our law
                                        enforcement personnel provide responsive and respectful
                                        protection of people and properties. The city is also served by the
                                        Orange County Fire Authority for prevention, suppression and
                                        emergency medical services. Safety is also supported by the
                                        community’s investment in its streets and infrastructure including
                                        its own water and sewer utilities. This is reflected in above-
                                        average property values and the level of positive activity on
                                        streets and in public places.
                                       Balanced Growth and Harmonized Change. The General Plan
                                        establishes a balance and mix of land uses that promote long

  term economic health while maintaining a high quality of life for
  La Palma residents. We recognize that some changes will occur in
  La Palma; it is important that these changes are incremental and
  harmonize with existing development to preserve the La Palma
  character and vision.
 Clarity. Our expectations for new development and property
  improvements are clear so that enhancements to our homes and
  businesses are efficiently processed and contribute to the quality
  and longevity of our neighborhoods and commercial districts.
 Recreation. The landscaped Southern California Edison power line
  easement, referred to as La Palma Promenade, extends the width
  of the city and is highly trafficked. In conjunction with Central
  Park, the promenade provides wonderful space for active
  recreation and community interaction. Also, cooperatively
  supported use of school sites provides places for physical activity
  and cultural enrichment for our families, youth, workers, and
  visitors.
 Fiscal Stability and Security. A sustainable local economy
  requires a diversified business, jobs base that has the ability to      La Palma Days encourages

 Health. We are a healthy community, with a physical environment
  that supports residents’ desires for physical activity and social
  interaction, access to healthy foods and alternative transportation,
  and community programs that encourage healthy living.
 Environmental       Sustainability.   We     are   committed      to
  environmental sustainability, which means meeting the needs of
  the present while conserving the ability of future generations to
  do the same.

General Plan Intent 
We have a General Plan, not just because state law requires one, but also
because through this Plan we provide our residents their blueprint for the
future. We are convinced that our community will retain and improve
upon its high quality of life for future residents and businesses because
of the commitments stated in this Plan. We take this document seriously
as a true business plan to guide our organization and community.
The General Plan provides the framework for future development-related         For each General Plan goal, 
decisions. To do that, the Plan contains goals and policies that provide       there will always be a 
guidance for our City staff and decision makers. Any topic for which a         policy to carry it out. 
goal is stated can be assumed to be an important factor in realizing our
Vision. If there is a goal, there will always be a policy to carry it out.
Often, there will be several. Substantial implementation actions are
included to point the way toward achieving the goals identified in the
General Plan. Implementation actions are included in Appendix A, where
they can easily be updated.
In addition to addressing the General Plan issues required by State law,
our General Plan includes discussion of growth management, as
prompted by Orange County’s Measure M (a proposition passed in 1990
to invest the proceeds of a sales tax levy in countywide transportation
system improvements). We also include a Technology Element, to ensure
that La Palma stays at the forefront of innovation. The mandated
subjects are organized into four general chapters: The City Structure,
Community Safety, Housing, and Growth Management.
The first two chapters (City Structure and Community Safety) contain
most of the topics (or elements, as the Government Code refers to them)
specified in State law. The City Structure Chapter also contains a
Community Building Element, discussing health, schools, economic
development, and local governance. Housing is treated as a separate
chapter because its scope is specified in great detail in State law and
updates are required on a separate schedule. The Growth Management
Chapter likewise covers a single subject because it was spurred by
Measure M2, and the Technology Chapter is also a stand-alone element.
As discussed elsewhere in the General Plan, many plans and programs
are guided by the policies stated here. Some are required by law to be
consistent with the General Plan. Examples include the City’s
Development Code (both the regulations themselves and the application          The adoption of this

                             How to Use the General Plan 
                             We want to be clear about what is expected when decisions on public or
                             private development issues require reference to the General Plan (in order
                             to be consistent with it). For that reason, you will find certain action
                             words have a particular meaning. It will help in understanding our Plan if
                             you take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with these terms.
                             Goals and policies set the framework for decisions. A goal is an overall
                             assertion of community desires consisting of a broad statement of
                             purpose or direction. A policy provides guidance to City decision makers
                             in their review of development proposals and other actions taken. The
                             Implementation Plan (Appendix A) identifies specific measures that the
                             City will undertake toward putting goals and policies into action.
                             Different levels of commitment to goals, policies, and implementation
                             measures are necessary and desirable, so we use particular terms in
                             specifying our intent. They are described below.
                             Shall. We will always follow the policy. This is our absolute commitment
                             to the guidance expressed in the policy. Our expectation is that the
                             policy will definitely be implemented.
                             Should. We will follow the policy in most cases. Exceptions or degrees of
                             implementation are acceptable to us for good reason. Our expectation is
                             that the policy will almost always be implemented.
                             Allow. Our policy is to permit someone else’s initiative and support it
                             unless there is a very good reason not to. Our expectation is that the
                             policy will generally be implemented, even though some party other than
                             the City carries it out.
                             Coordinate. The City will join with some other party to implement the
                             policy. Our expectation is that the policy will generally be implemented
                             in some form of partnering arrangement.
                             Consider. We will investigate the proposed action or approach to
                             determine the actual level of commitment that is appropriate. Our
                             expectation is that an open-minded effort will be made to evaluate
                             possibilities until facts are determined and a decision is made based on
                             those facts.
                             Restrict. We will take action within certain bounds. Our expectation is
                             that implementation will occur, but at a constrained level or within
                             specified limits.
                             Prohibit. We will take steps to actively oppose a specified action and
                             prevent it from happening. Our expectation is that the direction involved
                             will not happen under any circumstance.
                             Each Chapter of our General Plan follows a similar format. We begin with
                             a brief overview or introduction, discuss the portion of the Plan being
                             presented, and state the goals and policies we wish to implement.

Chapters 2 (City Structure) and 3 (Community Safety) cover all of the
topics in the General Plan except for Housing and Growth Management,
which are dealt with individually, in Chapters 4 and 5, respectively. The
La Palma General Plan also includes a Technology Element (Chapter 6) to
address strategies to facilitate new opportunities for the community that
can be afforded by new technology.
Appendix A contains the Implementation Plan, a key component of the
General Plan. The Implementation Plan provides concrete action-oriented
guidance for the City Council in its annual budgeting and other
processes. In addition to actions, the updated Implementation Plan
identifies time frames and funding sources. This section will be reviewed
and updated annually as part of the City’s budget cycle.
Appendix B is a Glossary of terms used in this General Plan. The General
Plan Glossary is adapted from a Glossary published by the California
Planning Roundtable in 2003.
Appendix C includes the Expanded Housing Element as reviewed and
certified by the State’s Housing and Community Development
Department. This technical appendix complements the housing goals
and policies contained in Chapter 4.
The Draft and Final General Plan Environmental Impact Report, certified
by Resolution 2014-32 on June 17, 2014 by the City of La Palma City
Council, is contained under separate cover and provides background
information for use for future projects.

The City Structure 
Introduction  
This City Structure chapter addresses Land Use, Circulation, Open Space,
and Conservation, combining four required General Plan elements into a
single, integrated Chapter that defines the physical structure of the
community. Additionally, a Building Community component has been
included to establish policies focused on the non-physical aspects of La
Palma that contribute to community quality: health, schools, local
governance, and economic development.

                                     Land Use  
                                     State planning law requires that a General Plan include a Land Use
                                     Element that designates "the proposed general distribution and general
                                     location and extent of the uses of the land" (Government Code Section
                                     65302). Through maps and text, this component defines the location and
                                     development intensities of residential neighborhoods; commercial,
                                     mixed-use, and industrial districts; parks and other open spaces; and
                                     public/institutional uses of property. In particular, the Land Use Plan
                                     consists of the Land Use Policy Map, which presents a pictorial
                                     representation of the desired land use patterns in La Palma.

The compact development in La Palma includes a vibrant business district
north of Orangethorpe Avenue and the Riverside/Artesia (SR-91) freeway.
This land use pattern enables industrial, hotel, office, and other business
uses to thrive, taking advantage of high visibility from the SR-91 freeway.
The business/industrial sectors of the City are generally well maintained
and visually attractive. One of La Palma’s landmarks is the Centerpointe
development, which can be easily seen and accessed from SR-91.
Centerpointe is a master-planned multi-use business district with a
high-rise hotel, office buildings, restaurants, entertainment uses,
research and development, and light manufacturing uses.                 The
development projects a high-quality image in terms of landscaping,
pedestrian circulation, signage, and architecture. North of Centerpointe
is the industrial sector, with large, single-story buildings housing
manufacturing, assembly, warehousing, and other light industrial uses.
While generally well maintained, the City continues to pursue code
compliance to address outdoor storage, screening, and truck traffic
within this industrial area.
La Palma is a fully urbanized community. Public open space is comprised
of lands devoted to park space, school yards, and pedestrian and bicycle
trails. Citywide, approximately 14 acres are devoted to open
space/recreation, the majority of which is contained within Central Park.
Smaller programmed open space areas are located within easements and
on the Cerritos side of the Coyote Creek channel. The preservation and
enhancement of the existing open space and recreational resources is an
important issue to most residents; this issue is covered in detail in the
Open Space Element.
In addition, the Southern California Edison power line easement that
crosses the City provides leased open space that has been developed with
walking trails and green space. This well-used “La Palma Promenade”
connects neighborhoods to each other and to Central Park.

                            Land Use Vision 
                            Residents consider La Palma a very desirable place to live. In La Palma,
                            residents value their safe and well-maintained neighborhoods, quality
                            housing, superior educational system, and strong sense of community.
                            City leaders are committed to preserving La Palma as a quiet community
                            while providing the framework to enhance development opportunities in
                            targeted areas. The General Plan reinforces established land use patterns
                            by emphasizing protection of existing residential neighborhoods and
                            targeting new residential, office, and commercial growth north of
                            Orangethorpe Avenue, where development opportunities exist on
                            underutilized properties. As we make development decisions, we will use
                            the following guiding principles to fulfill our overarching objectives.
                            Protect and Maintain Established Residential
                            Neighborhoods
                            We place great value on our single-family residential neighborhoods
                            that give the City its small town identity. The General Plan continues the
                            practice of protecting, maintaining, and enhancing the character and
                            quality of established residential neighborhoods. New development will
                            be required to complement and reinforce the character of
                            neighborhoods through sensitive infill projects and appropriate
                            transitions in scale of development. The City also encourages the
                            retention, rehabilitation, and development of diverse housing to allow
                            La Palmans to meet their housing needs in all stages of their lives.
                            Maintain Balanced Growth and Development: Provide
                            New Development Opportunities in the Mixed Use
                            Business District
                            The General Plan establishes the foundation for a mixture of land uses
                            that promote economic growth and health which support a high quality
                            of life for La Palma residents. Increased development is permitted in a
                            targeted area north Orangethorpe Avenue, separated from
                            neighborhoods we wish to protect. Our development decisions—
                            including the focusing of growth in strategically targeted areas—reflect
                            Smart Growth principles, which move us toward enhanced mobility,
                            more efficient use of resources and infrastructure, and healthier
                            lifestyles, while providing opportunities to enhance and diversify our
                            employment and economic base.
                            Establish a True Town Center
                            We envision a new town center on Walker Street that will create a more
                            diverse community focal point, building on the energies of Central Park
                            and the Civic Center to include new destinations and gathering spaces
                            for La Palmans.

Land Use Plan 
This Land Use Plan has been crafted to guide the development,
maintenance, and improvement of land and properties. The Land Use
Policy Map, illustrated in Figure 2-2, with the designations described
below, will allow the community to preserve those qualities that define La
Palma—including our long-established land use patterns and attractive
neighborhoods—while offering new opportunities to enhance our quality
of life and economic base to sustain those qualities.
Understanding Density and Intensity 
Density and intensity are quantitative measures used to describe how
much development may occur on a property. For residential uses, the
term density is used. The La Palma General Plan describes density in
terms of the number of residential dwelling units allowed per net acre
(du/acre). Net acres is defined as the gross project or lot area, less that
portion of the site to be used or dedicated for use as a public road and
for flood control channels.
For nonresidential land uses, the measure intensity is used. Development
intensity addresses the amount of building square footage on a particular
parcel or lot. Intensity can be described in many ways, including total
building square footage, the percent of the lot the building occupies, the
mass of a building, or a floor/area ratio. This General Plan uses floor-
area ratio (FAR) to measure nonresidential intensity. The FAR is the ratio
of total gross floor area of a building on the lot to the net total lot area.
Floor area does not include area within parking structures. FAR describes
the intensity of the use on a site but not the building height or site
coverage; these factors are addressed in the Development Code. Figure
2-1, Example Floor Area Ratio Calculation, illustrates the variation in
height and site coverage that can be achieved with the same FAR applied
to a site.

                            Land Use Designations 
                            The General Plan Land Use categories define the type, nature, and
                            intensity of development allowed on all properties in the City, with the
                            categories applied as indicated on the Land Use Policy Map (Figure 2-2).
                            Table II-1 summarizes the Land Use categories; detailed descriptions,
                            including the vision and associated uses permitted for each category
                            follows. The Development Code (Chapter 44 of the La Palma Municipal
                            Code) provides more specific information regarding the land uses
                            permitted and detailed development standards.
                             
                            Residential Categories 
                            Three residential designations provide for a range of allowable densities.
                            The upper limit of a prescribed range defines the maximum number of
                            units per net acre at which development can occur. Residential uses are
                            intended to be the principal and dominant use within each residential
                            category. Other allowed uses include public facilities and utilities, family
                            day care facilities (as defined in the California Health and Safety Code),
                            and home occupations, as determined to be compatible with residential
                            areas and specifically addressed in the Development Code.
                            Single-Family Residential
                            (1-8.7 dwelling units per net acre)
                            The Single-Family Residential category provides for a range of single-
                            family housing types, including conventional single-family detached
                            homes, patio homes, zero lot line homes, and attached lower-density
                            developments such as duplexes. The average density for single-family
                            development citywide is approximately eight dwelling units per net acre.
                            Zoning standards require a minimum 5,000 square-foot-lot for a single-
                            family dwelling, yielding 8.7 dwelling units per net acre.
                            Multiple Family Residential

                            The Multiple Family Residential category accommodates development of
                            attached residential uses.      Typical housing types include attached
                            multiple family dwellings such as duplexes, townhouses, condominiums,
                            and garden apartments.

                            (8.8-30 dwelling units per net acre)
                            The Village Multiple Family Residential category provides for a variety of
                            housing types within one project or development, ranging from single-
                            family housing to multiple family dwellings, as well as uses incidental to
                            the residential uses. The types of developments suitable within the
                            Village Multiple Family Residential category include housing projects
                            targeted for households of limited income and senior residents.
                            Development standards may be tailored to achieve higher densities, but
                            site design must reflect sensitivity to surrounding properties.

Office Professional (Maximum FAR: 0.6)
The Office Professional category provides for single or multi-tenant
offices and may include limited supporting uses for on-site employees.
Office developments may range from low-rise structures situated in a
landscaped garden arrangement to mid-rise structures at appropriate
locations. Typical uses include professional offices for legal, design, and
engineering services, medical offices/health care centers, corporate
headquarters, and general offices for insurance, real estate, and financial
services. Supporting convenience services may be permitted to serve the
needs of on-site employees or visitors/patients.
Neighborhood Commercial (Maximum FAR: 0.5)
The Neighborhood Commercial category provides for localized
commercial retail and service activities in close proximity to residential
neighborhoods. Typical uses include restaurants, food markets, drug
stores, clothing stores, sporting goods stores, cleaners, banks, offices,
child care centers, hardware stores, other retail and personal services
uses, and community facilities.       Neighborhood commercial projects
should be compatible in design and scale with adjacent residential areas,
and should be designed to provide convenient connections to the
neighborhoods.
Industrial (Maximum FAR: 0.6)
The Industrial category accommodates low-impact, jobs-intensive
industrial uses that involve manufacturing, assembly, distribution,
research and development, telecommunications, science laboratories, and
utility buildings/facilities. Uses may include ancillary office and
commercial or wholesale sales activities directly associated with the
business. Commercial developments—such as home improvement stores
and wholesale and retail commercial activities—may be permitted. New
warehousing uses may be permitted only where it can be demonstrated
that the use provides a substantial economic benefit to the City.
Public/Institutional (Maximum FAR: 0.6)
The Public/Institutional category supports diverse uses: public schools,
government offices, police and fire stations, trails and bikeways, outdoor
recreational uses, libraries, museums, churches, community care facilities
and similar supportive housing uses, and cultural facilities. Public and
institutional uses may also be permitted in other land use categories
under regulations established in the Development Code. Transportation
facilities such as transportation terminals, fixed rail lines, and bus
thoroughfares are expressly prohibited.
Open Space/Recreation (Maximum FAR: Not applicable)
The Open Space/Recreation category encompasses park lands developed
for recreational use. Only accessory buildings or those structures related
to parks and recreation facilities are permitted on open space lands.
Certain commercial outdoor recreation uses may be permitted per
Development Code regulations.
Flood Control/Utility (Maximum FAR: Not Applicable)
The Flood Control/Utility category includes public utilities easements,
flood control channels, and similar facilities. Trails, bikeways, and
outdoor recreational uses are permitted within the Flood Control/Utility
category where they would not conflict with flood control needs or
                                                            T h e   C i t y   S t r u c t u r e 2‐9

                               transportation terminals, fixed rail lines, and bus thoroughfares are
                               expressly prohibited; temporary storage facilities are also prohibited.
                               Flood control and utilities facilities may also be permitted in other land
                               use categories under regulations established in the Development Code.
                               Freeway Overlay (Maximum FAR: See Underlying Land Use Category FAR)
                               The Freeway Overlay category applies exclusively to properties that are
                               adjacent to the SR-91 Freeway. This category is intended to permit a
                               limited number of freeway-oriented signs in order to promote the
                               economic advantage of the SR 91 Freeway for local businesses and the
                               City, while ensuring that signs are properly placed and designed to limit
                               visual clutter.

                               Implications of Land Use Policy 
                               The Land Use Policy Map serves as the Land Use Plan. The Zoning Map in
                               the Development Code implements this policy. A proposed project must
                               conform to the land use category shown on the General Plan Land Use
                               Policy Map or will be subject to a General Plan Amendment process.
                               Likewise, a zone change is required for any proposed project that is
                               inconsistent with the Zoning Map.
                               The Land Use Plan and the policies and implementation actions of the
                               General Plan are intended to achieve the following goals:
                                       Maintain the existing land use pattern with regard to single-family
                                        neighborhoods.
                                       Ensure that deterioration of existing uses does not occur.

        Allow targeted growth to occur in locations that will be least
         impactful to residential neighborhoods.
        Maintain funding and service levels for vital services.
Over time, as properties transition from one use to another or property
owners choose to rebuild, land uses and intensities will gradually shift to
align with the intent of this element. Given the built-out character of La
Palma, significant development activities may not occur over the life of
this General Plan, and certainly not all properties will be developed to the
maximum permitted intensities and densities. Table II-2 summarizes the
land use distribution, expected level of development anticipated within
each land use category, and the resulting residential and nonresidential
outcomes that can be expected through approximately 2030.
Projected Future Conditions 
The Land Use Plan provides for approximately 3,650 single-family
dwelling units and approximately 1,960 multiple family units, as shown
in Table 2-2, Land Use Plan Statistical Summary. The maximum density
for single-family development represents existing conditions within the
City. The net effect for infill single-family development will be to conform
to the basic character of long-established single-family development.

Notes:
1. Net Acreage is defined as gross acreage for a site or parcel, less the land devoted
   to arterial or local roadways.
2. General Plan statistical summary calculations use “expected” intensities and
   densities. Expected intensities and densities are the result of assumptions about the
   level of resulting new development by 2030, combined with existing uses,
   throughout that land use category.
                                                                    T h e   C i t y   S t r u c t u r e 2‐11

                               The largest opportunity for new residential development will be within
                               the Mixed Use-Business category. The total anticipated number of
                               dwelling units provided for in the General Plan, based on the land use
                               designations described here, is 5,606 units. Using a factor of 3.1 persons
                               per household (2014 average), the projected population in 2030 would
                               be 16,891 persons. This estimate is slightly higher than the population
                               forecast of 16,699 in the year 2035, as estimated by the Center for
                               Demographic Research at California State University Fullerton. The
                               difference between these two population estimates is approximately one
                               percent. However, the Center for Demographic Research estimates a
                               higher dwelling unit total for La Palma in 2035 (5,626). The difference
                               between the dwelling unit estimates is less than one percent.
                               As of 2010, the City had 5,224 dwelling units. The Land Use Plan
                               provides for 522 acres of Residential, 81 acres of Mixed-Use Business,
                               seven acres of Office Professional, 28 acres of Neighborhood
                               Commercial, 57 acres of Industrial, and 119 acres of Public/Institutional.
                               The remaining areas of the City are devoted to parks and flood
                               control/utility easements. The Neighborhood Commercial uses are
                               distributed throughout the City to serve nearby residential areas. The
                               Mixed Use-Business and Industrial categories represent 15 percent of the
                               community and are located exclusively north of Orangethorpe Avenue,
                               and predominantly north of SR-91.
                               The Open Space/Recreation designation encompasses 13.7 acres (1.5
                               percent) of the community. This figure does not include the estimated
                               24 acres of greenbelt that traverse our City (the Edison right-of-way, also
                               known as the La Palma Promenade), nor does it include the roughly 54
                               acres of landscaped playground area on school sites in La Palma that are
                               available to the general public during non-school hours. Parks are
                               discussed in detail in the Open Space Element of this City Structure

                               In general, the General Plan Land Use Map reflects established land uses.
                               However, additional development opportunities are available in the
                               strategic focus areas (Figure 2-3), most notably within the commercial
                               areas north of Orangethorpe Avenue. Table II-3, Comparison of Land Use
                               Plan to Existing Land Use compares the Land Use Plan to existing uses in
                               the City as of 2014. Table II-4 summarizes development projections in

Circulation and Infrastructure 
Element
Our critical conveyance systems—streets, sidewalks, trails, bike lanes,
storm drains, water lines, and sewer lines—make up the network that
supports the flow of our daily activities. This Element addresses both the
transportation system that allows people to move in and through La
Palma and the utilities infrastructure systems that provide necessary
urban services to residences and businesses.
Circulation 
The local transportation network consists of a system of complete streets
that provides for a balanced integration of all transportation modes. In
La Palma, we aim to facilitate efficient and smooth-flowing traffic, at safe
speeds, and minimal traffic impacts within residential neighborhoods.
Alternative modes―transit, bicycling, and walking―should be available
and convenient for all.
Vehicle Transportation and the Street System   
The circulation pattern consists of an efficient grid system of major,
primary, and secondary arterial roadways connecting La Palma to
adjacent communities. Walker Street is the main arterial that links the
residential neighborhoods with Central Park, as well as to civic,
commercial, and industrial uses. Most homes in La Palma are located on
minor collector streets and cul-de-sacs that meander through the
neighborhoods and create quiet, safe environments.

                              The street system in La Palma is well defined. Figure 2-4 shows the
                              hierarchy of roadways (based mostly on the width and related number of
                              travel lanes) on key City roadways. The well-established grid network
                              shown in Figure 2-5 allows traffic to flow well in La Palma, with few
                              problems and only isolated congestion at certain intersections, as
                              described below.

                              The arterial highway system in La Palma is consistent with the Orange
                              County Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH). The City has adopted
                              the MPAH, which identifies the following arterial highway standards:
                              Major Arterial Highway
                              A major arterial highway is designed as a six-lane divided highway with
                              an ultimate right-of-way of 120 feet. A major arterial can accommodate
                              between 30,000 and 45,000 vehicle trips per day.
                              Primary Arterial Highway
                              A primary arterial highway is designed as a four-lane divided highway
                              with an ultimate right-of-way of 100 feet. A primary arterial can
                              accommodate between 20,000 and 30,000 vehicle trips per day.
                              Secondary Arterial Highway
                              A secondary arterial highway is designed as a four-lane undivided
                              highway with an ultimate right-of-way of 80 feet. A secondary arterial
                              can accommodate between 10,000 and 20,000 vehicle trips per day.

                              The remaining streets         are   local  streets   that   provide   internal
                              neighborhood circulation.
                              Level of Service (LOS) 
                              Analysis of traffic volumes and their impact on key intersections serving
                              the city results in an estimate of how well the intersections work. This
                              information translates into a level of service (LOS) estimate based on a
                              scale of “A” (free movement) through “F” (severely congested). These
                              levels of service are derived from a calculation of vehicle movements
                              through each leg of the intersection in both directions during morning
                              and evening peak periods. Table 2-6 indicates the conditions associated
                              with each service level.
                              Future increases in traffic will occur from traffic generated from new uses
                              located within La Palma, as well as regional traffic from outside the City.
                              Despite these increases, the City desires to maintain a level of service “D”
                              or better on its arterial system. Over the long term, five intersections will
                              require improvements to maintain at least a LOS “D”:
                                     Moody Street/Carmenita Road at Orangethorpe Avenue
                                     Moody Street at La Palma Avenue
                                     Walker Street at La Palma Avenue
                                     Valley View Street at Orangethorpe Avenue
                                     Walker Street at Orangethorpe Avenue

          open, turning movements are easily made, and
          nearly all drivers find freedom of operation.
          Very Good Operation
          Many drivers begin to feel somewhat restricted
          within platoons of vehicles. This represents
    B                                                           0.61 - 0.70
          stable flow. An approach to an intersection may
          occasionally be fully utilized, and traffic queues
          start to form.
          Good Operation
          Occasionally drivers may have to wait more than
    C     60 seconds, and backups may develop behind            0.71 – 0.80
          turning vehicles. Most drivers feel somewhat
          restricted.
          Fair Operation
          Cars are sometimes required to wait more than
          60 seconds during short peaks. There are no
    D                                                           0.81 - 0.90
          long-standing traffic queues. This level is
          typically associated with design practice for peak
          periods.
          Poor Operation
          Some long-standing vehicular queues develop
    E                                                           0.91 – 1.00
          on critical approaches to intersections. Delays
          may be up to several minutes.
          Forced Flow
          Represents jammed conditions. Backups from
          locations downstream or on the cross street may
    F     restrict or prevent movement of vehicles out of       Over 1.00
          the intersection approach lanes; therefore,
          volumes carried are not predictable. Potential for
          stop-and-go type traffic flow.
Of particular concern for La Palmans is the congestion associated with the
Orangethorpe Avenue and Walker Street intersection. While not
technically the most congested intersection in the City, this intersection is
one of the most common intersections used by residents because it
provides direct access to the SR-91 freeway. Under year 2013 conditions,
this intersection operated at a LOS “C” during both the morning and
evening peak hours. Under future conditions, assuming both regional and
local growth, the LOS at this intersection is expected to decline to LOS “E”
or “F” absent any improvements. However, the addition of turn lanes for
the southbound left-turn and eastbound right-turn movements will
provide for LOS “C” or “D”. These improvements will be implemented
either in association with planned development projects or as part of a
funded capital improvement plan.

                                   Appendix A, Implementation Plan, describes the necessary improvements
                                   to all five intersections discussed above. To achieve desired circulation
                                   objectives over the long term, only minor modifications to the established
                                   street system will be needed. The City’s intent is to monitor traffic and
                                   circulation conditions and to move forward with the modifications only
                                   when deemed necessary. The City assesses the need to upgrade and
                                   rehabilitate public rights-of-way as part of scheduled capital
                                   improvement plans and continues a regular program of street
                                   maintenance in accordance with its pavement management system.
                                   Future traffic conditions will also affect the intersection of Valley View
                                   Street at La Palma Avenue, which is anticipated to operate at less than
                                   LOS “D” and no feasible mitigation measures are available—an LOS “E” is

                                   years, many parents have opted to drive their children to school, which
                                   creates temporary congestion for short periods. Due to the concentration
                                   of schools in La Palma, especially with respect to John F. Kennedy High
                                   School and Walker Junior High School located right across the street from
                                   each other, school congestion and traffic safety around schools presents
                                   a daily concern.
                                   The City will work with the school districts to identify strategies to
                                   encourage more children to walk or bike to school, to address congestion
                                   during pick-up and drop-off hours (for example, considering staggered
                                   school schedules or other alternatives to improve access/flow), and to
                                   improve drivers’ behavior with increased law enforcement presence or
                                   other approaches. Partnerships include Safe Routes to Schools Program
                                   and encouraging students to use alternative modes of transportation
                                   where available.
                                   Truck Routes 
                                   Trucks routes through the City have been designated on two arterial
                                   highways: Orangethorpe Avenue and Valley View Street (see Figure 2-4).
                                   Trucks are limited to these two arterials when traveling through the City
                                   to access the freeway or adjacent cities, and are permitted on other
                                   streets only for local delivery purposes. Limiting truck routes to specific
                                   streets enables the City to maintain acceptable levels of service
                                   throughout the City, as well as limit the damage and wear to the street
                                   surface and installations.
                                   Complete Streets 
                                   The complete streets movement is based around a simple idea: streets
                                   should be safe for people of all ages and mobilities, whether they are
                                   walking, driving, bicycling, or taking the bus.

Widening streets to accommodate every mode of travel is unrealistic and
undesirable in La Palma given the well-established street network.
Instead, streets have been classified by priority mode or modes of travel.
Prioritization allows for a more tailored, efficient use of the street
network to balance the needs of each mode in a holistic manner.

By defining the priority streets to be given to specific streets, City
decision-makers can better strategize future street improvements while
avoiding conflicting transportation projects. Prioritization does not
preclude improvements to non-priority streets, nor does it limit
improvements to a particular modal type based on the priority. Rather,
the travel mode priority simply suggests where to focus attention first.
The street in La Palma that has the most immediate potential for
improvements to facilitate alternative modes of transportation is Houston
Avenue. While Houston is classified as a Secondary Arterial, it has ample
capacity to accommodate future anticipated car volumes. In 2030,
Houston Avenue will continue to operate at less than half of its maximum
capacity. Thus, the City will pursue a “road diet” for Houston Avenue.
The term “road diet” describes reduction in the number and/or width of
travel lanes on a roadway. Potential benefits of a road diet include lower
vehicle speeds, more space available for bike lanes, sidewalks, or
landscaping, and improved safety for all users.
One form of a road diet is to narrow a four-lane roadway with two travel
lanes in each direction (such as Houston Avenue) to a three-lane roadway
with one travel lane in each direction and a center two-way left-turn lane.
The remaining width can be used to provide bicycle lanes in both
directions, increased sidewalk widths, and parking lanes.

                                  Figure 2-6 illustrates the features of bikeway classifications. Bikeways are
                                  classified in three categories, per the California Department of
                                  Transportation:
                                          A Class I Bikeway (Bike Path) is intended for the exclusive use of
                                           bicycles. While it may parallel a roadway, it is physically separated
                                           by distance or a vertical barrier.
                                          A Class II Bikeway (Bike Lane) shares the right-of-way with a
                                           roadway or walkway. It is indicated by a bikeway pictograph on
                                           the pavement and a continuous stripe on the pavement, or is
                                           separated by a continuous or intermittent curb or other low
                                           barrier.
                                          A Class III Bikeway (Bike Route) shares the right-of-way with a
                                           roadway or walkway. It is not indicated by a continuous stripe on
                                           the pavement or separated by any type of barrier, but it is
                                           identified as a bikeway with signage.

                                       In La Palma, most of our bicycle facilities are categorized as Class II. This
                                       system of designated, on-road bicycle trails is located along La Palma
                                       Avenue, Moody Street, Walker Street, and Crescent Avenue, as shown in
                                       Figure 2-7. The bicycle lanes consist of a striped, on-road lane that
                                       extends five feet from the curb. In addition, a Class I County of Los
                                       Angeles Bicycle Trail follows the Coyote Creek Flood Control Channel.
                                       This is an off-road, paved trail that connects to the City’s local bikeway
                                       system at La Palma Avenue.

                                       the town center, Central Park, and the Coyote Creek Bikeway. The City
                                       seeks to increase education regarding bicycle safety and use, and to
                                       expand the bikeway network where possible.
                                       La Palma Promenade (Multi‐Use Path) 
                                       Running through the center of our city we also have a multi-use path for
                                       recreational purposes, known locally as the La Palma Promenade. The
                                       Promenade is contained within the Southern California Edison right-of-
                                       way, which runs east/west through the City. This meandering path is a
                                       favorite of our residents—on any given day, you’ll see people walking
                                       their dogs, pushing strollers, or enjoying an afternoon stroll.

                                     The Promenade has a variety of pedestrian amenities, including park
                                     benches, lighting, dog waste stations, and emergency call boxes.
                                     Bicyclists are also accommodated on this multi-use path.

                                     La Palma love to walk.
                                     Developments are encouraged to plan for the pedestrian in site design
                                     and maintenance. The Centerpointe complex has a well-landscaped
                                     sidewalk system that encourages walking instead of driving between
                                     buildings. Regular maintenance of the sidewalk system, particularly in
                                     areas with mature landscaping, is required to ensure public safety.
                                     All streets in residential neighborhoods should facilitate pedestrian
                                     access to nearby destinations, including schools, neighborhood
                                     commercial uses, and outdoor recreation. The design of many
                                     neighborhoods, however, limits connectivity and pedestrian movement
                                     because the streets are cul-de-sacs that provide no outlet to the
                                     secondary arterials. Subdivision boundary walls further restrict access to
                                     the greater street network. The opening of boundary walls at strategic
                                     locations within the neighborhoods—in a manner that continues to
                                     provide neighborhood security—would create improved pedestrian and
                                     bicycle connections citywide.

Transit Services 
The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) provides bus service
within La Palma and the region, with bus routes along Orangethorpe
Avenue (Route 30), La Palma Avenue (Route 38), and Valley View Street
(Route 21). Headways (the time between buses) on these transit lines
range between 45 minutes and one hour.
OCTA routes connect with other transit providers from other cities,
including Long Beach Transit and Long Angeles Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (Metro). OCTA also provides the ACCESS Service,       Transit service in La Palma is 
which is a shared-ride service for people with functional limitations          provided by the Orange County

such as benches at transit stops.

Railroads and Rails‐to‐Trails 
The Pacific Electric right-of-way is a former regional rail route that
extends approximately 20 miles between Orange and Los Angeles
counties; the right-of-way forms the southern boundary of La Palma.
Regional rail service was discontinued decades prior, but regional
planning agencies—spearheaded by efforts of the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG)—continue to explore reuse of the
corridor for public transit. Cities along the route have established interim
uses such as trails and public green space. La Palma supports the full
decommissioning of the right-of-way for rail and transit service, and
embraces the opportunity to convert this space into open space that
would provide for uses such as a bike trail.

                                       continue to enjoy the high level of City services that are a hallmark of La
                                       Palma.
                                       Sewer System 
                                       The City operated the local sewage collection system, servicing more than
                                       4,000 connections and approximately 30 miles of gravity sewer lines.
                                       Wastewater collected in the sewer system flows to regional facilities
                                       operated by the Orange County Sanitation District. La Palma adopted a
                                       Sewer Master Plan in 2013, which considers and plans for the growth
                                       levels associated with this General Plan.
                                       As of 2013, four segments of sewer pipe had been identified as “critical,”
                                       reaching maximum capacity based on computer models. Under future
                                       2030 conditions, an additional three segments may reach critical status.

                                       washers have a direct impact on wastewater generation. Such programs
                                       are designed to have long-lasting, if not permanent, effects on water use
                                       habits. The City anticipates that increases in sewer demands associated
                                       with new development may be offset to a degree by these conservation
                                       efforts. The City will continue to monitor sewer flows and ensure
                                       deficiencies are addressed.

Storm Drains 
Three fully improved and major flood drainage channels flow through the
City: namely Coyote Creek, Moody Creek, and Fullerton Creek. These
regional drainage facilities are managed by the Orange County Flood
Control District. The District has identified areas in La Palma subject to
localized flooding during large storm events. However, no major
deficiencies exist, and the District has no planned storm drain
improvements in La Palma. As indicated in the Conservation Element, new
development projects are required to implement site-specific drainage
improvements needed to minimize and control flows into the storm drain
system, as directed by the City’s Public Works Department.

from its franchisees. It is difficult to gauge the future breadth of wireless
communications, as this industry is ever growing and changing as
technology continues to improve.
Because communications service providers are private enterprises, the
City’s role is focused on improvements to its own communication
systems to support quality services to the community and on quality
service and equal access to telecommunication technologies for all local
users, and on helping businesses attain competitive advantages through
state-of-the-art systems. The City supports the use of continually
evolving communications technology to help local businesses achieve
their goals and improve residents’ connectivity.

Open Space and Conservation 
Element 
The Open Space and Conservation Element focuses City goals to maintain
and expand recreational opportunities, and to protect environmental
quality.
Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Facilities  
The City recognizes that open space and recreational amenities
contribute significantly to community character. As recognized in State
law, open space serves a multitude of functions:
        Preservation of natural resources
        Managed production of resources such as agriculture
        Outdoor recreation
        Protection of public health and safety
La Palma no longer supports any undeveloped natural resources such as
rivers and natural habitat areas for native plants and wildlife. The Coyote
Creek Channel is fully concrete lined. Open space areas consist of
community parks, utility easements, school playfields, and landscaping
included in parkways, medians, and public spaces.
Existing Park and Recreation Facilities 
A total of 13.4 acres in La Palma are designated as Open
Space/Recreation in the Land Use Map, meaning that approximately 1.5
percent of the City is devoted to parkland. Central Park is the largest
park, at 7.5 acres. The park is the center for events and ongoing
recreational and cultural activities for residents of all ages, and is
particularly important as “the” place for after-school recreation.
                                                                                      Central Park
Adjoining Central Park is the Southern California Edison electric power
line easement, a major transmission corridor that has been improved as
an open space/recreation corridor within La Palma. The 75-foot wide
corridor provides a well-used pedestrian connection from adjacent

                              residential areas to schools, recreation centers at Central Park, the
                              library, and to other neighborhoods. Within a segment of the easement
                              is the nearly two-acre El Rancho Verde Park, which contains playscapes
                              and programmed recreation. The City maintains the 24 acres of trails and
                              greenbelt within the easement inside the city limits and owns the
                              playscapes and improvements within the El Rancho Verde Park, but does
                              not own or have decision-making authority over uses in the right-of-
                              way, unless such uses would require a City development or building
                              permit.
        El Rancho Verde Park 
                              The City maintains two mini-parks tucked away in neighborhoods on
                              Denni Street. Denni Street Mini-Park South is 0.3 acres in size and offers
                              a play area for young children. The Denni Street Mini Park North provides
                              grassy areas for passive recreation and connects to the trail within the
                              Edison right-of-way. The City creatively captured available land at the
                              terminus of Denni Street as an opportunity to carve out this much-
                              needed open space.
      Denni Street Mini Park 
                              The City has relationships with the school districts to permit after-school
                              use of the fields and recreation facilities at the five school sites in La
                              Palma. The playground areas and fields at the schools total
                              approximately 54 acres. Due to the partial availability of school recreation
                              facilities to the general public, such facilities are considered adjuncts to
                              the citywide park system.
                              Within the City boundaries, but not very accessible to La Palma residents,
                              are two small parks that are owned and maintained by the City of
                              Cerritos. Rainbow Park and Bettencourt Park comprise a total of 3.6 acres
                              and are located at the intersection of SR-91 and the Coyote Creek

Channel, on the west. There is no direct access to these parks from the
City of La Palma. The parks are adjacent to a neighborhood in Cerritos
and primarily serve Cerritos residents.          Although the parks are
designated in this General Plan as Open Space/Recreation, they are not
considered a part of La Palma’s useable parkland due to the
inaccessibility, lack of City ownership, and periodic closures these parks
experience.
Standards for Parkland and Recreation Facilities 
The City has established standards for three types of parks to serve the
range of recreational needs within La Palma: the Community Park; the
Neighborhood Park; and the Mini-Park.
    Community Park
    A community-level park is typically a 10- to 40-acre site (although
    smaller sized parks can also serve a community park function, as in
    La Palma Central Park) designed to meet the active recreational needs
    of multiple neighborhoods within a two-mile radius. A community
    park typically contains some of the following features: ball fields,
    basketball     courts,   tennis   courts,   play   equipment,    picnic
    tables/barbecues, open grass areas, a trail system, volleyball court,
    recreation buildings or community center, and possibly a gymnasium
    and community swimming pool.
    Neighborhood Park
    A neighborhood park provides for the daily recreation needs of
    residents in the immediate area of the park (or within a half-mile
    radius). The optimum size of a neighborhood park is from three to
    10 acres. The facilities should include open play areas, picnic tables,
    tot lots, paved walkways, and ball fields.
    
    Mini-Park
    The mini-park is a small park site ranging from 2,500 square feet to
    two acres in size. These parks may serve any age group, depending
    upon the characteristics of the neighborhood. They typically include
    open grass areas, play apparatus, benches, and landscaping.
Parks Plans and Policies 
The Parks and Recreation Plan for La Palma is shown on the Park Facilities
and Service Areas Map, Figure 2-8. In addition, Table 2-8, City of La
Palma Existing Parks and Recreation Facilities provides information on
each facility.

Note: Total Parkland represents the total useable park acreage for La Palma residents,
and therefore does not include the 3.6 acres of parkland within the City’s boundaries that
is owned and maintained by, and serves the City of Cerritos (Rainbow Park and Betten-
court Park.
 In 2010, the City adopted a Comprehensive Parks and Recreation Master
 Plan. The Master Plan is intended to be the planning tool staff will use
 when making recommendations to the City Council for future facility
 improvements and for delivering parks and recreation services. Decision-
 makers and staff will use the Master Plan to make and set policies and
 standards that will continue to enhance park facilities for an evolving
 community into the future.
 Park level of service is a ratio of existing park acreage to the City’s
 current population. Through Municipal Code Section 44-1250, the City
 has adopted a standard of four acres per 1,000 residents for parks and
                                                                    T h e   C i t y   S t r u c t u r e 2‐35

                                    recreational purposes. A portion of the standard (1.5 acres) may be
                                    satisfied by the open space/recreational facilities offered by school sites
                                    within the City. The remaining acreage (2.5 acres) is to be provided via
                                    existing City parks and as a condition of development, in accordance with
                                    the La Palma Municipal Code. Private open space for parkland and
                                    recreational facilities may satisfy the dedication requirement for a
                                    subdivision, as stipulated in the Municipal Code.
                                    Applying the adopted standard to the reported 2010 Census population
                                    in La Palma (15,568), a total of 38.92 acres of parkland (not including
                                    school sites) should be provided to the community. An additional 23.35
                                    acres of parkland should be provided on school sites. As indicated in
                                    Table II-5, the City has 9.8 acres of parkland to serve La Palma residents
                                    within parks and 53.9 acres of recreation space on school sites.
                                    Therefore, a current deficit of 29.12 acres of parkland exists within the
                                    community. Given the built-out nature of the community, the City does
                                    not anticipate satisfying the deficit with traditional parkland resources.
                                    The Edison easement and school facilities will continue to be important
                                    supplemental open space and recreation areas.
                                    With regard to future estimated (2030) conditions, this General Plan
                                    would facilitate a population of approximately 17,519 persons in La
                                    Palma. The adopted standard would require a total of 43.8 acres of
                                    parkland to serve this population, as well as at least 26.3 acres of school
                                    recreational facilities.

Conservation 
Natural resources such as water, energy, and clean air are essential
components that contribute to our quality of life. Overuse or damage to
these resources can have widespread environmental and economic
effects.
Several federal and State laws affect how cities in California must address
resource protection. Federal legislation in the 1970s established the
framework for improving air and water quality throughout the nation. In
California, the legislature has enacted environmental laws and
established regulatory agencies to further these directives, most notably
the California Air Resources Board and Regional Water Quality Control
Boards. In addition, significant new State legislation in 2006 and 2008
required that cities and counties specifically and comprehensively
address how their long-range plans will begin to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions toward statewide goals, and how plans will provide for
development patterns that reduce vehicle miles traveled and promote
“smart growth” pursuant to AB 32 (the Global Warming Solutions Act of
2006) and SB 375 (Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act
of 2008).
Water Resources 
Water resources are valuable due to their function as aquatic habitat for
flora and fauna, as well as the provision of drinking water for humans.
Surface Water 
No naturally occurring permanent surface water features exist within La
Palma. Three storm drain channels intermittently carry water: Coyote
Creek, Moody Creek, and Fullerton Creek. These channels are identified
in Figure 2-7 (Park Facilities and Service Areas).
                                                                              The storm drain channels in La

                                                                              pictured here, intermittently 
                                                                              carry water.

                                   Urban runoff consists of water from precipitation and irrigation that has
                                   flowed over non-porous surfaces in dense urban areas, including roads,
                                   roofed structures, parking lots, and any areas covered in concrete or
                                   asphalt. Runoff flows into the surface streams and storm drains in urban
                                   areas, and may contain pollutants and sediment. The pollutants in urban
                                   runoff include landscape pesticides and fertilizers, automobile products,
                                   and degreasers. Urban pollutants degrade water quality and impact
                                   wildlife and plants downstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean.
                                   Control of urban runoff is an important preventative measure to avoid
                                   contamination of both groundwater supplies and local and regional
                                   surface water.
 Pollutants in urban runoff flow 
      into storm drain channels, 
  which drain to the ocean. Best 
      management practices are 
      required to reduce surface 
                 water pollution. 
                                   State and federal regulations work to protect watersheds and recharge
                                   areas. In particular, the Clean Water Act provides control over urban
                                   runoff and storm water discharges through the National Pollutant
                                   Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The NPDES permit program
                                   controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge
                                   pollutants. To comply with permit requirements, the City is required to
                                   implement or require the implementation of the most effective
                                   combination of best management practices for storm water/urban runoff
                                   pollution control.    New development projects will be required to
                                   incorporate best management practices, consistent with the NPDES
                                   permit requirements.
                                   Drinking Water 
                                   As noted above, the City’s own Water Division is the primary provider of
                                   local water services to residents and businesses. The local water supply
                                   comes from two sources. Approximately two-thirds is pumped directly
                                   from the local Lower Santa Ana River groundwater basin managed by the
                                   Orange County Water District. This supply is supplemented by imported

water purchased from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California.
Water Demand and Conservation 
Land use policy allows for residential and commercial business growth,
with a projected population increase of approximately 11 percent at build
out. This is in excess of the projected population identified in the City’s
Urban Water Management Plan, which assumes a seven percent
population increase. In order for the City to maintain a sustainable
supply of potable water, conservation efforts will be implemented, as well
as seeking out alternative sources of replenishment water, such as
treated recycled waste water.
Recycled water (also referred to as reclaimed water) represents an
important resource that can be used to offset use of potable water for
non-potable purposes, particularly for landscape irrigation. As of 2013,
reclaimed water supplies were not available in La Palma. However, a
wastewater recycling plant west of Coyote Creek in the City of Cerritos
represents a future source. Potable water demand could be reduced by
use of this facility. If implemented, a prime opportunity would be to
provide irrigation to the linear park located within the Southern California
Edison power line easement and to Central Park (approximately 30 acres
of open space areas). The many schools located in La Palma also have
extensive field and landscaped areas that present additional
opportunities for recycled water irrigation.
Water conservation represents a cost-effective and environmentally
sound way to reduce current and future water demand. Homeowners and
business owners can take many actions to reduce water use, such as
using water-conserving fixtures and appliances, fixing leaks as they
occur, planting drought-tolerant landscaping, and avoiding unnecessary
water use. The City actively encourages conservation and has added new
options for financing water and energy conservation improvements for
residents and businesses as well as revising codes dealing with the
installation of artificial turf.
Energy Resources 
Local efforts to conserve non-renewable energy resources help achieve
regional and state-wide goals for wise energy use and reduced
greenhouse gas emissions. Residents and the business community can
reduce energy consumption through a variety of relatively easy strategies,
including turning off and unplugging appliances when not in use,
installing insulation, replacing “leaky” windows with more efficient ones,
planting trees to increase shade, and monitoring energy use with smart
monitors. Reducing water use as noted above also saves energy needed
to produce and treat that water.
Conservation can be encouraged by educating and changing user
behavior, rewarding use of energy-saving appliances and light bulbs, and
employing building design and construction approaches, such as
incorporating natural cooling designs and proper insulation, to help
dramatically reduce the use of electric power and natural gas. As noted
                                                             T h e   C i t y   S t r u c t u r e 2‐39

                                    L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                                    above, the City has approved new financing options for residents and
                                    businesses completing conservation projects and has revised its code
                                    regarding fees relating to solar power.
                                    La Palma’s enforcement of California building code energy performance
                                    requirements helps integrate energy conservation efforts into current
                                    building practices. State building codes require, for example, minimum
                                    ceiling, wall, and raised floor insulation, and minimum heating,
                                    ventilating, air conditioning and water heating equipment efficiencies.
                                    Air Quality and Climate Change 
                                    Clean air contributes to healthier living environments. Although air
                                    quality in Southern California has improved dramatically since the 1960s,
                                    we still have some of the most polluted air in the nation. With the
                                    region’s continuing economic expansion and population growth, further
                                    progress to reduce emissions will be needed to guarantee good local air
                                    quality and to achieve State goals regarding reduction of greenhouse gas
                                    pollutants.
                                    According to the California Air Resources Board, more than 90 percent of
                                    California residents breathe unhealthy air during some portion of the
                                    year. Pollutants resulting from transportation sources, such as ozone,
                                    carbon monoxide, and small particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), generally
                                    are the most significant contributors to poor air quality in cities. These
                                    pollutants contribute to major respiratory health effects such as asthma,
                                    lung inflammations, and chest pains and tightness. Diesel trucks produce
                                    large volumes of particulate matter.
                                    Improving air quality requires regional cooperation among cities under
                                    the guidance provided by the South Coast Air Quality Management Board,
                                    as well as localized efforts. The City will continue active participation in
                                    cooperative regional efforts to reduce pollutant emissions.
  Air quality in the South Coast 
         Air Basin has improved 
    dramatically since the 1960s, 
       resulting in many days of 
   bright blue skies in La Palma. 
      Cars and trucks, however, 
      continue to be the primary 
 source of air quality pollutants. 
                                    In addition to air pollution, climate change is an issue of growing concern
                                    and importance. The warming of the Earth’s climate results when the
                                    atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth. Certain gases in the
2‐40  C    o m m u n i t y   B u i l d i n g   E l e m e n t  

                                 L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
atmosphere act like glass in a greenhouse, allowing sunlight to pass but
blocking the heat from escaping into space. While some amount of the
greenhouse effect is essential to life on earth, emissions from burning
fossil fuels, deforestation, and other causes have increased the
concentration of greenhouse gases to ecologically disruptive levels. The
City is working to contribute to greenhouse gas reduction by increasing
its urban forest. The City proactively plants new trees in areas such as
medians and open space.
Scientific models predict that the temperatures world-wide will increase
by between 2.5 to 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit during the twenty-first
century. These global temperature changes are anticipated to trigger
rising sea levels; more extreme weather events, including storms and
floods; more frequent heat waves and increased drought; and increased
potential for tropical insect-borne diseases to penetrate non-tropical
areas. Concerned about climate change, California has adopted a wide
variety of legislation and policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas
emissions across the state. As a result, communities must incorporate
greenhouse gas reduction policies within their planning and policy
documents.
Since greenhouse gas reduction is a cross-cutting issue relevant to
various policy arenas, policies that address land use, transportation,
buildings, and energy are incorporated throughout this General Plan.
Biological Resources 
Biological resources in La Palma are almost nonexistent due to the
urbanized nature of the City and surrounding area. However,
incorporation of plants, trees, and open space contributes to the
character of neighborhoods and districts, and provides habitat for wildlife
adapted to city life. Parks, vegetated streetscapes, large trees, local
easement areas, and neighborhoods support plant life and are home to
song birds.
In addition, increasingly residents of La Palma and similar suburban areas
around the country are having firsthand experience with coyotes in their
yards, parks, and neighborhoods. Other small animals that are
encountered include squirrels, opossums, and raccoons.
Solid Waste Management 
Many landfills in Southern California are quickly
reaching capacity, with new locations sought in the
desert and beyond. Recycling of solid waste and
diverting recyclable materials from landfills help
reduce the environmental costs associated with
expanding and siting new landfills.

Community Building Element 
La Palma recognizes that we all benefit when our community is healthy,
involved, and informed. We seek to foster community building efforts
that are inclusive to all, embrace and protect our assets, including our
great neighborhoods, schools, and local business community, and result
in a healthier La Palma.
Health 
The health of the American public has become one of our biggest
national concerns. National trends have shown increases in health
problems like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease affecting both children
and adults. Studies show that these health problems are partly the result
of factors such as physical inactivity. Having a healthy community is
important to La Palma. To foster a healthy community, La Palma seeks to
create a physical environment that stimulates physical activity and social
interaction, including recreation and outdoor activities, access to healthy
foods and alternative transportation, and community programs that
encourage healthy living.

                                                                               urban agriculture helps keep

The City has long offered diverse recreation and enrichment classes
through the Community Services Department that promote active
lifestyles, encourage exercise and physical activity, and provide organized
athletics for all ages. These programs help influence lifestyle changes,
teaching people to incorporate healthy activities into their daily lives.
The City also recognizes that everyday changes in lifestyle and behavior
can have the most impact on our community health. For example, by re-
evaluating transportation from a health perspective, the City understands
that creating a transportation network that balances multiple modes of
transportation will encourage fundamentally healthy habits such as biking
and walking to school, work or errands. The Circulation Element talks in
more detail about complete streets and alternative transportation modes.
Efforts to revitalize the Town Center will focus on walkability and seek to
achieve a healthier land use option.

                                     content and impacts, they frequently choose a healthy alternative. The
                                     City promotes regulations and programs that make it easier for people to
                                     access fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious food.

                                     The small town of La Palma is served by five K-12 public school districts,
                                     including three elementary districts and two high school districts. Within
                                     La Palma, these districts operate three elementary schools, a junior high
                                     school, and a high school, but not all school children in the City attend
                                     these schools. The city is also part of a community college district,
                                     supports a private university campus within its boundaries, and is nearby
                                     campuses of several other major universities.

A community that values and promotes education and learning benefits
its residents and businesses. An educated community contributes to
economic success, and keeps youth and adults engaged in productive
activities. A high-quality educational system positively influences the
future of La Palma’s children and the City itself. La Palmans place great
value on education; they move to La Palma because of the quality schools
and actively participate in school life.

Governance 
The City of La Palma is administered by a council/manager form of
government. In this system, the elected City Council sets the policy
framework for the City and hires the City Manager and City Attorney. The
City Manager directs the day-to-day operations to implement the
Council’s direction and ensure proper City service delivery. Additional
community representatives serve on commissions and committees
appointed by the City Council. Since these bodies represent all of La
Palma, it is important that their composition reflect the diversity of the
City.
La Palma recognizes that inclusive governance requires extending
involvement beyond City-sponsored groups. For the future, the City
hopes to increase community engagement and supports community
partnerships that engage the community in local decision making
through collaborative forums for input and discussion.
Effectiveness of public participation also depends on our City
government’s responsiveness and accountability. Citizens are part of a
community and decisions strive to be made on behalf of the overall
community good. While not everyone may be pleased with every decision,
the City’s commitment is to conduct fair and objective hearings and
outreach efforts where all sides of an issue can be voiced and will be
considered seriously and where decisions are based on evidence and
community values.

                                      La Palma is committed to fostering a government that embraces
                                      transparency, is fiscally sound, listens to all stakeholders, and makes
                                      decisions that are for the good of La Palma as a whole. The City continues
                                      to review operations, services, and capital needs to improve the City’s
                                      fiscal health over the long term and match costs to the revenues that
                                      support them. In capital projects, focus is on projects where a one-time
                                      investment pays on-going dividends in terms of savings—such as energy
                                      conservation or technology. In operations, we will focus on the best and
                                      most efficient ways of doing things and consistently monitoring our
                                      progress. The City will continue to provide additional opportunities for
                                      dialogue on the City’s finances, and respond to changing financial
                                      conditions with the full input of our community. Care is given to the long
                                      term sustainability of both services and service quality and the financial
                                      resources needed to sustain them.
                                     
        La Palma is committed to

 the good of La Palma as a whole. 
                                      Furthermore, even though most community actions take place at the local
                                      level, many urban problems have widespread influence and require
                                      attention at the regional level. Traffic, noise, air quality, and natural
                                      hazards are regional issues that have local impacts. The City collaborates
                                      with its neighboring communities and regional government bodies to
                                      tackle regional issues and encourages and supports citizen participation
                                      in addressing regional issues as well as raising local concerns and issues
                                      at the local level.

Economic Development 
Local economies do not run on “auto-pilot.” Without conscious and
continuous attention to La Palma’s economy, its competitive resources,
advantages, and quality of life can quickly dissipate. While each
community’s role in economic development may differ, the goals are
essentially similar—sustain and increase employment, private capital
investment, and revenue generation. Building our City’s income (profits
and tax revenues, secured for the community through its economic
development initiatives) is the only way to maintain a sustainable
economic base and the services that supports. A sustainable economic
base is measured by the ability of a community to attract private
investment that brings a return on investment to the community on a
reoccurring basis. Private investment, attracted by healthy returns, is the
only way to increase tax revenues sufficient to address the City’s public
service requirements without increasing its taxes.
The pressure to provide essential public services in the face of
constraints on public finances has created aggressive competition
between neighboring communities to attract new private investment.
Therein lies the reason a community needs to constantly pay attention to
supporting economic development opportunities and initiatives—local
economies are in a constant state of change. All types of businesses are
constantly adjusting as a result of market trends, disruptions,
capitalization, management decisions, and new regulations. Some are
particularly susceptible to business cycles, while others are driven by
regional or global demands. The important thing to remember is this: it
is the competitive position of these businesses that will determine
whether La Palma’s economic base is growing or declining.

                                      Land Uses and the Economy 
                                      The City of La Palma is part of the larger Orange County economy, which
                                      is projected to intensify as a business and employment destination within
                                      the Southern California region. This General Plan establishes policy to
                                      make effective use of property resources to best serve diverse economic
                                      and social needs of the community, and also to benefit from broader
                                      economic growth within the surrounding region.
                                      As part of the 2012-2014 General Plan update, a market study was
                                      completed to assess the local market potential for retail, lodging, medical
                                      services, and local opportunity areas. The market assessment found that
                                      significant potential exists to recapture La Palma resident retail spending
                                      that is currently lost to other cities, in the form of both anchor retail and
                                      non-anchor facilities. Furthermore, a significant lodging/hotel demand
                                      exists, which could support a new high-quality hotel in the city. The City
                                      maintains both an Economic Development Plan and an Economic
                                      Development Action Plan which provide details of its assets, liabilities and
                                      anticipated actions in support of a sustainable future.
                                      As of 2013, La Palma had a concentration of medical facilities located
                                      near the town core, including both a hospital and incidental medical
                                      offices. The changing healthcare industry has reduced demand for
                                      hospital capacity and the adjacent medical office space, which has
                                      resulted in vacancies and declining use of property. At the same time,
                                      significant medical industry growth has occurred in other areas of the city
                                      such as Centerpointe. To respond to these future trends, the General Plan
                                      calls for creation of a town center to foster reinvestment in this area.
Centerpointe’s balanced land use 
          plan includes additional 
    opportunities for hotel, retail, 
       office, and residential uses. 
   Pictured here is the La Quinta 
 hotel located at the Centerpointe 
                          campus.  
                                      The City’s best opportunities for economic development lie in more
                                      intense use of freeway-oriented properties to maximize on long-term
                                      regional economic growth and revitalization of the Town Center. Mixed-
                                      use development can be an effective way to bolster long-term retail and
                                      housing opportunities in La Palma.

Long‐Term Fiscal Sustainability 
To maintain the high quality of life and community amenities that
residents expect, La Palma will need to continue its good fiscal
management and maintain consistent revenue sources to fund City
services. The General Fund, which provides the most significant source of
revenue for local services and improvements, is funded largely by the
dollars generated by the City’s economic base and revenue structure
(sales tax, transient occupancy—or hotel—tax, and property tax). Future
development creates new opportunities to enhance and diversify the
City’s revenue stream, and to provide resilience through future economic
cycles. Recent legislation eliminating redevelopment as an economic
development tool intensifies the pressure on other avenues to encourage
such development.

City Structure Goals & Policies                                      
 
The following goals and policies define the direction we will take as a
community to shape our physical development.
Land Use Element Goals and Policies  
GOAL LU‐1:             In decision‐making, prioritize maintenance 
                       of a quality of life characterized by pride of 
                       property maintenance, personal and property 
                       security, and individual opportunity.
Discussion: This goal reflects the essential values that are shared by La
Palmans. It drives all of the other goals and policies in the General Plan.
That is why we emphasize the use of the General Plan in our decision-
making process.
Policy LU‐1.1 Cite the General Plan in recommendations and land
                use and development decisions.
Discussion:     The General Plan is to be used for guidance during the
                regular City decision-making processes. Otherwise, it
                cannot significantly affect achieving our vision for La
                Palma. We expect that staff reports, City budgets, and
                other official documents will consistently show General
                Plan consistency is achieved.
Policy LU‐1.2  Consider both the long- and short-range benefits in
                the review of development proposals, as well as
                multiple areas of benefit in achieving consistency
                with the General Plan. 
Discussion:     The City faces some major decisions regarding
                important improvements over the next several years. In
                addition, we recognize that the General Plan seeks
                improvements in several areas. That means that we
                sometimes have to balance several goals against each
                other and reach a compromise. Finally, some degree of
                synergy may be possible by looking at issues more
                broadly, rather than in isolation. This could involve
                combining several small actions into a single strategy.
                The General Plan is a living document, and
                implementation can occur incrementally.
Policy LU‐1.3 Require that new development be visually and
                functionally compatible with existing           residential
                neighborhoods and commercial areas.

                             Discussion:    La Palma consists of stable, high-quality residential
                                            neighborhoods that constitute a significant part of the
                                            City’s character. Without land use controls and
                                            development standards, new development could encroach
                                            on these areas and diminish the quality of life in these
                                            neighborhoods. Appropriate transitions to residential
                                            neighborhoods from nearby commercial areas are
                                            paramount.
                             GOAL LU‐2:             Promote a true small town atmosphere that 
                                                    is recognized as a prospering, 
                                                    contemporary, living environment. 
                             Discussion: We are interested in being a small town with strong
                             community values. This goal is not about image making but about
                             having an authentic image that reflects who we really are. We want to
                             be reminded of the strengths of this community to help sustain the
                             efforts required to maintain and enhance its qualities.
                             Policy LU‐2.1 Clearly and consistently identify the City in a variety
                                              of places throughout La Palma and on all official
                                              documents.
                             Discussion:      We have designed and implemented a system of images
                                              for use on City entrance monuments, newsletters, and
                                              other formats in which it is desirable to convey a
                                              consistent, graphic symbol of our City. We would like
                                              that symbol reinforced as much as possible, even in
                                              private and institutional use as long as that use of the
                                              image is approved by the City in advance. While this is a
                                              symbolic action, it is a constant reminder of the kind of
                                              community we are and aspire to be.
                             Policy LU‐2.2 Foster the City’s small town character throughout
                                              community improvements, City-sponsored activities,
                                              and communications with residents and the business
                                              community.
                             Discussion:      One of the most appealing characteristics of our City is
                                              its small town atmosphere.        This is so for several
                                              reasons: our small physical size and relatively modest
                                              population, the numerous community activities and
                                              events that have become a strong tradition, and the
                                              comfortable feeling of many residents who know each
                                              other because they have lived here a long time. We
                                              cherish these qualities and want to be reminded of them
                                              regularly.

Policy LU‐2.3 Maintain the City’s traditions and allow the evolution
                 of others.
Discussion:      The popular La Palma Days celebration is a highlight of
                 the year for us. With this policy, we make a commitment
                 to continue to support ways of involving our citizens in
                 activities that bring them together. The policy also
                 embodies our efforts to enhance our community in a
                 variety of ways to build on the qualities of what is
                 already here.
Policy LU‐2.4 Promote businesses that serve the community well.
Discussion:      We have a great many businesses that provide valuable
                 services to our residents or offer convenience that would
                 be hard to replace. We want those businesses and
                 others like them to prosper and will seek benefits on
                 their behalf so that they can continue their support for
                 our community. We will cooperate with business leaders,
                 the Chamber of Commerce, and others who are
                 dedicated to the continued health of our economic base.
 
 GOAL LU‐3:             Ensure the quality and maintenance of public 
                        and private development. 
Discussion:      We expect property owners—residential and non-
residential—to maintain their properties in excellent condition. Most of
us in the community do that already. A few do not. When property
shows evidence of neglect, we will take the steps necessary to reverse the
condition before blight sets in. This is just a matter of each of us taking
responsibility for our portion of the community and continuing the
standard that is already set.
Policy LU‐3.1 Continue code enforcement activities to ensure
                 proper maintenance of homes, buildings, yards, and
                 neighborhoods in all areas of the City, and work with
                 businesses and homeowners to gain compliance.
Discussion:      Although most of La Palma’s neighborhoods and
                 commercial businesses are stable and attractive, it is
                 important to maintain a high level of maintenance
                 standards to prevent deterioration that would impact
                 property values and the overall character of the City.
Policy LU‐3.2 Undertake education regarding the Code Enforcement
                 Policy and pursue violations in a firm, but fair
                 manner to enable property owners to improve their
                 properties without undue hardship.

                             Discussion:     We will seek to identify signs of neglect early so that
                                             corrective measures are neither unduly expensive nor
                                             time consuming.         At the same time, we expect
                                             community standards to be met and will insist that
                                             property be brought into compliance with City
                                             requirements if the property owner chooses to default on
                                             his/her responsibility.
                              
                             Policy LU‐3.3 Encourage high-quality design for infill development,
                                             and continue to support new high-quality uses.
                             Discussion:     The City of La Palma is built out; as such, all
                                             development opportunities are on infill or underutilized
                                             properties. High-quality design that is sensitive to
                                             neighboring properties and gracefully transitions
                                             between uses will be required on these sites.
                             Policy LU‐3.4 Maintain and improve streetscapes along arterial
                                             streets to contribute to the quality of the built
                                             environment, with particular emphasis on paving,
                                             sidewalks, landscaping, and walls. Overhead utilities
                                             may be placed underground at various locations as
                                             funding permits.
                             Discussion:     Both residents and visitors receive a major part of their
                                             impression of the City from the quality of the
                                             streetscape. Some portions of our public rights-of-way
                                             are not attractive and need repairs. The extensive use of
                                             block walls on the edge of residential neighborhoods
                                             along the highways creates an unattractive appearance in
                                             many portions of the City. These public spaces need to
                                             be improved and maintained in a condition more
                                             appropriate to the desired quality of the City.
                              
                             Policy LU‐3.5 Maintain programs that bring positive recognition to
                                             property owners/occupants who do an exceptional
                                             job of maintaining and enhancing their properties.
                             Discussion:     One of the ways we prefer to stimulate property owners
                                             and occupants to maintain their property is to recognize
                                             those who do an excellent job of it. This approach is
                                             intended to generate even more neighborhood pride
                                             than the relatively high level that currently exists.
                             GOAL LU‐4:            Continue to encourage and facilitate a mix 
                                                   and diversity of land uses that meet the 
                                                   economic, environmental, educational, and 
                                                   social needs of the City while remaining 
                                                   sensitive to La Palma’s small town character.

Discussion: The City has very little vacant land left for development. The
City has tailored the land use plan to facilitate redevelopment and exciting
destinations in areas where it would have the least impacts to existing
residential neighborhoods. We believe the current pattern of residential
neighborhoods, as of 2014, serves us well, and we do not seek to change
it significantly. Minor infill development of a consistent character is
anticipated in residential areas. Expansion or revitalization of existing
uses and a new mix of uses within areas designated Mixed Use–Business
will account for the remaining development potential in the City.
Policy LU‐4.1 Establish consistency between the Land Use Plan and
                  the Development Code.
Discussion:       To facilitate clarity, the Land Use Plan and the
                  Development Code (including the Zoning Map) will be
                  consistent. The Development Code will be updated so
                  that the zoning provisions comply with the General Plan.
Policy LU‐4.2 Rely on district-wide density and intensity standards
                  to ensure consistency between land use potential and
                  traffic capacities of the arterial street system and
                  other public facilities and services limits.
Discussion:       There is little flexibility in expansion of our highways
                  and other public facilities. This General Plan allows for
                  limited new growth, concentrated within the Mixed Use-
                  Business district. The City will consider such measures as
                  transfers of development rights to incentivize
                  development while ensuring that traffic congestion can
                  be kept to a minimum and overloading of public facilities
                  can be avoided.
 
Policy LU‐4.3 Protect neighborhoods from the encroachment of
                  incompatible activities or land uses that may have a
                  negative     impact       on    the    residential   living
                  environment.
Discussion:       La Palma is composed of stable, high-quality residential
                  neighborhoods that constitute a significant part of the
                  City’s character. Without land use controls, new
                  development could encroach on these areas and
                  diminish the quality of life in these neighborhoods.
                  Where new commercial or industrial development is
                  allowed adjacent to residentially zoned districts,
                  maintain standards for circulation, noise, setbacks,
                  appropriate transitions, landscaping, and architecture, to
                  ensure compatibility between the uses.
 
Policy LU‐4.4 Prohibit land uses that are not compatible with
                  residential development south of SR-91; locate them
                  on the north side of SR-91.

                             Discussion:     A number of non-residential uses are supportive of our
                                             residential neighborhoods and, with appropriate design
                                             and development standards, can be quite compatible
                                             with them. Examples include schools, churches,
                                             neighborhood commercial centers, utilities, and similar
                                             uses. Our experience is that others are not as
                                             compatible. Examples include uses that generate
                                             excessive truck traffic, adult entertainment uses, and
                                             generators of unusual levels of noise or vibration. We
                                             prefer that these uses be located where they have good
                                             access to the freeway system and do not impact
                                             residential neighborhoods.
                              
                             Policy LU‐4.5 Promote new land uses that contribute to economic
                                             development so long as they do not impinge upon
                                             residential neighborhoods and our quality of life.
                             Discussion:     We seek to attract solid businesses to our community to
                                             provide services and goods to our citizens, provide jobs
                                             for our workforce, and contribute to the revenue needed
                                             for public facilities and services. The pattern for these
                                             uses is well established in La Palma, and new
                                             opportunities are presented through the expanded
                                             Mixed Use-Business area. We can envision allowing
                                             limited expansion of existing uses and accommodation
                                             of new uses where it can be demonstrated to us that
                                             they will not have a negative impact on our residential
                                             areas. Our primary objective is to ensure that the
                                             residential quality of our community is preserved.
                              
                             Policy LU‐4.6 Promote the continuation of businesses that serve
                                             the community well.
                             Discussion:     We have a great many businesses that provide valuable
                                             services to our citizens or offer convenience that would
                                             be hard to replace. We want those businesses and
                                             others like them to prosper and we will seek benefits on
                                             their behalf so that they can continue their support for
                                             our community.         We will cooperate with business
                                             leaders, the Chamber of Commerce, and others who are
                                             dedicated to the continued health of our economic base.
                              
                             Policy LU‐4.7 Require that new development projects provide their
                                             full fair share of the improvements necessary to
                                             mitigate project generated impacts on the circulation
                                             and infrastructure systems.
                             Discussion:     Given the limited amount of developable land and the
                                             continued need to expand the City’s economic base,
                                             redevelopment of incompatible and underutilized uses
                                             will be the primary form of growth in the City. However,

                                 L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                 it is also necessary to understand all short- and long-
                 term impacts of new development, and to require
                 developments to pay their fair share of associated costs.
 
Policy LU‐4.8 Require that effective buffer areas be created
                 between land uses that are of significantly different
                 character or that have operating characteristics which
                 could create nuisances along a common boundary.
Discussion:      As targeted properties are redeveloped, it is important
                 that sensitivity to neighboring residential properties be
                 duly considered through appropriate transitions and site
                 plans that concentrate noise and views away from
                 residential neighborhoods.
 
Policy LU‐4.9 Encourage the maintenance and preservation of
                 historically,     culturally,   and/or    architecturally
                 significant structures and sites in the community.
Discussion:      While our community is relatively young, having been
                 constructed mostly during the 1960s, we have a strong
                 sense of history and community that we will continue to
                 embrace.
 
GOAL LU‐5:              Create a thriving Town Center as the heart of 
                        the City, with healthy civic and commercial 
                        office areas supported by high‐quality open 
                        spaces. 
Discussion: Our town has historically lacked a true “downtown.” The de
facto downtown has been our gracious Central Park. To build on this
excellent recreational resource, a new town center will create additional
places for community gathering and supporting uses.
Policy LU‐5.1 Maintain and enhance the centralized public function
                 of the Town Center, accommodating land uses that
                 support activity at the heart of our community.
Discussion:      A key focus of the General Plan is to encourage the
                 creation of a true Town Center. The General Plan
                 provides opportunities for a variety of uses in this area,
                 with a focus on pedestrian connections to civic and open
                 space amenities. Creating an identifiable center is
                 important in placemaking; building on the City’s existing
                 civic functions at the Town Center and the Central Park is
                 a viable way to create a meaningful place with
                 appropriate land uses.

                             Policy LU‐5.2 Facilitate revitalization of aging and underutilized
                                             properties in the Town Center by working with
                                             property owners, developers, local businesses, and
                                             other community organizations to coordinate efforts.
                             Discussion:     Large properties in the Town Center occupied by vacant
                                             or severely underutilized buildings are prime targets for
                                             reuse and reinvestment. Revitalization of these
                                             properties will assist in maintaining a healthy, strong tax
                                             base and provide improved commercial services and
                                             destinations for surrounding residential neighborhoods.
                              
                             Policy LU‐5.3 Require buildings and sites in the Town Center
                                             vicinity to be designed to encourage pedestrian
                                             activity through street character, plazas, and other
                                             features and amenities that enhance our Town Center
                                             aesthetic and functionality.
                             Discussion:     A true Town Center is a walkable, enjoyable place to be,
                                             which draws community activity and interaction.
                                             Through the use of creative design and accommodating
                                             public spaces, we can foster the Town Center’s
                                             functionality, providing a means for gathering,
                                             recreating, and governing.
                              
                             Policy LU‐5.4 Provide accessible plazas and public spaces in the
                                             Town Center.
                             Discussion:     A key ingredient to a town center is the “town square” or
                                             local gathering place. Existing public spaces such as the
                                             Memorial Garden at City Hall and the amphitheater in
                                             Central Park provide such opportunities. As our Town
                                             Center is enhanced over the years, we want to ensure
                                             that we have a variety of places to gather and host our
                                             City celebrations. Plazas and public spaces can be of
                                             varying size and create both intimate, outdoor rooms
                                             and larger spaces that could accommodate public
                                             gatherings.
                              
                             GOAL LU‐6:            Maintain a premier destination north of 
                                                   Orangethorpe Avenue, complete with hotels, 
                                                   major office spaces, research and technology 
                                                   facilities, and the potential for residential 
                                                   buildings. 
                             Discussion: To accommodate more office and complementary uses in La
                             Palma, the area north of Orangethorpe Avenue is planned as the City’s
2‐58  G o a l s   a n d   P o l i c i e s  

                                 L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
premier office district and gateway center. The proximity to the SR-91
freeway will benefit workers, as well as reduce potential traffic impacts on
local streets south of Orangethorpe Avenue. The General Plan encourages
excellence of design, integrated uses, and sustainability through mixed-
use development.
Policy LU‐6.1 Encourage development in the Mixed Use-Business
                 District that incorporates appropriate intensity and
                 design excellence for this important gateway to La
                 Palma.
Discussion:      Orangethorpe Avenue is a major gateway into the City
                 from SR -91; consequently, development in this area is
                 critical to the City’s image. Future office, business, and
                 mixed-use development at this gateway location,
                 particularly as visible from the freeway, should be
                 appealing, eye-catching, and take advantage of freeway
                 frontage for economic benefits. The inclusion of certain
                 iconic design elements can also foster a unique identity
                 for the City of La Palma as seen from the freeway.
Policy LU‐6.2 Accommodate uses in the Mixed Use-Business
                 District that provide for the City’s long-term fiscal
                 stability and that appeal to a regional market. As
                 centers age, re-evaluate and/or encourage properties
                 to update and renovate, thereby capturing the latest
                 development and design trends.
Discussion:      The Mixed Use-Business District is intended to
                 accommodate        a    well-designed,   business-friendly
                 environment that can be enjoyed by employees, visitors,
                 and residents. The City’s location and high quality of life
                 present opportunities for attracting a range of
                 commercial establishments. To foster opportunities for
                 attracting desirable uses, these areas should also offer
                 high-quality quasi-public spaces that connect buildings,
                 parking areas, sidewalks, streets, and transit. These
                 quasi-public spaces and landscaping should be
                 maintained and remain on the cutting edge to draw and
                 maintain top companies.
 
Policy LU‐6.3 Preserve areas designated for light industrial uses,
                 while ensuring that potential negative impacts to
                 surrounding uses are mitigated.
Discussion:      There is limited space for industrial activities in La
                 Palma; those areas that are designated industrial should
                 be retained as such to ensure a diversified economic
                 base and the availability of industrial jobs. However,
                 potential negative impacts, including aesthetics and
                 especially noise, can be an issue for surrounding
                 neighbors. The City will require that new and renovated
                 industrial properties continue to be maintained, and will
                                                             T h e   C i t y   S t r u c t u r e 2‐59

                                             work to help maintain good neighbor relationships
                                             among land uses.
                              
                             Policy LU‐6.4 Establish adequate public infrastructure to support
                                             Mixed Use - Business as a premier destination.
                             Discussion:     Adequate public infrastructure is an essential element of
                                             successful economic development and the ability to
                                             support projected land use demands. As uses intensify in
                                             the areas surrounding Centerpointe, we will need to
                                             continue to assess infrastructure capacity. In addition,
                                             the infrastructure throughout our City will continue to
                                             age and require maintenance and updating from time to
                                             time.
                              
                             Policy LU‐6.5 Support new residential development in the Mixed
                                             Use - Business district to foster a diversity of uses. 
                              
                             Discussion:     To complement the existing commercial and industrial
                                             uses, Mixed Use-Business will also accommodate
                                             residential development. Additional residential in the
                                             northern portion of the City will help create a lively and
                                             diverse atmosphere, removed from the lower-density

                             Policy LU‐6.6 Review proposals for new mixed-use development to
                                             ensure adherence       to  the  following   factors    and
                                             principles: 
                              
                                                Comprehensively       design     developments       to
                                                 effectively integrate housing with local-serving
                                                 convenience and neighborhood shopping centers,
                                                 open space, and other uses appropriate for
                                                 neighborhoods.
                                                Emphasize pedestrian orientation in site and
                                                 building      design,   promoting      a    walkable
                                                 environment with active street frontages, well-
                                                 scaled buildings, and usable site spaces.
                                                Create lively streetscapes, interesting urban
                                                 spaces, and attractive landscaping.
                                                Provide appropriate transition between heights,
                                                 intensities, and land uses as appropriate to
                                                 minimize neighbor compatibility conflicts.
                              
                             Discussion:     Mixed-use developments can provide an opportunity for
                                             a variety of housing types, open space, and attractive
                                             neighborhood-serving commercial uses, within a
                                             pedestrian-friendly context. Comprehensively planning
                                             such developments affords opportunities to critically
                                             think about potential impacts on neighbors, and reduce
                                             these through careful site design and performance
                                             standards.

and Policies
GOAL CI‐1:             Support a safe and efficient circulation 
                       system in La Palma. 
Discussion:     Keeping the roads safe for motorists, bicyclists, and
pedestrians will always be a high priority for us. Even though the arterial
roadway system is complete and there are only a few areas where
improvements are warranted, we want the City to properly maintain the
streets and sidewalks. Traffic on most of our streets is not too congested,
but we are concerned about speeding, particularly on Walker Street,
Moody Street, and La Palma Avenue, and especially around schools. In
places where congestion is a problem, either now or in the future, we
should anticipate and budget for roadway improvements—including
making sure that new developments pay their fair share of necessary
modifications.
Policy CI‐1.1 Maintain a Level of Service “D” or better at all
                 intersections and roadways under the sole control of
                 the City, during peak hours, except that LOS E may be
                 permitted at the Valley View Street and La Palma
                 Avenue intersection and LOS E may be permitted
                 along the roadway segment between Walker St
                 between Orangethorpe Ave & Houston Ave.
Discussion:      Level of Service “D” is typically considered tolerable if
                 limited to the peak hour periods when traffic flows are
                 heaviest.    These performance standards may require,
                 but are not intended to mandate, roadway and/or
                 intersection widenings. They represent goals used to
                 monitor traffic conditions and to assess traffic impacts
                 of development projects. Because LOS standards apply
                 only to vehicular mobility and do not account for
                 enhanced pedestrian movement or other modes, the City
                 will not use them as the sole criteria for judging
                 transportation     system      performance.      Pedestrian
                 convenience, transit access and operations, urban
                 aesthetics, and other factors will also be considered.
Policy CI‐1.2 Maintain roadway surfaces, traffic signals, street
                 signage, sidewalks, parkways, and medians in safe
                 conditions.
Discussion:      The City regularly allocates a portion of its annual
                 budget to street maintenance and improvements. We
                 will need to continue to pay attention to conditions as
                 roads, sidewalks, and facilities continue to age and are
                 affected by uprooting from mature trees. Roadways are
                 regularly resurfaced and restriped.

                             Policy CI‐1.3 Require that development of new private driveways
                                             do not introduce significant traffic conflicts along
                                             major streets and residential collector roads.
                             Discussion:     As new development is proposed, we will need to
                                             carefully consider the location of driveways for these
                                             developments, to ensure that traffic safety is maintained.
                              
                             Policy CI‐1.4 Coordinate with school districts to provide for safe
                                             pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular access to and
                                             around schools.
                             Discussion:     We recognize the importance of proper planning and
                                             continued vigilance with regard to safe pedestrian,
                                             bicycle, and vehicular access to schools. La Palma will
                                             continue to coordinate with the local school districts to
                                             identify traffic issues in the vicinity of all schools within
                                             the City, and to develop workable traffic relief plans such
                                             as possible designated student pick-up times and pick-
                                             up zones.
                              
                             GOAL CI‐2:             Require that new development mitigate 
                                                    transportation impacts and contribute to 
                                                    improvement of the City’s transportation 
                                                    system. 
                             Discussion:     The traffic in our town moves fairly smoothly, with the
                                             exception of a couple of problem intersections. As
                                             regional growth increases through-traffic in La Palma,
                                             and new development places additional drivers on our
                                             streets, it will be necessary to complete improvements to
                                             the roadways to ensure good traffic flow occurs. The
                                             cost of these improvements must be borne by new
                                             development.
                             Policy CI‐2.1 Require the cost of transportation mitigation and
                                             improvements necessitated by new development be
                                             borne      by     new     development—including        non-
                                             automobile solutions—through the Traffic Impact Fee
                                             Program.
                             Discussion:     The mitigation of traffic is a responsibility that is shared
                                             by all new development. Working with developers to fully
                                             integrate all modes of transit is a proper step in that
                                             direction. New development projects subject to the
                                             California Environmental Quality Act will be required to
                                             assess traffic impacts associated with their project and
                                             complete mitigation measures as needed to ensure level
                                             of service standards are achieved. Furthermore, the City
                                             will establish a Traffic Impact Fee Program to ensure that

                adequate funds are available to pay for necessary
                improvements down the line.
 
Policy CI‐2.2 Require that new and substantially renovated office,
                retail, industrial, institutional, and multi-family
                residential developments include bicycle, pedestrian,
                and transit amenities on site, as applicable.
Discussion:     To encourage the use of other modes of transportation
                besides the automobile, a full network of infrastructure
                is necessary. This includes appropriate bicycle parking,
                walkable site plans that actively link to other
                destinations, and transit amenities such as bus shelters,
                benches, and other streetscape elements as appropriate.
 
GOAL CI‐3:             Provide an integrated and balanced multi‐
                       modal transportation network of complete 
                       streets to meet the needs of all users. 
Discussion: Complete Streets mean that the needs of all users are taken
into account, with a focus on connectivity and getting people where they
want to go safely, efficiently, and by any mode of transportation they
choose.
Policy CI‐3.1 Facilitate the design of streets where people walking,
                 parking, shopping, bicycling, working, and driving
                 can cross paths safely.
Discussion:      A primary goal of the complete streets initiative for La
                 Palma is to give La Palmans of all ages and abilities
                 safer, cheaper, and healthier travel options. For
                 example, where feasible, we hope to widen sidewalks
                 to improve the pedestrian environment and provide
                 space for necessary infrastructure, amenities, and
                 streetscape improvements. As we enhance opportunities
                 for nonmotorized travel, care will need to be taken to
                 ensure our streets remains safe for all users.
Policy CI‐3.2 Implement adopted street design standards. Modified
                 standards may be applied where appropriate on
                 arterial corridors to provide for transit, bicycle
                 facilities, sidewalks, and on-street parking and be
                 context-sensitive to adjacent land uses.  Design the
                 character and scale of the uses along the street to
                 support its Complete Streets designation.
Discussion:      The standards for various roadway types have been
                 established to accommodate the forecast traffic volumes
                 and functions of the roadways in La Palma. Where
                 roadways are identified to have excess capacity, such as
                                                            T h e   C i t y   S t r u c t u r e 2‐63

                             L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                                             Houston Avenue, the City supports implementation of a
                                             road diet, enhancing alternatives to the automobile.
                             Policy CI‐3.3 Support the creation of new pedestrian ways through
                                             our residential neighborhoods.
                             Discussion:     The suburban design of our town makes for fantastic,
                                             quiet neighborhoods. However, due to the many cul-de-
                                             sacs and block walls dividing neighborhoods from
                                             arterials, pedestrian access can be limited. Where
                                             supported by residents, the City supports the creation of
                                             pedestrian access ways through neighborhoods.
                              
                             Policy CI‐3.4 Actively advocate for greenspace, trails, and bicycle
                                             facilities on the Pacific Electric right-of-way. Clearly
                                             state the City’s opposition to transit along this
                                             corridor.
                             Discussion:     The City of La Palma is encouraging a “no build”
                                             alternative as regional groups consider potential transit
                                             options along the Pacific Electric right-of-way. Such
                                             transit would bring unwanted noise to our existing quiet
                                             single-family neighborhoods that directly abut the right-
                                             of-way. Instead, La Palma advocates for a healthy active
                                             linear park, including pedestrian and bicycle facilities.
                              
                             Policy CI‐3.5 Lobby actively for the widening of the La Palma
                                             Avenue bridge over Coyote Creek.
                             Discussion:     La Palma Avenue is reduced to two lanes as it crosses
                                             Coyote Creek. The City supports widening this bridge to
                                             provide additional automobile capacity. In addition, any
                                             widening should consider alternative modes of
                                             transportation.
                              
                             Policy CI‐3.6 Develop new bike paths and enhance existing bike
                                             paths.
                             Discussion:     For a City of its size, La Palma has a solid bicycle route
                                             system in place, including the regional bike path along
                                             Coyote Creek, bicycle routes around town, and the
                                             multi-use path along the Edison easement. We
                                             encourage the continued maintenance of these routes,
                                             and seek to make them more visible in the roadway
                                             hierarchy.

Discussion: Maintaining infrastructure capacity to meet the current and
future local needs will be an ongoing priority. Areas already identified,
through documents such as the Sewer Master Plan, as needing
improvements must be addressed. Equally important, each of these
infrastructure systems must be assessed with regard to any new
development proposed to ensure adequate capacity remains.
Policy CI‐4.1 Implement        sewer     system     improvements       and
                operational recommendations identified in the Sewer
                Master Plan 2013, and as it may be updated from
                time to time.
Discussion:     The Sewer Master Plan identifies potential areas of
                maintenance or needed expansion. Whereas regular
                maintenance can be supported through the City’s Capital
                Improvements Program, the impact of any future
                redevelopment (densification) project within the City
                should be evaluated using the City’s computer model to
                assess the impacts to the capacity of the City’s collection
                system. Where impacts are triggered by a particular
                development, require that developers pay their fair share
                of infrastructure improvements. Furthermore, upstream
                users may be adversely impacting the City’s collection
                system and unnecessarily or inappropriately reducing the
                capacity of downstream sewers. The City will exercise its
                legal authority to enforce the sewer system’s proper
                operation on both the public and private sides of service
                connections.
Policy CI‐4.2 Use the annual capital improvement plan process to
                identify immediate, near-term, and longer-term
                funding priorities for water system improvements.
Discussion:     The City’s water system infrastructure is in good
                condition. The City will continue to inspect infrastructure
                on a regular basis and schedule improvements as
                needed.
 
Policy CI‐4.3 Continue to consult and coordinate local storm water
                system improvement projects           with   the   Orange
                County Flood Control District.
Discussion:     The City’s three major flood control facilities are
                managed by the Orange County Flood Control District.
                The City will continue to consult with this regional
                agency with regard to both water quality and facilities’
                needs.
 
Policy CI‐4.4 Support efforts to develop and utilize improved
                state-of-the-art communications technologies in a
                manner that minimizes visual and environmental

                                              government, business, education, and public safety.
                             Discussion:      Undergrounding of utility lines and regulations on
                                              placement of communications towers ensure that
                                              communication technologies are accessible in the City,
                                              yet the aesthetics of our community are protected. The
                                              City will continue to analyze future communications
                                              technology improvements and adjust policies and
                                              regulations as necessary to accommodate new
                                              technologies and ensure visual and environmental
                                              impacts are mitigated while providing access to these
                                              important technologies throughout the community.
                             Policy CI‐4.5 Maintain safe neighborhoods with well-lighted and
                                              maintained streetlights.
                             Discussion:      La Palma is known for the safety of its neighborhoods.
                                              To continue to maintain our high levels of safety, we
                                              want to actively maintain streetlights so that burned out
                                              and broken lights are expediently replaced and the
                                              financial and energy resources required for the system
                                              are used as efficiently as possible.

                                                    community.  
                             Discussion: High quality parks and recreation facilities contribute to La
                             Palma’s quality of life. Retention of open space areas and consistent
                             provision of recreational opportunities for our residents is a high priority.
                             In many ways both Central Park and the Civic Center complex function as
                             our “downtown.” The La Palma Promenade within the Southern California
                             Edison easement provides both recreational opportunities and pedestrian
                             and bicycle access to our town center. A quality park and recreation
                             system will remain a primary goal as our community matures.
                             Policy OS‐1.1 Maintain       and improve existing parkland              and
                                              recreation facilities, as the City budget permits.
                             Discussion:      While La Palma has limited possibilities for expanding
                                              open space and recreation areas, given the largely built-

              out condition of the city, the open space and recreation
              areas that do exist are highly valued resources. We need
              to make the most of our existing open-space and
              recreation resources, which means that increasing
              maintenance or replacing equipment is required in
              certain locations. We are interested in safety, usability,
              and attractiveness of recreation buildings, restrooms,
              landscaping, trails, tables/benches, tot-lot equipment,
              ball fields, and other sports facilities.
Policy OS‐1.2 Continue to pursue improvements to Central Park as
              envisioned in the City of La Palma Parks and
              Recreation Comprehensive Master Plan and future
              updates.
Discussion:   The Parks and Recreation Comprehensive Master Plan
              provides guidance on the revitalization of our all-
              important Central Park. The Master Plan included
              extensive public outreach and feedback; future
              improvements       should    reflect    what   stakeholders
              envisioned and incorporated into the Master Plan or
              future updates.
Policy OS‐1.3 Provide new recreation facilities (for either passive or
              active use) as the City budget permits.
Discussion:   The Community Services Department should prioritize
              the purchase of new recreation facilities based on
              demand. During our annual budget review and capital
              improvement planning, we will consider the allocation of
              funds to build or improve facilities and purchase new
              equipment.
 
Policy OS‐1.4 Coordinate with governmental and other entities to
              improve open space resources on school grounds
              and utility rights-of-way.
Discussion:   School grounds are important to us from both a visual
              and recreational standpoint. With this policy, we will
              seek to assist school districts in improving school
              grounds. This may involve the planting of trees and
              shrubs, re-striping courts, assisting with the purchase of
              new play equipment and play surfaces, and improving
              the sports fields. We will consider providing financial
              assistance, materials, or labor for such improvements
              (including volunteer labor and donations, or some
              combination thereof). This approach will go a long way
              towards enhancing the open-space resources in the
              community, as well as improving the working
              relationship with the school districts.

                             Policy OS‐1.5 Encourage the conversion of abandoned or out-of-
                                             service railroad rights-of-way for compatible
                                             recreational purposes such as trails, greenbelts,
                                             linear parks, etc.
                             Discussion:     The Pacific Electric right-of-way extends 20 miles
                                             between southern Los Angeles County and northern
                                             Orange County. The right-of-way runs along the
                                             southwest border of the City of La Palma. The City of La
                                             Palma opposes the use of this right-of-way for
                                             transportation or transit purposes, as it will interfere
                                             with the quality of life for local residents. A more
                                             appropriate use of the space would be to provide
                                             opportunities to enhance the right-of-way as a linear
                                             greenway, a dog park, a museum for purposes of
                                             increasing the very limited amount of open space
                                             available to La Palma residents.
                             Policy OS‐1.6 Explore alternative uses for parklands on the west
                                             side of Coyote Creek. Work cooperatively with the
                                             City of Cerritos to support uses on these properties
                                             that are to the benefit of both jurisdictions.
                             Discussion:     While technically located within the City’s boundary,
                                             these parks are owned and maintained by the City of
                                             Cerritos, and there is no direct access from La Palma to
                                             these parks.

                             Discussion: The City of La Palma enjoys a high rate of residents
                             participating annually in City recreation programs. These policies allow
                             for the continued expansion, improvement, and maintenance of
                             sustainable community services so that future La Palma residents can
                             enjoy what many residents value today.
                             Policy OS‐2.1 Pursue meeting the recreation needs of the
                                             community by offering activities and working with
                                             community organizations and committees to make
                                             available programs that provide leisure service
                                             benefits to residents of the community.
                             Discussion:     As noted in the Parks and Recreation Comprehensive
                                             Master Plan (2010), recreational programs are highly
                                             valued by residents. Programs should be designed so
                                             that they facilitate the following benefits: creating a
                                             sense of community and unique sense of place,
                                             socialization, healthy lifestyles, personal growth,

Policy OS‐2.2 Plan and conduct community special events that
                  bring residents.
Discussion:       Special community events can enrich residents’ lives
                  and bring residents and workers together in La Palma to
                  enhance the feeling of community. These events can
                  also attract residents from neighboring cities and
                  provide an opportunity for the City to market the
                  benefits of living and working in La Palma.
Policy OS‐2.3 Continue broad-based public outreach activities to
                  inform residents of all available recreational and
                  educational programs and services, and obtain input
                  from the community regarding program and service
                  needs.
Discussion:       As noted in the Master Plan of Parks (2010),
                  recreational programs are highly valued by residents. A
                  variety of types of programs are desired; these should
                  be advertised widely to ensure their use. Furthermore,
                  as residents’ preferences and recreational trends may
                  shift over time, it is important to reach out to the
                  community to determine priority needs on a continuing

                        respond to and support the needs of City 
                        residents and businesses. 
Discussion:      Water conservation through reduced use, efficiency,
reclaimed water, and the control and treatment of runoff pollution is
critically important not only for La Palma, but the entire region. Reduced
water consumption lessens reliance on potentially unreliable foreign
water supplies and, locally, leaves more water in natural groundwater
systems to benefit the local environment. Maintaining and improving
water quality is essential to protect public health, wildlife, and the local
watershed. Water conservation and pollution prevention can be
dramatically improved through proactive efforts of residents and through
City policies.
Policy OS‐3.1 Allow for construction of new development only
                  when it can be demonstrated that sufficient water is
                  available over the long term to supply that
                  development.

                             Discussion:     Potable water supplies are finite, a fact which becomes
                                             obvious in the arid Southern California climate. Our
                                             water supplies rely on local groundwater as well as a
                                             significant amount of imported water. Current plans
                                             anticipate a moderate increase in population and
                                             nonresidential development; however, the City must
                                             analyze development projects as they are proposed that
                                             could exceed available water supplies. The City will
                                             develop a new development tracking system and
                                             continue to update the Urban Water Management Plan on
                                             a five-year basis, as the primary information and
                                             planning tool used to assess water supply adequacy.
                             Policy OS‐3.2 Take steps to reduce water use from municipal
                                             operations. 
                             Discussion:     The City is committed to leading by example, acting as a
                                             model to the business community and residents by
                                             reducing water usage. The City will seek new ways to
                                             conserve water, including assessing landscaping areas
                                             for appropriate planting and watering equipment, and
                                             low-flow fixtures.
                              
                             Policy OS‐3.3 Require new buildings and encourage owners of
                                             existing buildings to pursue strategies for water
                                             conservation.
                             Discussion:     Water conservation strategies can include drought-
                                             tolerant landscaping, efficient irrigation systems, on-site
                                             storm water capture and recycling systems, low-flow
                                             plumbing fixtures and access to improvements
                                             financing. The City encourages the conversion of water-
                                             intensive landscape areas to landscaping options that
                                             use climate-appropriate plants, efficient irrigation
                                             systems, and water efficient site maintenance.
                              
                             Policy OS‐3.4 Explore funding options to facilitate the use of
                                             recycled water to irrigate public uses and utility
                                             corridors, with priority given to irrigation of the
                                             Edison easement.
                             Discussion:     West of the Coyote Creek Channel is a wastewater
                                             recycling plant in the City of Cerritos. The cost of tying
                                             in to the system and crossing the channel is estimated at
                                             $1 million, which does not include installation of new
                                             piping for recycled irrigation water to destinations.
                                             Funds have not been allocated, and grants or other
                                             outside funding are necessary to facilitate this project.

Policy OS‐3.5  Fulfill the City’s responsibilities relative to the
                  requirements of the County’s NPDES permit program
                  by enforcing regulations aimed at reducing
                  groundwater and urban runoff pollution.
Discussion:       As an NPDES co-permittee, the City is responsible for
                  ensuring best management practices are employed to
                  reduce pollution. The City regulates control of urban
                  pollutants to storm water runoff through provisions in
                  the Municipal Code.
 
GOAL OS‐4:             Encourage the use of sustainable practices to 
                       reduce energy use and help curb global 
                       climate change. 
Discussion: State Assembly Bill 32, the California Global Warming
Solutions Act (California Health and Safety Code §38500) requires
California to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions levels to 1990 levels by
2020. To meet this state-wide target, local communities must assess
their development patterns and local efforts to contribute to greenhouse
gas reduction, including continued cooperation with state and regional
agencies addressing this far-reaching issue.
Policy OS‐4.1 Encourage the use of solar energy systems in homes
                 and commercial businesses.
Discussion:      There are many opportunities to take advantage of the
                 City’s sunny location with more aggressive adoption of
                 solar energy systems. The City supports the installation
                 of solar energy systems in neighborhoods and business
                 districts.
Policy OS‐4.2  Serve as a role model by incorporating the use of
                 sustainable strategies for new and existing public
                 buildings.
Discussion:      Energy conservation and sustainable building practices
                 maximize occupant health and productivity, minimize
                 operating costs, and provide good environmental
                 stewardship. Utilizing available energy resources in the
                 most efficient manner possible provides benefit to all of
                 us. The City will serve as a role model in energy
                 conservation and related issues.
 
Policy OS‐4.3  Promote energy-efficient design features, including
                 but not limited to appropriate site orientation, use of
                 light-colored roofing and building materials, and use
                 of deciduous trees to reduce fuel consumption for
                 heating     and    cooling    beyond     the   minimum
                 requirements of the California Green Building Code.

                             Discussion:     California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 11, the
                                             California Green Building Standards Code (CALGreen), is
                                             the first state-adopted green building code in the nation.
                                             CALGreen contains mandatory requirements for new
                                             construction and substantial remodels. Additional
                                             voluntary measures are listed in CALGreen to further
                                             encourage sustainability. The City will promote
                                             integration of these voluntary measures, as appropriate,
                                             through the planning and building approval process.
                              
                             Policy OS‐4.4 Adopt practices that minimize the amount of
                                             materials entering the waste stream. Encourage
                                             recycling and composting in all sectors of the
                                             community.
                             Discussion:     Excessive product waste, building and construction
                                             waste, and landscaping materials can enter landfills
                                             when many of these materials should be reused,
                                             recycled, and composted. Methane from landfills is a
                                             known greenhouse gas source.   Furthermore, local
                                             landfills are slowly being filled to capacity. It will become
                                             costlier (and create more greenhouse gas emissions) to
                                             transport waste to disposal sites farther away.
                              
                             Policy OS‐4.5 Support tree planting and the planting of more
                                             vegetation (including native and drought-resistant
                                             planting).
                             Discussion:     As trees grow, they take carbon dioxide out of the air
                                             and transform it into roots, leaves, bark, and wood. At
                                             the same time, by providing shade and transpiring water,
                                             trees lower air temperature and thereby cut energy use—
                                             reducing the production of carbon dioxide a power
                                             plants where fossil fuels are burned. Vegetation, and
                                             especially native and drought-tolerant planting, helps
                                             reduce the heat-island effect and lowers temperatures
                                             so that less energy-intensive cooling is required in our
                                             homes and businesses. The City maintains an active
                                             urban forestry program.
                              
                             Policy OS‐4.6 Collaborate with State and regional agencies to
                                             improve air quality and implement State air quality
                                             and climate change goals.
                             Discussion:     Air quality is the preeminent regional issue—there are no
                                             boundaries to air quality or climate change impacts. The
                                             City will continue to consult with state and regional
                                             agencies to participate and cooperate in the
                                             implementation of laws and efforts to increase air quality
                                             and respond to climate change.

Community Building Element Goals and 
Policies 
GOAL CB‐1:              Provide all La Palma residents the 
                        opportunity to make healthy lifestyle choices. 
Discussion: Access to healthy food and exercise are key components of
a healthy lifestyle. We support access to healthy, fresh goods in all public
activities. Furthermore, by providing a walkable and bicycle-able town,
we encourage our residents to integrate healthy actions into their daily
activities.
Policy CB‐1.1 Encourage physical activity in residents of all ages.
Discussion:       Public education and proactive prevention are the most
                  effective ways of deterring serious health problems.
                  Physical activity can be encouraged through various
                  efforts such as developing and providing health-oriented
                  classes; encouraging walking to school; maintaining
                  recreational programs that stress physical activity;
                  continually supporting City-sponsored events that get
                  people out and active; and providing convenient access
                  to parks, schools, and other outdoor spaces.
Policy CB‐1.2 Consider health and active lifestyles when making
                  land use and transportation decisions.
Discussion:       The most effective means of creating a healthy
                  community in La Palma is to establish a “healthy”
                  physical infrastructure through the implementation of
                  multi-modal transportation networks and walkable
                  neighborhoods and destinations. As evidenced in both
                  the Land Use Element and the Circulation and
                  Infrastructure Element, the City’s priority is to re-
                  establish walkable neighborhoods such as the Town
                  Center and support a variety of travel modes.
Policy CB‐1.3 Consider all opportunities to encourage access to
                  healthy food.
Discussion:       The City of La Palma supports increasing access to
                  healthy, locally grown foods by invigorating the
                  community’s interest in farmer’s markets, community
                  and school gardens, home-grown foods, and convenient
                  access to local supermarkets. Local farmers markets
                  provide support for farmers in the region and provide an
                  opportunity for the community to purchase fresh, locally
                  grown foods, as well as temporary gathering spaces for
                  residents. Community gardens have many benefits,
                  including reducing food budgets for families, providing
                                                            T h e   C i t y   S t r u c t u r e 2‐73

                                                healthy foods options, and providing another form of
                                                recreation space to the community. Finally, residents can
                                                also contribute to their healthy food stock by growing
                                                their own edible gardens.
                             GOAL CB‐2:               Continue to foster cooperative arrangements 
                                                      with public agencies to enhance public 
                                                      services, facilities, and schools, enabling a 
                                                      high quality of life for our residents. 
                             Discussion: Because our City is small and is on the edge of the County,
                             it is essential that we seek out opportunities to collaborate with others in
                             achieving our own objectives. An example is the fact that, despite our
                             small size, we are served by five school districts. Because educational
                             opportunity is so important to our residents, we want to collaborate as
                             much as possible with these districts to represent the interests of our
                             students and families. In addition, other regional entities can make
                             decisions that have a significant impact on our quality of life. As such,
                             coordination with these groups is paramount to provide our input and
                             negotiate the best alternatives for La Palma.
                             Policy CB‐2.1 Support joint powers agreements, memorandums of
                                                understanding, and other formal and informal
                                                arrangements with other local governmental agencies
                                                where such agreements generate mutual benefits.
                             Discussion:        There are many ways in which we have worked or could
                                                work with school districts and other cities in
                                                implementing shared services and programs of value to
                                                them and to La Palma. An example is the joint funding
                                                of projects with the City of Cerritos to widen and
                                                improve the bridges on Moody Street and Orangethorpe
                                                Avenue over the Coyote Creek Channel, demonstrating
                                                mutual benefits.      Creativity in forming cooperative
                                                agreements would give our City greater leverage in
                                                serving its citizens without diminishing our identity. In
                                                addition, it allows us to obtain benefits to the
                                                community from a limited land resource that cannot be
                                                expanded.
                             Policy CB‐2.2 Coordinate with Southern California Association of
                                                Governments,         Caltrans,      Orange        County
                                                Transportation Authority, the South Coast Air Quality
                                                Management District, and other public agencies to
                                                ensure that actions taken by these agencies do not
                                                adversely affect La Palma’s quality of life or are
                                                inconsistent with the policies contained in the
                                                General Plan.
                             Discussion:        While La Palma has decision-making power over many
                                                local land use decisions, a multitude of other public

                agencies can make decisions and establish policies and
                local changes that can affect our quality of life and built
                environment. It will be necessary to maintain ongoing
                coordination to provide our point of view and ensure La
                Palma’s priorities are considered in the planning
                process. The City will need to help agencies understand
                the importance of the defining components of La Palma’s
                character and the potential impacts of their actions on La
                Palma. This will be especially important as use
                alternatives are considered for the Pacific Electric right-
                of-way, currently vacant. La Palma does not support the
                establishment of transit or transportation along this
                right-of-way beyond pedestrian and bicycle modes.
 
Policy CB‐2.3 Coordinate with the school districts to further the
                City’s goal of improved access for all La Palma
                residents to high-quality educational opportunities
                that satisfy each individual’s needs, desires, and
                potential.
Discussion:     The impact of having five school districts is that students
                in some areas have a home school located outside of the
                city limits. Much community discussion over the years
                has centered on finding a way for students located north
                of Houston to attend schools physically located within La
                Palma. While the City of La Palma has no jurisdiction to
                effectuate such an adjustment, the City recognizes the
                value of high-quality education and embraces an open
                conversation with schools to best serve La Palma
                residents.
Policy CB‐2.4 Foster systems of interjurisdictional communications
                and development review, and provide that such
                review respects the values of adjacent municipalities
                and equitably distributes both the benefits and
                impacts associated with a given project.
Discussion:     As new development occurs on our boundaries, we will
                be subject to potential impacts. The City will maintain
                open conversations and working relationships to ensure
                La Palma understand the views and values of others and
                that La Palma’s concerns are voiced and addressed in the
                larger context of our metropolitan area.
 
GOAL CB‐3:             Ensure that City deliberations and decisions 
                       involve and reflect the needs of all members 
                       of our community. 
Discussion: The opinions and passions of all La Palma residents matter
in governance. For those who have time to engage in civic activity, the
City has ready access to information provided by these people. However,
                                                            T h e   C i t y   S t r u c t u r e 2‐75

                             extra effort is needed to reach out to residents who are equally
                             impassioned but, due to family and job commitments or because of
                             language barriers or mobility limitations, cannot and do not engage in
                             civic activities.
                             Policy CB‐3.1 Develop and implement strategies to involve and
                                               engage City residents whose voices are not
                                               traditionally heard in the planning process. Particular
                                               attention should be given to those issues that
                                               directly affect the residents.
                             Discussion:       The City’s Korean population has historically been
                                               absent from many political decisions. The City seeks to
                                               encourage input from all residents and City stakeholders
                                               and will identify barriers to public participation, and
                                               develop implementation to overcome these barriers. New
                                               technologies can offer avenues for more expansive
                                               community participation and transparency, especially for
                                               youth and tech-savvy residents.
                             Policy CB‐3.2 Implement transparency in decision making.
                             Discussion:       Transparency in decision making is a cornerstone of
                                               effective governance. All La Palmans need to have access
                                               to materials that illustrate how and why particular
                                               decisions have been made and documents describing the
                                               plans on which activities are based, especially those
                                               dealing with services and financial resources.
                             GOAL CB‐4:              Achieve and maintain a high quality of life 
                                                     for La Palma residents by developing a 
                                                     diverse economic base and maintaining long‐
                                                     term fiscal sustainability. 
                             Discussion: The La Palma community considers a balanced City budget
                             an important fiscal goal, ensuring the City’s longevity and prosperity. The
                             City will plan for balanced income and expenditures to maintain fiscal
                             solvency. A healthy local economy is one that is home to diversified
                             businesses and industries that serve local and regional needs, and one
                             that supports a highly trained and educated workforce. To create and
                             sustain a healthy and diverse economy, a city must have the support
                             systems that attract businesses: a variety of available housing and
                             mobility options, a high level of community amenities, and adequate
                             infrastructure to serve technologically advanced businesses. With these
                             vital elements in place, La Palma can attract, retain, and facilitate growth
                             of local businesses, which in turn will allow the City to remain fiscally
                             sustainable and thus able to continue providing high levels of public
                             services and many community programs. Furthermore, a variety of local
                             destinations and shopping choices for residents will enhance our quality
                             of life.

Policy CB‐4.1 Develop     and adhere to a robust economic
              development strategy that focuses on business
              attraction and retention to facilitate the land use
              opportunities provided by the General Plan.
Discussion:   In 2012, the California legislature and courts ended
              redevelopment across the State. Redevelopment had
              been an excellent source of revenue to combat blight
              and invest in infrastructure and facilities. Without
              redevelopment, it is more important than ever that the
              City encourage land use decisions that are fiscally
              responsible and positively affect the City’s economic
              health by creating jobs, generating tax revenue, and
              involving private capital investment. In addition, to
              achieve the necessary economic diversity and fiscal
              soundness, the City will need to maintain a
              comprehensive Economic Development Strategy. In the
              absence of a cohesive Redevelopment Agency with an
              economic development mission, the City’s other
              departments will need to work together to achieve
              economic development goals.
 
Policy CB‐4.2 Encourage a pattern of development that balances
              revenue-generating land uses.
Discussion:   A balanced land use base is crucial to maintain variety
              for shopping options, a strong fiscal tax base, and jobs
              for our residents and regional economy. A diversified
              economy is the best way to ensure continued high levels
              of local services and amenities.
 
Policy CB‐4.3 Explore the attraction of new retail anchors and
              sectors to help diversify the City’s economic base and
              provide shopping opportunities for residents.
Discussion:   It is important for residents and workers to have local
              access to a range of retail needs. The market study
              prepared for the General Plan indicated strong retail
              anchor potential in La Palma for a drug store and grocery
              store, and very strong potential for bedding and
              housewares, auto parts, sporting goods, book/media,
              and office supply stores. Diversifying the City’s retail
              options will also provide for a steady stream of sales tax
              revenue that is more resilient in economic downturns,
              compared with retail that is focused just on one sector.
 
Policy CB‐4.4 Support high-quality professional and corporate
              office environments north of Orangethorpe Avenue.
Discussion:   To encourage highly-skilled office and other office uses,
              the City will continue to support established office
              clusters north of Orangethorpe Avenue. Such support
                                                          T h e   C i t y   S t r u c t u r e 2‐77

                                             will include maintaining consistently high design
                                             standards for new office development, encouraging
                                             supporting retail and service uses as appropriate, and
                                             continuing tenant- and business-attraction efforts
                                             through the Economic Development Strategy.
                              
                             Policy CB‐4.5 Expand lodging choices in the City through the
                                             recruitment and placement of a full-service hotel.
                             Discussion:     The market study completed for the General Plan update
                                             indicated market potential for 180 hotel rooms by 2016
                                             and 350 hotel rooms by 2020. A full-service Class A
                                             hotel facility will remain a priority goal for the City of La
                                             Palma.
                              
                             Policy CB‐4.6 Work with the business community to generate
                                             innovative ideas and strategies that will ensure the
                                             City’s continued economic viability.
                             Discussion:     Understanding the structure of the local economy and its
                                             dynamics is essential for formulating public policies that
                                             maintain and improve economic vitality. Outreach and
                                             data collection are necessary components to grasp an
                                             effective understanding of existing local economic
                                             conditions. To achieve this, the City of La Palma actively
                                             engages in conversations with our La Palma businesses.
                                             The General Plan provides opportunities for the
                                             expansion of existing businesses and introduction of
                                             new business in the City. It will remain important to
                                             maintain a dialog with local business stakeholders to
                                             best understand their needs to facilitate innovations and
                                             success.
                              
                             Policy CB‐4.7 Encourage the location of revenue-generating uses
                                             and structures in appropriate locations. 
                             Discussion:     As municipal revenue shortfalls may occur from time to
                                             time, it is important to develop innovative ways to
                                             continue contributions to our General Fund to maintain
                                             our highly valued City services. Potential revenue sources
                                             may include such avenues as digital billboards or other
                                             advertising mechanisms. When placing these structures,
                                             it will be important to identify locations that are
                                             separated from residential neighborhoods and provide
                                             context sensitivity.
                              
                             Policy CB‐4.8 Improve the City’s presence along the SR-91 freeway
                                             corridor. 
                             Discussion:     Our strategic location at the border of Los Angeles and
                                             Orange Counties, with frontage along a major regional

  freeway is an asset to our community. To best maximize
  on this asset, the City will improve the visual
  appearance,    permit    an   increased   intensity   of

  on a regional scale. Uses that do not benefit from
  freeway frontage are discouraged from locating here.

Community Safety 
Introduction 
One of the City’s highest priorities is to have a safe and secure
community. This Community Safety chapter sets forth goals and policies
to protect and safeguard La Palma residents from urban fires, crime,
hazardous materials incidents, flooding, earthquakes, and exposure to
excessive noise levels.

                                   Public Health and Safety Element  
                                   Providing a high level of public safety is a community core value. Low
                                   crime rates and safe neighborhoods have been cited as one of the
                                   primary reasons people choose to live and raise their families in La
                                   Palma.
                                   Fire Protection 
                                   The City of La Palma contracts with the Orange County Fire Authority for
                                   fire protection services and operates Fire Station 13. The Authority is a
                                   regional fire service agency that serves 23 cities in Orange County and all
                                   unincorporated areas in Orange County. For La Palma, the Authority
                                   provides fire suppression, fire prevention planning, emergency medical
                                   response, hazardous materials response, and rescue services. In addition,
                                   the Authority offers a variety of other services such as public education,
                                   disaster planning and coordination, fire prevention inspections, building
                                   plan review, hazardous materials disclosure program management, fire
                                   investigation, and emergency dispatch and communications.
                                   Fire Station 13, located at 7792 Walker Street in La Palma, is our first
                                   responding station for emergency responses. Other responding agencies
        Established in 1970 and    are Station 12 (on Walker Street in the City of Cypress) and Station 61 (on
  comprised of three Captains,     Western Avenue in the City of Buena Park). Given the Authority’s regional
          three Engineers, three   presence, services are provided without regard to jurisdictional
    Firefighters, Fire Station 13  boundaries. In addition, the agency maintains automatic and mutual aid
     proudly serves La Palma.      agreements with neighboring jurisdictions should the need for additional
                                   resources arise.
                                                         The fire protection level of risk in La Palma is
                                                         minimal since the City is largely developed and
                                                         supports traditional suburban-scale development.
                                                         Existing buildings facilities have been constructed in
                                                         compliance with fire codes and thus are not
                                                         considered high fire hazards. Orange County Fire
                                                         Authority personnel conduct annual inspections of
                                                         nonresidential uses to ensure compliance, and
                                                         residential inspections are provided upon request.
                                   Fire-flow requirements are adequate for established development
                                   throughout the City to meet fire suppression needs. The water reservoir
                                   located at 8415 Meadowlark Lane, together with a supplemental two-
                                   million-gallon reservoir located at Walker Street and Fresca Drive, create
                                   a system that provides the pressures and volumes necessary for all fire-
                                   fighting needs. The City proactively involves Authority personnel in the
                                   review of new development proposals to ensure compliance with
                                   standards for water supply, minimum road width, and emergency access.

Law Enforcement Services 
Almost since its founding, the City of La Palma has maintained its own
police department. The La Palma Police Department historically has been
a full-service police agency providing general law enforcement, traffic
enforcement, community policing programs, parking enforcement, SWAT
team, investigations, school anti-drug and alcohol instruction, crime
prevention and disaster response planning and training. In addition, the
Police Department provides feedback on proposed development through
the Planning Review and implementation processes for new developments
and conditional uses.
                                                                           Our law enforcement 
                                                                           personnel work to ensure 
                                                                           that we have one of the 
                                                                           safest communities in 
                                                                           Orange County.
The City’s aim is to provide a very high level of law enforcement services
to the community, to maintain a safe and healthy environment, and to
educate all residents on how they can help contribute to a safe city.
Flooding Hazards 
Historically, Orange County experienced intermittent widespread
flooding. Storm drain improvements maintained by the Orange County
Flood Control District generally provide relief from the flooding. Along
the City’s western edge, flood control systems are managed by the Los
Angeles County Public Works Department.
Flood Zones
Flood zones are geographic areas, or zones, that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has defined according to varying levels of
flood risk. These zones are depicted on Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
where each zone reflects the severity or type of flooding. The entire City
of La Palma—like most of Orange County—is categorized as Zone X,
                                             C o m m u n i t y   S a f e t y   E l e m e n t         3‐3

                                L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                                identified as a moderate to low flood hazard risk area. Zone X signifies
                                areas between the limits of the base flood (100-year flood) and the 500-
                                year flood. The 100-year flood is defined as that flood event that has a
                                one percent chance of occurring in any one year.
                                The FEMA designation implies that the City could be subject to flooding
                                during an unusually heavy rainfall event. The three drainage channels
                                that run through La Palma—Coyote Creek, Moody Creek, and Fullerton
                                Creek—are fully improved for flood control purposes and are designed to
                                handle most rainfall conditions. The County agencies responsible for
                                these facilities routinely monitor their integrity. In addition, the City has
                                adopted a floodplain management ordinance aimed at promoting public
                                health, safety, and general welfare, and minimizing public and private
                                losses due to flood conditions in specific areas.
        Flood control drainage 
     channels for Coyote Cree, 
            Moody Creek, and 
  Fullerton Creek are concrete 
      lined through La Palma. 
                                Dam Inundation 
                                Inundation from four different dam facilities could potentially result in
                                flooding in La Palma in the event of dam failure. These dams are Brea
                                Dam, Carbon Canyon Dam, Prado Dam, and Whittier Narrows Dam. Figure
                                3-1 identifies potential inundation areas. Dam failure can result from a
                                number causes such as earthquakes, rapidly rising floodwater, and
                                structural design flaws. Dam failure can occur instantaneously or very
                                gradually depending on the source of the failure. These events have the
                                potential to cause loss of life, damage to property, and other ensuring
                                hazards, as well as the displacement of persons residing in the
                                inundation path. The four dams cited above have all been improved for
                                seismic safety purposes, so the risk of dam failure is considered to be
                                relatively low.

                          Brea Dam is located in the city of Fullerton, approximately six miles from
                          La Palma. Carbon Canyon Dam is located over 11 miles away. The
                          inundation areas for these two dams would generally affect areas north of
                          SR-91. Failure of Whittier Narrows Dam, located 12 miles north along the
                          San Gabriel River, would have limited impact, as the floodwaters would
                          barely reach La Palma’s western boundary. Prado Dam, over 25 miles
                          away along the Santa Ana River in Riverside County, poses the most risk.
                          If an inundation event were to occur, floodwaters could affect most of
                          northern Orange County and inundate all of La Palma.
                          Prado Dam was completed in 1941. In 1999, the completion of Seven
                          Oaks Dam upstream from Prado Dam, along with other flood protection
                          features along the Santa Ana River, provided increased flood protection to
                          Orange County.
                          Localized Flooding Concerns 
                          Groundwater levels in Orange County range from a high of about 300
                          feet above mean sea level (MSL) to a low of 80 feet below MSL in the
                          coastal areas. In La Palma (elevation 46 feet above MSL), water table
                          levels are high throughout town, which has caused localized flooding and
                          building design concerns. Groundwater levels here are typically around
                          34 to 38 feet above MSL, which equates to approximately 5 to 13 feet
                          below grade.
                          Geologic/Seismic Hazards 
                          This section describes the presence and characteristics of seismic
                          conditions in La Palma.
                          Earthquake Faults 
                          While no active or potentially active faults are located within the City of La
                          Palma, the entire Southern California region is considered to be
                          seismically active. A number of earthquake faults cross within 15 miles of
                          the City, including the Los Alamitos, Newport-Inglewood, Huntington,
                          and Whittier-Elsinore faults. Regional earthquake faults are shown in
                          Figure 3-2, Regional Faults. In addition, the San Andreas and San Jacinto
                          faults—major fault zones that affect the region—are located some
                          distance from La Palma, but have the potential to deliver large magnitude
                          earthquakes that could affect the City.
                          Similar to the rest of Southern California, scientists have little doubt that
                          the City will experience future earthquakes of various magnitudes, with
                          impacts ranging from minimal to severe. Ground shaking with moderate
                          to high lateral ground accelerations would be the primary effect of
                          earthquake activity, with loss of soil support due to liquefaction (see
                          below) also occurring in some areas.

Liquefaction 
Liquefaction describes a condition where a water-saturated or partially
saturated loose, sandy soil looses cohesion due to ground shaking,
causing the soil to behave like a liquid. Building foundations located on
such soils, when not properly secured, could fail as the result of a major
earthquake. According to the Seismic Hazard Zones map (Los Alamitos
Quadrangle) published by the California Geological Survey, the entire City
of La Palma is located within a Liquefaction Hazard Zone. Areas located
within Liquefaction Hazard Zones generally have these conditions and/or
are where historic occurrences of liquefaction conditions indicate a
potential for permanent ground displacement.
The Liquefaction Hazard Zone designation does not mean that all areas
within the zone will necessarily experience liquefaction, nor does it mean
that they should be excluded from development. Instead, the zone
delineation is intended to identify areas where the potential for damage is
great enough to require further evaluation and potential mitigation. The
State Seismic Hazards Mapping Act requires preparation of a geotechnical
report prior to the approval of most new development projects where
such conditions are present. In addition, a disclosure statement must be
provided prior to the sale of property within a Liquefaction Hazard Zone.

                                Hazardous Waste 
                                Hazardous materials and chemicals are used daily in households and
                                businesses throughout La Palma. Not limited to the popular conception
                                of large chemical and industrial factories, sources of hazardous materials
                                can originate from seemingly innocuous places such as service stations,
                                dry cleaners, medical centers, and almost any industrial business.
                                Hazardous waste is any material with properties that make it dangerous
                                or potentially harmful to human health or the environment. Hazardous
                                waste can take the form of liquids, solids, contained gases, or sludge,
                                and can be the by-products of manufacturing processes or simply
                                discarded commercial products, like cleaning fluids and pesticides.

                                waste discharge. The State Water Resources Control Board and the
                                Regional Water Quality Control Boards are responsible for controlling
                                nonpoint pollution sources. Coordination among local, regional, and state
                                agencies is important to ensure that dischargers are appropriately
                                regulated and that new developments employ best management practices
                                to reduce potential pollutant discharges.

                                reactive ingredients are referred to as household hazardous waste.
                                Products such as paints, cleaners, oils, batteries, florescent light bulbs,
                                and pesticides contain potentially hazardous ingredients. These products
                                require special care in their disposal, as improper methods such as
                                pouring them down drains, onto the ground, or into storm sewers, or
                                throwing them out with household trash can pollute the environment and
                                pose a threat to human and animal health.

                           Community Emergency Response Team 
                           La Palma operates a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT)
                           training program. CERT was created to help fulfill the need for a well-
                           trained civilian emergency work force. The primary goal of CERT is to
                           train residents to care for themselves, their family, and neighbors, and
                           then to assist the overall neighborhood during an emergency.
                           CERT provides an opportunity for residents to learn basic skills to save
                           lives and protect property in the aftermath of a major disaster when
                           traditional emergency response resources may be limited or not
                           immediately available. The training program provides for community
                           self-sufficiency through the development of multi-functional teams, who
                           will act as an adjunct to the City’s emergency services team during major
                           disasters.

                           La Palma participates in AlertOC, a mass notification system designed to
                           keep Orange County and La Palma residents and businesses informed of
                           emergencies and certain community events. Residents and businesses
                           that register with AlertOC receive time-sensitive voice messages, text
                           messages, and/or e-mails with crucial information regarding an
                           emergency or event.

Noise Element 
Noise generally is defined as unwanted or objectionable sound. Too much
noise can negatively impact fundamental aspects of daily life, from our
thoughts and conversations to restful sleeping. Because extreme
exposure to noise can be damaging to health or even distracting enough
to cause accidents, it is also a public safety issue. Of particular concern is
the impact of noise on sensitive uses: residences, hospitals, schools, day
care centers, and similar uses.
Noise can be generated by sources in a known location, such as freeway
and highway traffic noise, railroads, or aircraft overflights. These are
considered noise sources with long-term, relatively permanent impacts.
Noise is also generated from variable locations, such as yard equipment
or power tools, loud music, construction activities, or even excessively
noisy parties. The more predictable sources can be addressed in part by
separating sensitive uses from noise sources. This can be effective
because noise decreases as a function of distance from the source. In
some cases, such as along busy freeways, sound barriers are necessary.
The City of La Palma is fortunate in that relatively few fixed sources of
noise exist in the community and generally, there is excellent separation
of sensitive uses from them. The SR-91 freeway separates the City’s
primary commercial hub from residential neighborhoods. Although the
freeway itself is a source of noise, its elevated profile through the City
and buffering by commercial uses from most residences mitigate its
impacts. Arterial highways generate noise as well, but the estimated
increase in traffic from infill development will have negligible increase in
noise from that source. Consequently, the long-term noise environment
is not expected to change enough to be noticeable. Even the Town Center
area is buffered from single-family neighborhoods by Central Park and
multi-family and assisted living uses. Neighborhood commercial uses are
generally located at corner properties, limiting noise impacts on at least
two sides of the property.
 
Noise Metrics 
Sound intensity is measured and expressed by decibels (dB), with an
adjustment referred to as the A-weighted measure to correct for the
relative frequency response of the human ear. Of all the various scales
available for measuring noise, the A-weighted sound pressure level (dBA)
is the scale of measurement that is most useful in community noise
measurement. The A-scale approximates the frequency response of the
average ear when listening to most ordinary everyday sounds.
Decibels are measured on a logarithmic scale and the system of
measuring sound gives a rough connection between the physical intensity
of sound and its perceived loudness to the human ear. For example, a
10-decibel increase in sound level is perceived by the human ear as only
doubling of the loudness of the sound. Ambient sounds in the urban
                                               C o m m u n i t y   S a f e t y   E l e m e n t 3‐11

                               L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                               environment generally range from 30 dBA (very quiet) to 100 dBA (very
                               loud).
                               A key factor in whether sound is interpreted by the listener as noise is the
                               time of day or night during which the sound is heard. Generally speaking,
                               all other things being equal, sound is more “noisy” at night than during
                               the daytime.
                               A given level of noise may be more or less tolerable depending on the
                               duration of exposure experienced by an individual. There are numerous
                               measures of noise exposure that consider not only the A-level variation
                               of noise but also the duration of the disturbance. The CNEL measure
                               weights the average noise levels for the evening hours (7:00 P.M. to 10:00
                               P.M.) by increasing them 5dB, and weights the average noise levels for the
                               nighttime hours (10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M.) by increasing them 10 dB. The
                               daytime noise levels are combined with these weighted levels are
                               averaged to obtain a CNEL value.
                                
                               Noise Standards 
                               The State of California’s noise insulation standards are codified in the
                               California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Building Standards
                               Administrative Code, Part 2, California Building Code. These noise
                               standards are applied to new construction for the purpose of providing
                               suitable interior noise environments. The regulations specify that
                               acoustical studies must be prepared when noise-sensitive structures,
                               such as residential buildings, schools, or hospitals, are located near
                               major transportation noise sources, and where such noise sources create
                               an exterior noise level of 60 dBA CNEL or higher. Acoustical studies that
                               accompany building plans must demonstrate that structures have been
                               designed to limit interior noise in habitable rooms to acceptable noise
                               levels. For new residential buildings, schools, and hospitals, the
                               acceptable interior noise limit for new construction is 45 dBA CNEL.
                               City of La Palma Municipal Code 
                               The Municipal Code provides, among other things, a basis for controlling
 Leaf blowers certainly make   excessive and annoying noise. Limitations are placed on exterior noise

                               construction, and maintenance, are restricted to daytime hours. The
                               Municipal Code also places limitations on leaf blowers, with regard to
                               both applicable hours and noise levels.
                               Noise/Land Use Compatibility  
                               The California Department of Health Services, Office of Noise control
                               studied the correlation of noise levels and their effects on various land
                               uses. As a result, the DHS established four categories for judging the
                               severity of noise intrusion on specified land uses. DHS standards suggest
3‐12  C    o m m u n i t y   S a f e t y   E l e m e n t  

                                 L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
“normally      acceptable,”     “conditionally     acceptable,”    “normally
unacceptable,” and “clearly unacceptable” exterior noise levels for various
land uses. A “conditionally acceptably” designation implies new
construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed
analysis of the noise reduction requirements for each land use is made
and needed noise insulation features are incorporated in the design. By
comparison, a “normally acceptable” designation indicates that standard
construction can occur with no special noise reduction requirements.
Most cities and counties in California have adopted noise/land use
compatibility criteria that reflect DHS standards and are based on the
general assumption that higher noise levels are acceptable in business
districts and industrial areas. However, the introduction of mixed-use
development principles into traditionally suburban environments has
started to shift thinking with regard to acceptable noise levels. For
example, garbage collection early in the morning and the noise from
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment can occur with
greater frequency and intensity in a mixed-use setting. These and other
factors will be important considerations as the City considers future
mixed-use developments. People who choose to live in mixed-use areas
know that the activity levels bring with them a noise environment
distinctly   different    than    that   of    traditional   residential-only
neighborhoods.
Importantly, our existing residential neighborhoods must be protected
from new noise intrusions, so care will especially need to be taken
around property boundaries abutting noise-sensitive uses. Careful review
of site design and operational characteristics of individual commercial
uses will allow the City to address any site-specific noise concerns
through design and operational conditions applied to individual projects.
Figure 3-3 identifies criteria La Palma will use to make land use decisions
relative to noise.

 Baseline and Future Noise Environments  
The most significant noise-producing activity within La Palma is
transportation. This noise source consists primarily of traffic on city
streets and traffic on the Artesia Freeway (SR-91). Activities at
commercial properties, industrial properties, and construction sites (as
well as landscaping activities in neighborhoods), also contribute to the
noise environment in La Palma. Industrial activities are concentrated in
the northeastern area of the City and are separated from the nearest
noise-sensitive residential areas by either the SR-91 freeway or Coyote
Creek.
Traffic on the City’s arterials results in CNELs that range from about 67
dB to about 75 dB at the adjacent properties. Residential neighborhoods
that are buffered from traffic noise by five- to six-foot-high block walls
have exterior CNELs that are reduced by approximately 5 dB. In 2012, the
City approved increasing the height of block walls on arterials by two feet
to eight feet. This action allows those seeking additional buffer to receive
that benefit. Higher noise levels occur at properties adjacent to SR-91.
Traffic on the freeway generates CNELs of up to 77dB at the adjacent
properties. Properties that are buffered from the traffic noise by freeway
sound walls have exterior CNELs up to 72 dB.
                                                                             The primary source of noise in

In compliance with California Government Code Section 65302(f), CNEL
contours were developed for baseline (2013) and future (2030) noise
environments in La Palma. As illustrated in Figures 3-4 and 3-5, noise
measurements and analyses of future traffic conditions indicate that the
noise environment in the future is not forecast to be significantly
different from conditions in 2013. Slight noise increases are expected in
areas in the northern portion of the City, associated with regional traffic
increases and traffic increases associated with new development.
The City’s intent with regard to regulating noise is to minimize adverse
noise impacts on residents and visitors, and to preserve a quality noise     As part of the process to assess

                           Discussion: We contract with the Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA)
                           for fire protection services. The Authority maintains a fire station in La
                           Palma, as well as others in adjacent cities that can serve our City, and
                           provides a high level of fire protection services.

                                           the Authority is critical to protecting the health and
                                           welfare of our residents. Through our contracts with the
                                           Authority, we will structure agreements to achieve the
                                           service levels desired.

                           Discussion:     The City has been able to provide adequate water system
                                           pressures and supplies to meet the needs of the

                                           maintenance of water lines, hydrants, and the reservoir to
                                           ensure that these resources operate at peak efficiency in
                                           the event of an emergency.
                           Policy S‐1.3 Support OCFA’s efforts to provide fire prevention and
                                           fire safety education to residents and business
                                           owners as a means to reduce the potential for
                                           damaging fires.
                           Discussion:     Prevention is always the best strategy for reducing
                                           potential loss of property and life resulting from fires and
                                           fire-related emergencies. We are committed to working
                                           with the Orange County Fire Authority to educate
                                           community members about fire safety at home, in
                                           schools, and in the workplace.

Law Enforcement Services 
GOAL S‐2:               Provide a high level of preventative and 
                        responsive law enforcement services. 
Discussion: We live in a safe community with a relatively low crime
rate. We enjoy this safety and recognize the value it brings to La Palma.
Therefore, one of our primary goals is to maintain community safety at
the high level the community expects.
Policy S‐2.1 Provide for law enforcement services at levels the
                community expects.
Discussion:     Through our budgeting process, we will continually
                assess the best means of providing the highest level of
                law enforcement and crime prevention services.
Policy S‐2.2     Practice proactive crime prevention.
Discussion:     As with other emergency services, prevention programs
                and activities can reduce calls for service. Our active
                Neighborhood Watch program engages many community
                members in crime prevention efforts. We are committed
                to sponsoring education programs that make residents
                and business owners aware of how they can work
                cooperatively with law enforcement personnel to reduce
                incidents of crime and create safer neighborhoods and
                business districts.
Policy S‐2.3 Support        cooperative      programs    between       law
                enforcement and local organizations, including local
                school districts.
Discussion:     Our community has a strong bond with local law
                enforcement, which can be seen through a number of
                cooperative programs with local organizations and
                agencies. These programs make our community a safer
                place to live and work and help to create a positive
                relationship between our law enforcement personnel and
                the community.

                           Flooding Hazards 
                           GOAL S‐3:               Minimize the exposure of people and 
                                                   properties to flood hazards. 
                           Discussion:    The City is located in the inundation zones of several
                           regional dams. Therefore, it is important that we coordinate with
                           responsible parties to ensure the continued safety and operational
                           quality of these facilities, and that we keep our emergency response
                           plans and activities up to date. It is also important that we maintain local
                           drainage systems to ensure they operate effectively and protect our
                           community from unusual storm flow events.
                           Policy S‐3.1 Ensure that City emergency notification procedures
                                          and evacuation plans address the responses needed
                                          in the event of dam failure.
                           Discussion:    Regional dams have been improved to comply with
                                          seismic safety requirements, thus reducing the risks of
                                          inundation due to dam failure. We support the monitoring
                                          and maintenance of these facilities by the Army Corps of
                                          Engineers and other agencies to provide continued
                                          protection for the City from flood events.
                           Policy S‐3.2 Monitor the activities of Orange County and Los
                                          Angeles County flood control agencies regarding
                                          facilities that serve and impact La Palma.
                           Discussion:    The efficient operation and maintenance of regional flood
                                          control channels such as the Coyote Creek and Moody
                                          Creek Channels protects La Palma from regional flood
                                          hazards.      Our     vigilance  regarding    any   planned
                                          improvements/modifications to these and other regional
                                          facilities will help us plan any needed response.
                           Policy S‐3.3 Continue to maintain the efficient operation of local
                                          drainage facilities.
                           Discussion:    At the local level, our existing drainage system is
                                          adequate to meet our needs. We will budget to keep the
                                          facilities in good condition, and we will require that any
                                          new development appropriately mitigate any new
                                          demands on the system.

Geologic/Seismic Hazards 
GOAL S‐4:              Safeguard the community against primary 
                       and secondary seismic and geologic hazards. 
Discussion: The City is located in a seismically active region. We seek
to protect people and properties from the effects of earthquakes and
other geologic hazards, and to reduce loss of life, injuries, and property
damage. Prevention strategies include requiring retrofit of existing
buildings to bring them in line with current seismic safety standards and
ensuring new building foundations are safeguarded against liquefaction
hazards. In addition, we support education programs designed to
increase earthquake preparedness.
Policy S‐4.1 Require all new development to comply with the most
               recent State of California seismic building laws and
               the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act, and where
               appropriate, require mitigation of potentially adverse
               impacts of geologic and seismic hazards.
Discussion:    Complying with State building and seismic safety code
               standards is the best means of ensuring that new
               structures achieve appropriate safety standards. Our
               community is located in a Liquefaction Hazard Zone and
               therefore must also comply with the requirements of the
               Seismic Hazards Mapping Act, which requires that a
               certified geologist conduct liquefaction investigations
               prior to approval for most new development projects.
               Where necessary, mitigation will be required to minimize
               the risks of site-specific conditions associated with high
               groundwater levels and sandy soils.
Policy S‐4.2 Support earthquake preparedness education programs.
Discussion:    In La Palma, we endorse programs that provide families,
               schools, businesses, government and emergency service
               with earthquake education and preparedness planning.

                           Hazardous Waste 
                           GOAL S‐5:              Provide for the safe use, storage, and 
                                                  transportation of hazardous materials within 
                                                  the City. 
                           Discussion: We realize that hazardous waste is a necessary by-product
                           of certain industrial activities and day-to-day living in the urban
                           environment. However, with the implementation of appropriate
                           precautions, hazardous waste should not pose a significant threat to
                           workers or residents. Federal and state laws provide good safeguards,
                           and our efforts with the Orange County Fire Authority help monitor local
                           conditions.
                           Policy S‐5.1 Work with appropriate authorities to ensure the safe
                                          handling of hazardous materials, including the
                                          monitoring of facilities that use, store, or handle
                                          hazardous materials.
                           Discussion:    We want to ensure that hazardous materials are stored
                                          and handled in a safe manner and that appropriate
                                          precautions are taken to reduce the risk of a spill or other
                                          accidental release. The most effective means of doing this
                                          is to ensure that applicable local, state, and federal
                                          programs governing the use of hazardous materials and
                                          waste are implemented in La Palma. We will continue our
                                          coordination with the Orange County Fire Authority and
                                          the Certified Unified Program Agency for County of
                                          Orange for both education and enforcement.
                           Policy S‐5.2 Support state and regional efforts to control nonpoint
                                          sources of water pollution.
                           Discussion:    We recognize that controlling nonpoint sources of water
                                          pollution is an important means of reducing the
                                          discharge of hazardous and potentially hazardous wastes.
                                          Therefore, we support the efforts of state and regional
                                          agencies, such as the Regional Water Quality Control
                                          Board, to identify and mitigate sources of nonpoint
                                          pollution. We also support education programs designed
                                          to alert residents and businesses of their roles and
                                          responsibilities in reducing this kind of pollution. In
                                          addition, we recognize that City government, as the
                                          principal land use planning authority, can be an
                                          important manager of water resources. We will support
                                          responsible water quality planning and the integration of
                                          best management practices into the design of new
                                          development projects.

Emergency Preparedness 
GOAL S‐6:              Minimize the loss of life, injury, and 
                       property damage resulting from natural and 
                       human‐caused disasters. 
Discussion: A natural or human-caused upset event—such as an
earthquake, terrorist attack, or hazardous materials accident—most
often occurs without warning. We must be prepared for all types of
emergency situations and be capable of mobilizing all the resources at
our disposal to protect life and property within the City.
Policy S‐6.1 Prepare for the effective mobilization of City
               resources—both public and private—in the event of
               any disaster event.
Discussion:    The City has prepared a Multi-Hazard Emergency Plan
               outlining the mobilization of City resources in the event
               of a disaster at any scale. Keeping this plan up-to-date is
               considered the most effective means of preparing for an
               emergency. We also support emergency training of public
               personnel, as well as public awareness and education
               efforts for our residents. These measures are included as
               Preparedness Elements in the Multi-Hazard Emergency
               Plan.
Policy S‐6.2 Engage in regional emergency response planning.
Discussion:    Disasters such as earthquakes often affect a wide area,
               involving many agencies across jurisdictional boundaries.
               In such a situation, a cooperative effort involving
               numerous jurisdictions and resource agencies is the most
               effective means of dealing with the emergency. We are
               committed to planning and preparing for multi-
               jurisdictional emergency responses. Our City has assisted
               in the countywide emergency planning effort by
               permitting an emergency communications tower to be
               built in our industrial area. We are open to consideration
               of other means of participating in this important function.

                           Noise 
                           GOAL N‐1:               Ensure that the noise environments in La 
                                                   Palma do not impinge upon the high quality 
                                                   of our neighborhoods and business districts. 
                           Discussion: Our City is small and quiet. Even local industry is not a
                           major source of noise, given its location some distance from our
                           neighborhoods. Only a small section of freeway runs through town, and
                           freeway noise largely impacts commercial and industrial uses. Despite
                           regional and local growth, our major streets are not going to get much
                           noisier than they already are. We can ensure that new construction
                           complies with insulation standards that reduce outside noise. Our main
                           challenge is to ensure that temporary, short-term noise sources do not
                           get out of hand and that new development—and especially mixed-use
                           development—is planned with nearby noise-sensitive uses in mind.
                           Policy N‐1.1 Enforce state noise insulation standards for proposed
                                          projects in high noise environments.
                           Discussion:    In looking at the expected future noise conditions along
                                          the arterial highways serving our City, overall noise levels
                                          generated from traffic are not going to be noticeably
                                          different from what they today. Regardless, we want to be
                                          sure that the noise levels inside structures comply with
                                          established state standards. The state has established
                                          noise insulation standards for proposed projects in high
                                          noise environments. They are contained in Title 24 of the
                                          California Code of Regulations and are designed to
                                          ensure an adequate interior noise environment for
                                          residential uses, such as homes, apartments, and hotels.
                                          If a developer combines compliance with these insulation
                                          standards with other measures to reduce interior noise
                                          levels, there should be no difficulty in achieving the noise
                                          conditions we desire for our citizens.
                           Policy N‐1.2 Enforce the City’s noise ordinance for those noise
                                          sources that are not pre-empted by other agencies.
                           Discussion:    Cities do not have any control over highway and freeway
                                          generated noise. The same is true for aircraft and railway
                                          noise. What we can influence is the kind of noise we
                                          create ourselves, including noisy equipment, loud music,
                                          construction activity—even loud talking or party activities.
                                          These things don’t occur everywhere, or all the time, but
                                          when they do happen, they can be annoying and
                                          irritating. Loud noises, particularly unexpected ones, can
                                          even cause accidents, not to mention possible hearing
                                          damage. The way we choose to make sure that this type
                                          of noise doesn’t become bothersome is to establish and
                                          enforce a fair but firm noise ordinance. Noise standards
                                          in the Municipal Code specify noise measurement criteria,

                              L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
             interior and exterior noise standards, time restrictions for
             certain noise sources, and procedures for enforcement.
             This is our main tool for keeping the living and working
             environment in La Palma the way we want it.
Policy N‐1.3 Design new development projects so that potential
             noise impacts are minimized.
Discussion:  There are many approaches to designing a project so that
             potential noise impacts on nearby noise-sensitive uses
             are kept as low as possible. We expect new development
             to take noise considerations into account. Methods for
             accomplishing this can include ample building setbacks,
             building orientation, window placement, wall and fence
             treatment, location of activity areas, access design, and
             similar design features. These strategies do not
             necessarily reduce the need for other ways of reducing
             noise impacts, but they can be extremely effective,
             especially for larger projects. This is all part of what it
             means to be a quality development in our community.
Policy N‐1.4 Require that mixed-use structures be designed to
             account for noise from adjacent uses within the
             mixed-use development.
Discussion:  The City will allow for mixed-use developments in the
             Mixed Use-Business area along the SR-91 freeway.
             Mixed-use developments help create an exciting and
             walkable     environment,     but   can     create    noise
             incompatibilities within a development if not properly
             designed. Care should be taken at the design stage to
             minimize noise intrusion for residential uses, while
             recognizing that residents in mixed-use environments
             understand and accept the vibrancy of their districts.
 
Policy N‐1.5 Provide for vigorous and consistent enforcement of
             state Motor Vehicle Code noise standards for cars,
             trucks, and motorcycles.
Discussion:  Transportation is the dominant noise source in La Palma.
             However, the City has limited ability to reduce vehicle-
             generated noise. Through the efforts of our law
             enforcement personnel, the City can enforce state noise
             limits for vehicles by citing noise offenders whose
             engines, exhaust, or music systems create noise beyond
             defined limits.

Housing Element 
Introduction 
This chapter focuses on the policy aspect of housing. Appendix C
contains the data and analysis which shape and inform the policy
commitments. Combined, this chapter and Appendix C cover the scope
required by the California Government Code for Housing Elements in
local General Plans.
Nearly half of our City is zoned for residential use, and La Palma’s
foundation was as a bedroom community. The first city plan provided for
housing of all types to accommodate diverse needs and preferences.
Quality housing and quality neighborhoods define La Palma. Thus
continuing to plan for housing—from maintenance to meeting the
evolving needs of residents—is very important to our community. In this
Housing Element, we identify and establish our goals, policies, and
programs for meeting the housing needs of our existing and future
residents. We also outline an action plan that will guide the
                                                            H o u s i n g   E l e m e n t 4‐1

                          L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                          implementation of our housing goals. In implementing this plan, we seek
                          to contribute to the statewide housing goal of “early attainment of decent
                          housing and a suitable living environment for every California family,” as
                          well as to respond to housing conditions and needs unique to the City of
                          La Palma.
                          For this document is to play a meaningful role in guiding our actions, we
                          must periodically evaluate its effectiveness. Since our Regional Housing
                          Needs Assessment was updated by the Southern California Association of
                          Governments in 2012, this Housing Element is based on those numbers.
                          This element covers the planning period from January 1, 2014 through
                          October 1, 2021.
                          Our Housing Plan identifies specific actions we will take to implement the
                          goals and policies of this Housing Element. Pursuant to state law
                          (Government Code Section 65583), our plan must accomplish the
                          following:
                                 Provide adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity of
                                  housing types
                                 Facilitate the development of affordable housing stock
                                 Promote equal housing opportunity
                                 Remove potential constraints to affordable housing development
                                 Address and, if necessary, improve the existing affordable
                                  housing
                          Housing Plan 
                          The goals we have set in this plan respond to the overarching objectives
                          listed above, and our housing programs implement the respective
                          policies of these goals. Included in each program are a description of its
                          primary components, the timeframe for accomplishment, available
                          funding source, and the key objective of each program. Each objective
                          establishes a benchmark of implementing each housing program during
                          the 2014-2021 Housing Element cycle.

Goals and Policies 
Our goals and policies for housing in the City of La Palma for the 2014-
2021 planning period are:
Adequate Sites and Diversity of Housing 
Options 
A range of housing options is necessary to support an economically and
socially diverse community such as ours. Adequate public facilities and
services are important to maintain the quality of life valued by all of our
City’s residents. We also value the important investment represented by
our existing housing stock.
GOAL 1:               Continue  to  keep  land  use  regulations  in 
                      place  that  allow  for  diverse  housing 
                      opportunities that satisfy the physical, social, 
                      and economic needs of existing and future La 
                      Palma residents, including those with special 
                      needs (including large families, single parent 
                      households,  senior  citizens,  persons  with 
                      physical  and  developmental  disabilities,  and 
                      the homeless). 
Policy 1.1     Maintain a diversity of zoning districts that allow for
               new residential development at a range of densities.
                                                               H o u s i n g   E l e m e n t   4‐3

                          L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                          Policy 1.2     Ensure that housing and neighborhoods are provided
                                         with public services that provide for safe and sanitary
                                         living conditions.
                          Policy 1.3     Support innovative public, private, and nonprofit
                                         efforts in the development of affordable housing,
                                         particularly for special needs groups.
                           
                          High‐Quality Residential Development 
                          Our City celebrates our high-quality single-family neighborhoods. It is
                          essential to the social, physical, and economic well-being of the City that
                          this housing stock be actively maintained and enhanced through the
                          policies and programs in this Housing Element.
                          GOAL 2:                 Achieve high design quality in all residential 
                                                  developments  to  ensure  that  investments  in 
                                                  neighborhoods,  as  well  as  safety  and 
                                                  aesthetic value, are respected and maintained.
                          Policy 2.1     Enforce Municipal Code regulations that promote the
                                         maintenance of residential properties.
                          Policy 2.2     Provide public services and improvements that support
                                         and improve neighborhood longevity and cohesion.
                          Removal of Housing Constraints 
                          Government constraints are City policies, standards, or requirements that
                          may have the potential to constrain the production of affordable housing
                          under certain circumstances. High development fees, complicated
                          processing procedures, and challenging development standards are often
                          cited as factors that impact the ability of developers to provide market
                          rate and affordable housing.
                          GOAL 3:                 Optimize City processes and regulations that 
                                                  relate  to  the  maintenance,  improvement,  and 
                                                  development of housing. 
                          Policy 3.1     Remove land use barriers that pertain to emergency
                                         and transitional housing.

Policy 3.2     Assist developers of emergency and transitional
               housing in locating sites, and streamline the approval
               and permitting process for this type of housing.
Policy 3.3     Use the Village Overlay to promote the development of
               high-quality, high-density housing that is affordable
               to households of all income ranges.
 
Policy 3.4     Periodically review development standards to ensure
               consistency with the General Plan.
 
Policy 3.5     Facilitate     high-quality       workforce       housing
developments.
 
Equal Housing Opportunity 
Discriminatory housing practices are prohibited by national and state fair
housing laws. Discriminatory practices impede housing opportunities for
all La Palma residents.
GOAL 4:                Ensure  that  housing  opportunities  are 
                       available to all persons. 
Policy 4.1     Support the enforcement of laws and regulations that
               prohibit discrimination in mortgage lending practices
               and in the sale or rental of housing.
 
Policy 4.2     Support efforts aimed at guaranteeing unrestricted
               access to housing for all segments of the community.
 
Policy 4.3     Encourage and support private and nonprofit groups in
               their efforts to address the housing needs of the
               homeless and other disadvantaged groups.

                          Housing Programs and Action 
                          Plan 
                          The City’s housing programs for the 2014-2021 planning period are
                          described below and followed by a Summary Action Plan. The Summary
                          Action Plan matrix describes the intent of each program, and identifies an
                          objective, funding source, agency responsible for implementation, and
                          time frame. This format provides a quick reference for Housing Element
                          users, and facilitates evaluation of the Housing Plan in the next Housing
                          Element cycle.
                          SB 1087 of 2005 requires cities to provide a copy of their Housing
                          Elements to local water and sewer providers, and also requires that these
                          agencies provide priority hookups for developments with lower-income
                          housing. The Housing Element will be provided to these agencies
                          immediately upon adoption.
                          Housing Programs 
                          1. Section 8 Rental Assistance 
                          The Orange County Housing Authority administers the Section 8 Voucher
                          Program for several Orange County cities, including La Palma. The Section
                          8 program provides rental assistance (subsidies) to low- and moderate-
                          income families, the elderly, and disabled persons who spend more than
                          30 percent of their monthly income on rent. The subsidy represents the
                          difference between 30 percent of the recipient’s monthly income and the
                          federally approved fair market rent (FMR). This program helps to address
                          problems of overpayment and overcrowding.
                          Under the Housing Choice Voucher program, the landowner enters into a
                          contract with the local Housing Authority. Eligible tenants must pay the
                          difference between the fair market rate for rent and the actual rent.
                          Housing subsidized through this program must meet the standards of
                          safety and sanitation established by HUD.
                          According to the Orange County Housing Authority, 64 households in La
                          Palma receive Section 8 assistance as of 2012, including 46 elderly and 5
                          disabled/handicapped households. The City cannot directly influence the
                          number of Section 8 certificate/vouchers available to residents; however,
                          the City supports the efforts of the Housing Authority to obtain additional
                          funding from HUD to provide subsidies.

Objective: Support OCHA’s efforts to increase the amount of funding
allocated to HUD programs. Provide referrals to apartment complex
owners for information on the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher
program. Continue to participate in the County Housing Authority’s
Committee for Municipalities participating in Section 8 County-
Administered programs.
2. Funding for Preservation and Rehabilitation of 
Affordable Housing 
Through the federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
program, HUD provides funds to local governments for a range of
community development activities that benefit lower-income households.
The Orange County Community Services Department is responsible for
distributing CDBG funds to the smaller cities in Orange County under the
Urban County program. The City Council maintains a Cooperative
Agreement with the County of Orange to participate in the annual CDBG
and HOME fund Urban County competitive process. The City intends to
continue the agreement in order to ensure that local affordable housing
opportunities remain.
In addition, the City will participate with non-profit housing authorities to
preserve at-risk affordable multi-family housing in the City and/or to
convert market-rate multi-family housing into covenanted affordable
housing, as opportunities arise. Funding for the program will be provided
through the issuance of tax-exempt affordable housing bonds. Such
funding will be utilized to preserve low- and very low-income units. This
program helps to address the needs of extremely low-income households
and related problems of overpayment and overcrowding.
In 1998, the La Palma City Council joined with the California Statewide
Communities Development Authority (CSCDA) to enable a non-profit
corporation—Steadfast/McCord LPA, LLC—to finance the acquisition and
rehabilitation of the 272-unit Nova La Palma complex. The CSCDA issued
bonds used for the acquisition, maintenance, and rehabilitation of this
multi-family project, with the intent that affordability would be
maintained through 2023. Within recent years, however, the development
has been sold, and the current owner is considering buying out the
affordability obligations and converting some or all units to market rate.
The City’s commitment is to work with the current owner to encourage
some—if not all—of the units to remain affordable.
In 2010, Assembly Bill 1867 was signed into law, amending the California
Government Code to give jurisdictions the ability to convert market rate
multi-family ownership units to affordable units in an attempt to meet
their RHNA mandates. The City has established AB 1867 Program
Guidelines to facilitate the conversion of existing attached residential
units (developments of three or more units) to affordable units. This is a
tool available to the City for the Nova La Palma complex or any other
opportunity that might arise.
Priority for funding will be given to multi-family residential buildings;
however, the City will consider assisting single-family developments as
well.

                          with non-profit housing entities to preserve at-risk affordable multi-
                          family housing and/or convert market-rate housing into covenanted
                          affordable housing.
                          3. Mortgage Assistance Certificate Program 
                          A Mortgage Assistance Program for low-income first-time homebuyers is
                          administered by the Affordable Housing Clearinghouse under contract
                          with Orange County Housing & Community Services. The program
                          provides down payment assistance, targeted at the population with
                          incomes at or below 80 percent of the area median income. The City
                          could increase participation in the program by actively publicizing it on
                          the City’s website.
                          The City will publicize the availability of the Mortgage Assistance Program
                          to local residents. Potential avenues of advertisement include:
                                 Publishing information about these programs in the City’s
                                  quarterly La Palma newsletter, which is distributed to all
                                  households; and

                          programs by providing links between the County’s and City’s websites.
                          4. Mortgage Credit Certificate Program 
                          The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program is a federal Income Tax
                          Credit Program administered by the County of Orange. The MCC program
                          was originally created by Congress through the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
                          The program provides assistance to first-time homebuyers in the
                          purchase of owner-occupied residential units. The MCC program
                          increases the loan amount offered to a qualifying homebuyer and reduces
                          federal income taxes by 15% of the annual interest paid on a home
                          mortgage. The MCC program entitles qualified home buyers to reduce the

                                L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
amount of their federal income tax liability by an amount equal to a
portion of the interest paid during the year on a home mortgage. This tax
credit allows the buyer to qualify more easily for a loan by increasing the
effective income of the buyer. Since the borrower's taxes are being
reduced by the amount of the credit, this increases the take-home pay by
the amount of the credit, thus enabling the buyer to qualify for a larger
loan than would otherwise be possible. The MCC program was reactivated
by the County in 2009.
The City will publicize the availability of the Mortgage Credit Certificate
Program to local residents. Potential avenues of advertisement include:
       Publishing information about these programs in the City’s
        quarterly La Palma newsletter, which is distributed to all
        households; and
       Posting information about these programs in the City’s public
        library and community center, on the City Hall bulletin board, on
        the community center reader board, and on the City website.
Responsible Agency: Orange County Community Services (Affordable
Housing Clearinghouse)
Timeframe: Ongoing

Objective: Publicize availability of Orange County mortgage assistance

5. Reverse Mortgage Program 
This program targets elderly homeowners who are cash poor but have
substantial equity in their homes. Homeowners can draw needed income
from the accumulated equity in their home through a reverse mortgage.
The reverse mortgage is a deferred payment loan, or a series of such
loans, for which a home is placed as security. Reverse mortgage
programs typically permit homeowners to borrow up to 80 percent of the
assessed value of their property, receive needed principal of up to 25
percent of the loan, and receive monthly annuity payments for the life of
the loan.
The Orange County Housing Authority has been certified by HUD to
provide counseling services for individuals seeking this type of loan.
Responsibilities include providing counseling to seniors interested in
applying, working with private lending institutions, and working with
seniors to complete applications.
The City will publicize the availability of the reverse mortgage program.
Potential avenues of advertisement include:
       Publishing information about the program in the City’s quarterly
        La Palma newsletter, distributed to all households
       Posting information about the program in the public library and
        community center, on the City Hall bulletin board, on the
        community center reader board, and on the City website

                           6. Section 202 Elderly or Handicapped Housing 
                           Under this federally administered program, direct loans are made to
                           eligible, private nonprofit sponsors to finance the development of rental
                           or cooperative housing facilities for occupancy by elderly or handicapped
                           persons. The interest rate on such loans is determined annually. Section
                           8 funds are made available for all of the Section 202 units for the elderly.
                           Rental assistance for 100 percent of the units for handicapped persons is
                           also available.
                           Private nonprofit sponsors may qualify for Section 202 financing.
                           Households of one or more persons, the head of which is at least 62
                           years old or is a qualified non-elderly handicapped between the ages of
                           18 and 62, are eligible to live in these units.
                           While directed at the elderly and handicapped, this program helps to
                           address the needs of extremely low-income households and related
                           problems of overpayment and overcrowding.

                           Objective: Facilitate development of elderly and handicapped housing by
                           assisting with federal housing applications, providing density bonus
                           incentives, and providing “gap” financing where possible, such as through
                           application for CDBG funds. Support all viable nonprofit entities seeking
                           Section 202 funding.
                           7. Residential Code Enforcement Relief Program 
                           The City’s Residential Code Enforcement Relief Program is designed to
                           provide assistance to lower-income La Palma homeowners who are
                           charged with a Code Enforcement violation but cannot afford to make the
                           necessary repairs. The program provides a grant of up to $10,000 to
                           allow low-income homeowners to bring their homes up to the City’s
                           minimum standards.

The Code Enforcement Officer routinely disseminates information on the
Code Enforcement Relief Program. When residents are issued a notice of
violation, they are informed of this program as a means to address the
violations and provide monetary assistance. This program was previously
funded with Redevelopment set-aside funds; as new funding sources are
identified, the program may be reactivated.
Responsible Agency: Code            Enforcement    Division;  Community
Development Department
Timeframe: Ongoing
Funding Source: Undetermined
Objective: Identify potential funding sources to continue the Residential
Code Enforcement Relief Program. As funding permits, support lower-
income homeowners to comply with the City’s minimum standards for
property maintenance.
8. Home Spotlight Award Program 
The majority of the housing stock in the City was constructed by the late
1970s. The stock is aging but of high quality, and is a source of pride in
the community. To ensure the continued maintenance of the housing
stock, the Home Spotlight Award program will continue to recognize
homes within the community as an incentive for home maintenance and
upkeep. Awards will be made to occupants demonstrating home
maintenance values the City wishes to promote in areas such as exterior
upkeep of the property and landscaping.
Responsible Agency: Community Activities and Beautification Committee
Timeframe: Ongoing as funds allow
Funding Source: General Fund
Objective: As funds allow, continue the Home Spotlight Award Program
rewarding high standards of property maintenance.
9.   Emergency, Transitional and Supportive Housing  
A homeless population is comprised of persons lacking consistent and
adequate shelter. Homeless persons can be considered extremely low-
income residents (those remaining in an area year-round) or transient.
Emergency and transitional shelters can help to address the needs of the
homeless.
Emergency shelters provide short-term aid to homelessness and involve
limited supplemental services. Transitional and supportive housing, in
contrast, is directed at removing the basis for homelessness. Transitional
and supportive housing is provided for an extended period of time, and
is combined with other social services and counseling to assist in the
transition from homelessness to self-sufficiency. Although no homeless
persons have been specifically identified in La Palma, state law requires
                                                              H o u s i n g   E l e m e n t   4‐11

                           shelters by right (without discretionary review). The City has identified
                           the Public/Institutional zone as the zone appropriate and with adequate
                           capacity for emergency shelter facilities. Amendments to the
                           Development Code to permit emergency shelters by right will be brought
                           forward for consideration and adoption by City Council prior to Housing
                           Element adoption.
                           Also, the City will revise the Development Code to indicate that
                           transitional and supportive housing are a standard residential use
                           requiring no special review or permits. The Development Code will
                           identify where these uses may be permitted under the same standards
                           that apply to other residential uses. In addition, the City will work to
                           establish a referral list on the City’s website for individuals looking for
                           emergency or transitional/supportive housing.
                           Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
                           Timeframe: Complete Development Code amendments related to
                           emergency shelters prior to Housing Element adoption; complete other
                           amendments concurrent with General Plan and Housing Element update
                           adoption (2013)
                           Funding Source: General Fund
                           Objectives:
                               1) Permit permanent emergency housing by right in the General
                                   Industrial zone with appropriate development standards.
                               2) Clarify that transitional and supportive housing is a residential use
                                   that is subject to the same standards as other residential uses of
                                   the same type in the same zone.
                               3) Work with local faith-based organizations and nonprofits to
                                   formally establish appropriate emergency and transitional housing
                                   sites, and advertise referral resources.
                           10. Density Bonus Program 
                           In 2011, the City of La Palma revised the density bonus provisions of its
                           Affordable Housing Regulations (Chapter 26, Sections 26-59 to 26-64 of
                           the Municipal Code) to conform to California Government Code §69915.
                           The Affordable Housing Regulations allow a density bonus of up to 35%
                           for qualifying projects, as well as regulatory concessions to facilitate
                           affordable housing.
                           The City will promote the program to encourage its use. Possible avenues
                           of advertisement include developing a hand-out to be placed at the

This Housing Element update reflects current General Plan land use
designations that respond to the needs of the City, and which accurately
represent the types of housing stock already in existence. These
designations will need to be updated to remain consistent with new laws
and City land use requirements as changes may occur.

housing services, including housing discrimination response, landlord-
tenant relations, housing information and counseling, and community
education programs. Many of the persons served by this program are
likely to be extremely low-income. The City will support the Fair Housing
Council by promoting these services. Potential avenues of advertising
include publishing information in the quarterly La Palma newsletter which
is distributed to all households, placing flyers at the library and
community center, and posting information on the City’s website.

Growth Management 
Introduction 
This Growth Management Chapter addresses strategies to pace
development growth based upon the City’s ability to provide and manage
a well-functioning transportation system, utilities infrastructure, and
public facilities. To ensure that new development does not negatively
impact the current and planned levels of services, the Growth
Management Chapter provides guidance for land use approvals.
Planning for and managing growth and the potential impacts on the
roadway network is required by an Orange County proposition—Measure
M—adopted by voters in 1990 and renewed again by vote in 2006 as
Renewed Measure M (M2). This program, using proceeds from a half-cent
sales tax, allocates funds to provide transportation facilities and
congestion relief initiatives throughout Orange County. In addition to
funding freeway enhancements, Measure M2 monies are returned to
cities to be used for local transportation projects. To qualify for funds,
each city must comply with the eligibility requirements set by the Orange
County Transportation Authority.

                                Pacing Infrastructure 
                                Enhancements with 
                                Development  
                                This General Plan does not provide for extensive growth in La Palma. The
                                focus of new development will be along the SR-91 freeway. Nonetheless,
                                the City must ensure that existing infrastructure continues to meet
                                current needs and that any demands for infrastructure enhancements
                                associated with new development do not strain existing systems.
                                The provision of infrastructure to support new development will be the
                                responsibility of developers and property owners proposing the new
                                development. However, as discussed in the City Structure Chapter, the
                                City is responsible for maintaining established systems, which can be
                                costly. From the upkeep of sewer and water mains to street paving and
                                public facility maintenance, the City recognizes the need to plan well
                                ahead to pace capital investments with funding availability.
                                With regard to transportation systems and funding, Measure M2 proposes
                                to deliver $15.5 billion in transportation improvements through 2041,
                                both on the regional freeway/highway systems and cities’ local networks.
                                The Orange County Transportation Agency has not identified any
                                immediate regional improvements for freeways directly serving La Palma.
                                However, the City will be able to compete for funding for local road
                                system improvements such as traffic signal synchronization, street repair,
                                and enhancements to busy intersections like La Palma Avenue/Walker
                                Street and Orangethorpe Avenue/Walker Street. The Orange County
                                Transportation Authority has prepared guidelines on how cities can
                                                                             become eligible to receive
                                                                             their funding share from

Goals and Policies 
These goals and policies will guide investment               strategies  in
transportation and infrastructure system improvements.
Meeting Transportation and other 
Infrastructure Needs 
GOAL GM‐1:              Transportation and infrastructure systems 
                        should meet the current and future needs of 
                        residents and businesses. 
Discussion: For a community to thrive and grow, infrastructure services
must be in place to meet the current and future needs of residents and
businesses. The roadways must accommodate the number of vehicle
trips associated with our land use plan.
Transportation and infrastructure improvement projects are costly so it
is very important for La Palma to qualify for any available funding when
making necessary improvements to our transportation and
infrastructure systems.
Policy GM‐1.1 Require that development projects fund their fair
                 share of the costs associated with that development.
Discussion:      New development should not place a financial burden
                 on existing development to pay for the infrastructure
                 improvements caused by the new development. All new
                 development projects will include strategies to ensure
                 all fair-share costs of infrastructure improvements and
                 other capital facilities are paid.
Policy GM‐1.2 Establish        and maintain a seven-year capital
                 improvement program that sustains LOS “D” on the
                 City’s arterial highway system, with the exception of
                 key intersections, where peak period LOS “E” may be
                 acceptable.
Discussion:      Although future improvements are expected to be
                 relatively few because of the built-out condition of our
                 City, the City needs to comply with this requirement
                 specifically included in Measure M2.
                                            G r o w t h   M a n a g e m e n t   E l e m e n t 5‐3

                          Policy GM‐1.3 Update traffic mitigation fees as needed over time to
                                          ensure they          relate   to   the   impact    of   new
                                          development.
                          Discussion:     Maintaining La Palma roadways are expensive,
                                          particularly if additional traffic places stresses on them.
                                          Updating traffic mitigation fees periodically will allow
                                          the City to ensure that sufficient funds are available to
                                          pay for maintenance and improvements and that
                                          development is paying its fair share towards
                                          improvements.
                          Policy GM‐1.4 Promote transportation demand strategies that
                                          allow employers to efficiently utilize La Palma’s
                                          transportation system.
                          Discussion:     La Palma has adopted a Transportation Demand
                                          Management (TDM) Ordinance (Ord. 2003-07) and
                                          encourages commercial businesses and professional
                                          office developments to utilize the strategies contained
                                          in the ordinance, including carpool/vanpooling,
                                          alternative work schedules, providing bicycling parking
                                          facilities, transit shelters, pedestrian and bicycle access,
                                          and other TDM mechanisms.
                          Policy GM‐1.5 Fund        transportation and utility infrastructure
                                          improvements creatively, relying on both public and
                                          private resources.
                          Discussion:     While the City will place the burden on new
                                          development projects to fund improvements directly
                                          associated with such development, broader-based
                                          infrastructure improvements—and particularly those
                                          important to economic development (like new
                                          telecommunication infrastructure) and neighborhood
                                          quality—will require public financing.
                          Policy GM‐1.6 Ensure the City meets the requirements to be
                                          eligible for funding for local street system
                                          improvements from Measure M2 and other sources.
                          Discussion:     Measure M2 funds will be available through competitive
                                          grants, with the City required to provide matching
                                          funding. La Palma has creatively used grants in the
                                          past for fund matching, and will continue to do so to
                                          leverage available Measure M2 monies. It is important
                                          that the City update the necessary documents and fulfill
                                          the eligibility requirements as required by Measure M2.
                                          It is also important that the City pursue other funding
                                          options      to    finance    transportation    and    other
                                          infrastructure projects and programs.

Policy GM‐1.7 Consult with other agencies and organizations to
              address regional issues and opportunities related to
              growth, transportation, infrastructure, and other
              planning issues.
Discussion:   The purveyance of infrastructure services can involve a
              regional agency or organization, such as Orange County
              Sanitation District for wastewater services, Orange
              County Water District for groundwater basin
              management, Municipal Water District of Orange
              County for purchasing imported water, and other
              agencies that provide infrastructure services. The City
              will consult with all of the relevant agencies,
              organizations, and utilities companies to ensure that
              adequate infrastructure services are provided at
              reasonable costs to all residents and businesses over
              the long term.

                                 Relationship of Technology to the 
                                 General Plan 
                                  
                                 Advances in technology have frequently resulted in changes to the
                                 development patterns, transportations systems, and growth management
                                 policies of cities. One of the technological impacts with the most impact
                                 on our built environment came with the mass production of automobiles,
                                 which led to lower housing densities and suburbanization. Today,
                                 suburban sprawl, traffic congestion, and other factors are contributing to
                                 a return to more compact, mixed-use development, and increased
                                 dependence on modern mass transit systems.
                                 Today’s cities are also experiencing new challenges and opportunities
                                 presented        by    technology,     particularly    advances     in     the
                                 telecommunications field. Adaptations to near- and long-term
                                 technological advances, some major and some subtle, will be necessary
                                 to maintain La Palma’s position as an outstanding place to live, work, and
                                 play. The Technology Element sets a basic framework for that to occur.
                                  
                                 Key Factors 
                                 Quality of Life 
                                 “Quality of Life” is often used by cities to define their overall goals or
                                 “visions.” It is the cornerstone of the “Vision Statement” for the City of La
                                 Palma (see Chapter 1: Introduction of this General Plan). Quality of life
                                 implies that a community’s residents have a variety of services, facilities,
                                 and opportunities available to them to enhance the way they live from
                                 day to day. Quality of life issues include services relating to basic sanitary
                                 facilities and operations, public safety, libraries, parks and recreation,
                                 cultural activities, and education. Services provided by the private sector
                                 such as retail stores and shops, restaurants and convenient services are
                                 also quality of life components. Mobility and accessibility by private
                                 vehicles, mass transit, and communications systems also play a major
                                 role in one’s ability to function successfully in today’s society.
       La Palma’s smart water 
       meters have assisted its 
                                 There are also some within the community who cannot currently use
                                 technology effectively, particularly in the area of communications. Their
     residents with their water 
                                 access may be impaired by lack of financial resources, limited knowledge
          conservation efforts. 
                                 and understanding of technological devices, unavailability of certain
                                 technologies where they live or work, or a lack of desire to use such
                                 services. These challenges must be noted when developing service
                                 programs and operations.
                                 A critical component of La Palma’s quality of life has been the
                                 development and implementation of an effective General Plan. The
                                 General Plan has served as the guide to growth development and
                                 continues to guide redevelopment in the community. The plan has been
                                 effectively implemented through zoning measures, the Capital
                                 Improvement Program (CIP), and the Operating Budget. As a maturing

                                 L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
city, La Palma is facing issues such as infill development, redevelopment,
and revitalization. Technology may enhance the City’s ability to
effectively address these issues and maximize the opportunities
associated with these challenges.
Technological advances have the potential to enhance quality of life and
this Element addresses how technology may contribute to and benefit the
lives of La Palma residents as well as the City’s role in promoting those
benefits.
Business/Economic Development 
Much of La Palma’s success as a community involves its ability to
combine a strong economy with residential opportunities. La Palma’s
location in the Los Angeles/Orange County metropolitan area,
accessibility via major transportation routes, skilled work force, and
quality of life position us to be a major economic center. Our strong
economy contributes to La Palma’s quality of life by providing job
opportunities and by strengthening financial resources.
The ability of current and future La Palma businesses to remain
competitive in the marketplace will depend on their ability to utilize
technology to improve their efficiency, product quality, and marketing
programs. Much of La Palma’s future success as an economic center will
depend on the ability of its business community to effectively incorporate
technology into its operations; and to a large extent that depends on the
ability of the community to build and maintain a state-of-the-art
technology infrastructure.
Communications 
Efficient and effective communications are at the forefront of our
changing world. In recent years, technological advances in
communications and information sharing have changed our abilities as
well as how we live and work.
Enhancing La Palma’s ability to communicate and share information with
various individuals and groups will, in turn improve its effectiveness as a
responsive governmental entity. Technology should continue to provide
numerous opportunities to inform, engage, and educate citizens about
issues that affect their daily lives. Communications technologies provide
citizens with opportunities to interact effectively and efficiently with local
governments. Citizens can access information 24/7 and provide input on
various pending issues and challenges facing decision makers. The
inconvenience of certain permitting processes and procedures can be
mitigated through the effective use of communications.
As residents, workers, and leaders, we have high expectations regarding
the seeking, generation, and receipt of information quickly and
comprehensively. Advances in speed and breadth of available information
are likely to continue over the next decade and beyond. Cities that
embrace communication enhancements via technology are likely to be
more successful in meeting the needs of their communities. City rights-
                                                            T e c h n o l o g y   E l e m e n t 6‐3

                                    L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                                    of-way will probably continue to provide the primary opportunities for
                                    installing technologically advanced communications systems.
                                    Continued expansion of wireless operations will supplement such hard-
                                    wired facilities, but it is not likely to totally replace them. The ability of
                                    providers and the City to work, over time, on the effective use of these
                                    rights-of-way will be a critical factor. The City will attempt to
                                    accommodate private communications facilities when doing so does not
                                    inhibit the ability to provide basic services within its rights-of-way.
                                    Information sharing between La Palma and public and private entities is
                                    also important. This should be done in a manner that minimizes
                                    duplication of resources and protects proprietary data, public security,
                                    and individual privacy.
              The City utilizes an 
        electronic digital display 
     readerboard to disseminate 
              public information.

Goals and Policies 
The following goals and policies, derived from the “Key Factors” used to
define the City’s technology-related objectives and the key approaches
for meeting those objectives, will guide the City’s ability to adapt and
evolve seamlessly with advances in technology from 2014 to 2030.
Regular review and monitoring of their effectiveness, particularly in the
fast-paced environment of technology change, will be necessary. The City
Council, committees, commissions, and staff will use these objectives
and strategies in program development and related decisions. They will
also be useful to organizations, businesses, and residents in
understanding the City’s philosophies and expectations.
The achievement of the objectives that follow will require careful
evaluation to ensure that the City’s resources and capabilities are
properly used. While the City intends to be proactive in encouraging the
use of technology, it must primarily focus on core competencies and
services.
Quality of Life 
GOAL T‐1:        Enhance  the  design,  development,  delivery,  and 
                 access to public services through the cost‐effective 
                 use of technology. 
Policy T‐1.1   Include technology considerations when updating or
               evaluating the General Plan, the Capital Improvement
               Program, the Operating Budget, the Technology
               Internal Service Fund Plans and Budgets, and similar
               documents. 
Discussion:    Consider adjustments to these documents to ensure that
               they are consistent with changing technologies and do not
               unintentionally hamper their use.
Policy T‐1.2 Where feasible, extend access to technology, primarily
               information and communication technologies, by
               making available City facilities and services to
               residents that might not otherwise take advantage of
               these advances.
Discussion:    For example, the La Palma Library System currently makes
               personal computers with Internet access available to
               patrons. It also offers basic training on the use of related
               equipment and data. The City provides free wireless
               internet (“Wi-Fi”) at City Hall and the Community Center.
               The emphasis should be on creating or facilitating options
               as opposed to the City providing full service to every home
               or business in La Palma.

                           GOAL T‐2:        Promote  communications  technology  as  a  means 
                                            for  reducing  traffic,  improving  air  quality,  and 
                                            increasing productivity. 
                           Policy T‐2.1  Use technology to reduce the need for citizens,
                                          customers, and staff to travel to City facilities by
                                          enhancing      e-business    and    e-document     access
                                          capabilities. 
                           Discussion:    Consider adjustments to these documents to ensure that
                                          they are consistent with changing technologies and do not
                                          unintentionally hamper their use.

                           Development 
                           GOAL T‐3:        Ensure  that  City  regulations  are  not  an 
                                            unreasonable  barrier  to  businesses’  ability  to 
                                            apply technological advances to their operations. 
                           Policy T‐3.1  Provide     for codes and ordinances that enable
                                          businesses to gain efficiencies and economies of scale
                                          in the market place.
                           Discussion:    This may involve periodic comparisons of technological
                                          advances and resulting changes in business activities to
                                          the applicability of current regulations. For example,
                                          technological advances could impact the design and layout
                                          of certain business facilities and the City may find it
                                          appropriate to refine development standards to account
                                          for such changes.
                           GOAL T‐4:        Promote  coordination  between  the  local  business 
                                            community  and  public  entities  to  share 
                                            information  and  assess  the  impacts  of 
                                            technological advances on both sectors. 
                           Policy T‐4.1  Encourage activities that link business leaders with
                                          those    in    local  governmental     and    educational
                                          institutions.
                           Discussion:    This can be accomplished through existing venues such as
                                          the Lunch with the Mayor events and joint forums with

               local business, government, and education leaders.
               Technology will continue to change and affect the market
               place, the local economy, and public resources. Therefore,
               proactive coordination will be critical to the community’s
               overall success in attracting and retaining businesses.
GOAL T‐5:        Apply  technology  to  supplement  business 
                 recruitment and retention programs. 
Policy T‐5.1   Use technologies such as Geographic Information
               Systems (GIS) to develop interactive programs
               assisting business prospects with identifying suitable
               properties and lease spaces.
Discussion:    This could include on-line demographic analyses for
               specified areas. Use business license data to market
               retention programs to local businesses.
Efficient and Effective Communications 
GOAL T‐6:        Accommodate the reasonable use of public rights‐
                 of‐way  for  communications  infrastructure  while 
                 protecting  the  ability  of  the  City  to  provide 
                 services in said rights‐of‐way. 
Policy T‐6.1   Establish balanced and fair rights-of-way policies that
               preserve the City’s ability to provide safe and efficient
               traffic movement, effective utility operations, and
               infrastructure maintenance along with opportunities
               for the placement and maintenance of communications
               services.
Discussion:    Such policies should be monitored in accordance with
               technological advances and government regulations.
               Promote fair compensation to the community for such
               services.

                           GOAL T‐7:        Enhance  the  City’s  ability  to  share  information 
                                            and  coordinate  with  various  public  and  private 
                                            organizations  through  the  cost‐effective  use  of 
                                            technology. 
                           Policy T‐7.1  Explore  opportunities  to  employ  technology  as  a 
                                          means  for  sharing  services,  information,  data,  and

                                          private entities.
                           Discussion:    Such programs should be carefully designed to ensure that
                                          “sensitive” data and information is protected and that
                                          security and individual rights to privacy are not
                                          compromised.      Cost    effectiveness     and   operational
                                          efficiencies and quality for all participants should also be a

Implementation Plan 
This Appendix establishes the necessary implementation actions for the
General Plan. The City will perform an annual review of this Appendix in
conjunction with the annual budget cycle so that fiscal resources can be
focused on evolving priorities for responding to General Plan direction.
The implementation actions are intended to be updated more frequently
than the rest of the General Plan. The City will add or modify actions due
to changing social, economic, and environmental conditions, as well as
changes in funding and City priorities.
As discussed in Appendix B, General Plan Consistency Requirement, a
number of City decisions and actions are required to be consistent with
the General Plan. This requirement applies to both public decisions (e.g.,
capital improvements such as major street improvements) and private
development projects subject to City discretionary review (e.g., rezoning
or subdivision approval). The actions contained in this Implementation
Plan seek to put the City in a position to achieve legally mandated
                                                        I m p l e m e n t a t i o n   P l a n A‐1

                           L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                           consistency wherever required, as well as to generally assist in achieving
                           the City’s vision embodied in the General Plan.
                           Some actions are not new; they may consist ongoing programs or
                           projects that exemplify the multi-year nature of implementing the
                           General Plan.      Continuing actions also demonstrate the interaction
                           between planning and implementation that characterizes the real world in
                           which feedback from actions serves to improve plans.
                           Implementation actions are listed by Chapter in the General Plan. Each
                           implementation action lists the City departments or divisions that will be
                           involved in implementation (or other outside agency as applicable),
                           anticipated funding sources, a suggested time frame, and the policies
                           that correspond to the action.

                                     The General Plan includes land use designations not reflected in
                                     the Development Code as of 2014; thus, the Code must be
                                     updated to achieve consistency. The City will review and modify
                                     the Development Code to ensure that the purpose and intent of
                                     zoning classifications clearly implement the description of
                                     relevant General Plan land use designations. The City will pay
                                     particular attention to ensure zoning standards for new
                                     developments are sensitive to adjacent residential uses.
                                     Additionally, a new Zoning Map will be prepared to graphically
                                     communicate the pattern of zoning regulations.

      To best incentivize new development in our new strategic

      establishing a process that allows for transfer of development
      rights. Ensure that, through this process, maximum new
      dwelling units and nonresidential square footage are limited to
      the amounts planned for in this General Plan. Require more
      intense projects to make every effort to provide graceful
      transitions to surrounding uses. Approve transfers of
      development rights only when a community benefit can be
      realized.

      physical improvement of City facilities. Subsequent versions of

                                    La Palma’s Code Enforcement Program is the major way in which
                                    erosion of the quality of private development can be prevented.
                                    Code enforcement has become increasingly important as
                                    residences and business buildings have aged. Prevention and
                                    small-scale intervention are manageable activities. Adhere to
                                    the General Plan policy direction of a middle ground between a
                                    “laissez-faire” approach, in which little is done, and an
                                    aggressive approach, in which intrusive procedures are widely
                                    used. Revise and update and support the Code Enforcement
                                    Program as needed to respond to issues.

                                    Five intersections in the arterial highway system may have level
                                    of service operations decline or become deficient over time due
                                    to new regional and local trips. These five intersections are
                                    expected to operate below the desired minimum Level of Service
                                    “D” at some point in the future. The following improvements—
                                    in addition to improvements planned by the City of Cerritos and
                                    the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Agency

            Add turn lanes for the southbound left-turn and
            eastbound right-turn movements
      The City of Cerritos General Plan Circulation Element also
      recommends improvements at the Moody Street/Carmenita
      Road and South Street/Orangethorpe Avenue intersection. In a
      study prepared jointly by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan
      Transportation Authority and the Gateway Cities Council of
      Governments a concept plan for this intersection was developed,
      identifying needed improvements including an additional
      southbound left-turn lane, an additional northbound left-turn
      lane, and southbound right-turn overlap phasing. The proposed
      additional eastbound lane identified in this Implementation
      Action would supplement the improvements proposed by this
      study. The City will coordinate with the City of Cerritos and
      Metro regarding any planned improvements for the intersection
      outside of La Palma boundaries.
      The City of Buena Park General Plan Circulation Element also
      recommends intersection improvements at Valley View
      Street/Orangethorpe Avenue and Valley View Street/La Palma
      Avenue. La Palma will work with Buena Park to coordinate these
      improvements.
      Monitoring conditions at these intersections, ensuring timely
      inclusion of their improvement in the Capital Improvement
      Program, and adequate funding available in part through traffic
      impact mitigation fees collected, will be a critical aspect of
      maintaining overall traffic conditions at acceptable levels within
      the City.

OC-1. Continue Park Improvement Prioritization
      The City’s parks and recreation facilities are critical features of
      the City structure. Sufficient land is not available in La Palma to
      meet contemporary open space and recreation standards for
      current or anticipated population levels.             Thus, careful
      stewardship of existing park facilities is critical. This involves
      reviewing priorities for park improvements established in the
      Parks and Recreation System Comprehensive Master Plan and
      ensuring that the commitment to maintenance and facility
      development is sustained. In addition, the City should seek to
      acquire additional lease rights in the remaining section of the
      power line easement (the Promenade).

OC-3. Implement Recommendations of Parks Master Plan
      Implement the provisions of the La Parks and Recreation System
      Comprehensive Master Plan, as it may be amended from time to
      time. Specifically:
         Pursue funding sources for implementation of the Concept
          Site Plan for Central Park, as illustrated in the 2010 City of
          La Palma Parks and Recreation System Comprehensive
          Master Plan, including refurbishment and additional
          recreational amenities.
         Continue negotiations with Southern California Edison to
          implement additional amenities within the SCE greenbelt.
         Pursue development of new revenue sources to fund the
          park and recreation system, programs, and events in La
          Palma by using park and facility resources as assets to
          generate income, partnering with other public agencies, and
                                                         I m p l e m e n t a t i o n   P l a n A‐11

                                         pursing cost recovery of fee-based recreation programs
                                         whenever possible.
                                        Pursue improvements on the SCE greenbelt at Moody Street
                                         that would provide additional parking and a restroom, and
                                         that would address the need for an on-demand signalized
                                         crosswalk on Moody Street.
                                        Revise the City of La Palma Landscape Standards to include
                                         sustainable design elements into new park design and park
                                         rehabilitation projects to enable the City to integrate new
                                         energy-efficient technologies and water conservation into all
                                         park and facility development projects.
                                        Require developers to dedicate land or pay sufficient in-lieu
                                         fees to meet established public recreational open space
                                         standards associated with their development impact.
                                        Continue to make community facilities and park amenities
                                         available for rental by community residents, non-profit
                                         groups, and businesses to meet their recreational and

OC-9. Sustainable Development Practices
      To ensure that targeted energy performance standards or
      guidelines for new development are being achieved, the City will
      review projects against the following and/or guidelines:
         Where feasible, locate reflective surfaces (i.e., parking lots)
          on the north and east sides of buildings to decrease
          potential heat gain and reflection to adjacent buildings;
          alternatively, where parking areas must be located to the
          south or west of buildings, provide landscaping to reduce
          potential heat gain.
         Where possible, orient glass toward the south, the side with
          the greatest amount of solar access (heat gain potential).
         Use appropriate building shapes and locations to promote
          maximum feasible solar access.
                                                       I m p l e m e n t a t i o n   P l a n A‐13

                            L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                                        Design individual buildings to maximize natural internal
                                         lighting through the use of court wells, interior patio areas,
                                         and building architecture. Site plan elements (e.g., buildings,
                                         landscaping) should protect access to sunshine for planned
                                         solar energy systems and/or for solar oriented rooftop
                                         surfaces that can support a solar collector or collectors
                                         capable of providing anticipated hot water needs of the
                                         building.
                                        Use canopies and overhangs to shade windows during
                                         summer months while allowing for reflection of direct
                                         sunlight during winter months.
                                        Install windows and vents in commercial and industrial
                                         buildings to provide the opportunity for thorough
                                         ventilation.
                                        Use reflective roof materials to reduce solar gain, unless a
                                         passive heat system is provided.
                                        Incorporate the use of deciduous trees in landscaping plans,
                                         especially near buildings and around large expanses of
                                         parking lots or other paved areas.
                                        Incorporate deciduous vines on walls, trellises, and canopies
                                         to shade south and west facing walls to cool them in
                                         summer months.
                                     The City will develop guidelines for development projects that
                                     incorporate the above and other appropriate standards that can
                                     achieve more sustainable development approaches.

       practices that allow percolation to the underlying aquifer and
       minimize off-site surface runoff. Acceptable on-site retention
       methods include—but are not limited to—use of pervious paving
       materials in hardscape areas is to be maximized, along with the
       provision of swale designs in landscape or grassy areas that
       slow runoff and maximize infiltration. Where feasible, require
       the discharge of roof drainage to be directed into pervious areas
       to reduce increases in downstream runoff. Investigate the
       efficacy and long-term benefits—both environmentally and
       fiscally—of using pervious pavement systems.

                                     An important aspect of “community” is the extent to which time
                                     and resources are invested in our youth. In La Palma, this
                                     extends beyond the normal educational realm to involve youth
                                     in community service and character building through a variety of
                                     activities and events. The City has received wide recognition for
                                     the nature and level of its commitment to the youth of the
                                     community. The City will continue to support and nurture these
                                     efforts.

N-4. Noise Suppression Devices
     Outside of transportation-related noise, our City is relatively
     quiet. As is the case in many other communities, some of the
     most common sources of noise in La Palma are a result of
     landscaping tools and other similar equipment. Even short
     durations of noise from such sources as leaf blowers can disturb
     the peace and interrupt daily activities. The City will explore
     requiring the use of noise suppression devices and techniques
     on all exterior noise sources (such as construction operations,
     pumps, fans, and leaf blowers) to lower exterior noise to levels
     that are compatible with adjacent land uses. The City can
     incentivize or potentially require the use of sound-limiting
     techniques on such external sources to further enhance the
     already high standard of living in La Palma. The City will also
     continue to use time of day regulations relative to such
     operations.

                           remains residential.
                           At-Risk Housing is multifamily rental housing that is at risk of losing its
                           status as affordable housing for low- and moderate-income tenants due
                           to the expiration of federal, State, or local arrangements.
                           Automatic Aid Agreement (see also Mutual Aid Agreement) is

                           Best Management Practices (BMP) are practical, structural or
                           nonstructural methods which prevent or reduce the movement of
                           sediment, nutrients, pesticides and other pollutants from the land to
                           surface or ground water, or which otherwise protect water quality from
                           potential adverse effects of cultural activities. These practices are
                           developed to achieve a balance between water quality protection and the
                           production of wood crops within natural and economic limitations.

                            around a noise source, such as an airport or highway. The lines are
                            generally drawn in five-decibel increments so that they resemble
                            elevation contours in topographic maps.

                            government, in which the community is divided into districts or zones
                            within which permitted and special uses are established as are
                            regulations governing lot size, building bulk, placement, and other
                            development standards. Requirements vary from district to district, but
                            they must be uniform within the same district. The zoning ordinance

Expanded Housing 
Element 
1. Introduction 
This Appendix C focuses on the data and analysis from which housing
policy commitments in the Housing Element are derived. Chapter IV of
the General Plan contains the goals, objectives, policies and programs
based on this Appendix. Combined, they cover the scope required by the
Government Code for Housing Elements in local General Plans.
The Housing Element is one of the seven General Plan elements
mandated by the State of California, as articulated in §65580 to
§65589.8 of the Government Code. State law requires that the Element
consist of “identification and analysis of existing and projected housing
needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and
scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement and development
                                                                         A p p e n d i x   C C‐1

                           of housing.” The residential nature of the City is, to a large extent,
                           determined by the variety and location of its housing and particularly, the
                           maintenance of that housing.
                           The Housing Element is an official municipal response to the need to
                           provide housing for all economic segments of the population within La
                           Palma. It establishes policies that will guide City decision-making and
                           sets forth an action program to implement housing goals.
                           1.1 Housing Element Organization 
                           The La Palma       Housing     Element   is  comprised   of   the  following
                           components:
                                      A Housing Needs Assessment (Section 2 of this Appendix C),
                                       which includes population trends and characteristics,
                                       employment trends, household characteristics, housing stock
                                       characteristics, and the housing needs summary.
                                      A summary of Housing Constraints (Section 3 of this Appendix
                                       C), which includes market constraints and governmental
                                       constraints.
                                      A Housing Resources Section (Section 4 of this Appendix C),
                                       which reviews availability of sites for housing and available
                                       administrative and financial resources.
                                      A Progress Report (Section 5 of this Appendix C) reviewing
                                       performance to date for the 2008-2014 Housing Element.
                                      A Housing Plan (Chapter IV of the General Plan), which
                                       includes the goals and policies for the implementation of the
                                       element and our housing programs. The plan also includes
                                       quantified objectives and a detailed action plan.
                           The state-mandated Housing Element components are identified in Table
                           C-1, together with a reference to the sections of this document in which
                           they are addressed.
                           1.2 General Plan Consistency 
                           The Housing Element of the General Plan is only one facet of a city’s
                           planning program. The California Government Code requires that General
                           Plans contain an integrated, consistent set of goals and policies. The
                           Housing Element is therefore affected by development policies contained
                           in the Land Use Element, which establishes the location, type, intensity
                           and distribution of land uses throughout the City. The Circulation
                           Element establishes policies for providing essential streets and roadways
                           to all housing that is developed. The policies in other elements of the
                           General Plan affect the quality of life that citizens expect. As portions of
                           the General Plan are amended in the future, all elements of the General
                           Plan, including the Housing Element, will be reviewed to ensure internal
                           consistency is maintained.

                           1.3 Public Participation 
                           In 2011, La Palma began pursuing a comprehensive update of its General
                           Plan, which was last updated in 1999 (with the Housing Element updated
                           in 2010). The public outreach phase was initiated in late 2011 with
                           numerous one-on-one interviews with residents, business owners, and
                           other community stakeholders. The City also met with the Kiwanis Club,
                           Neighborhood Watch, Anaheim Union High School District, Traffic Safety
                           Committee, Cypress School District, Centralia School District,
                           Development Committee, La Palma Intercommunity Hospital, BP/ARCO,
                           Centerpointe, Kennedy High School and Walker Jr. High School students,
                           and the Community Activities and Beautification Committee to discuss
                           potential land use changes, housing, economic development, and other
                           issues relevant to the General Plan.
                           A summary of preliminary community outreach was presented to the City
                           Council at a workshop on January 17, 2012. Two additional workshops
                           were held on April 17, 2012 and June 5, 2012 to discuss potential land
                           use changes and related issues.
                           Public outreach continued through the summer of 2012 via a three-point
                           approach using personal contact, electronic media, and printed media.
                           Personal contact was made through a series of committee and community
                           organization meetings, all of which were previously engaged in the
                           outreach conducted for the General Plan Update process and
                           stakeholders’ identification process. City staff offered to conduct
                           meetings in people’s homes to further engage neighborhood groups.
                           Staff advertised this option at City Committee meetings, community
                           organization meetings include Neighborhood Watch and Kiwanis, and at

public events including the Civic Expo & National Night Out, coffee chats,
and city-wide community workshop held in August, 2012.
At the August, 2012 community-wide workshop, participants were
engaged in group exercises that included defining what they would want
to see in a Town Center, using a series of icons that illustrated a range of
uses. Participants were also asked to review exhibits illustrating various
types of multi-family housing development and to indicate whether
particular housing types were considered appropriate for La Palma.
                                      The City maintained a section of the
                                      website dedicated to the General Plan
                                      Update process. Information available
                                      included     technical   reports    and
                                      documents, project status, and dates
                                      of upcoming public meetings and
                                      workshops      for   participation.    A
                                      regular Facebook post, including the
                                      hyperlink to the City’s website,
                                      encourage the public to visit the
                                      website. Reminders were also posted
                                      on the electronic message board at
                                      the Community Center, inviting
                                      people to visit the General Plan link
                                      on the website.
                                      Lastly, the printed material campaign
                                      included a direct mail postcard sent
                                      to every address in La Palma. The
                                      postcard mailer directed recipients to
                                      the City’s enhanced webpage for
more information about the General Plan Update process, and identified
upcoming opportunities to participate and provide input at public
meetings and workshops.
The expanded outreach campaign included using comment cards to
solicit input on land use matters at the core of the General Plan Update.
Comment cards were passed out at all outreach events and made
available at City Hall. A total of 46 comment cards were received. The
results of the outreach were summarized for the City Council in October,
2012.
The City Council conducted a workshop on the draft Housing Element on
February 19, 2013. Notices of the workshop were sent to all 5,000+
households in the City.
In the future, the City will continue to actively seek public participation in
the Housing Element process and will endeavor to continue to include
persons and groups from a diverse base. The City acknowledges that
those requiring affordable housing, and especially those utilizing very
low- and extremely low-income housing opportunities, are likely to be
among the toughest population segments to reach through traditional
advertising means (e.g., recent immigrants, transients, special needs
groups). As such, the City will work with the network of established local
housing advocates to include members of the populations in the future
                                                                              A p p e n d i x   C C‐5

                           efforts will be made to provide housing information in several languages
                           that are spoken locally–with special focus on Asian languages–and to
                           provide meeting notices and program brochures to local churches,
                           community organizations, legal activists, non-profit organizations, and
                           Section 8 housing cooperatives. Special efforts will be made to tailor
                           affordable housing programs and projects to meet the needs of the very
                           low- and extremely-low income populations in the community.

2. Housing Needs Assessment 
Ensuring the availability of adequate housing for all social and economic
sectors of the City’s present and future population is an important goal
for La Palma. This section of the Housing Element discusses the
characteristics of the City’s present and future population and housing
stock, in order to better define the nature and extent of the unmet
housing needs in the City. Specifically, it examines general population
and household characteristics and trends, such as age, race and ethnicity,
employment, household composition and size, household income, and
special needs. Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g., number
of units and type, tenure, age and condition, costs) are also addressed.
Finally, the City’s projected housing growth needs based on the 2014-
2021 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) are examined.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent data from the
2010 U.S. Census and American Community Survey estimates on
population and demographic characteristics, California Department of
Finance (DOF), California Employment Development Department (EDD),
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and other
relevant sources.
2.1 Population Trends and Characteristics 
2.1.1 Population Trends 
According to the U.S. Census, the population of the City of La Palma
stayed nearly constant between 2000 and 2010, growing from 15,408 to
15,568 (1.0%) in this 10-year period, much less than the 6.4% growth
reported for Orange County as a whole for the same period (see Table C-
2). However, this growth is much greater than that experienced between
1990 and 2000, when the population increased by only 10 people. Based
on estimates provided by the California Department of Finance, in 2012
La Palma had a population of 15,700, indicating the City continues to
have capacity for very modest growth. The City’s 2012 population
represents approximately 0.5% of the Orange County total population of
over three million persons.

                           The age breakdown of a population is an important factor in evaluating
                           housing needs and projecting the direction of future housing
                           development. Table C-3 illustrates the age distribution of La Palma
                           residents in 2010, compared to the age distribution of County of Orange
                           residents. This table shows that 22% of the City’s population is under the
                           age of 18, 63% is between the ages of 18 and 65, and 15% is over the age
                           of 65. In comparison to the county, La Palma’s population is slightly
                           older, with the median age of City’s population exceeding the county

                           African American. Approximately 4.3% of La Palma’s population identified
                           themselves with more than one race category, and 4.9% identified
                           themselves as some other race.

2.1.4 Employment 
Current employment and projected job growth have a significant
influence on housing needs during this planning period. The
unemployment rate in La Palma was reported by the 2010 Census as
3.8%. This was significantly less than the County rate of 7.4%. Table C-5
shows that the City had a workforce of 7,433 persons, or approximately
60% of the working-age population, as reported by the 2006-2010
American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. This table shows that
roughly 60% of those aged 16 and over in La Palma were in the labor
force as of 2010, in comparison to 67% throughout the County. About 2%
of residents in La Palma worked at home and approximately 40% of
residents aged 16 or older were not in the labor force.

In 2000, approximately 23% of La Palma’s working residents were
employed in educational services and health care and social assistance
related professions (Table C-6). A significant percentage of workers
(15%) were employed in manufacturing occupations. A relatively low
percentage of workers were employed in financial-related professions
(9%),       arts       and       entertainment           professions       (8.4%),
professional/management professions (8.4%), and retail trade positions

                            2.2.1 Household Composition and Size 
                            The U.S. Census defines a household as all persons who occupy a
                            housing unit, regardless of whether these persons are related by birth,
                            marriage, or adoption. People living in retirement or convalescent homes,
                            dormitories, or other group living situations are not considered
                            households. The characteristics of the households in a city are important
                            indicators of the type of housing needed in that community.
                            As in most cities, families (defined by the Census as people who live
                            together in a household that are related to the householder by birth,
                            marriage, or adoption) represented the majority (87%) of La Palma’s
                            4,212 households in 2010. According to the 2010 Census, approximately
                            85% of La Palma’s residents live in small (one- to four-person)
                            households. Only 868 households, or 17% of the City’s households, were
                            non-family households in 2010. Generally, since 2000, there has been a
                            significant increase in the number of non-family households (in 2000
                            only 3.5% of households were non-family households), which can be
                            related to changes in how households are comprised and the economic
                            downturn that began in 2008.
                            2.2.2 Overcrowding 
                            The federal government defines an overcrowded household as having
                            more than one person per room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens,
                            hallways, and porches. Severe overcrowding occurs when there are more
                            than 1.5 persons per room. Overcrowding results from either a lack of
                            affordable housing (which forces more than one household to live
                            together) and/or a lack of available housing units of adequate size.
                            According to the 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-Year
                            Estimates, approximately 129 occupied housing units were overcrowded
                            in La Palma, representing roughly 3% of the occupied housing units in the
                            City (Table C-7). This figure is seven percentage points lower than
                            reported in the 2000 Census, which indicated that 10% of the units in La
                            Palma were overcrowded. In general, overcrowding in La Palma continues
                            to be lower as compared to Orange County (9% of units are overcrowded).

The data do not distinguish between units in single-family (R-1) zones
versus multifamily zones (R-3). In La Palma, where many of the homes in
the R-1 zones are relatively large and apartments in the R-3 zones
generally have two bedrooms, the City surmises that rental overcrowding
is more prevalent in apartment housing.
Overcrowding is much more prevalent in renter households than among
owners. Among renter households, about 10% were estimated to be
overcrowded (compared to just 1% of owners) and 1% were severely
overcrowded (compared to 0% of owners). While overcrowding may
indicate a need for larger units, it is also the result of high housing costs
as compared to incomes. Programs 1 (Section 8 Rental Assistance) and 14
(Adequate Sites) will help to address these needs.

2.2.3 Household Income 
Income is a major factor in evaluating the affordability of housing in a
community. According to the 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-
Year Estimates, in 2010 the median household income in La Palma was
$89,788 (Table C-8), which is 21% higher than the County of Orange
median of $74,344. Furthermore, the 2010 median income in La Palma
represents a significant increase (31%) over the 2000 median income of
$68,438.

                             2.2.4  Housing Affordability and Overpayment 
                             California Health and Safety Code §50079.5 and §50105 provide that
                             affordability limits are those that are established by the U.S. Department
                             of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The income limits set by HUD
                             are revised annually and are based on median family income for a
                             particular county and a corresponding family size. State and federal
                             guidelines dictate the following income categories:
                                          Extremely Low-Income: less than 30% of the Area Median
                                           Family Income (AMFI)
                                          Very Low-Income: less than 50% of the Area Median Family
                                           Income
                                          Low-Income is deemed to be between 50% and 80% of the
                                           Area Median Family Income
                                          Moderate-Income is set at levels between 80% and 120% of
                                           Area Median Family Income
                             In the County of Orange, the Area Median Family Income (for a family of
                             four) was $85,300 dollars for 2012. Table C-9 illustrates the range of
                             income housing limits for Orange County, including the City of La Palma.

                             A large percentage of the very low-income households of La Palma are
                             likely to be comprised of retired persons whose homes are no longer
                             mortgaged. State and federal standards specify that a household
                             overpays for housing if it spends more than 30% of its gross income on
                             housing. A household spending more than it can afford for housing has
                             less money available for other necessities and emergency expenditures.
                             Lower-income renter households overpaying for housing are more likely
                             to be at risk of becoming homeless than owner-households. Because
                             renter-households tend to have lower incomes than homeowners,
                             overpayment affects renter-households more seriously. In addition,
                             overpayment by owners is considered less serious than overpayment by
                             renters because they have more options than renters, and are therefore
                             less likely to become homeless. That is, owners generally are building
                             equity, and have the option of selling the home and possibly obtaining

less expensive housing, refinancing, or using the equity in the home to
obtain a loan.
According to the 2010 Census, there were 4,725 occupied housing units
in La Palma. Of these, 3,955 (84%) were owner occupied; 770 (16%) were
renter-occupied. Table C-10 shows estimates of income and housing
problems based on the Comprehensive Affordability Strategy special
Census tabulations completed for HUD. The data indicate that 700 lower-
income households in owner-occupied units (65%) were overpaying for
housing, and 450 lower-income households in renter-occupied units
(66%) were overpaying for housing. A portion of overpayment is
addressed through Section 8 rental assistance certificates issued by the
Orange County Housing Authority. The County has issued 64 Section 8
rental assistance vouchers to lower-income households in the City as of
2012.

2.2.5 Special Needs Groups 
Certain segments of the population may have a more difficult time
finding decent, affordable housing due to their special circumstances or
needs. These “special needs” households include elderly persons,
disabled persons, large households, female-headed households, farm
workers and homeless persons. Table C-11 summarizes the special
needs groups within the City.

                            The special needs of many households containing adults over the age of
                            65 result from their lower, fixed incomes, physical and development
                            disabilities, or dependence needs.
                            The City of La Palma’s elderly population more than doubled between
                            1980 and 1990, and again between 1990 and 2000. Between 2000 and
                            2010, the elderly population continued to increase, by roughly 57%. The
                            2010 Census reported that there were 2,477 persons aged 65 and over
                            living in La Palma. This represents approximately 16% of the total
                            population, with 6% of elderly living below the poverty level.
                            According to the 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-Year
                            Estimates, 33% of owner households and 15% of renter households are
                            headed by an elderly person (Table C-12). The 2006-2010 American
                            Community Survey 5-Year Estimates also reports the number of
                            households with Grandparent as Caregivers, which indicated that there
                            are 600 La Palma households with a grandparent and a grandchild under
                            the age of 18, and 250 of those households indicated that the
                            grandparent is responsible for the grandchildren.

Elderly persons who live alone and those caring for their grandchildren
may have special housing needs due to a need for assistance with
finances and daily living activities. Furthermore, many senior citizens
have fixed incomes and experience financial difficulty in coping with
rising housing and living costs. This problem will grow in magnitude as
the percentage of elderly residents continues to rise. Finally, as one
might expect, most seniors are not in the labor force and earning an
income, and may need help in meeting ongoing housing costs, especially
utility and related costs, and often are forced to defer necessary repairs.
A total of 46 Section 8 rental assistance certificates have been issued to
elderly persons in the City as of 2012. Rental assistance to reduce
housing costs is of value to current, as well as future, senior renter
households; however, presently in La Palma a greater number of owner-
occupied housing units headed by senior householders are overpaying
for housing than are renter-occupied units headed by seniors. Additional
renter assistance resources would benefit the senior households that are
overpaying, as well as other elderly persons who may desire to shift
tenure due to the death of a spouse.
In addition to rental assistance (Program 1), the Housing Plan includes
programs for rehabilitation (Program 2), “reverse” mortgages (Program 5),
Section 202 elderly housing (Program 6), preservation of units at risk of
converting to market-rate (Program 2), and reasonable accommodation
for persons with disabilities (Program 13). All of these City efforts benefit
elderly persons.
2.2.5.B  Disabled  
Physical, mental, and developmental disabilities can hinder access to
housing units of traditional design, and potentially limit the ability to
earn adequate income. According to the 2000 Census, there were 3,379
disabilities reported for persons 5 years of age or over in La Palma.1 Since
2000, 97 handicapped-accessible (very low- and moderate-income)
housing units have been constructed in La Palma. Two group homes for
the care of children with severe mental and physical disabilities are
located in the City of La Palma. The County of Orange has issued five
Section 8 rental assistance vouchers to disabled persons in the City as of
2012.
The Housing Plan includes programs that address the needs of the
disabled, including Section 202 elderly housing (Program 6), and
providing reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities
(Program 13).

                            According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, a
                            "developmental disability" is a disability that originates before an
                            individual turns 18 years old, continues, or can be expected to continue,
                            indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual,
                            which includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism.
                            This term shall also include disabling conditions found to be closely
                            related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that
                            required for individuals with mental retardation, but does not include
                            other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.
                            Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently
                            within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled
                            individuals require a group living environment where supervision is
                            provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an
                            institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy
                            are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood,
                            the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is
                            the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an
                            appropriate level of independence as an adult.
                            The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently
                            provides community based services to approximately 243,000 persons
                            with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide
                            system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two
                            community-based facilities. The Regional Center of Orange County
                            provides a local point of entry to services for people with developmental
                            disabilities. The center is a private, non-profit community agency that
                            contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to
                            individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.
                            Table C-14 provides information on the number of developmentally
                            disabled individuals in La Palma who have sought services from the
                            Regional Center of Orange County. In 2012, there were approximately 79
                            individuals from La Palma (0.5% of the total population) actively utilizing
                            services at the Regional Center for a developmental disability.

A number of housing types are appropriate for people living with a
development disability, including standard residential units, rent
subsidized homes, group living facilities, and licensed care facilities. The
design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services
and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities represent
some of the types of considerations that are important in serving this
need group. Incorporating “barrier-free” design in all new multi-family
housing (as required by California and federal fair housing laws) is
especially important to provide the widest range of choices for disabled
residents. Special consideration should also be given to the affordability
of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
To assist in the housing needs for persons with Developmental
Disabilities, the Housing Plan includes Program 13 to provide reasonable
accommodation for persons with disabilities.
2.2.5.D Large Households 
Large households are defined as those with five or more persons.
Analysis of 2010 Census data shows that 821 households in La Palma are
classified as “large” (Table C-15). Of all renter households, 91 are
overcrowded or severely overcrowded. Due to the built-out nature of La
Palma and the shortage of vacant land available for housing development
limited opportunities exist for construction of new rental housing.
Further, the nature of existing rental housing in La Palma renders it
infeasible to consider expanding or enlarging existing tenant units (to
create four-bedroom units) to accommodate large households or
alleviate overcrowding.
In order to address this issue, the City will continue to work with the
County of Orange to seek grant monies and Section 8 support to meet
the needs of residents in large and overcrowded households. In addition,
the Housing Plan includes several other programs that may serve large
families, including housing rehabilitation and preservation of units at
risk of converting to market-rate (Program 2), and the Adequate Sites
Program (Program 14).

                            2.2.5.E Female‐Headed Households 
                            Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance
                            because of their increased need for affordable and accessible day care,
                            health care, and other supportive services. Female-headed households
                            with children in particular tend to have lower incomes than other types of
                            households, which limits their housing options and access to supportive
                            services. Analysis of the 2010 Census data indicates there were 290
                            female-headed households with children in La Palma at this time. Thirty-
                            eight householders in this category were living under the poverty line.
                            The Housing Plan includes several programs that may serve female-
                            headed households, including Section 8 Rental Assistance (Program 1),
                            housing rehabilitation and preservation of units at risk of converting to
                            market-rate (Program 2).
                            2.2.5.F Farm Workers 
                            The 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates indicate
                            18 individuals were employed in farming, fishing or forestry related
                            occupations workers while living in La Palma. The City of La Palma does
                            not currently have an areas or zones designated for agricultural uses. The
                            City is built out, and undeveloped areas are designated for recreation or
                            as open space. Consequently, the estimated 18 individuals identified as
                            working in the agricultural sector are likely to be employed outside of the
                            City. The demand for housing generated by farm workers in the City is
                            thus estimated to be extremely low to nonexistent.
                            The City does allow second dwelling units to be constructed in the
                            single-family (R-1) and multiple family (R-3) residential zones which can
                            provide units for employees working in these occupations. The City also
                            has a number of affordable multi-family units that could provide housing
                            for employees in the sector.

2.2.5.G Homeless 
The Orange County homeless population includes many working families
and individuals who live in cars, parks, under bridges, in motels and in
homeless shelters trying to maintain their dignity while they struggle to
survive. As a result, most homeless remain hidden. A Point-in-Time
Count and Survey of the Homeless was conducted by the County of
Orange in 2009 and 2011. The Point-in-Time Count estimated for the
entire county a total of 8,333 homeless individuals in 2009 and 6,939
individuals in 2011. Between 2009 and 2011, the survey showed a 25%
decline in the number of homeless persons in the county. Data for
individual cities are not available, and it is difficult to quantify the
number of homeless in the City of La Palma. Of those homeless persons
counted in shelters and on the streets in Orange County, none reported
La Palma as their city of last permanent residence. At this time, City staff
is not aware of any homeless individuals and/or families that regularly
reside in La Palma, although anecdotal reports cite person living within
the Coyote Creek channel along the City’s western edge.
Often, homelessness is a spiraling-down process; households facing
employment or other crisis would move to successively less costly
communities. Regional strategies to combat homelessness are developed
through Orange County’s Continuum of Care System. The goal of the
Continuum of Care Strategic Plan is to work toward a seamless system of
care through advocacy, homeless prevention, outreach and assessment,
emergency shelter, transitional shelter and permanent affordable
housing. Approximately 76 emergency and transitional shelters are
available in nearby communities to persons experiencing homelessness.
These include 485 emergency shelter beds and 2,044 transitional shelter
beds, according to Orange County’s 2010 survey.
Persons threatened with homelessness are most likely the 295
households in La Palma with incomes at 30% of area median income or
below. This group was discussed within the subset of very low-income
renter and owner households who were cost burdened by 30% to 50% of
their monthly income for rent. These households are at greatest risk for
homelessness as any interruption in their modest income could make
them homeless within one to three months, depending on the
circumstances.
The nonprofit 2-1-1 Orange County organization is a 24 hours a day,
seven days-a-week, toll-free number that people in need of assistance
can call to obtain comprehensive information and referrals to health and
human services. Available services include food, shelter, government
assistance programs, urgent care, substance abuse and treatment
programs, and workforce development.
2.3 Housing Stock Characteristics 
2.3.1 Housing Growth 
The composition of La Palma’s housing stock is identified in Table C-16.
The table shows a comparison of housing type, number of units, and
                                                                           A p p e n d i x   C C‐19

                             percentage distribution from 2000 to 2010. As shown, only 69 units were
                             added to the City’s housing stock between 2000 and 2010, most of
                             which were multi-family units in a single development project. However,
                             the mix of housing types in the City remained relatively constant. Single-
                             family detached homes comprise the majority (71%) of the housing stock
                             in La Palma. This is the primary difference between the City’s housing
                             types and those countywide, (50% of the county’s housing stock is
                             comprised of single-family units).
                             Vacancy rates in the City were relatively low, with just 5.6% of units
                             available for rent and only 0.3% of units for sale. The rental vacancy rate
                             for the county as a whole was comparable, at 6.3%, while the county’s
                             rate of for-sale housing was somewhat higher, at 1.8%. Rental vacancy
                             rates in the 2% range indicate nearly full occupancy, and contribute to
                             upward pressures on rents. The City’s overall vacancy rate increased
                             between 2000 and 2010, from 1.7% to 2.8%.

                             2.3.2  Housing Tenure  
                             Housing tenure (owner versus renter) is an important indicator of the
                             housing market. Communities need an adequate supply of units available
                             both for rent and for sale in order to accommodate a range of households
                             with varying income, family size and composition, and lifestyle. Table C-
                             17 provides a comparison of the number of owner-occupied and renter-
                             occupied units in the City in 2010 as compared to the county as a whole.
                             It reveals that the level of homeownership for the City is 23 percentage
                             points higher than the county.

2.3.3 Age and Condition of Housing Stock  
2.3.3.A Single‐Family Housing 
The age of a community’s housing stock can provide an indicator of
overall housing conditions. Typically, housing over 30 years in age is
likely to have rehabilitation needs that may include new plumbing, roof
repairs, foundation work and other repairs. Table C-18 displays the age
of occupied housing stock by tenure as of 2010. The majority of housing
in La Palma (80%) was built in the 1960s and 1970s, and reached 30 to
40 years of age in 2010.
According to the 2010 Census, approximately 85% of the City’s housing
stock is more than 30 years old. As the City is almost entirely built out,
fewer new units are being constructed. Based on reports provided by the
California Department of Finance, between 2000 and 2010,
approximately 69 units (or 1.4%) were added to the City’s housing stock.
Among owner-occupied housing, 89% of units were constructed prior to
1980, with an additional 9% constructed in the 1980s. Similarly, 62% of
renter housing units are greater than 30 years in age. The majority of the
housing stock in the City was built before 1980 (3,998 units were in place
by that year). The largest increases in the housing stock in the City
occurred between 1960-1970 and 1970-1980; within two decades 80%
of all housing in La Palma was constructed.

                            Most of the housing stock in La Palma remains in good condition. Very
                            few housing units in the City are considered substandard, and the City
                            actively addresses those through code enforcement. The City of La
                            Palma’s Code Enforcement staff works to ensure that the City’s municipal
                            code and property maintenance standards are met through both
                            proactive code enforcement efforts and by responding to complaints
                            received from the community. The goal of the Code Enforcement
                            program is to ensure and maintain the high property values and
                            standards and excellent quality of life enjoyed throughout our City.
                            The Code Enforcement Department tracks the number of open/active and
                            closed cases each month, and ranks open cases by priority. On average,
                            there are approximately three to six high priority cases each quarter of
                            the year that remain open (out of approximately 40 cases that remain
                            open). High priorities include public nuisances that could be detrimental
                            to public health and welfare, as well as maintenance standards such as
                            graffiti removal. Notices are sent to property owners, and where
                            warranted, administrative citations are issued. Through the proactive and
                            reactive efforts of the Code Enforcement Department, the housing stock
                            in the City is routinely monitored and found to be in good condition.
                            According to a countywide comparison of median home sale price to
                            peak home price, La Palma single-family residential property is extremely
                            stable, and the current median home sale price is only approximately 16
                            percent lower than the peak home price (which occurred in 2006). Only
                            two other cities (Villa Park and Irvine) had lower deviations in market
                            value. As such, the housing stock in La Palma can be said to be more
                            stable than 91% of the rest of Orange County.
                            2.3.3.B  Multi‐Family Housing 
                            The Nova La Palma apartment complex, at 7777 and 7799 Valley View
                            Street, was rehabilitated in 1998 to upgrade the property and convert all
                            the units to low-income affordable housing. This complex remains in
                            good condition. The other multi-family complexes in the City (Brookside,

need varying levels of rehabilitation.
2.3.4 Housing Costs 
2.3.4.A Housing Affordability Criteria 
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing
programs based on the area (i.e., county) median income (“AMI”):
            Extremely low (30% or less of AMI)
            Very low (31-50% of AMI)
            Low (51-80% of AMI)
            Moderate (81-120% of AMI)
            Above moderate (over 120% of AMI)
Housing affordability is based on the relationship between household
income and housing expenses. According to HUD and the California
Department of Housing and Community Development, housing is
considered “affordable” if the monthly payment is no more than 30% of a
household’s gross income. In some areas (such as Orange County), these
income limits may be increased to adjust for high housing costs.
Table C-19 shows affordable rent levels and estimated affordable
purchase prices for housing in La Palma (and Orange County) by income
category. Based on state-adopted standards, the maximum affordable
monthly rent for extremely low-income households is $515, while the
maximum affordable rent for very low-income households is $941. The
maximum affordable rent for low-income households is $1,318, while
the maximum for moderate-income households is $2,135.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to
variations in mortgage interest rates and qualifying procedures, down
payments, special tax assessments, homeowner association fees,
property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the maximum home
purchase prices by income category shown in Table C-18 have been
estimated based on typical conditions.

                            2.3.4.B For‐Sale Housing 
                            According to the 2010 Census, the median value of a home in La Palma
                            was $615,000. This reflects a continuing increase in the value of owner-
                            occupied units in the City. Table C-20 compares single-family and
                            condominium sales prices during May 2012 in La Palma and nearby
                            communities by ZIP code, and contrasts this with sales prices during May
                            2011. A total of nine single-family homes were sold within the City
                            during May 2012, commanding a median sales price of $475,000. Median
                            sales prices in La Palma were higher than Anaheim, Lakewood, Cypress,
                            Westminster, and Santa Ana, and were comparable to Costa Mesa,
                            Huntington Beach, and the countywide median of $455,000. While only a
                            limited number of homes were sold in La Palma, at -8.3%, the City’s year-
                            over-year price decrease was comparable to that experienced among all
                            comparison cities, the majority of which experienced a decrease in
                            median single-family home prices. No condominiums were sold in La
                            Palma during May 2012.
                            Housing prices have decreased dramatically throughout the nation since
                            the housing boom of the mid-2000s. In La Palma, the median home price
                            averaged $650,000 in 2007 (at the peak). Home prices today are more
                            affordable, as they have decreased approximately 27%.

                            *Survey of advertised apartments, July, 2012
                            When market rents are compared to the amounts low-income households
                            can afford to pay (Table C-19 and Table C-21), it is clear that very low-
                            and extremely low-income households have a difficult time finding
                            housing without overpaying. The gap between advertised market rent and
                            affordable rent for a two-bedroom apartment at the very low-income
                            level ranges from $360 to $710 per month, while the gap at the
                            extremely low-income level ranges from $785 to $1,135 per month.
                            However, at the low-income and moderate-income levels, households are
                            more likely to find affordable rentals. The affordable payment for a four-
                            person low-income La Palma household is $1,318, which is within the
                            range of advertised apartment rents for a 1-bedroom or 2-bedroom
                            apartment.
                            2.3.5 Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion 
                            State law requires the City to identify, analyze, and propose programs to
                            preserve affordable multi-family housing units that are currently
                            restricted to low-income housing use and that will become unrestricted
                            and possibly be lost as affordable housing (i.e., units at risk). Table C-22
                            outlines affordable housing units and potential conversion risks in La
                            Palma.

2.3.5.A Nova La Palma Apartments 
The Nova La Palma Apartments conversion was accomplished with
assistance in the form of revenue bond financing through the California
Statewide Communities Development Authority (CSCDA). CSCDA provides
refinancing for single and multiple agency housing projects that
designate a certain number of units for affordable housing. Nova La
Palma (formerly Casa La Palma) is the oldest apartment complex in the
City, and this purchase and rehabilitation by developer Steadfast McCord,
LLC significantly improved the affordable housing stock in the City.
In addition to the affordability covenant and bonds issued for the project,
Section 8 Housing Certificates are being used in the complex. The
project’s covenants require that the units remain low-income units
through March of 2013. The current owner repaid debt obligations in
2011. Section 8 vouchers are allocated annually, so the possibility exists
that the Nova La Palma Apartments could convert to market rate during
this planning period if these units lose Section 8 assistance. The CSCDA
agreement includes requirements for the gradual phasing out of
affordable units should the Section 8 contracts not be renewed.
The City has committed to working with the developer to encourage
keeping Section 8 contracts in place to allow as many units as possible to
                                                                              A p p e n d i x   C C‐27

                            remain affordable. However, with the absence of redevelopment funds,
                            resources are extremely limited. The City will continue its participation in
                            the OCHCD Section 8 program.
                            The City joined the CSCDA specifically to initiate this conversion project.
                            The City’s membership will enable future projects in the City to apply for
                            financing assistance that is risk-free to the City.

                            Village townhomes were at risk starting in 2006. Of the 46 Montecito
                            Village units, 31 were converted to market rate and 15 remain affordable.
                            Of the 16 Kathy Drive single-family homes, 12 have converted to market
                            rate and four remain affordable as of 2012. Due to a lack of available
                            land for 19 new units in the City, replacement is impossible and
                            preservation is the only feasible option for these projects. In the past, the
                            City has been able to exercise its “Right of First Refusal” to preserve some
                            of the units at Montecito Village as affordable housing. In recent years,
                            however, additional units have paid off their promissory notes
                            and terminated their affordability covenants, and the City has not been
                            able to successfully preserve many units. Staff believes this activity is due
                            to two factors. First, there has been an increased awareness by
                            homeowners of their affordability provisions with the development of the
                            second phase Tapestry Walk. The second factor is due to the
                            exceptionally low mortgage interest rate. Many homeowners have elected
                            to refinance their units; with such low interest rates, homeowners are
                            able to lower their monthly payments and take out enough equity to
                            retire the silent second promissory note and remove the affordability
                            covenant.
                            The dissolution of redevelopment in California has eliminated the funding
                            source that the City in the past used to exercise its First Right of Refusal
                            to repurchase the units and keep the affordability covenants. However, if
                            other funding sources become available in the future, the City will
                            continue to seek opportunities to purchase the units as they become
                            available and renew the silent second for an additional term of
                            affordability. The most important effort in the future will be to secure
                            long-term affordability covenants on new and, if possible, existing
                            affordable housing. Under Phase II of the Denni Street Affordable Housing
                            Project (constructed in 2012), all six affordable units will have
                            affordability covenants in perpetuity.
                            According to the National Housing Trust, there are currently no other at-
                            risk units in La Palma. However, the Nova La Palma Apartments (272
                            units), as well as four homes on Kathy Drive and 15 townhomes at
                            Montecito Village that are at risk of converting to market rate during the
                            next 10 years.

Specific actions to protect or replace at risk units include:
           Contact Property Owners: Maintain contact with owners of
            at-risk units as potential conversion dates approach, and
            discuss with the owners the City’s desire to preserve the units
            as affordable and determine if a strategy can be devised to
            make continued preservation possible. This may include
            seeking other funding sources or providing mutually
            acceptable incentives.
           Owner Education: Work with owners of units at risk of
            converting to market rate. Provide owners with information
            regarding potential programs that might assist in the
            preservation of the units as affordable housing. Act as a
            liaison between owners and non-profits potentially involved in
            constructing or acquiring replacement housing.
           Work with Non-profits: Work with nonprofit housing
            providers to explore, and if appropriate, facilitate acquisition
            or replacement of at-risk units.
           Right of First Refusal: Because the City has the right of first
            refusal to purchase units as they come up for sale in the
            Montecito Village Townhomes and the Kathy Drive single-
            family homes, the City will endeavor to purchase units as they
            become available and extend their term of affordability for an
            additional 10-year period, as funding is available.
2.3.5.C Preservation and Replacement Options 
State Housing Element law requires an analysis to preserve or replace
affordable housing that is at risk of converting to market rate.
Preservation of at-risk projects can be achieved in a variety of ways, with
adequate funding availability. These include:
       Transfer of ownership to nonprofit developers and housing
        organizations
       Providing rental assistance to renters through other funding
        sources
       Purchase affordability covenants
       Refinance mortgage revenue bonds
Alternatively, units that are converted to market rate may be replaced
with new assisted multi-family units with specified affordability
timeframes.
Transfer of Ownership
Transferring ownership of the affordable units to a nonprofit housing
organization is a viable way to preserve affordable housing for the long
term and increase the number of government resources available to the
project. The feasibility of this option depends upon the willingness of the
owner to sell, funding sources available to buy the property, and the
existence of a nonprofit organization with sufficient administrative
capacity to manage the property. Additionally, projects in which all of the
units are affordable (such as Nova La Palma), rather than just a portion
                                                                            A p p e n d i x   C C‐29

                            L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                            (such as Montecito Village and Kathy Drive), are more likely to be feasible
                            because they lend themselves to ownership transfers more simply. A list
                            of qualified agencies that have indicated interest in purchasing projects
                            that are at risk of converting to market rate is maintained by the
                            California Department of Housing and Community Development. In La
                            Palma, the estimated market value for the 291 affordable units in the at-
                            risk project is estimated to be approximately $52.46 million.

                            Rental Assistance
                            State, local, or other funding sources can also be used to provide rental
                            subsidies to maintain the affordability of at-risk projects. These subsidies
                            can be structured to mirror the Section 8 program, whereby the subsidy
                            covers the cost of the unit above what is determined to be affordable for
                            the tenant’s household income (including a utility allowance) up to the
                            fair market value of the apartment. This option is not available for
                            moderate-income units because the affordable monthly cost for a
                            household (30 percent of income) exceeds the fair market rents.
                            However, this option could be available for a project serving lower-
                            income households, such as Nova La Palma. Given the mix of unit sizes in
                            this development, the total annual subsidy to maintain the 272 at-risk
                            units here is estimated at over $985,000 each year (Table C-24). Finding
                            funding sources to make this a viable preservation option can be difficult.

Purchase Affordability Covenants
Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is to
provide an incentive package to the owners to maintain the projects as
low-income housing. Incentives could include writing down the interest
rate on the remaining loan balance and/or supplementing the Section 8
subsidy received to market levels. The feasibility of this option depends
on whether the complex requires rehabilitation or is too highly leveraged,
as well as the availability of funding.
Construction of Replacement Units
The construction of new low-income housing can be a means to replace
at-risk units. The cost of developing new housing depends on a variety of
factors including density, size of units, construction quality and type,
location, and land cost. Assuming a development cost of $200,000 per
unit, the cost of replacing all 291 affordable at-risk units can be
estimated to be approximately $58 million. In La Palma, with no vacant
land, the cost could be substantially higher due to costs associated with
land acquisition and demolition of existing development.
2.4 Housing Needs Summary 
In November 2011, SCAG released the draft RHNA growth needs for each
of the county’s cities plus the unincorporated area. The total housing
growth need for the City of La Palma during the 2014-2021 planning
period is nine units. This total is distributed by income category as shown
in Table C-25.
Table C‐25: Regional Housing Growth Need 
    Income Category             Number of Units          Percent of Total
 Extremely Low                                     1                     11%

                                                                            A p p e n d i x   C C‐31

                            It should be noted that SCAG did not identify growth needs for the
                            extremely low-income category in the adopted RHNA. As provided in
                            Assembly Bill (AB) 2634 of 2006, jurisdictions may determine their
                            extremely-low-income need as one-half the need in the very-low
                            category.

3. Housing Constraints 
3.1 Market Constraints 
Market, or non-governmental constraints, within the context of housing
element legislation, consists of financing, land and construction costs.
Usually, these factors are considered market conditions and may include
the prices and rents charged in the marketplace.
3.1.1 Inventory of Vacant Land 
The lack of vacant land in the City represents a significant barrier to
housing development. As indicated on Table C-24, only one 0.38-acre
parcel currently designated for residential use remains vacant in the City.
The property owner has indicated intention to develop the vacant site
with a single-family residential use and a second unit, consistent with the
General Plan designation.
After a period of rapid residential growth in the 1960s and 1970s, La
Palma reached a point where very few remaining parcels remained
suitable for residential development of more than one unit. Therefore,
the cost of land is not a significant constraint to housing development;
rather, the most significant constraint is the lack of available land.
3.1.2   Construction Costs 
Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor,
development standards and general market conditions. The City has no
influence over materials and labor costs, and the building codes and
development standards in La Palma are not substantially different than
most other cities in Orange County. Construction costs for materials and
labor have increased at a slightly higher pace than the general rate of
inflation according to the Construction Industry Research Board.
                                                                          A p p e n d i x   C C‐33

                            L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                            3.1.3 Financing Costs and Availability 
                            The crisis in the mortgage industry that started in 2007 affected the
                            availability and cost of real estate loans, although the long-term effects
                            are unpredictable. The credit “crunch” resulted when sub-prime lenders
                            made it possible for low-income families or others who could not qualify
                            for standard mortgages to become homeowners even though they might
                            not have had the credit history and income to support repayment of the
                            loans. The problem typically occurs with adjustable rate mortgages
                            (ARMs) after the initial fixed interest rate period expires (often three
                            years) and the interest rate converts to market rates. Because ARMs often
                            offer “teaser” initial interest rates well below market for the first few
                            years, monthly payments may increase by several hundred dollars when
                            the loan converts to market rate. When property values were increasing,
                            as was the case from 2000 to 2006, homeowners had the option of
                            refinancing to a new loan when the initial rate expired. However, in the
                            subsequent market with declining values, homeowners may owe more
                            than the resale value of their home, making refinancing impossible. As a
                            result of these conditions, there has been a significant rise in foreclosure
                            rates, and changes in mortgage underwriting standards are likely to have
                            greater impacts on low-income families than other segments of the
                            community. Also, lenders have significantly tightened their lending
                            practices, with sub-prime mortgages extraordinarily difficult to obtain.
                            Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to
                            discriminate against entire neighborhoods in lending practices because of
                            the physical or economic conditions in the area; this practice is known as
                            redlining. In monitoring new construction sales, re-sales of existing
                            homes, and permits for remodeling, it would not appear that redlining is
                            practiced in any area of La Palma.
                            Interest rates are determined by national market conditions, not local
                            jurisdictional policies. As of 2012, interest rates were at historic lows,
                            spurred by the Federal Reserve’s purchases of mortgage-backed
                            securities. As interest rates rise, jurisdictions can offer interest rate
                            write-downs to extend home purchase opportunities to lower income
                            households. In addition, government insured loan programs may be
                            available to reduce mortgage down payment requirements. Residents of
                            La Palma have both a Mortgage Credit Certification Program and a bond
                            financed First Time Homebuyers program available to them. Both
                            programs are administered through agencies of Orange County. Since
                            relatively few residents in the City have taken advantage of these
                            programs, the City may need to embark on a more aggressive advertising
                            campaign to increase awareness of them.
                            3.1.4 Land Costs 
                            Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of
                            new housing. Land values fluctuate with market conditions, and steadily
                            increased from 2000 to about 2006. The downturn in the housing market
                            that began in 2007 reduced land values significantly. The result was a
                            recent relatively sharp decline in property values. Values began to climb
                            slowly in 2012, but periods of minimal appreciation can be anticipated
                            before prices fully recover.

3.2 Infrastructure Constraints 
Because the City has developed primarily within the last 40 years,
infrastructure, including water, sewer, and sidewalks are readily available
and adequate within the City limits. As discussed under Fees, the City
requires developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements
necessary to serve their projects. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may
also be required of a project for rights-of-way, transit facilities and
recreational facilities, consistent with the Subdivision Map Act.
Additionally, the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a
schedule of public improvements, including street/intersection
improvements and other public works projects required to maintain or
improve levels of service. The CIP helps to ensure that construction of
public improvements is coordinated with private development. As a result
of these policies, any infrastructure constraints which currently exist
must be fully mitigated and financed as development or redevelopment
occurs.
3.2.1 Wastewater 
Sewage collection and treatment in La Palma is provided by the Orange
County Sanitation District. The City is represented on the Board of
Directors for the District. In 2011-12, the City undertook an update to
its sewage collection service master plan to identify maintenance needs
and the schedule for providing routine maintenance funded by annual
assessments and service costs. These are routine fees that are passed on
to existing property owners.
3.2.2 Water  
Water service in La Palma is provided a combination pumped water from
local groundwater basins (groundwater–68%) and purchase of water from
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California through the
Municipal Water District of Orange County (imported water from Northern
California and the Colorado River–32%). This blend of groundwater and
imported water helps to ensure a consistent water supply to meet current
and future needs within the City. Therefore, domestic water supply is not
expected to limit development during the planning period. All new
development is required to incorporate water-saving plumbing fixtures
and landscape irrigation.
3.2.3 Storm Water Drainage 
Three regional drainage channels run through the City of La Palma:
Coyote Creek, Moody Creek, and Fullerton Creek. These channels are
fully improved for flood control purposes. Flood control systems have
been constructed to direct runoff away from developed areas and prevent
flooding associated with heavy rains. The Orange County Flood Control
District (OCFCD) is responsible for regional flood control facilities. The
City manages local in-street facilities. The City works closely with OCFCD
                                                                           A p p e n d i x   C C‐35

                            L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                            to determine needs for flood control improvements and to identify
                            improvements needed to accommodate proposed development projects,
                            if any. Because there is little vacant land in the City, the City’s flood
                            control system is not expected to be a limiting factor for development
                            during the planning period.
                            3.3 Fair Housing 
                            State law also prohibits discrimination in the development process or in
                            real property transactions, and it is the City’s policy to uphold the law in
                            this regard. La Palma supports the Fair Housing Council of Orange County
                            (FHCOC) to provide fair housing services by publicizing its services to
                            local residents. Services offered by the Fair Housing Council include
                            counseling concerning housing rights, obligations and laws, especially as
                            related to landlord/tenant problems; information on special assistance
                            including rental assistance programs, mortgage default/foreclosure
                            prevention, reverse mortgages, and Homebuyer Education Programs; and
                            investigation of housing discrimination complaints. Services are available
                            to low-to-moderate income persons free-of-charge and to others for a
                            moderate donation. Services are available in English, Spanish and
                            Vietnamese. These services are sufficient to serve needs of La Palma
                            residents.
                            3.4 Governmental Constraints 
                            3.4.1 Land Use Controls 
                            3.4.1.A Residential Zones  
                            Single-family housing is the predominant existing land use in the City,
                            comprising approximately half of its area. Multiple family housing
                            comprises approximately 8% of the community.
                            Land use controls, which govern the City’s residential zones, are detailed
                            in the Development Code (Chapter 26 of the Municipal Code) and shown
                            in Table C-26: Development Code Requirements. These controls are
                            typical of those governing residential development in a suburban
                            community and do not unduly constrain residential development in the
                            City. The General Plan and this update of the Housing Element
                            incorporate residential designations that respond to the needs of the
                            City, and which accurately represent the types of housing stock already
                            existing.

3.4.1.B Village Residential Overlay Zone 
In order to encourage the development of affordable housing, the City
adopted the Village Residential Overlay (VO) Zone, which allows for
increased residential densities (up to 30 units per acre) and increases the
flexibility for developers seeking to establish affordable housing in the
City. The designation is intended as an overlay for areas within the
Multiple Family Residential (R-3) district that involve special development
opportunities and require a tailored approach to planning and design.
The VO overlay provides for a variety of housing types within one project
or development ranging from single-family housing to multiple-family
dwellings, including uses incidental to the residential uses.
The types of developments that are suitable to the VO overlay zone
include affordable housing projects and senior housing projects that
involve tailored development standards and site design. The designation
has been applied to three areas of the City. The first is on the north side
of La Palma Avenue, east of Denni Street. The second area is on the west
                                                                                   A p p e n d i x   C C‐37

                            L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                            side of Walker Street, south of the intersection of Walker and
                            Orangethorpe. The third area is located on La Palma Avenue, east of
                            Moody Street.
                            Properties covered by this overlay zone are already occupied by
                            affordable housing units, and it is unlikely that additional affordable
                            housing units will be constructed within the existing Village Residential
                            Overlay Zone, with the exception of the area located on La Palma Avenue
                            east of Moody Street. This area is further discussed in Section 4: Housing
                            Resources and Opportunities. The City will work to maintain affordability
                            in this district and will consider expansion of the Overlay Zone in the
                            future, where appropriate.
                            3.4.1.C Mixed Use Standards 
                            The City currently allows for mixed-use development within the R-1, R-3,
                            OP (Office Professional), NC (Neighborhood Commercial), B-1 (business
                            park), and PI (Public/Institutional) zoning districts with a Conditional Use
                            Permit. If new mixed-use General Plan land use designations are
                            adopted, implementing zoning regulations will be completed, and
                            adopted concurrently with the General Plan update (anticipated for fall
                            2013). The City intends to use mixed-use zoning to facilitate requests
                            for new housing types in La Palma over the long term.
                            3.4.1.D Parking Standards 
                            The City’s parking standards for residential developments are tailored to
                            the vehicle ownership patterns associated with different residential uses.
                            In La Palma, two parking spaces in a garage are required for each single-
                            family residential unit. Parking standards for multi-family residential
                            development is based on unit size. For two-bedroom units, two parking
                            spaces are required plus one guest space (at least 66% of which must be
                            covered; three-bedroom units must provide three spaces plus one guest
                            space (at least 50% of parking must be covered), and four-bedroom or
                            more units must provide four spaces plus one guest space (at least 40%
                            of the parking must be covered). The required parking ratios are typical
                            for most cities in Orange County and are not considered to be a
                            constraint on the production of affordable housing. It is widely accepted
                            that seniors and low-income households have fewer cars on average than
                            higher-income households.
                            To encourage affordable and senior housing development, the City
                            implements State density bonus law to allow reduced parking for
                            qualifying multiple-family housing projects. (The City revised the
                            Development Code to comply with State density bonus law in 2011.) In
                            addition, developers of affordable projects can request up to three
                            variances, which may include a parking variance to reduce required
                            parking. The City is committed to working with affordable housing
                            developers to create viable affordable housing projects and increase the
                            diversity of housing options in La Palma.

3.4.1.E Park Dedication Requirements 
The City’s local park standard is four acres per 1,000 residents. However,
1.5 acres of this standard can be satisfied by cooperative arrangements
between the City and local school districts. The remainder amount can be
satisfied by either the dedication of land, payment of in-lieu fees, or a
combination thereof. The effective local park standard of 2.5 acres per
1,000 residents is not in excess of the minimum State requirements, and
therefore does not place an undue burden on the development of
housing.
3.4.1.F Effects of Land Use Regulations on Housing Supply and 
Affordability 
Under State law, for small metropolitan cities like La Palma with fewer
than 20,000 residents, a density of 20 units per acre is considered
adequate to facilitate development of lower-income housing.
The permitted density in the R-3 district is determined by parcel size,
with higher density allowed on larger parcels, as follows:
Parcel Size                   Maximum Density
2.0 acres or less             10 units/acre
2.1 – 4.0 acres               15 units/acre
4.1 acres or more             25 units/acre
In addition, the City has established the Village Overlay zone, which
permits multi-family development at densities up to 30 units per acre by
right.
3.4.2 Building Codes and Enforcement 
The City of La Palma has adopted the 2010 California Building Code,
which establishes minimum construction standards as applied to all
residential buildings. The City’s building code is based on regulations
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and the local
enforcement of this code does not unduly constrain the development of
housing.
The City has not adopted any amendments to the Building Code that
would impact the availability and affordability of housing in the City. In
addition, the City has avoided enacting excessively stringent
requirements on building materials and construction methods that would
hinder housing affordability and, where possible, plan reviews and
approval processes have been expedited to reduce construction times.
These efforts serve to lower overall development costs, thereby
maintaining housing affordability.
The City maintains a code enforcement program as a means of
maintaining the habitable condition of rental and owner-occupied units
within the City. The City conducts sensitive enforcement of its residential
codes by providing a minimum of three written notifications of code
violations to property owners, allowing sufficient time for compliance and
                                                                          A p p e n d i x   C C‐39

                            L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                            by providing information on available rehabilitation assistance to code
                            violators.
                            To assist lower-income La Palma homeowners who are charged with a
                            Code Enforcement violation, but cannot afford to make the necessary
                            repairs, the City has adopted a Residential Code Enforcement Relief
                            Program. The Program provides a grant of up to $10,000 to allow low-
                            income homeowners to bring their homes up to the City’s minimum
                            standards. This program was previously funded with Redevelopment Set-
                            Aside funds; as funding becomes available, the program will continue to
                            be implemented.
                            3.4.3 Site Improvements 
                            Since the City is almost completely built out and infrastructure is in place
                            to service the entire City, site improvements are not a significant
                            constraint to housing development. Because the City is surrounded by
                            other jurisdictions in both Orange County and Los Angeles County to the
                            west, a significant proportion of the traffic on its streets is the result of
                            the regional traffic, which is outside the City’s control. Therefore, the
                            traffic and street improvement considerations are the result of, and in
                            response to, this regional impact, and are not a constraint imposed by
                            the City itself. Largely, traffic conditions in La Palma are good, with only
                            the     La   Palma/Walker       and    Orangethorpe/Walker      intersections
                            experiencing congestion during peak travel periods.
                            3.4.4 Processing and Permit Procedures 
                            Development projects to be undertaken in residential zones require
                            submission of a Precise Plan. No separate conditional use permit is
                            required for a residential development. The applicant must undertake the
                            process outlined below when making a Precise Plan submission.
                            One key advantage in La Palma is that the City has no separate Planning
                            Commission; the City Council serves as the Planning Commission, which
                            reduces processing times.
                            3.4.4.A New Residential Developments 
                            The approval procedure for a new residential development requires a
                            Precise Plan Permit application to be processed by the City’s Community
                            Development Department. Within 30 days of receiving the application,
                            staff assesses the application for completeness. If deemed complete, staff
                            completes the appropriate CEQA documentation and makes it available
                            for public comment. Staff also notices the project for public hearing with
                            the Development Committee for design review. Typically, the CEQA
                            process involves a Negative Declaration, which must be available a
                            minimum of 20 days for review. The public hearing must be noticed a
                            minimum of 10 business days before the hearing date. If a
                            recommendation for approval to the Planning Commission is obtained
                            from the Development Committee, staff notices the project again, 10
                            business days before the Planning Commission Hearing date. If the
                            project is approved by the Planning Commission, the applicant must sign
                            an Agreement to Conditions of Approval within 30 days. Within five days

of project approval, staff records the CEQA documents with the County
Clerk-Recorder. The applicant can then submit to the Building Division
for building permit plan check and building permit issuance.
3.4.4.B Precise Plan Requirements 
The purpose of a Precise Plan is to provide a process for reviewing
applications for new residential development. The precise plan
application process allows for the review of the design of the
development, an identification of potential impacts on the surrounding
properties, and an assurance that the proposed project complies with the
City of La Palma Municipal Code and General Plan. The applicant for a
Precise Plan must submit an application form describing the manner in
which the project complies with applicable requirements. Before
submitting an application for a precise plan, the applicant or prospective
developer is strongly encouraged to attend a pre-application conference
with the Community Development Department to obtain information and
guidance in preparing plans, surveys, and any other required application
data.
Precise Plan approval requires that the following findings be made:
           The proposed use is allowed within the subject zoning district
            and complies with all applicable provisions of this
            Development Code.
           The proposed use would be consistent with the objectives,
            policies, general land uses, and programs of the general plan
            and any applicable specific plan.
           The approval of the precise plan or an amendment to precise
            plan for the proposed use is in compliance with the
            requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act
            (CEQA).
           The location, size, design, and operating characteristics of the
            proposed use would be compatible with existing land uses
            within the general area in which the proposed use is to be
            located.
           The subject site is physically suitable for the type and
            density/intensity of the use being proposed.
           The proposed project will have no adverse effect on abutting
            or adjacent properties and is compatible with those
            properties.
The conditions of approval that may be imposed on a project by the City
as part of the permitting approval process are not unique or overly
burdensome. Rather, they reflect a process employed on all projects
requiring precise plan approval in the City. They are not so rigorous as to
render infeasible projects of this type.
3.4.4.C Room Additions and Remodels 
There are three different approval procedures (A, B, & C) for residential
remodels and room additions that the City’s Community Development
                                                                             A p p e n d i x   C C‐41

                            L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                            Department processes. Procedure A is an over-the-counter approval,
                            Procedure B is a 15-day courtesy notification to adjacent neighbors, and
                            Procedure C is a public hearing before the Development Committee to
                            review and approve a Precise Plan Amendment. The timeline for a
                            Procedure C begins with staff receiving and reviewing the application and
                            will determine within 30 days if the application is complete. If deemed
                            complete, staff notices the project for public hearing before the
                            Development Committee a minimum 10 business days before the hearing
                            date. If the project is approved by the Development Committee, the
                            applicant must sign an Agreement to Conditions of Approval within 30
                            days. Within 5 days of approval, staff will record the CEQA documents
                            with the County Clerk-Recorder. The applicant can then submit to the
                            Building Division for building permit plan check and building permit
                            issuance. Plan check review typically takes seven to 10 days. The process
                            is generally as follows:
                                1. Property owner or contractor contacts the City regarding
                                    constructing a room addition. The City sends them application
                                    forms and encourages them to meet with staff to review their
                                    project when it is in the earliest design stage so that they can
                                    provide assistance with the code requirements regarding setbacks
                                    and height restrictions.
                                2. Applicant submits three sets of plans for in-house review by
                                    planning, building and public works (if necessary).
                                3. Depending on the location and details of the room addition, it
                                    proceeds in one of three ways:
                                       Single-story additions that are not readily visible from the
                                        street, meet all setbacks and code requirements, and match
                                        the existing structure in terms of roof slope, roof materials,
                                        roof design, eave dimensions, siding materials, color and
                                        general design can be approved “Over-the-Counter”
                                        (Procedure A).
                                       Single- or two-story additions that are not readily visible from
                                        the street or are a minor addition in front of the house, meet
                                        all setbacks and code requirements and match the existing
                                        structure in terms of roof slope, roof materials, roof design,
                                        eave dimensions, siding materials, color and general design
                                        can be approved over the counter if there are no objections
                                        from adjacent neighbors. Anyone who may be affected by the
                                        addition will be notified of the addition and given 15 days for
                                        comments. If no negative comments or objections are
                                        received, it is approved by Planning and moved to Building for
                                        permits (Procedure B).
                                       Additions that affect the street/front appearance of the home,
                                        or that do not meet development standards require a Precise
                                        Plan Amendment. The Development Committee takes action
                                        on these Precise Plan Amendments. The Development
                                        Committee meetings are regularly scheduled once every other
                                        month; however, the Committee meets once a month if there
                                        is a project pending. The Development Committee has the
                                        discretion to require Planning Commission approval in
                                        addition to Development Committee approval on any Precise
                                        Plan Amendment (Procedure C).

The majority of room additions fall into the first or second category, and
are processed either over the counter or immediately after building
permit plan check. Those that fall into the third category are reviewed for
completeness and then noticed for public hearing. They are typically
processed within 30 to 90 days.
Fees for room additions vary from project to project based on their size
and scope, but an applicant can anticipate paying at minimum a building
plan check fee and a building permit fee. If a bedroom is a part of the
scope of the project, then a sanitation fee applies and if the project
exceeds 500 square feet, school fees also apply.
Previously, the City’s process for approving residential projects required
every project to obtain both Development Committee and Planning
Commission review prior to approval. While a typical residential project in
the City can conclude the approval process within 30 to 60 days, this dual
process was a potential constraint to residential construction in the City.
To alleviate this constraint, in 2003 the City amended the Development
Code to streamline the approval process by allowing conforming
residential addition projects to be approved administratively if they
involve an expansion of less than one third of the existing dwelling unit’s
square footage. Thus, only major projects that involve significant
departure from City development standards go to the Development
Committee and Planning Commission. In most cases, the processing time
has been reduced to less than 30 days.
3.4.5 Fees 
A schedule of the City’s development fees is included in Table C-27. The
City’s fees are lower than in many other areas of Orange County. For
example, the total fees for a 12-unit townhome residential project are
estimated at $13,080.20 per unit. These fees were not an unreasonable
constraint on the planning of this development, nor have they
constrained or rendered infeasible any recent housing development in the
City. In addition, for fiscal year 2009-10, the City Council approved a
“Fee Holiday” resolution waiving all building, plan check, and planning
fees for improvements to existing single-family residential homes. This
fee waiver resulted in a typical savings of almost $1,650 for a 360-
square-foot room addition.
                                                                           A p p e n d i x   C C‐43

                            The only City impact fee in La Palma is a Quimby Act park-in-lieu fee.
                            Typical development fees will include fees paid to Public Works (grading
                            permits, encroachment permits etc.), sanitation fees, Building Division
                            fees (demolition permits, plan checks, mechanical, plumbing, electrical
                            permits, etc.), Orange County Fire Authority fees, and City Business
                            License fees. Development fees charged by other entities are as follows:
                                    Orange County Sanitation District - $2,998 (assumes 3-bedroom
                                     multi-family unit)
                                    School fees - $2.63 – $2.97 per square foot depending on the
                                     district
                            Planning, building and other development fees (including those required
                            by other entities) total approximately $13,000 for a typical 1,500-
                            square-foot home, which represents less than 3% of the total home value.
                            An example of actual fees incurred on a multi-family development in La
                            Palma can be drawn from the recently constructed Tapestry Walk project,
                            which was comprised of attached townhomes (three units each in four
                            buildings). Total fees for this project were approximately $6,800 per unit,
                            not including school fees, which add an additional $4,000 to $5,000 per
                            unit, or only two percent of the overall development cost.

3.4.6 Multi‐Family Precise Plan Requirements (Density 
Bonus Ordinance) 
The Precise Plan process ensures that all Multi-Family Residential
developments comply with the development standards of the Multi-
Family Residential Zone (R-3) per Chapter 26 of the City of La Palma
Municipal Code. The Precise Plan process and these development
standards may be minor constraints on affordable housing projects. For
example, the Precise Plan process has the potential to prolong the
timeline of an affordable housing project or the development standards
may impact the financial feasibility of a project by limiting the number
and sizes of housing units in a development.
To mitigate these potential constraints from the development standards
and Multi-Family Residential Precise Plan requirements, the City has
incorporated an Affordable Housing Section into the City of La Palma
Municipal Code (Chapter 26, Sections 26-59 to 26-64). This section
provides incentives for the development of affordable housing to
qualifying households and residents. The incentives include a density
bonus and other incentives, such as a reduction in development
standards. The density bonus provisions of the Affordable Housing
Section comply with the current requirements of Government Code
Section 69915. These provisions help to minimize the governmental and
financial constraints of the Multi-Family Residential Precise Plan process
to affordable housing projects.
3.4.7 Environmental Review 
Environmental review is required for all development projects under the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). An Environmental Impact
Report (EIR) is required of all developments that have the potential of
creating significant impacts that cannot be mitigated. Most infill
residential projects in La Palma are either Categorically Exempt or require
only an Initial Study and Negative Declaration. The Negative Declaration
process typically takes two to three weeks to prepare, plus the mandated
public review period. Categorically Exempt developments require a
minimal amount of time. As a result, state-mandated environmental
review does not pose a significant constraint to housing development.
3.4.8 Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing 
There is often an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a plant
rather than on site, thereby reducing costs. State law precludes local
governments from prohibiting the installation of mobile homes on
permanent foundations on single-family lots. It also declares a mobile
home park to be a permitted land use on any land planned and zoned for
residential use, and prohibits requiring the average density in a new
mobile home park to be less than that permitted by the Municipal Code.
In La Palma, manufactured housing and mobile home parks are
conditionally allowed the R-3, multiple family zone. Permanently sited
                                                                          A p p e n d i x   C C‐45

                            L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                            manufactured homes on lots zoned for single-family dwellings are
                            subject to the same rules as site-built homes, consistent with state law.
                            The City of La Palma currently has no mobile home parks.
                            3.4.9 Second Units 
                            Second units can be an important source of affordable housing for lower-
                            income persons and households. Second unit residences are reviewed
                            and approved ministerially (i.e., without a conditional use permit or other
                            discretionary action) by the Community Development Director. Plans are
                            required showing the lot dimensions, streets, utilities, drainage plan,
                            building placement, access, parking areas, roof pitch, fencing,
                            landscaping, exterior elevations, and material of all buildings. Design
                            standards are required as follows:
                                1. Maximum one story in height not exceeding 16 feet if it is
                                    detached from the primary unit.
                                2. Conforms to the height limits for the zone in which the subject
                                    residential property lies, if the second unit is attached to the
                                    primary unit.
                                3. Contains a total floor area of no more than 30% of the living area
                                    of the principal dwelling and in no case exceed 1,200 square feet.
                                4. Maintains architectural compatibility with the primary unit, which
                                    includes, but is not limited to, building proportion, architectural
                                    style, roof type, paint color, finish, details, and other qualities
                                    subject to the review and approval by the Director of Community
                                    Development.
                                5. Conforms to all setback and building separation requirements.
                                6. Conforms to all density requirements in the Code and General
                                    Plan.
                                7. Conforms to all parking requirements in the Code, which requires
                                    one parking space per secondary unit or one space per bedroom
                                    in the secondary unit, whichever is greater.
                            A second unit may be rented, but is not permitted to be sold, transferred,
                            or assigned separately from the primary residence. A second unit cannot
                            be approved by the City prior to the applicant’s submittal of evidence that
                            a deed restriction affirming this requirement has been filed with the
                            County Recorder. This deed restriction runs with the land and is
                            continuous in tenure with the life of the second unit.
                            While the City’s regulations encourage second units and are consistent
                            with state law, no applications have been received in recent years. One
                            property owner in 2012 has expressed interest in developing a second
                            unit in conjunction with a new single-family unit.
                            3.4.10 Special Needs Housing 
                            Persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities,
                            persons with disabilities, the elderly, farm workers, persons needing
                            emergency shelter or transitional living arrangements, and single room

occupancy units. The City’s provisions for these housing types are
discussed below.
3.4.10.A Residential Care Facilities 
Residential care facilities refer to any family home, group home, or
rehabilitation facility that provides non-medical care to persons in need
of personal services, protection, supervision, assistance, guidance, or
training essential for daily living. In accordance with state law, small
family care homes that serve six or fewer persons are permitted by right
in all residential districts. The Development Code explicitly permits small
family care homes within the R-1 and R-3 zones, and conditionally
permits congregate care facilities in the R-3 zone. In addition,
convalescent homes are conditionally permitted within the OP and PI
zones. These requirements are consistent with state law and do not pose
a significant constraint on the establishment of such facilities.
The Development Code requires congregate care facilities in the R-3
zone that have seven or more residents to obtain a Conditional Use
Permit (CUP) prior to operation. A CUP is necessary to properly analyze
the impact of the intensity of the use on the surrounding residential
properties. Typical conditions of approval for a large group home would
include proper building clearance from the City’s Building Official along
with conditions specified by the County of Orange Health Care Agency
and the Orange County Fire Authority. The City would also evaluate
potential noise and parking impacts and condition the project to mitigate
any adverse impacts to surrounding residential properties.
3.4.10.B Housing for Persons with Disabilities 
The City’s building code requires that new residential construction
comply with Title 24 accessibility standards. These standards include
requirements for a minimum percentage of fully accessible units in new
multi-family developments. The provision of fully accessible units may
increase the overall project development costs. However, enforcement of
accessibility requirements is not at the discretion of the City, but is
mandated under state law.
With regard to the definition of “family”, the Development Code contains
the following definition, which complies with state law.
         (1) Two of more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption
             [U.S. Bureau of the Census]. (2) An individual or a group of
             persons living together who constitute a bona fide single-
             family housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit, not including a
             fraternity, sorority, club, or other group of persons occupying
             a hotel, lodging house or institution of any kind [California].
With regard to concentration requirements, there are no restrictions
regarding separation or concentration for group homes or other facilities
for persons with disabilities.
With regard to parking standards, to facilitate the processing of requests
to reduce architectural obstacles for persons with disabilities, the City
established a process for review of requests for reasonable
                                                                             A p p e n d i x   C C‐47

                            accommodation pursuant to SB 520 of 2001, expediting requests and
                            providing information to applicants. Requested modifications to parking
                            requirements for persons with disabilities will be considered under the
                            City’s Reasonable Accommodation procedures (see Program 13 in the
                            Housing Plan).
                            3.4.10.C Farm Worker Housing 
                            The City of La Palma does not have agricultural areas and has no need for
                            permanent farm worker housing. The City’s overall efforts to provide and
                            maintain affordable housing opportunities will help to support the few
                            seasonal farm workers who may choose to reside in the City.
                            3.4.10.D Housing for the Elderly 
                            Senior group housing and senior citizen hotels are conditionally
                            permitted uses in the PI zone. In addition, multiple-family housing in the
                            R-3 zone can accommodate senior apartments or condominiums. The
                            Development Code also provides a density bonus for the construction of
                            senior housing (Section 26-60 et seq.). The Development Code is not
                            considered a constraint to the development of senior housing because
                            the regulations are the same as for other residential uses in the same
                            districts.
                            3.4.10.E Emergency Shelters and Transitional Housing 
                            Emergency shelters are facilities that provide a safe alternative to the
                            streets either in a shelter facility, or through the use of motel vouchers.
                            Emergency shelter is short-term, usually for 30 days or less. Transitional
                            housing is longer-term housing, typically up to two years. Transitional
                            housing requires that the resident participate in a structured program to
                            work toward the established goals so that they can move on to
                            permanent housing. Residents are often provided with an array of
                            supportive services to assist them in meeting goals. The Development
                            Code will be amended in 2013, prior to adoption of the Housing Element,
                            to permit emergency shelters by right (Program 9 in the Housing Plan). As
                            part of the comprehensive Development Code update, standards will also
                            be revised to clearly permit transitional and supportive housing in zones
                            allowing residential uses as a residential use of property, subject only
                            to those restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the
                            same type in the same zone. Development standards for transitional
                            and supportive housing shall be no more restrictive than for other uses
                            allowed in these districts, although conditions may be required to
                            mitigate potential impacts to nearby uses, or permit such facilities on
                            only a temporary basis.

3.4.10.F Single Room Occupancy 
Single room occupancy (SRO) facilities are small studio-type units and are
allowed in the NC, B1, GI and PI zones subject to a Conditional Use
Permit. Development standards for these uses are no more restrictive
than for other uses allowed within these zones. There are no minimum
size restrictions for SROs.
The CUP process for the development of a SRO facility would entail a staff
review and analysis of a CUP application, which would include a CEQA
review and a water quality review. The project would be noticed for
hearing before the Traffic and Safety Committee, the Development
Committee, and the Planning Commission. The time frame for a CUP
application is tied to the Permit Streamlining Act, CEQA, and Public
Hearing Notification requirements. When an application is deemed
complete, then staff would move to schedule the appropriate hearings as
quickly as possible. Typical timeframe is approximately 90 days to get to
Public Hearing before the Planning Commission after an application has
been deemed complete. Typical conditions of approval would include
construction impacts (dust, erosion control, etc), lighting, drainage,
landscaping, parking, refuse storage, utility easements and connections,
occupancy limits, on-site management and operational characteristics,
equipment screening and noise control.

                                 Opportunities  
                            4.1 Regional Growth Needs 2014‐2021 
                            In accordance with Government Code §65584, projected housing needs
                            for each city and county in the Southern California region are prepared by
                            the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) under a
                            process known as the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA).
                            SCAG’s Regional Council adopted the final Regional Housing Need
                            Allocation in October 2012. The RHNA covers the planning period of
                            January 1, 2014 to October 1, 2021.
                            The Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008 (SB
                            375) promotes good planning, with the goal of more sustainable
                            communities through integration of land use, transportation, and
                            housing planning. The law connects the Regional Transportation Plan
                            with the RHNA, both in terms of timeline and population projections. As
                            such, SCAG began the RHNA process with an update of the population,
                            employment and household forecasts for both the region as a whole and
                            for each county. These forecasts were largely derived from California
                            Department of Finance (DOF) population and employment forecasts and
                            modified by regional demographic and modeling efforts by SCAG. SCAG
                            then disaggregated the regional and county forecasts to each jurisdiction
                            (while being consistent with the 2012 RTP projections), and estimated the
                            number of dwelling units needed to achieve a regional target vacancy rate
                            (1.5% owner-occupied and 4.5% rental) and account for projected
                            housing demolitions. The total housing needed in each jurisdiction was
                            then distributed by income category (very low-, low-, moderate-, and
                            above-moderate income). In jurisdictions with higher proportions of
                            existing lower-income households (as compared to the countywide
                            average), SCAG adjusted the allocations such that the lower-income share
                            of growth need is reduced to avoid overconcentration. The final RHNA
                            allocation for La Palma is also discussed in Appendix C, Section 2 –
                            Housing Needs Assessment.
                            All new units built or preserved after January 1, 2014 are credited in the
                            2014-2021 RHNA period.
                            4.2       Inventory of Sites for Housing 
                                      Development 
                            Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements
                            to contain an “inventory of land suitable for residential development,
                            including vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment, and
                            an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services

                                  L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
to these sites.” In order to ensure that housing units in the lower- and
moderate-income categories can be accommodated during this planning
period, a proactive adequate sites implementation program is necessary.
Table C-26 shows the housing that can be accommodated on vacant and
underutilized sites. The realistic capacity and suitability of each of the
sites that could accommodate a portion of the City’s housing need is
discussed below.
4.2.1 5052 and 5062 La Palma Avenue   
These two adjacent parcels are each approximately 17,000 square feet
(0.39 acres), and each contains one single-family residence. The
residence located at 5052 La Palma Avenue was built in 1965 and is
2,474 square feet. The residence located at 5062 La Palma Avenue was
built in 1958 and is 1,350 square feet. While both properties are well
maintained and appear to be structurally sound, they front on a four-lane
arterial and are zoned for multi-family residential use. It is possible that
the two parcels could be consolidated, similar to the nearby six-unit
project recently developed at 5082 La Palma, which has similar site
circumstances. That project also involved the replacement of a single-
family unit with six units, indicating that there is market demand for this
type of infill housing. In order to encourage multiple-family development,
the City extended the Village Overlay (VO) to these parcels in 2011,
increasing the allowable density on both parcels to 30 units/acre. The
overlay allows up to 11 units on each parcel (22 units total) if the parcels
remain separate, or 23 units if they are consolidated, excluding any
potential density bonus. To be conservative, these sites are assumed to
develop at 80% of that allowable capacity, or nine units on each site.
Because the VO overlay allows multi-family development by right beyond
the default density of 20 units/acre, these sites are assigned to the
lower-income site inventory.
4.2.2 Vacant Single‐Family Parcel 
There is only one vacant parcel in the City zoned for single-family
development. If subdivided, this parcel could potentially accommodate
three single-family homes. However, access to the site would likely
inhibit such development. To be conservative, it is estimated that one
home would be developed on this vacant parcel, which is assigned to the
above-moderate-income site inventory. The property owner has
indicated the potential to seek development of a second unit on the site
as well.
4.2.3 Vacant Multi‐family Parcel (Proposed) 
This property is a 0.41-acre site; the property has been vacant for a
number of years. As part of the General Plan update, this parcel is
considered for residential use and would be designated Multiple Family
Residential and rezoned R-3. The parcel is surrounded to the south and
east by other multi-family residential uses. The rezoning would occur
concurrently with the General Plan update.
                                                                           A p p e n d i x   C C‐51

                                L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                                While this analysis demonstrates that vacant and underutilized sites have

                            development is contained in Section 2 of this Appendix, under
                            Infrastructure Constraints. There are currently no known environmental
                            or public facility service limitations that would preclude the level of
                            development described in the RHNA, although developers will be required
                            to pay fees or construct public improvements prior to or concurrent with
                            development.
                            4.3 Financial Resources 
                            4.3.1 Redevelopment Opportunities 
                            In the past, the La Palma Community Development Commission (CDC)
                            served as the Redevelopment Agency for the City. The CDC was involved
                            in maintaining, assisting, or producing over 168 affordable homes since
                            its inception. The CDC used housing set-aside funds (20 percent of tax
                            increment revenues within the 224-acre Redevelopment Project Areas) to
                            support new housing construction, housing rehabilitation, and first-time
                            homebuyer assistance throughout the City.
                            On Dec. 29, 2011, the California Supreme Court ruled to uphold ABx1 26,
                            which dissolved all redevelopment agencies (RDAs) in the State. A
                            companion bill, ABx1 27, which would have allowed the RDAs to continue
                            to exist, was also declared invalid by the court. The court’s decision
                            required that all RDAs within California be eliminated no later than
                            February 1, 2012. As such, the La Palma CDC was dissolved in 2012. The
                            City was selected to be the Successor Agency responsible for all
                            enforceable obligations owed. No additional housing set-aside funds are
                            available.
                            4.3.2 Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and 
                            HOME Funds 
                            During the previous Housing Element planning period, the City did not
                            apply for a CDBG award through the Urban County competitive process,
                            nor has it applied for and received a HOME grant award. However, the
                            City maintains a Cooperative Agreement with the County of Orange to
                            participate in the Urban County competitive process. Through Housing
                            Program 2, the City commits to seek outside funds for the preservation
                            and rehabilitation of affordable housing during the 2014-2021 planning
                            period.
                            Because the existing single-family housing stock, which comprises the
                            majority of the housing in the City, is in excellent condition, there is little
                            likelihood that redevelopment and replacement with higher density
                            multi-family housing is likely to occur within the planning period of this
                            Housing Element.
                            4.3.3 Mixed Commercial/Residential Use Opportunities 
                            Several zoning districts permit mixed-use development, subject to
                            approval of a CUP. In addition to the residential zoning districts, mixed-

                                  L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
use development is conditionally          permitted    within   the following
nonresidential districts:
           OP – Office Professional
           NC – Neighborhood Commercial
           B1 – Multi-use Business
           GI – General Industrial
           PI – Public/Institutional
Furthermore, the City is exploring updating the General Plan to introduce
new mixed-use districts, including a mixed-use district in the heart of
the City to create a town center and a mixed-use district near the 91
Freeway. If established, these new districts would permit housing above
20 units per acre.
Because mixed-use development is conditionally permitted in almost all
of the City’s current zoning districts and new areas are under
consideration to further facilitate mixed use and new housing
opportunities, there is additional potential for underutilized parcels to
transition to mixed-use affordable housing developments.
4.3.4 Second Unit Opportunities 
Government Code §65852.1 et seq. provides for implementation of state
specifications for the establishment of local ordinances governing the
establishment of a second residential dwelling unit on a single-family or
multiple family zoned lot. The City’s Second Unit Ordinance provides for
ministerial approval of second units by the Director of Community
Development. Plans for second units must comply with the site and
design standards listed in Section 26-30 of the Development Code.
Single-family homes in the City of La Palma range in size from 1,700
square feet to 3,000 square feet on 5,000 square-foot lots. Room
additions are permitted, which can decrease rear setbacks in some areas
to 10 feet. The size and configuration of the housing, including lack of
areas to provide residential parking in the City, typically renders it
infeasible to add second units on most single-family lots.
4.4 Opportunities for Energy Conservation 
Housing Elements must, by law, include an analysis of the opportunities
for energy conservation with respect to residential development. As
residential energy costs rise, the subsequent increasing utility costs
reduce the affordability of housing. Although the City is fully developed,
new infill development and rehabilitation activities could occur, allowing
the City to directly affect energy use within its jurisdiction.
The State of California Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and
Nonresidential Buildings were established in 1978 in response to a
legislative mandate to reduce California's energy consumption. The
standards are codified in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations
and are updated periodically to allow consideration and possible
incorporation of new energy efficiency technologies and methods.
                                                                             A p p e n d i x   C C‐55

                            L a   P a l m a   G e n e r a l   P l a n  
                            California's building efficiency standards (along with those for energy
                            efficient appliances) have saved billions of dollars in electricity and
                            natural gas costs since 1978.
                            Title 24 sets forth mandatory energy standards and requires the adoption
                            of an “energy budget” for all new residential buildings and additions to
                            residential buildings. Separate requirements are adopted for “low-rise”
                            residential construction (i.e., no more than 3 stories) and non-residential
                            buildings, which includes hotels, motels, and multi-family residential
                            buildings with four or more habitable stories. The standards specify
                            energy-saving design for lighting, walls, ceilings and floor installations,
                            as well as heating and cooling equipment and systems, gas cooling
                            devices, conservation standards and the use of non-depleting energy
                            sources, such as solar energy or wind power. The home building industry
                            must comply with these standards while localities are responsible for
                            enforcing the energy conservation regulations through the plan check
                            and building inspection processes.
                            In 2010, the state made modifications to Title 24 to incorporate “green”
                            building practices. The City of La Palma adopted the latest edition of the
                            California Building Codes, including the California Green Building Code.
                            The Community Development Department reviews and approves green
                            improvements such as roof-mounted solar panels over the counter,
                            subject to applicable building permits. In addition, the City housing
                            rehabilitation program (see Housing Plan, Program 2) can result in energy
                            savings through home improvements such as window and door
                            replacement, energy-efficient appliances (e.g., water heaters), and new
                            insulation/weatherization.

5. Progress Report 
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions
evaluate the effectiveness of the existing Housing Element, the
appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies, and the progress in
implementing programs for the previous planning period. This section
reviews the housing goals, policies, and programs of the previous
Housing Element (adopted in 2010), and evaluates the degree to which
these programs have been implemented during the previous planning
period January 1, 2006 through June 30, 2014. This analysis also includes
an assessment of the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies.
The findings from this evaluation have been instrumental in determining
the City’s 2014-2021 Housing Plan (Chapter IV of the General Plan).
Table C-29 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Housing
Element, along with the source of funding, program objectives,
accomplishments, and implications for future policies and actions.
Table C-30 evaluates the appropriateness of previous goals and policies,
and identifies any changes that are called for in response to the City’s
experience during the past planning period. Based on this evaluation, all
of the current Goals and Policies continue to be appropriate and have
been retained.
Table C-31 presents the City’s progress in meeting the quantified
objectives from the previous Housing Element.
Table C-32 provides a summary of residential development by income
category during the 2006-2014 RHNA period.
