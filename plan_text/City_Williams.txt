 9.1     INTRODUCTION
 The Housing Element, one of the seven State mandated elements of the General Plan that embodies
 the City’s plan for addressing the housing, was last updated on May 18, 2011 (for the 2007-14
 Planning Cycle). This cycle expired on June 30, 2014). In accordance with State Housing Law, this
 Housing Element has been updated for the 2014-19 Planning Cycle. The Element was prepared by
 the City of Williams, with assistance from the State Department of Housing and Community
 Development (HCD).
 A.      HOUSING ELEMENT CONTENT AND ORGANIZATION
 Section 9.1: Introduction addresses the need for and purpose of the Housing Element, and
 summarizes its key components and methodology.
 Section 9.2: Regulatory Framework sets forth the state and local laws that establish the
 framework for the Housing Element’s content.
 Section 9.3: Housing Needs Assessment provides a summary of current housing characteristics
 for Williams.
 Section 9.4: Constraints and Resources to Housing Production addresses governmental and
 non-governmental constraints to the development of affordable housing and identifies potential
 means for reducing these constraints. Also addresses what resources the City can draw from to
 demonstrate meeting its housing needs.
         CONSTRAINTS REVIEW INCLUDE:
         Governmental Constraints discusses government agency imposed constraints to housing
         production including land use controls, improvement standards, impact and application
         processing fees and processing time requirements, and specifically addresses governmental
         constraints to production of special needs housing.
         Non-Governmental Constraints describes potential non-government imposed constraints
         to housing production including the availability of financing, land costs, construction costs,
         environmental, infrastructure, and public facilities constraints. This section also addresses
         constraints associated with fair housing issues.
         RESOURCES INCLUDE:
         Land Resources
         Residential Land Inventory assesses the City’s residential land uses and its ability to supply
         housing for all income-level households in the community.
         Adequate Sites Requirement demonstrates the ability of the City to make available an
         adequate number of sites to facilitate and encourage a sufficient level of new housing
         production during the 2007-2014 planning period.

         Program Resources
         City Efforts to Meet Housing Needs provides a residential land inventory and evaluates
         the sites relative to the City fulfilling its share of regional housing needs as determined by the
         State of California. This section also identifies means by which housing units may be
         constructed, rehabilitated and conserved to meet the City’s housing needs.
         Housing Cost Reduction and Direct Subsidies analyzes the City’s subsidized housing
         stock that may be at risk of conversion to market rate rents.
         State and Federal Programs lists and describes the various State and federal financial
         assistance programs that are available to public and private sector affordable housing
         providers.
         Private Programs lists and describes private programs that provide financial assistance
         toward the development of affordable housing.
         Residential Energy Conservation outlines measures that the City will promote to
         encourage energy efficiency and conservation, including home weatherization.
 Section 9.5: Strategy provides an assessment of the City’s accomplishments to date with regard to
 its implementation programs adopted with the 2009-2014 Housing Element
         2009 – 2014 Regional Housing Needs Objectives discusses the housing production
         objectives of the 2009 – 2014 Housing Element.
         2007 – 2014 Accomplishments discusses the specific accomplishments in meeting the
         housing production objectives identified in the 2008 Housing Element.
         Review of Previous Element’s Program Effectiveness reviews and analyzes the
         effectiveness of specific programs identified by the 2009-2014 Housing Element to assist in
         meeting the City’s housing needs.
         Implications for 2014-19 Element summarizes adjustments made to the new element in
         response to the analysis of the effectiveness of programs identified in previous elements.
         Summary of Achievements describes the City’s commitment to the actions that are
         necessary to address the housing needs of current and future residents, as well as addressing
         energy conservation and equal housing opportunity in providing for the identified need.
         While goal and policy statements are general, the housing programs spell out the specific
         actions necessary to achieve the goal and policy objectives adopted in principle. Specific
         actions and programs identified in this document are aimed at meeting the City’s affordable
         housing needs over the 2014-2019 planning period. Specific implementing actions are
         identified for each policy (Note: the RHNP planning period is different from that of the
         Housing Element by statute).
         Goals, Objectives, Policies and Programs provides a detailed description of the
         implementing Actions for the 2014-19 planning cycle, including programs that will

Chapter 9, Housing Element                               2

          implement the City’s policies. It assigns Responsibility, Timeframe, and Funding Source for
          each of the Implementing Actions.
          Quantified Objectives provides the City’s realistic objectives of preserving and adding new
          housing to the City.
 B.       DATA AND METHODOLOGY
 To understand the context of local housing in Williams, a review and analysis of the community’s
 population characteristics and housing stock was performed. The primary data source for the 2014
 Housing Element Update is the Colusa County Housing Element Data Package (2014 Data
 Package) prepared by HCD staff. Additional data sources include the U. S. Census Bureau (2010
 Census, and 2008-2012 American Community Survey (ACS), California Department of Finance,
 California Employment Development Department, and other sources as noted in the document.
 Data from the 2007-2011 ACS and the 2008-2012 ACS are referred to as “2010” data. Due to the
 use of multiple data sources, there are slight variations in the total population and household
 numbers for 2010. However, these variations do not significantly affect the analysis and discussion
 of overall housing trends and changes.
 C.       PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
 Public participation in preparation of the Housing Element is required under Government Code
 Section 65588(c). This housing element was developed through the combined efforts of City staff,
 the City’s Planning Commission, the City Council, and the City’s consultant. Public input was
 received through workshops conducted with the Planning Commission on October 28, 2013,
 September 22, 2014 and July 25, 2016. Subsequently, public hearings were conducted by the
 Planning Commission on August 22, 2016 with the Planing Commission and September 21, 2016,
 with the City Council. Notices were both e-mailed and sent through the U. S. mail to public
 agencies as referenced in Appendix A of this document. Notices were published in the Colusa Sun
 Hearald and the Sacramento Bee. The July 25, 2016, Public Workshop and subsequent public
 hearings with the Planning Commission and City Council were also noticed in both Spanish and
 English, Spanish Interpreters were available at these meetings and flyers for these meetings were
 posted at the Post Office, Library and many businesses throughout Williams at least ten days before
 each of the meetings. In addition, organizations that represent the interests of low-income and
 special needs households, or are otherwise involved in the development of affordable housing, were
 consulted during the preparation of this element as specified above.
 To comply with Senate Bill 18, the City requested consultation opportunities to local tribes taken
 from a list derived from the Native American Heritage Commission. No Tribes indicated an
 interest in consultation.
 The draft Housing Element has been available in City Hall and was posted on the City’s website for
 review and comments. During City Council/Planning Commission meeting, public comments were
 received. However, none of these people indicated concerns regarding housing issues. At the 2016,
 Planning Commission workshop, no one from the public spoke on the Housing Element Update.
 The only written comments received during this public outreach program were from California
 Rural Legal Assistance Inc (CRLA). Responses to comments by the City were made to CRLA in he
 form of the staff report to the Planning Commission, which was also distributed to CRLA separately

 before the workshop. Details of the public participation process, including letters, notices and public
 agency information can be referenced in Appendix A of this document.
 The City will actively engage the community in the progress of the housing element implementation,
 including specifically working with developers, service providers and other community interests to
 accomplish the various implementing programs.

 9.2      REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
 A.       AUTHORITY
 Section 65302(c) of the California Government Code requires every county and city in the State to
 include a housing element as part of its adopted general plan. In stipulating the content of this
 element, Article 10. 6 of the Government Code indicates that the element shall consist of
 “identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals,
 policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement and
 development of housing.” This legislation further states that the element “shall identify adequate
 sites for housing, including rental housing, factory-built housing, and mobile homes, and shall make
 adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the
 community.”
 The 2003 State of California, Office of Planning and Research’s (OPR) General Plan Guidelines and
 the California Department of Housing and Community Development’s online resource Building
 Blocks for Effective Housing Elements was used as the guiding principles for developing this
 document.
 B.       STATE HOUSING GOALS
 According to the California Statewide Housing Plan Update, it is the goal of the State to “ensure to
 all Californians the opportunity to obtain safe, adequate housing in a suitable living environment.”
 In addition, the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) has established
 the following four primary goals:
 1.       Provision of new housing
 2.       Preservation of existing housing and neighborhoods
 3.       Reduction of housing costs
 4.       Improvement of housing conditions for special needs groups
 C.       RECENT LEGISLATION
 Recent legislation pertinent to the preparation of the housing element and housing element law
 includes the following:
         AB 1866 (Second Units)
         SB 1087 (Water and Sewer Service Priority for Affordable Housing)
         SB 2 (Local Planning and Approval for Emergency Shelters)
         AB 2348 (Land Inventory Requirements)
         AB 1233 (Provision of Adequate Sites for RHNP)
         AB 2511 (promotes the development of affordable housing
         AB 2634 (requires analysis of population and employment trends for all income levels,
          including extremely low-income households)
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                          5

        SB 812 (requires analysis of housing needs for the developmentally disabled)
        SB1087 (requires objectives, policies and standards for allocation of water and sewer services
         for affordable housing developments)
        SB 244 (requires review of disadvantaged communities within the City’s Sphere of
         Influence).
 This updated Housing Element has been prepared to respond to all of these changes in legislation
 D.      DATA AND METHODOLOGY
 To understand the context of local housing in Williams, a review and analysis of the community’s
 population characteristics and housing stock was performed. The primary data source for the 2014
 Housing Element Update is the Colusa County Housing Element Data Package (2014 Data
 Package) prepared by HCD staff. Additional data sources include the U. S. Census Bureau (2010
 Census, and 2008-2012 American Community Survey (ACS), California Department of Finance,
 California Employment Development Department, and other sources as noted in the document.
 Data from the 2007-2011 ACS and the 2008-2012 ACS are referred to as “2010” data. Due to the
 use of multiple data sources, there are slight variations in the total population and household
 numbers for 2010. However, these variations do not significantly affect the analysis and discussion
 of overall housing TRENDS AND CHANGES.
 E.      GENERAL PLAN INTERNAL CONSISTENCY
 The California Government Code requires internal consistency among the various elements of a
 general plan. Section 65300. 5 of the Government Code states that the general plan and the parts
 and elements thereof shall comprise an integrated and internally consistent and compatible
 statement of goals. These elements, which were developed to incorporate all seven mandated
 elements of a General Plan, comprising the 2010-30 Williams General Plan, including 1) Land Use,
 2) Public Safety, 3) Public Safety 4) Public Facilities, 5) Noise, 6) Open Space and Conservation, and
 7) Circulation. All these elements were found to be internally consistent with the 2014-19 Housing
 Element. In accordance with Assembly Bill 162 relating to flood protection, this housing element
 contains a number of policies and program for addressing unreasonable risks to flooding (refer to
 Section 9. 6 of this document).
 F.      REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION PLAN
 The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) established the
 Colusa County Regional Housing Need Allocation Plan (RHNP) for January 1, 2014 through June
 30, 2019, that includes Williams share. Williams RHNPs incorporates the following objectives:
        Increases the housing supply and the mix of housing types, tenure, and affordability in all
         cities and counties within the region in an equitable manner;
        Promotes infill development and socioeconomic equity, the protection of environmental and
         agricultural resources, and the encouragement of efficient development patterns; and
        Encourages an improved intra-regional relationship between jobs and housing.
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                            6

 The Housing Element details a five-year schedule of actions the community is undertaking or plans
 to undertake to achieve its housing goals and objectives, based upon the community’s RHNP, as
 given in the RHNPP. To comply with State law in addressing the jurisdiction’s RHNPP, the
 updated housing element must identify adequate sites and program actions to accommodate the
 total RHNPP for each of four (4) income categories; very-low, low, moderate, and above-moderate.
 The City’s Housing Element is required to be updated by June 30, 2014 and sent to HCD for
 determination of compliance with State law. In updating the housing element, a jurisdiction may
 count toward its RHNPP any new units permitted since the beginning of the RHNP planning
 period (July 1, 2014).
 State law recognizes that housing needs may exceed available resources and, therefore, does not
 require that the City’s quantified objectives be identical to the identified housing needs. This
 recognition of limitations is critical during this period of uncertainties in both the public and private
 sectors. Fiscal resources at all governmental levels are limited and uncertain and the private
 marketplace is currently facing a challenging economic climate. As a result, the ability of the City
 and private industry to achieve the City’s objectives, as stated in this document, may be affected.
 Therefore, it is intended that this Housing Element be reviewed annually as required by State Law in
 order to remain relevant and useful to decision makers, the private sector, and the residents of the
 City of Williams.
 California Government Code Section 65589(a)(1) states that a City is not expected to spend local
 revenue for the construction of housing, housing subsidies, or land acquisition as may be identified
 as objectives of this element. In compliance with State law, it is the City’s responsibility to:
        Provide adequate, appropriately zoned sites to meet the existing and projected housing needs
         of all economic segments of the community;
        Eliminate constraints to the private development of a supply of housing to meet the needs
         of all economic segments of the community; and
        Facilitate the actions required of the development industry in providing an adequate supply
         of housing.
 G.      STATE OF CALIFORNIA, DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY
         DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW
 The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) reviewed the draft
 document and determined that it complies with all statutory requirements of State housing element
 law.

 9.3      HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
 To adequately plan for any occurrence, change, or improvements, it is necessary to fully understand
 present conditions and the past trends that led to the current environment. The same holds true for
 housing -- a successful strategy must be preceded by an adequate assessment of the community and
 regional environment. This section discusses the components of housing need, which include the
 trends between 2000 and 2010 in Williams’ population, households, employment base and the type
 of housing units available. In several instances, countywide data is included for comparative
 analysis.
 The analysis that follows is divided into four major subsections:
         Population Characteristics examines the City of Williams in terms of individual persons and
          identifies population trends that may affect future housing needs.
         Household Characteristics explores Williams by families, households, or living groups, to see
          how past and expected household changes will affect housing needs.
         Employment denotes primary income sources and levels by occupation.
         A review of the Housing Stock discloses the housing environment in Williams as a whole
          and details availability, affordability, and condition.
 Information within these subsections is helpful to identify the programs that are needed to ensure
 that existing and future housing stock meets the shelter needs of every segment of the City’s
 population. Analysis in each of these subsections provides a database upon which decisions
 concerning programs and policies for the provision of adequate housing in the City are made.
 A.       POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
 To effectively address and identify existing and future housing needs for the City of Williams,
 population variables such as demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and trends must be
 analyzed. The resulting community profile is based on available data from the U. S. Census
 Bureau, California Department of Finance (DOF), California Department of Housing and
 Community Development, California Employment Development Department (EDD), and various
 other informational sources.
 B.       POPULATION GROWTH
 The City of Williams is one of only two incorporated cities in the County, with approximately 68%
 of the population size as the City of Colusa. The U.S. Census reported Williams’ population to be
 5,123 in 2010. In 1990, the population of Williams was 2,297, and by 2000, the population had
 increased to 3,670. From 2000 to 2010, Williams’ population increased approximately 40%,
 significantly higher than the City of Colusa, Colusa Count, and California’s increase in population
 for the same time period. From 1990 to 2000, the City’s population increased nearly 60%. Colusa
 County and California’s population increase from 1990 to 2000 was lower at 15.5% and 13.8%,
 respectively.

 Table 9.3 illustrates population estimates since 2010, and projections to 2020 for Williams and
 Colusa County. City and County populations for 2013 and 2014, as well as County population
 projections for 2015 and 2020, were estimated by the DOF. There are no 2015 population estimates
 for the City. However, the Draft Background Analysis for the 2010 update to the General Plan for
 the City of Williams contains a 2020 estimate of 7,322 for the City of Williams. By 2020, Williams is
 estimated to attain a population of 7,322, which is approximately 37% higher than in 2014.

 C.        AGE
 Housing needs in the community are determined in part by the age characteristics of its current and
 future residents. Each age group tends to have distinct lifestyle, family type and size, income levels,
 and housing preferences. As people move through each stage, their housing needs and preferences
 also change. As a result, evaluating the age characteristics of a community is important in
 determining and addressing housing needs.
 Table 9.3-3 summarizes age characteristics of Williams’ residents in 2000 and 2010. During this
 period, the number of older adults (age 45 to 64) increased by 71%, contributing to an increase in
 the median age from 26.6 to 28.3 years. Older adults are typically at the peak of their earning power
 and are more likely to be homeowners. While increasing numerically, the number of seniors (65+)
 and college age (20 to 24) residents increased at a slower rate than the City average of 40% and
 comprised smaller proportions of Williams’ population during this period. The young adult (25 to
 44) and the school age (5 to 19) groups represent the two largest population segments in Williams
 with 28.2 and 26.5%, respectively. Additionally, the preschool (ages <5) population grew
 substantially at 62% during this same period. This pattern may signify that housing opportunities in
 Williams have favored young families.
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                                9

 Though many seniors are homeowners and typically reside in single-family homes, as they grow
 older, some may prefer to trade down their larger homes for smaller dwellings and alternative
 housing types, such as assisted living facilities. To remain in their homes, some seniors may decide
 to participate in home sharing programs, while others may require assistance in maintaining their
 homes.

 D.           RACE AND ETHNICITY
 Different racial and ethnic groups often have different household characteristics, income levels, and
 cultural backgrounds, which may affect their housing needs and preferences. Studies have also
 suggested that different racial and ethnic groups differ in their attitudes toward and/or tolerance for
 “housing problems” as defined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development
 (HUD), including overcrowding and housing cost burden. According to these studies, perceptions
 regarding housing density and overcrowding tend to vary among different racial and ethnic groups,
 especially within cultures that prefer to live with extended family members, household size and
 overcrowding also tend to increase. 1
 A majority of Williams’ residents reported their race or ethnicity as White (54.4%) to the U.S.
 Census Bureau in 2010. Additionally, between 2000 and 2010, both the total number and the
 percentage of populations increased in African-American, Asian, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian, and
 Other Pacific Islander ethnic groups in the City (Table 9.3-4). Hispanic population also increased
 from 71.2% -76% of the population between 2000 and 2010. The Hispanic population is the largest
 ethnic group in Williams. Due to the larger family size characteristic of this group, a greater demand
 is expected for larger houses with more bedrooms.

 E.      EDUCATION
 The education level of a city’s population can serve as an indicator of its educational and
 employment opportunities, as well as the earning potential of its population. Data collected from
 the Census 2010-14 indicates over 50% of William’s residents graduated from high school and that
 only about 6% possessed a Bachelor’s degree. The education level is slightly lower than Colusa
 County’s overall, as shown in Table 9.3-6. Both City and County resident education levels are lower
 than that of the state overall (76.8% graduated from high school and 26.6% held a bachelor’s degree
 or higher).

 The level of educational attainment level in the City suggests a lack of professional employment
 opportunities in the City and lower earning potential. The relatively high percentage of the
 population with less than a 12th grade education likely reflects employment opportunities in the
 agricultural/agricultural-support sectors. City and County government employment opportunities in
 Colusa are reflected in the higher education levels relative to the County overall.
 F.        EMPLOYMENT CHARACTERISTICS
 One of the factors that can contribute to an increase in demand for housing is expansion of the
 employment base. The 2010 Census indicated that there were 1,966 civilians in the Williams labor
 force in 2010. Table 9.3-7 shows 2010 employment by industry for the City of Williams as
 compared to Colusa County. In Williams, the “Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, and
 Mining” industry employed the most people at 27.9%. The second largest employment industry was
 the “Educational, Health and Social Services” industry, which had 12.3% of the total employed
 persons in Williams. The County’s employment by industry is very similar to that of Williams’.

 G.        HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
 The U. S. Census Bureau defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit. This may
 include single persons living alone, families related by blood or marriage, as well as unrelated
 individuals living together. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories or other
 group living situations are enumerated separately and are not counted in household population.
 Household type and size, income level, the presence of special needs populations, and other
 household characteristics determine the type of housing needed by residents. The discussions below
 detail the various household characteristics affecting housing needs.

 H.      HOUSEHOLD TYPE
 Information collected on household type provides a good base for the analysis of a community’s
 housing needs. Tables 1-8 and 1-9 provide an overview of household characteristics. Table 9.3-9
 indicates that family households increased in the City from 80.7% in 2000 to 82.5% in 2010. While
 increasing numerically in 2010, married-couple families, non-family households, and householders
 living alone all decreased as a proportion of total Williams households compared to year 2000.
 However, total householders 65 years and over tripled from year 2000 to 2010.

 I.      HOUSEHOLD SIZE
 Trends in household size can indicate the growth pattern of a community. Average household size
 will increase if there is an influx of larger families or a rise in the local birth rate such as may be
 attributed to more children in a single-family or teenage parents living at home. Household size will
 decline where the population is aging (as is the case in Williams) or when there is an immigration of
 single residents outside childbearing age. Household size has increased more in the City than in the
 County.
 Table 9.3-11 compares household size. Williams has a larger average household size of 3.66 as
 compared to the County with an average size of 3.00. The household size has also experienced a
 reduction from 3.70 in 2000 to 3.66 in 2010.

 J.        HOUSEHOLD INCOME
 Household income level is probably the most significant factor limiting housing choice. Therefore,
 income patterns have been examined carefully to assess the extent of housing need. Certain
 population groups (elderly, female householders, farmworkers, etc.) fall disproportionately into low-
 income groups, so they have been given special attention.
 Median income is an important measure of a community’s wealth and ability to afford the rent or
 own housing. Median income is the amount that divides the income distribution into two equal
 groups: one group having incomes above the median, and the other having incomes below.
 Median family income is different from median household income. Median family income indicates
 income for those households with two or more related individuals, i.e., families, while median
 household income indicates the income of all individuals in a household, including persons living
 alone or with unrelated individuals. Median family income is, generally speaking, higher than median
 household income.
 The median income data provides a comparison of current income levels in the City of Williams,
 City of Colusa, County of Colusa, and the State of California. Other data, such as lower income,
 which is defined as 80% of the median income level, and poverty level income, add insight as they
 relate to families and households in the bottom one-half of the income distribution. Calculations
 based on these two measures are used to determine eligibility for most housing subsidy programs.
 Table 9.3-12 compares median family and median household income between Williams, the City of
 Colusa, and Colusa County. Due to employment and educational characteristics, Williams has a
 relatively low median income as compared to the State of California, Colusa County and the City of
 Colusa. Nearly 28% of Williams’ workforce is employed in the agricultural industry. In 2010,
 Williams’s median household income was 71% of the State’s and 90% of Colusa County’s. Median
 Household Income in Williams increased 35% from 2000 to 2010 to a total of $43,185. Refer to
 Table 9.3-12.

 In 2010, the majority (55%) of households in Williams earned in excess of $35,000 per year and
 approximately 44% earned in excess of $50,000 per year. The incidence of households earning less
 than $35,000 per year was far higher among renter households (74%) than owner households (24%).

 A Housing Income Survey was conducted by Rural Community Assistance Corporation (RCAC) in
 2015. The survey concluded that the City’s Median Household Income was $33,419. This is
 significantly lower than as estimated in the 2010 Census. Williams, is therefore, considered a
 severely disadvantaged community with over 50% of its households less than 60% of the State’s
 median household income.
 K.        OVERCROWDED HOUSEHOLDS
 Although there is more than one way of defining overcrowded housing units, the definition used in
 the Housing Element is 1. 01 or more persons per room, the same definition used in the 2000 and
 2010 U. S. Censuses. It should be noted that kitchenettes, strip or Pullman kitchens, bathrooms,
 porches, balconies, foyers, halls, half-rooms, utility rooms, unfinished attics, basements, or other
 space for storage are not defined as rooms for Census purposes.
 Overcrowded households are usually a reflection of the lack of affordable housing available.
 Households that cannot afford housing units suitably sized for their families are often forced to live
 in housing that is too small for their needs, which may result in poor physical condition of the
 dwelling unit.
 In 2010, 160 households (15.2%) were living in overcrowded households. The majority of these
 households, 89 in total, were living in severely overcrowded conditions with more than 1.50 persons
 per room; and a lesser amount (71) were living in less-severe, yet still overcrowded situations with
 1.01 to 1.50 persons per room. The level of overcrowding is highest among owner households
 (totaling 59), versus 78 renter households living in severely overcrowded conditions.
 Table 9.3-14 identifies overcrowded households by level of overcrowding information between
 owner and renter households. Utilizing the average number of 3.66 persons per household,
 multiplied by 160 overcrowded households, results in a total of 585.6 persons (11.4%) living in
 overcrowded conditions.

 Housing Units
 Table 9.3-15 identifies total housing units for Williams and Colusa County in 1980, 1990, 2000 and
 2010. The growth rate of housing units in Williams is greater than that in the County. Between the
 years 2000 and 2010, a total of 519 housing units were constructed within the City (an increase of
 53.6%), while the County’s percentage of housing units increased 16.3% to total 7,883 in 2010.

 by 1.1%. The County’s percentage of owner-occupied housing units also decreased 2% for the same
 time period.
 Housing Inventory
 Most of the housing units built in Williams between 1990 and 2010 were single-family detached
 units. Table 9.3-17 highlights that single-family housing units increased from 72.4% in 1990 to
 74.7% in 2010. The number of attached single-family units increased by only two net units between
 1990 and 2010.

 Residential Construction Trends
 As illustrated in Table 9.3-18, the majority (51.7%) of Williams’ housing stock was built since 1990.
 By 2020, over half of the City’s current housing stock will be over 30 years old. This indicates the
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                               18

 potential need for rehabilitation and general maintenance of these units in the near future. The
 largest decade of home building occurred from 2000 to 2009, when 35.7% of the City’s current
 housing stock was developed. Approximately 55 dwellings were constructed during the 2009-14
 period with 48 units consisting of the Stony Creek Senior apartments being built in 2014 and a few
 single-family units built.
 Vacancy
 The vacancy rate in a community indicates the percentage of units that are vacant and for rent/sale
 at any one time. This establishes a relationship between housing supply and demand. For example,
 if the demand for housing is greater than the supply, then the vacancy rate is probably low and the
 price of housing will most likely increase. According to “Raising the Roof, California Housing
 Development Projections and Constraints, 1997-2020,” the desirable vacancy rate in a community is
 considered to be 5% to provide adequate housing choice. Generally, when the vacancy rate drops
 below 5%, the demand for housing exceeds the supply of housing. Subsequently, prospective
 buyers and renters may experience an increase in housing costs.

 In 2010, Williams’ total vacancy rate was 7.9% (118 units, compared to 4.5% (44 units) in 2000. The
 amount of vacant units for sale and for rent (as percentage of total vacant units) increased sharply
 from 2000 to 2010. Since the vacancy rate is well over 5%, there are increased housing choices for
 prospective renters and buyers in Williams.
 M.        EXISTING HOUSING CONDITIONS
 Housing Condition Survey
 A housing condition survey was conducted for the City July 2010 by Community Development
 Services (CDS). By utilizing a windshield survey tool, developed by the federal Department of
 Housing and Urban Development (HUD), CDS surveyors were able to assess the housing condition
 of the community. This rating tool assesses the condition of housing based on the condition of the
 foundation, roofing, siding, electrical, windows and door systems. Each building system receives a
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                         19

 numerical value, based on the assessment criteria and the total number of points determines whether
 the unit is in a standard (sound) or substandard condition.
 Housing Quality
 Housing quality is measured by accepted standards of health and safety concerns and issues.
 Deteriorating conditions -left unchecked- allow for the possibility of physical harm to residents and
 guests. It is important that the City be aware of deferred maintenance conditions for the protection
 of all, and when cross referenced with income data, such information can help determine potential
 resources to address the problems.
 Survey Criteria
 The condition of the City’s substandard housing units was further broken down into the following
 categories:
         Minor: Housing units rated as “minor” may be structurally sound but show signs of
          deferred maintenance or upkeep. The dwelling may need minor repair or maintenance of its
          roof, siding, windows and/or doors.
         Moderate: A “moderate” unit requires the repair or replacement of more than one of the
          rated systems. This category varies widely, from a unit needing the roof replaced and new
          siding to one that needs the replacement of the roof, windows and doors.
         Substantial: “Substantial” rehabilitation of a unit involves the replacement of several major
          systems, such as a complete replacement of the roof, foundation, siding, windows and doors.
         Dilapidated: If a unit is in such a state of major disrepair that all building components
          need to be completely replaced or the building needs to be razed it is considered to be
          “dilapidated.”

 Based upon the above categories, surveyors found that: 46% (164 housing units) were in need of
 minor rehabilitation; 38% (137 housing units) were in need of moderate rehabilitation; 13% (46
 units) were in need of substantial rehabilitation and 3% (10 units) were dilapidated and not suitable
 for rehabilitation (Table 9.3-20).

 The amount of substandard housing can be attributed to a number of factors, primary the age of the
 City’s housing stock. Table 9.3-18 indicates that approximately 30% of the homes in Williams were
 built prior to 1960. Generally, housing conditions have improved on average due to the significant
 numbers of new units constructed between 2005 and 2008. By 2010 only 48.3% of the City’s
 housing stock was built prior to 1990. These units are over 20 years old.
 Housing Costs
 Several types of data are available are used to assess the costs and availability of housing. They
 include median housing value, mortgage/gross rental cost, and mortgage/rental cost in terms of
 available income. Other types of data include costs of housing production (including land and
 materials, development costs, City fees, etc.), housing sale prices for new and existing homes, the
 cost of financing, and financing options. Williams’ housing production and acquisition costs are
 discussed Chapter 3 - Constraints.
 Housing Value
 Value is defined as the Census respondents” estimate of the amount for which property, including
 house and lot, would sell if it were on the market at the time of the survey. For several years, sub-
 prime loans have caused a decline in the residential real-estate market. The resulting foreclosures
 and short sales have increased available hosing inventory and led to a decrease in housing prices.
 For-Sale Housing Market
 Based on a market report from the 2013 Multiple Listing Service (MLS), the median value of homes
 sold in 2013 was $110,000. Of the 16 homes that sold that year, the least expensive was $52,300 and
 the most expensive was $159,900. Approximately 50 homes were on the MLS in Williams with a
 median listing value of about $117,000. Home values have remained relatively flat since 2000, where
 the 2000 Census reported that the average home price in Williams was about $96,000.
 Rental Housing Costs
 Gross rent is defined as the summation of rent, plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities
 and fuels, if these items are paid for by the renter.

                           Source(s): 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census
 As illustrated in Table 9.3-21, median gross rent in Williams in 2000 was $559 and increased to $857
 in 2010, (up 53%). During the same period, median gross rent in Colusa County increased from
 $494 to $830, (up 68%).
 Table 9.3-21 reflects increasing gross rental housing costs in Williams from 2000 to 2010. In 2000,
 71.5% of rental homes were available for between $300 and $749 per month in gross rent. This

 median market rate noted in the 2010 Census is generally consistent with a market rent study
 conducted for 2013. This study, reviewed market rentals from property management companies
 that provided a sample of 57 units (26 houses and 31 apartments) with a median monthly rent of
 $842 for apartments. Of course this does not take into account a number of publically assisted units
 on the market which generally rent for less than open market units.

 Housing Affordability
 Housing affordability, for the purpose of housing element analysis, is a function of two primary
 factors:
 1.       The proportion of total income a household is able to reasonably be expected to expend on
          housing costs and still meet other essential needs (e.g., the “overpayment” threshold); and
 2.       The cost of available housing, in the form of mortgage payments and taxes for owner
          occupants or monthly rent.
 Since the determination of housing need often is discussed in terms of household income categories,
 it is important to define the categories used in this Housing element at the outset. HUD has
 established household income categories (very low, low, moderate and above moderate), based on a
 household’s earnings relative to the County’s median household income, as defined below:
         Very-low income:         50% of median County income or below (this category includes
          extremely-low income)
         Low-income: 51% to 80% of median County income
         Moderate-income: 81% to 120% of median County income
         Above-moderate-income: more than 120% of median County income
          Note: Although not included among the income categories as part of the RHNP Plan, the
          Housing Element addresses the needs of “extremely low-income” households (those earning
          30% or less of the County median-income) in other sections of this element.
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                                22

 For over a decade, the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has used the
 30%-of-gross-income figure to determine the affordable rent or housing cost for Section 8 and
 other direct assistance programs for very low-income households. The 30% figure also is thought to
 be the most reasonable figure for the low-income group (up to 80% of median income) that rents,
 rather than owns, their homes. In recent years, the Legislature has indicated some recognition that a
 higher percentage is realistic for at least the moderate-income group, as well as those households in
 the low-income group that can manage to qualify for home ownership.
 Affordability, as defined in Section 50052. 5 of the State Health and Safety Code allows a higher-
 than-30% level (generally set at 35%) for owner-occupied housing, in recognition of the willingness
 of homeowners to sacrifice other disposable income for the benefits of home ownership. This
 criterion applies only to the upper third of the low-income households that earn 70% or more of the
 median-income and to owner-occupants.
 This analysis considers the affordability level for all very low-income and low-income households as
 30% of gross income. The affordability level for moderate- and above-moderate-income
 households was assumed to be 35% of gross income.
  The determination of housing affordability within each defined income category is based on a
 household’s annual income and the number of persons in that household. Table 9.3-23 provides the
 annual income limits for each income category for households of various sizes. Affordability of
 housing for each income category is typically based on income limits for a four-person household.
 (Note: These income levels have been established by the State Department of Housing and
 Community Development (HCD) as limits for qualification for certain state programs and do not
 reflect household incomes within the City of Williams)

 Table 9.3-33, below, provides examples of typical wages in Colusa County for several common
 occupations. These occupations are representative of jobs available in the City of Williams. It
 should be noted that mean annual earnings for each occupation are based on full-time employment
 and do not reflect what a part-time worker, such as those employed in the retail, restaurant, and fast
 food industries, would earn annually. Wage data is provided to assist in a comparison of a

 Affordability
 Table 9.3-24 identifies the maximum monthly housing costs affordable to households in Williams by
 income group. Affordability is based on a household paying up to 30% of their monthly income
 toward housing. Compared to the rental rates in Table 9.3-22, the median rents in Williams are not
 affordable to extremely-low and most of the very-low income households, but are affordable to
 most low-income households. Based on the 2013 Rental Market Study conducted over 90% of the
 apartment units surveyed in Williams were affordable to very low income households (refer to
 Exhibit B). This does not include a number of publically assisted housing in the City, of which are
 reserved for Very Low and Extremely Low Income families. Moderate and above-moderate income
 households can generally afford the median rent and sales prices.

 Table 9.3-25 shows the maximum rents and sales prices, respectively, that are affordable to very-low,
 low, moderate, and above-moderate income households. Affordability is based on a household
 spending 30% or less of the total household income for shelter. Affordability is also based on the
 maximum household income levels established by HCD (Table 9.3-23). The annual income limits
 established by HCD are based on those used by HUD for administering the Section 8 program.
 Maximum affordable sales price is based on the following assumptions: 5% interest rate, 30-year
 fixed-rate loan, 10% down-payment for extremely-low-, very-low-, and low-income households (plus
 mortgage insurance), 20% down-payment for moderate- and above-moderate-income households, 1.
 125% property tax and assessments, and 0. 2% homeowners insurance.

 In order to provide an idea of affordable housing costs by income group, affordable home sales
 prices are estimated for one- and two-person households, and also for four-and six-person
 households (see         Table 9.3-27). Williams’ median home sales price of $110,000 is within reach of
 very-low, low- and moderate-income families

 Lower Income Households
 A Housing Income Survey was conducted by Rural Community Assistance Corporation (RCAC) in
 2015. The survey concluded that the City’s Median Household Income was $33,419. This is
 significantly lower than as estimated in the 2010 Census. Williams, is therefore, considered a
 severely disadvantaged community with over 50% of its households less than 60% of the State’s
 median household income.
 According to 2013 HCD housing data in Table 9.3-27, the amount of owner-occupied, lower
 income households was 224 (30.2%) of 741 total owner-occupied households, up from 20.7% in the
 year 2000. Renter-occupied lower income households accounted for 451 (82.6%) of 546 total
 renter-occupied households, up from 16.8% in 2000. A low percentage of owner-occupied housing
 units, low median household income, low education attainment, and a high unemployment rate,
 when compared to State averages, the County, and comparable communities, indicates the
 continued limited financial capacity of Williams’ households to afford housing. In all, 52% of the
 City’s households are in lower income category.
 Overpayment
 HCD housing data provides further insight to affordability when reviewing the number of
 households identified as paying more than 30% of their monthly income for shelter cost. This
 condition is referred to as “overpayment,” which compares the total housing cost for a household to
 the ability of that household to pay. Shelter cost is defined as the monthly owner costs (mortgages,
 deed of trust, contracts to purchase or similar debts on the property and taxes, insurance on the
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                                   25

 property, and utilities) or the gross rent (contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of
 utilities).
 According to the HUD 2006-2010 data, 61.4% of renters and 71.8% of owners are paying over 30%
 of their income on housing. Lower-income households have much higher overpayment rates than
 moderate- and above-moderate-income households. Collectively, low-income households, those
 earning between 50% and 80 % of the area median income (AMI), currently overpay at the highest
 rate, 74%. Of the extremely-low-income group, owner-occupied households have the highest rate
 of overpayment, with 66% paying more than 30% of their income for housing. Table 9.3-27
 identifies overpayment by income group and by tenure, illustrating that households in the lower
 income categories are those that overpay the most.

 Wages and Affordability
 Table 9.3-28 demonstrates affordability issues, based upon average earnings levels for selected
 occupations in Colusa County, in conjunction with Williams’ median housing costs for owners
 ($159,200) and for renters ($857/month). Within this table, housing affordability (30% of monthly
 wages) is determined for each occupation and applied towards the respective median gross rent of
 $857 and towards the cost of a median-priced home mortgage of $159,200 at $1,043 per month.
 As referenced in the 2013 housing rental and sales market surveys, however, housing costs are
 actually shown to be reduced compared to the 2010 Census information, which shows that the
 median value house sold in 2013 to be $110,000 and median market rent to be $842/month.
 For the Colusa County representative occupations less than half appear able to afford gross rental
 housing costs, and even fewer could afford to mortgage a median-priced home. Income from other
 household members could increase affordability they could qualify. Median home mortgages
 assumptions below are based on minimum parameters of the USDA home loan program.

 N.        SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
 Household groups with special needs include seniors, developmentally and physically disabled
 persons, large-family households, female-headed households, agricultural workers, and homeless
 persons. Households with special housing needs often have greater difficulty in finding decent and
 affordable housing. As a result, these households may experience a higher prevalence of overpaying,
 overcrowding, and other housing problems. Special housing needs are projected through 2019.
 Homeless
 The federal definition of a homeless person per the McKinney Act is cited as follows:
           “A person is considered homeless when the person or family (a) lacks a fixed, regular, nighttime
           residence, or (b) has a primary nighttime residence that is a supervised, publicly-operated shelter
           designated for providing temporary living accommodations, or (c) is residing in a public or private
           place not designated for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.”
 According to the Chief of Police and county-wide homeless advocacy representatives, there is no
 identifiable homeless population in Williams other than the occasional person walking or hitchhiking
 through town. Despite the unapparent homeless population currently, 2010-2015 Housing Element
 Policy 9 was created to encourage housing opportunities for the homeless. And in accordance with
 State Senate Bill 2, and Housing Element Policy Action Program 9.1, the City amended the Zoning
 Code to (Section 17.01.030. 4 to unconditionally allow homeless shelter uses on properties zoned

 Business Park (BP) District. Though there appears to be no homeless population, some extremely-
 low-income households are most at risk of becoming homeless.
 Extremely-Low Income Households
 Based on 2013 HCD Housing Element Data, approximately 464 households (36.1%) in Williams
 pay over 30% of their income for housing (see Table 9.3-30). Extremely-low- and very-low-income
 households paying over 30% of their income for housing comprise 26.7% of all households in
 Williams. Renters (25.2%) paying over 30% of their income for housing outnumber owners (10.9%
 paying the same) by nearly two-and-a-half times.

 Extremely-low-income households and very-low-income households (particularly renters)
 experience the highest incidences of overpayment for housing and are most at risk of becoming
 homeless or temporarily homeless.             These households can also consist of families of
 farmworkers/farm laborers.
 Loss of a job, dissolution of a marriage or long-term relationship, onset of or increase of the severity
 of a disability, an increase in rental rates or other housing costs are all potential causes of a person
 becoming homeless. Households that would be most susceptible to these conditions are households
 that are experiencing severe cost burdens. Households with extremely low-income have a variety of
 housing situations and needs, and often receive public assistance, such as SSI or disability insurance.
 Seniors
 Seniors are considered persons aged 65 or older in this housing element. Seniors have special
 housing needs primarily resulting from physical disabilities and limitations, fixed or limited income,
 and health care costs. Additionally, senior households also have other needs to preserve their
 independence including supportive services to maintain their health and safety, in-home support
 services to perform activities of daily living, conservators to assist with personal care and financial
 affairs, public administration assistance to manage and resolve estate issues and networks of care to
 provide a wide variety of services and daily assistance.

 As illustrated in Table 9.3-30, approximately 427 persons in Williams (8.3%) were 65 years and older
 in 2010. There were 223 aged 65 to 74 (4.3%), 125 were aged 75 to 84 (2.4%), and 79 were aged 85
 or older (1.5%).
 From 2000 to 2010, all three senior age groups increased as a percentage of the Williams population.
 The 65 to 74 age group increased by 48.7%; the 75 to 84 age group increased by 2.5%; and the 85
 years and older age group increased by 17.7%. The overall senior population increased by 26%
 from 2000 to 2010; this rate of increase is less than that of the overall population, which increased
 by 39.6%.

 Table 9.3-31 summarizes senior households in Williams by age and tenure. In 2010, there were 141
 owner-occupied senior households age 65 and older (74.6% of all age 65-and-older households).
 Additionally, there were 48 renter-occupied senior households 65 years and over (25.4% of all age
 65-and-over households) in 2010.
 Seniors tend to prefer affordable units in smaller single-story structures, located in close proximity to
 health facilities, transportation, entertainment, and other services. Pinewood Manor Apartments has
 served Williams’ seniors and the disabled exclusively for several years with 25 affordable, 1-bedroom
 units. Country Manor Guest Home is also located in William as a 15-bed, long-term residential care
 facility for the elderly. Stony Creek is Williams’ newest senior apartment complex, constructed in
 2014, with 47 affordable units.
 Large Households
 Large Households are defined as those households containing five or more persons. Income is a
 major factor that constrains the ability of households to obtain adequate housing. Larger units are
 more expensive and most units with over three bedrooms are typically single-family homes, instead
 of multi-family rental units. Large family households are considered a special needs group because
 there is limited supply of adequately-sized housing to accommodate their needs. Table 9.3-33

 Between 2000 and 2010, the total number and percentage of large households in Williams increased
 by only 0.5%. In 2000, there were 287 (31.1%) large households in Williams and by 2010, the
 number increased to 433 (31. 6%). Large households comprised approximately 30.8% of all owner-
 occupied households and approximately 32.9% of all renter-occupied households in 2010.
 The more persons in a household, the more bedrooms are needed to accommodate that household.
 Specifically, a five-person household would require three or four bedrooms, a six-person household
 would require four bedrooms, and a seven-person household would require four to six bedrooms.
 Table 9.3-34 indicates the number of housing units by bedrooms. Three-bedroom homes (45.5% of
 all homes) are by far the most common in Williams, followed by two bedroom homes comprising
 26. 4% of the total.

  Since 2000, the number of four-bedroom dwellings increased from 45 to 214 in 2010 in Williams.
 This appears to have had a direct effect upon overcrowded housing conditions, as the total number
 of overcrowded households in Williams decreased by about half, from 323 in 2000 to 160 in 2010
 (Table 9.3-34).
 Based on the housing market study for the Green Valley Homes Project in 2013, there is an
 increasing need to provide larger-household units, particularly for the renter market, which has a
 larger number of four and five plus person households in the area. Single-parent households are
 households with children under the age of 18 at home and include both male and female headed
 households. These households generally have a higher ratio between their income and their living
 expenses (that is, living expenses take up a larger share of income than is generally the case in two-
 parent households). Therefore, finding affordable, decent, and safe housing is often more difficult
 for single-parent and female-headed households. Additionally, single-parent and female-headed
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                               30
 households have special needs involving access to daycare or childcare, healthcare and other
 supportive services. While the majority of households in the City of Williams are either married-
 couple or single-person households. To respond to the need for larger bedroom units in rental
 projects, the City's Zoning Code was amended in 2012 to require that at least one unit in a mutiple
 family housing project in the RU-HD Zone have three bedrooms. However, there appears to be a
 greater need for these housing projects to contain more bedrooms. Action Program 2.4 has been
 added for the City to consider adding provisions to the Zoning Code to require units with larger
 than three bedrom units for larger apartment projects.

 Table 9.3-35 identifies a total of 243 female-headed households (23% of all households) as well as 31
 male-headed households (3% of all households) in Williams. All but nine of the female-headed
 households included children under 18 years old.
 Male-headed households with children under 18 comprised 1.3% of all households in Williams;
 while another 1.8% of Male-Headed Households. Although the housing needs of female-headed
 households are usually greater than those of male-headed households, it is important to recognize
 the housing needs of both groups because male-headed households also have only one income. A
 larger percentage of female-headed households have children and females typically have lower
 incomes than males. The large number of single-parent households in the City- indicates a need for
 more daycare facilities.
 Disabled Persons
 A disability includes, but is not limited to, any physical or mental disability as defined in California
 Government Code section 12926. A mental disability involves having any mental or psychological
 disorder or condition, such as a mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental
 illness, or specific learning disabilities that limits a major life activity. A physical disability involves
 having any physiological disease, disorder, condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss that
 affects body systems including neurological, immunological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs,
 respiratory, speech organs, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and
 lymphatic, skin and endocrine. In addition, a mental or physical disability limits a major life activity
 by making the achievement of major life activities difficult including physical, mental, and social
 activities and working.
 Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities could prevent a person from working, restrict a
 person’s mobility or make caring for oneself difficult. Therefore, disabled persons often require
 special housing needs related to potential limited-earning capacity, the lack of accessible and
 affordable housing, and higher health costs associated with disabilities. Additionally, people with
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                             31

 disabilities require a wide range of different housing, depending on the type and severity of their
 disability. Housing needs can range from institutional care facilities to facilities that support partial
 or full independence (i.e., group care homes). Supportive services such as daily living skills and
 employment assistance need to be integrated into the housing situation. The disabled person with a
 mobility limitation requires housing that is physically accessible. Examples of accessibility in
 housing include widened doorways and hallways, ramps, bathroom modifications (i.e., lowered
 counter tops, grab bars, adjustable shower heads, etc.) and special sensory devices including smoke
 alarms and flashing lights space.
 The 2013 ACS recognizes six types of disabilities including hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory,
 self-care, and independent living. A disability is further defined as a mental, physical, or health
 condition that lasts over six months and persons may have more than one disability. According to
 the 2013 ACS, there were 441 disabilities in the population of Williams. However, this is not to say
 that there were 441 disabled persons in the City, but rather 441 disabilities.

  As illustrated in Table 9.3-36 the 2013 ACS reports that of the 441 disabilities in Williams, well over
 half (279) were ambulatory disabilities. Ambulatory disabilities were most pronounced amongst
 those aged 5 to 64, with 185 affecting 3.6% of the total population Williams. In all, approximately
 5.5% of the total population of Williams had some form or type of disability that may impede their
 ability to earn an adequate income or find suitable housing accommodations to meet their special
 needs. Approximately 2.7% of the total Williams population is comprised of persons over 64 years
 old living with at least one disability. Therefore, many in this group may be in need of housing
 assistance.

  Persons with a Developmental Disability
  Disability categories include persons with developmental disabilities. “Developmental disability”
 means a disability that originates before an individual attains age eighteen years, continues, or can be
 expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. This
 term includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and disabling conditions found to
 be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals
 with mental retardation, does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in
 nature.
 While the U.S. Census reports on mental disabilities, which include developmental disabilities, the
 Census does not identify the subpopulation that has a developmental disability. The California
 Department of Developmental Services (DDS) maintains data regarding people with developmental
 disabilities, defined as those with severe life-long disabilities attributable to metal and/or physical
 impairments. The DDS data indicates that approximately 24 developmentally disabled persons
 reside in Williams, as shown in Table 9.3-37. Of these persons, only three are living independently,
 while 18 live with a parent or guardian.
 Farm Worker Housing
 The housing needs of permanent farm workers are no different from those of other employment
 groups. Such needs consist of housing that is affordable in relation to income, that meets acceptable
 housing standards, and that is reasonably accessible to the site of employment. Seasonal or part-
 time farm workers who do not leave the area, and seek year-round residency in the area, have similar
 needs; but their income is likely to be considerably less than year-round employees, and these
 individuals may require subsidized housing or employer-based housing. Seasonal migrant workers
 typically have even less income available for housing because of their need to minimize expenses to
 meet off-season needs. As a result, migrant farm workers may seek housing in a labor camp or may
 rent an available and inexpensive unit (which may be shared among several workers). If such
 housing is not available, migrant farm workers may resort to substandard shelters—ranging from
 vehicles to tents or other forms of temporary shelter. Because migrant farm workers desire to reside
 near the work sites, most farm worker housing should be provided in these unincorporated areas;
 farm workers with reliable transportation could reside within the City limits.
 As noted in Table 9.3-7, the largest employment sector in Williams is Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing
 and Hunting and Mining, which employ approximately 28% of the labor force. As noted in the
 2015 housing market study for the Green Valley Homes Farmworker Housing Project, there is a
 strong demand for farmworker housing in Williams. This study indicates that there is a need of over
 350 rental units requiring rental subsidies, most of which are farmworkers with their families.
 Agricultural Workers
 There is a significant amount of crop production in Colusa County. The 2008 Crop Report
 prepared by the Colusa County Department of Agriculture indicated that the 2008 total value of
 produced crops was $662,640,000, compared to $351,278,000 in 1999. These figures reflect some
 inflation in the unit value of crops over the past 10 years. While the number of farm workers has
 declined since 1992, farm workers and their families represent a significant portion of the county
 population.
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                          33

 The 2015 housing market study conducted for the Green Valley Farmworkers Housing Project in
 Williams, referenced an enumeration study indicating that there were 24,792 migrant and seasonal
 farm workers in Colusa County in 2000. This equates to about 15% of California’s Farm Labor
 Force (Refer to Exhibit D).
 There were 548 workers reported in the “Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, and Mining”
 industry group, according to the 2010 Census (Table 9.3-7). Many of these are assumed to be farm
 workers. This represents 27.9% of the City’s overall civilian labor force of 1,966 persons. Table 9.3-
 38 presents the estimated number of seasonal and permanent farm workers employed in the County
 as reported by the Census of Agriculture, there were 1,839 seasonal and 1,219 permanent workers
 employed on farms in Colusa County.

                       Census of Agriculture
 While the number of farm workers has declined since 1992, farm workers and their families still
 represent a significant portion of the County's population.
 It is noted that approximately 60 percent of Colusa County's farm labor housing is located in
 Williams. With the completion of the Green Valley project, a 40 unit farmworker housing project in
 2016, this will increase to over 65 percent.
 As with other special needs housing, such as homelessness, the City addresses this need relating to
 Extremely Low Income housing needs, consistent with the Colusa County Housing Needs
 Assessment.
 The City recognizes the need to address farmworker housing needs, but finds that Colusa County
 and the City of Colusa, also has a responsibility to provide their fair share of this type of housing for
 the area.
 Disadvantaged, Unincorporated Communities
  Senate Bill 244, signed into law on October 7, 2011, requires that the General Plan identify and
 address needs of disadvantaged communities located within the City’s Sphere of Influence, “fringe
 areas” outside the City’s jurisdictional boundaries (unincorporated areas). Under Local Agency
 Formation Commission (LAFCO) Cortese-Knox-Hertz Code Section 56033.5, a disadvantaged
 community is defined to mean inhabited territory (12 or more registered voters), or as determined by
 LAFCO policy, that constitutes all or a portion of a “disadvantaged community,” which is defined in
 the Water Code (§79505.5) to be “a community with an annual median household income (MHI)
 that is less than 80% of the statewide annual median household income.” In consultation with
 Colusa County LAFCO, the City was unable to find any disadvantaged communities that complied
 with LAFCO’s definition of a Disadvantaged Unincorporated Community within the
 unincorporated areas of its Sphere of Influence. Therefore, the City is not required to further

 9.4      CONSTRAINTS TO AND RESOURCES FOR HOUSING
          PRODUCTION
 This first part of this section discusses constraints to housing conservation and production.
 The section part discusses what resources are available to help conserve and produce more housing
 in Williams.
 Small and large home building organizations alike face a variety of constraints, in terms of costs and
 timing, in their attempt to construct new housing. Ultimately, these constraints limit the number
 and increase the cost of housing units which are constructed. Although constraints to residential
 development in Williams may be classified generally as governmental and non-governmental, there is
 often a strong interrelationship between these factors. And while many factors limiting housing
 production are market driven, jurisdictions have some control in instituting policies and programs to
 address the constraints or limiting factors. The City’s Housing Program includes policies and
 actions designed to reduce or overcome constraints for the development of housing for all income
 levels. In addition, this section will address what resources the City has to help in the production of
 this housing. A Capacity Analysis is included here that presents the amount of vacant residentially
 zoned land is available in Williams to demonstrate the City’s ability to comply with the Regional
 Housing Needs Allocation.
 A.       GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
 Governmental constraints, such as costs and processing time, consist of potential and actual policies,
 standards, requirements, fees, and/or actions imposed by the various levels of government on
 development, which serve to ensure public safety and welfare with respect to housing construction
 and land-use issues. Federal and state agencies, along with their respective regulations also play a
 role in the imposition of governmental constraints. As is the case, they are beyond the influence of
 local government, and therefore cannot be effectively addressed in this document. The
 governmental controls unique to Williams that affect housing development are discussed further
 below.
 Land-Use Controls
 The Land Use Element sets forth City policies for guiding local land-use development. These
 policies, together with existing zoning regulations, establish the amount and distribution of land
 allocated for different uses. Table 9.4-1 shows the General Plan land-use districts in Williams that
 permit residential uses.

 Residential Development Standards
 Generally, residential development standards can limit the number of units that may be constructed
 on a particular piece of property. These include density, minimum lot and unit sizes, height, and
 open space requirements. By limiting the number of units that could be constructed, the per unit
 land costs would necessarily be higher and, all other factors being equal, result in higher
 development costs that could impact housing affordability.
 The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily through
 the Zoning Ordinance. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health, safety,
 and general welfare of residents as well as to implement the policies of the General Plan. The
 Zoning Ordinance also serves to preserve the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods by
 ensuring that the land uses in the community are properly situated in relation to one another,
 providing adequate space for each type of development. The Ordinance sets forth specific
 residential development standards, as summarized in Table 9.4-2, for each of the following
 residential districts as contained within:
          Agricultural/Rural (AR)
          Estate Residential (E)
          Suburban Residential (R-S)
          Urban Residential (R-U)
          Urban Residential High Density (R-U-HD)
          Neighborhood Conservation (NC-xx)

  The Subdivision Ordinance governs the process of converting vacant land into building sites. It
  allows the City to control the design of new subdivisions so that its pattern of streets, lots, public
  utilities, etc. will be safe, pleasant and economical to maintain. Overly restrictive standards can
  result in greater land development costs and/or lack of development interest. However, well
  designed subdivisions can cost less to maintain and result in reduced living costs. The Subdivision
  Ordinance requires on- and off-site improvements that do not create any undue obstacles or
  constraints in the provision of any housing type. Rather, the required improvements ensure the
  provision of adequate utilities, efficient access for public safety services, and the ability to maintain
  quality, livable neighborhoods and communities. Also, design standards and guidelines in the new
  Zoning Code and Design Review Manual improve efficiencies and reduced living costs. For
  example, new multi-modal and connectivity provisions, in the City’s Design Guidelines, which
  provide for walking and bicycle trails and access from residential to employment centers, allow
  residents an alternative to automobile transportation.
  General Plan and Zoning Code
  Comprehensive updates were completed to the General Plan and Zoning Code in 2012. This has
  transformed the City’s development policies and programs to less rigid development requirements.
  It includes a number of policies/actions and code provisions that provide illustrations, graphic and
  text that describe expected development characteristics. New development that is designed
  according to these new standards can be approved through a facilitated non-discretionary staff
  review process. This program also reduces future general plan and zoning amendments by creating
  greater land use flexibility and creates greater opportunities for the production of higher density and
  more affordable housing. The new Zoning Code accomplishes the following:
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                                   40

        Streamlines the development review process in that it no longer requires discretionary use
         permits for any residential uses, including multi-family uses. Some uses may be designated
         “limited” uses, which are uses by right. The “limited designation indicates that there are use
         standards that apply, but these standards are not discretionary, and are approved at staff
         level.
        Eliminates the need for a lengthy, discretionary planned development district rezoning
         process to allow greater densities by right. The structure of the new districts include "by-
         right density bonus incentives" without the requirement of additional review processes.
        The current design review process is replaced with a much more streamlined staff level
         review of performance standards as they relate to project design.
        The discretionary language in the current ordinance is replaced by development standards
         that facilitate the review process in a more objective and user-friendly, straight-forward
         manner.
        Incorporates provisions for uses that are expressly addressed in the state statutes, including
         those for transitional housing, emergency shelters, farmworker housing/employee housing,
         senior housing, foster care homes and group homes.
        Reduces parking requirements to allow greater residential densities.
 The new Code enhances affordable housing development opportunities. Existing residential
 neighborhoods are now designated Neighborhood Conservation Zoning District which considers
 Homes to be “conforming” and thus facilitates infill and repair, maintenance, and expansion of
 existing development. New residential development within vacant areas are zoned Estate,
 Suburban, or Urban Residential. Estate Residential and permits single-family homes and cottages,
 including cluster development of such uses. The Suburban Residential Zoned areas allow
 development of single-family, patio homes and duplexes, including cluster developments and mixes
 of such uses. Urban Residential Zoned areas allow all residential uses in the Suburban category, but
 will also include multiplexes and multi-family development. The new mixed use district,
 Commercial Downtown, permits multi-family uses that are mixed with commercial uses.
 Parking Requirements
 The City requires two off-street parking spaces per single-family unit. For multi-family the
 requirement is 1 space per studio or 1-bedroom dwelling unit 1.2 spaces per bedroom for 2+
 bedroom dwelling unit. An additional parking space is required over what is provided for a
 secondary dwelling unit. This is not considered an excessive requirement nor a significant
 impediment to housing development.
 B.      DEVELOPMENT REVIEW AND PERMIT PROCESSING
 Development review and permit processing are necessary steps to ensure that residential
 construction proceeds in an orderly manner. However, the time and cost of permit processing and
 review can be a constraint to housing development if these constraints place an undue burden on
 the developer.
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                         41

 The permitting and review process for residential projects can include conceptual development
 review and is required to include preliminary and final development review. This process provides
 the opportunity for review and correction of the application by the staff, and other governmental
 agencies. The time necessary to complete the review process is generally dependent on several
 factors including the complexity of the project being proposed, the various land use applications
 required, the timing related to the environmental review process to name a few. Table 9.4-4 outlines
 housing types allowed by zone either by right, which is a permitted use (Under the City’s Zoning
 Ordinance Permitted Uses are not discretionary permits and they are approved administratively by
 staff). This non-discretionary review, for example, is applied to limited to determining compliance
 with parking, setbacks, coverage, height regulations for emergency shelters in the Business Park
 zone, and transitional, farmworker, and supportive housing in all residential districts. Also, the RU-
 HD District allows apartment development at a minimum density of 16 units per acre. Allowed
 projects that comply with various zoning standards are non-discretionary.

 The time required for project approval is not so much a factor of the approval body (Planning
 Director versus Planning Commission), but the complexity of the project and associated
 environmental issues. However, small infill projects that can be approved administratively are
 generally less complex and take a shorter time to obtain appropriate approvals. Large, residential
 subdivision maps, subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA compliance) and a
 public hearing before the Planning Commission. These larger projects can take approximately 6 to
 12 months to obtain appropriate approvals. Most residential development projects in Williams are
 one-phase smaller projects that can typically be processed in less than six months. These residential
 projects typically do not create substantial environmental impacts, thereby greatly reducing the time
 needed for review. Table 9.4-5 outlines the typical approval timelines associated with different
 entitlements that projects could require. It should be noted that many projects require multiple
 entitlements, which are often processed concurrently, thereby shortening the overall processing
 time.

 If a project requires other entitlements needing Planning Commission approval, then the Negative
 Declaration is deferred to the Planning Commission for approval. All projects subject to City
 Council approval are first reviewed for recommendation by the Planning Commission. All projects
 subject to Planning Commission approval may be appealed to the City Council for final
 determination.
 Household Size:
 The City defines family (or household) in the Zoning Code as one person living alone, two persons
 related by blood, marriage, or legal adoption; or a group of unrelated persons up to five persons not
 related by blood, marriage or legal adoption; living together as a single nonprofit household unit in a
 dwelling unit and distinguished from a group occupying a boarding house; lodging house, motel,
 hotel, or fraternity or sorority house. This definition limits the number of persons living in a house
 which is considered a constraint to households with special needs. Restricting the number of
 persons in a household or family is considered a constraint to providing housing to larger
 households. Action Program 2.5 of this Element requies that an amendment be made to the Zoning
 Code in 2017 to revise this definition consistent with State Housing law.
 Density Bonus
 The Zoning Ordinance allows the City to grant a density bonus on a sliding scale that can exceed 35
 percent depending on number of units proposed in a development These percentages are provided
 in Sction 17.02.110.3 of the Zoning Code and reflect the density percentage increase set by the
 California Government Code, Sections 65915-65918 However, the City has not received an
 application for a density bonus. This is partly due to the fact that, because of lower land costs in
 Williams, higher densities do not increase the affordability of housing as much as in more urbanized
 locations with higher land prices and larger minimum lot sizes.
 Mobile Homes and Manufactured Homes
 Manufactured housing is allowed by right in various residential districts in the City in accordance
 with Chapter 17.100 of the Municipal Code regulates mobile and manufactured housing. This Code
 complies with California Government Code Section 65852.3 which allows by right Mobile and
 Manufactured Housing subject to the same development standards for conventional single-family
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                           43
 residential dwellings limited to roof overhang, roofing and siding material restrictions. However,
 mobile homes which have not been built under the National Manufactured Housing Construction
 and Safety Standards Act of 1974 are subject to a use permit.
 Allowance for Special Needs Housing
 Housing Element law specifies that the City must identify adequate sites to encourage the
 development of various types of housing for all economic segments of the population. This
 includes single-family housing, multiple family housing, manufactured housing, second units, mobile
 homes, emergency shelters, and transitional housing, among others.
 Transitional and/or Supportive Housing
 Transitional and/or Supportive Housing is defined as interim housing helping families move from
 homelessness to self-sufficiency by providing short-term housing at extremely low rent to qualified
 families. The City’s Zoning Code allows these uses by right in all residential zoning districts under
 the same provisions for development of other residential uses in accordance with SB2 State-wide
 legislation. There are no siting or other requirements for these group homes other than those
 applied to other residential uses.
 Farm Laborers
 There are four registered private farm labor camps in Colusa County, with a capacity of 70 persons.
 There is also a 100-unit (eleven 4-bedroom units, eleven 2-bedroom units, and 78 3-bedroom units)
 County-operated camp in Williams that houses 250 people on a seasonal basis. The facility operates
 180 days per year from April to October because the units are not heated. Those agricultural
 workers that work in the winter months transition into motels or in with relatives. The State of
 California defines seasonal farm laborers as those who are employed fewer than 150 consecutive
 days by the same employer.
 While the City Zoning Code generally accommodates farm-labor housing facilities within the A-R
 Agricultural/Rural Zoning District, it allows this type of housing in other zoning districts as subject
 to the same requirements of other residential uses in accordance with Government Code Sections
 17021.5 and 17021.6. In 2015 the City-approved Green Valley Homes; a permanent farmworker
 housing development located on in the southeast section of Williams. This project will provide 40
 single-family housing units, a community center and related improvements reserved for qualifying
 farmworker families. The project will be constructed sometime in 2016.
 Disabled
 The Colusa County Department of Health and Human Services is part of the California Children’s
 Services, the state program which children under 21 years of age who are diagnosed with certain
 physically disabling medical conditions. This County Department operates the In-Home Supportive
 Services program, which is designed to keep disabled/aged individuals -- who are at risk of being
 placed in a facility -- in their own home. Individuals are able to remain in their home with the
 assistance of an independent provider to help with the domestic tasks and personal care needs.
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                         44

 There are no housing facilities for the mentally disabled in Williams. Colusa Support Services
 operates the Fifth Street Residence located in neighboring Colusa. This facility provides a six-bed
 home for the developmentally disabled population.
 Emergency Shelters
 The City defines emergency shelters as housing for homeless with minimal supportive services that
 is limited to occupancy of six months or less. This use is considered an allowed use under the
 Zoning Code in the B-P, Business Park Zoning District. Emergency shelters are allowed subject to
 specific standards regarding security, lighting, parking and operation in accordance with
 Government Code Section 65583(a)(4). There are over vacant acres that could for the development
 of new emergency shelters in Williams. There are also over 275 acres of developed BP Zoned
 properties in Williams that could potentially be converted to this type of housing. Figure 1, consists
 of a map of properties zoned for B-P that could conceivably be converted to emergency shelters or
 developed on vacant ground. Many of these properties, vacant, developed, or underutilized, are
 located in close proximity to transportation facilities, job centers and other community services. In
 summary, there is very little regulatory controls that would constrain the development of emergency
 shelters in Williams.
 Secondary Dwelling Units
 A secondary living unit (or second unit) is a separate dwelling unit that provides complete,
 independent living facilities for one or more persons. Second units are permitted by right. Under
 the City’s Zoning Ordinance Permitted Uses are ministerial and are approved by staff. The review is
 limited to determining compliance with certain zoning standards, such as parking, setbacks,
 coverage, and height. Detached second units are only allowed on lots twice the minimum lot size,
 and at least 10,000 square feet in area. Second units must be located at least 10 feet away from the
 primary unit, and not exceed setback requirements of the zoning district. Separate kitchen and
 restroom facilities must be located within the unit. One, off-street parking space is required per
 unit, and the design of the second unit must be similar to that of the primary residence.
 These restrictions on secondary living units are consistent with applicable provisions of State law.
 These conditions are not considered overly restrictive and do not pose a significant constraint to the
 production of second units.
 Residential Care Facilities
 Pursuant to state law, the City allows group homes for six or fewer individuals by right in all
 residential zone districts. Group homes of seven individuals or more are allowed in the RU and RU-
 HD zone districts with issuance of a conditional use permit. There are no siting requirements for
 this type of groups home, and are treated the same in the Zoning Code as other residential uses.
 Further discussion of residential care facilities for persons with disabilities is provided below under
 Americans with Disabilities Act Requirements.
 Reasonable Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities
 The City has established procedures to addressing reasonable accommodation to comply with
 Senate Bill 520. However, the City plans to update the Zoning Code in 2017 to further address SB-
 520. The needs of persons with disabilities in accordance with the Federal Fair Housing

 Amendments Act of 1988 and California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Gov. Code Section

 Americans with Disabilities Act Requirements
 The City has adopted and enforces the current California Building Codes (CBC), including Chapter
 11 pertaining to accessibility. This chapter incorporates provisions from the Americans with
 Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.), which specifies that a number of the residential units in
 new multi-family construction of three or more apartments or four or more condominiums must be
 accessible or adaptable. The recently constructed Stony Creek multi-family apartment project
 provides several units both accessible and adaptable ground floor units. Building officials and
 Planning Department staff are encouraged to keep current with accessibility requirements for the
 construction and remodel of residential structures to ensure that accessibility requirements are met
 for all projects. The Code also requires all new multi-family development projects to incorporate
 project design in accordance Americans for Disabilities Act and/or the California Building Code as
 adopted by the City.
 Fair Housing Constraints
 The provision of equal housing opportunities for all persons is an important goal of the Housing
 Element. The City addresses complaints regarding fair housing issues through its Planning
 Department. City staff monitors complaints and if necessary, refers fair housing matters to
 California Rural Legal Assistance, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
 and/or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing in order to ensure that housing
 opportunities are open to all without regard to race, color, age, sex, religion, national origin, family
 status, or physical handicap and to apprise the general population regarding State and federal laws
 related to the provision of fair and equal housing opportunities for all. Housing discrimination is
 not considered a significant constraint to the availability and production of affordable housing in the
 City.
 C.       FEES
 Although development fees contribute to the total cost of housing development, the extent to which
 these costs are passed on to the consumer depends on price sensitivity of each housing type and the
 ability of housing developers to absorb such cost increases and still maintain acceptable profit
 margins. In “price sensitive” markets, such as that for affordable housing, when increased costs
 cannot be absorbed by the developer, or products modified to compensate the developer, affordable
 housing is not built.

Source(s)/Assumption(s): City of Williams, 2016 Fee Schedule: Includes entitlement, engineering, agency fees, and
infrastructure construction. As there is a large inventory of vacant single-family housing sites available, this assumes
development of a single-family house is on an existing house that has access to water and sewer lines (no planning entitlement,
such as a subdivision or rezoning is required for this construction). For multi-family, assumes one building with four dwelling
units on an existing vacant lot that has access to water and sewer lines. Assumes single-family housing construction costs of
about $100/sq. ft. and multi-family construction costs of about $115/sq. ft. City AB 1600 Fees include police facilities,
parks and recreation, administrative facilities traffic and storm drainage. These fees are reduced by 20% for multi-family units
as compared to a single-family house. City Fee Schedule increases annually based on Consumer Price Index. School Mitigation
Fees are $5.81/sq. ft. residential based on 2015 needs analysis. There are not planning entitlement fees charged to construct a
single house. Design review may or may not be required for an apartment project depending on zoning. However, for the
purpose of this estimate, a proportional charge for major design review is estimated.
 Infrastructure and Public Facilities Constraints
 Environmental factors and a lack of necessary infrastructure or public facilities (e.g., water, sewer,
 roads, etc.) can constrain residential development in a community by increasing costs and reducing
 the amount of land suitable for housing construction. Environmental constraints such as flooding,
 sensitive biological resources, and seismicity can also affect the costs associated with the
 maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. Fortunately, no hazardous materials sites
 exist in the City that would constrain residential development. This section discusses the most
 relevant of these constraints to housing production in Williams. It should be noted that Senate Bill
 1087 requires water and sewer providers, in this case the City of Williams, to grant priority service to
 developments that include housing units affordable to low income households.
 Utilities and Services
 The ability of the community to provide adequate infrastructure and services (roads, water, sewer,
 etc.) to new housing developments is an important element in meeting future housing needs.
 Requirements that are placed on the developer to provide utilities and municipal services may prove
 restrictive when weighed with other construction/property costs and the return on housing
 investments in today’s market.
 Water Supply
 The City obtains its water supply from three wells that have a combined storage capacity of 3. 97
 million gallons per day (MGD) which exceeds the current demand of 1. 7 MGD. The City has
 sufficient storage capacity to serve it current and projected population through the 2030 General
 Plan time horizon. The City is working on developing an additional well system and filtration to
 correct water quality problems, reduce leaks and pressure problems, and to assure sufficient back up
 supply. The system consists of with three active and two standby groundwater wells. The three
 active wells include numbers 8, 9 and 10, which collectively pump approximately 2,800 gallons per
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                                        50

 minute (GPM). The two standby wells have a total pump capacity of 820 GPM, although they each
 have poor water quality and are not now permitted by the State Board of Public Health. The wells
 draw ground water from depths ranging from 120 feet to as deep as 500 feet. The source of
 groundwater is recharge from the hills to the west. Each well pumps directly to the distribution
 system, which largely includes 8-inch water lines. In 1995, a majority of the older four and six inch
 lines in the original town area were replaced, leaving a few remaining transit and cast-iron, four and
 six inch pipes. The average annual water flow is about 400,000 gallons per day, which increases
 substantially to 1.2 to 1.5 million gallons on a peak day. The month of July is usually the peak
 month with around 36. 5 million gallons pumped. As of January 2016, the City served 1,466
 Equivalent Dwelling Units (EDU) of which 1,266 provide service to residential uses.
 The City received a $1. 5 million Community Development Block Grant in 2014 which is being
 used to replace leaking water lines with the West William’s Neighborhood; the lowest income
 housing area in Williams. This replacement is expected to result in increased water use efficiency
 and assure an adequate supply of water to one of the oldest areas of town.
 The City has sufficient capacity to serve an additional 544 EDUs over the General Plan timeline of
 2030. Based on the 2010 Census estimate of 3.66 persons average family size, this equates to
 capacity to serve an additional a population increase of almost 2,000 people. Water supply and
 treatment facilities are not constraining factors to accommodating future development anticipated
 during the 2014-19 planning period. The City’s future water demand will increase by approximately
 6.5 gallons as a result of projected growth (between 2014 and 2019) which would be more than
 sufficient to accommodate development of the 307 RHNA (Regional Housing Needs Allocation for
 this period. In accordance with Senate Bill 1087, the City will reserve water capacity for a minimum
 119 Low and Very Low Income persons (33 EDUs) during the 2014-19 planning period as
 identified in William’s 2014-19 Regional Housing Needs Allocation (refer to Policy 2.1 in Section 9.6
 of this Housing Element.
 Wastewater Facilities
 The City of Williams Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is owned by the City of Williams as part
 of a municipal wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal system that provides sewerage service
 to residential and commercial users within the City of Williams. The wastewater Collection System
 includes 0.6 miles of forced mains, 4 lift stations, 23 miles of gravity sewers, and 15 miles of laterals.
 Wastewater flows into the WWTP and receives tertiary level treatment before it’s discharged to Salt
 Creek. The WWTP is designed to pump, screen, and equalize a peak flow rate of 4.5 MGD. The
 plant’s rated treatment capacity is based on an average day max month flow rate of 1.08 million
 gallons per day (MGD) and a peak flow rate of 2.32 MGD. This capacity is sufficient to handle the
 City’s current and future average daily and dry weather flows. William’s future wastewater system
 treatment demand will increase by approximately 0.06 MGD as a result of projected growth
 (between 2014 and 2019) of the 307 RHNA (Regional Housing Needs) dwellings (at 210 gallons per
 day/dwelling unit).
 Occasionally, wet weather demand exceeds the maximum treatment capacity, but not enough
 frequency to pose a constraint to future residential development. The City’s Wastewater System
 Master Plan (March, 2009) provides a plan for upgrading the system to improve current capacity to
 mitigate wet weather flow capacity and for a plant expansion that would increase capacity to
 accommodate General Plan build-out.
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                           51

 The City received a $1.5 million Community Development Block Grant in 2014 which is being used
 to replace surcharging sewer lines with the West William’s Neighborhood; the lowest income
 housing area in Williams. This replacement is expected to result in reduced surcharging and reduce
 infiltration which will improve sewer system operation efficiencies.
 Wastewater facilities are not constraining factors to accommodating future development anticipated
 during the 2014-19 planning period. In accordance with Senate Bill 1087, the City will reserve sewer
 capacity for a minimum 119 Low and Very Low Income persons (33 EDUs) during the 2014-19
 planning period as identified in William’s 2014-19 Regional Housing Needs Allocation (refer to
 Policy 2.1 in Section 9. 6 of this Housing Element.
 Site Improvement
 Site improvements are an important component of new development and include streets, water,
 sewer, and other infrastructure necessary to serve new development. Site Improvement Standards
 are regulated by the City’s Design and Construction Standards. The City can reduce the cost of the
 improvements by assisting affordable housing developers in obtaining state and federal financing for
 their projects, providing density bonuses, and by deferring or reducing fees in exchange for long-
 term affordability of the assisted housing units.
 Street Improvements
 The City of Williams does not experience the heavy traffic congestion conditions found in many of
 the larger urban areas in California. At present, the normal traffic flows are light and most of the
 tourism is transient traffic from I-5 and Highway 20. Heavier traffic is limited to a few blocks on
 the east side of the City near the on and off ramps and where the majority of the highway service
 businesses are located. This area is served by “E”, 5th and 6th Streets.
 Although Williams does not now experience significant traffic congestion, there is a growing
 maintenance problem which will become more critical with increased growth and traffic demands.
 Many of Williams’ streets have pavement and sub-surface problems. Even streets in the commercial
 and industrial areas are in a state of disrepair that has left them close to complete deterioration. This
 problem is being addressed by the Public Works Department which attempts to repair streets as
 money permits. The real solution, however, is to obtain additional funding for road maintenance.
 As new development occurs, roads will need to be built and existing roads up graded.
 Street improvement standards typically have the greatest impact on housing costs. The cost of
 providing streets for new residential development, in turn, is primarily influenced by the required
 right-of-way width, pavement width, pavement improvement, and landscaping standards.
 The City’s Improvement Standards identify three types of streets required for new development.
 Typical residential development will include provisions for Major Collectors and Collector streets,
 which have a right-of-way requirement of 70 feet, including pavement, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks
 (see Table 9/4-8). Local streets and collector streets function as neighborhood roads, providing
 direct access to lots that are adjacent to the paved section of a street. These streets include a
 pavement width of 36 feet, curb to curb. The pavement width required by the City is the generally
 accepted minimum necessary to provide for one lane of vehicular traffic in each direction and on-
 street parking on each side. Larger developments or developments along major circulation routes
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                            52

 may be required to construct arterials streets, which require much larger right-of-ways of between 86
 to 110 feet.

                         Source(s): City of Williams Improvement Standards
 For residential subdivisions, street improvements are required. However, for infill develop
 (residential construction within the City’s existing subdivided lots) street improvements are not
 required for gravel streets. The City has a large inventory of these lots ready for immediate
 residential development. The cost of street improvements for infill development is not considered a
 significant constraint to housing production in Williams.
 Storm Drainage
 All storm water runoff within the City is handled by surface drainage as no major outfall piping
 systems are in existence. The majority of the town area, consisting of the central core north of “H”
 Street and east of 10th Street, drains to the northeast along “B” Street, under I-5 and then along
 Highway 20. An area of approximately four blocks north of “B” Street and east of 9th Street
 currently drains north along Old Highway 99.
 The portion of the City west of 10th Street drains to the north and west along North Street and
 eventually into Salt Creek north of Highway 20. The southern portion of the town south of
 “H” Street and west of 9th Street flows to the south east along Husted Lateral Road and is piped
 under I-5. Drainage from the area known as the Plank Industrial Park flows generally north-east
 into a Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District channel at the northeast corner of Section 19.
 Flooding currently occurs in the north section of the City and along the western side of I5 north of
 the Husted Lateral. A good portion of the City’s north side is currently in the 100 year flood plain.
 The reason for this flooding is due to the condition and height of the levee on Salt Creek just
 outside town to the west. Because of this current flooding problem, development on the west side
 of the City can cause increased flooding in residential and commercial districts on the City’s north
 side and along I-5. Development north of the City would already occur in the flood zone and would
 have serious flooding impacts that should be addressed before development is permitted. Areas east
 of I-5 and directly south of Highway 20 may have flooding and drainage problems. Some of the
 severity of the potential flooding in the north side of the City can be mitigated by constructing and
 improving levees to the west of the City along Salt Creek and Highway 20.
 The City requires developers to make improvements to project sites to accommodate on-site storm
 drainage facilities including underground storm drain pipelines, catch basins, detention basins, and
 other facilities that may be needed. In certain situations, the City requires that off-site
 improvements be constructed, but these may be in-lieu of the City’s Drainage Impact fees collected
 as part of the City’s AB 1600 Developer Fee Program.

 Flood Zone
 Approximately 1,183 acres of land in the City of Williams is located within Special Flood Hazard
 Area “A” according to the City’s Geographic Information System (refer to Figure 2). Most of this
 land is in north Williams. Property located in Flood Zone “A” is subject to a 1% or greater chance
 of flooding (100-year flood) in any given year. Construction occurring within flood zones must be
 conducted in accordance with Chapter 15. 16 of the Municipal Code which states that no structure
 shall be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the
 Floodplain Management regulations. Approximately 1,183 acres of land in the City of Williams is
 located within Special Flood Hazard Area “A” according to the City’s Geographic Information
 System (reference Figure 13). Most of this land is in north Williams. Property located in Flood
 Zone “A” is subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding (100-year flood) in any given year. Any
 development within the 100-year flood zones must be in accordance with Chapter 15. 16 of the
 Municipal Code which states that no structure shall be constructed, located, extended, converted, or
 altered without full compliance with the Floodplain Management regulations.
 Most of the available residential properties zoned for medium to high density development are not
 located in flood zone areas. This element includes Action Programs 3.1 to assist with infrastructure
 or other subsidies for new, affordable, residential development, where necessary. Action Programs
 4.2 and 4.3 was developed to help defer initial costs associated with impact fees, such as flood
 mitigation fees. Action Program 2.3 was developed to specifically accomplish technical assistance,
 planning and engineering, as well as submit applications for construction funding from sources such
 as CDBG general funds and USDA Rural Development. These programs can be applicable to
 alleviating additional costs related to flood area mitigation measures should it become necessary in
 the future.
 Building Codes
 Building Codes regulate plumbing, electrical and mechanical improvements. The City currently
 enforces the Uniform Building Code (UBC) and related codes, as established by the state, and has
 little control over these standards. The Planning and Building Department is responsible for
 administering ordinances and other regulations pertaining to land and building development within
 the City limits. The department provides plan-checks and inspections. Building Code enforcement
 is basically conducted through scheduled inspections of new construction, remodeling, and
 rehabilitation projects. Inspections are also conducted in response to public complaints or an
 inspector’s observation that construction is occurring without proper permits. Local enforcement of
 these codes does not add significantly to the cost of housing in Williams and maintains an acceptable
 standard of health and safety governance for all inhabitants.
 Building Code Enforcement
 The City implements Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, in which California has adopted
 the Uniform Building Code (UBC) and other model codes (electrical, plumbing, mechanical, etc.).
 The City has not adopted local amendments to the various model codes, which establish standards
 and requires inspections at various stages of construction to ensure code compliance. Although
 these standards and the time required for inspections increase housing production costs and may
 impact the viability of rehabilitation of older properties that are required to be brought up to current
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                          54

 code standards, the intent of the codes is to provide structurally sound, safe, and energy-efficient
 housing.
 The Building Department is responsible for enforcing both the State and City regulations governing
 maintenance of all buildings and property. Code enforcement complaints are generally related to
 housing in need of rehabilitation. Property owners who are the subject of code enforcement
 complaints regarding housing condition can obtain information on potential City assistance available
 for repairs and improvements through the Planning Department.

 Native American Consultation
 Assembly Bill AB 52, Consultation with Native American Tribes, took effect July 1, 2015. It seeks
 to protect a new class of resources under CEQA: ”tribal cultural resources.” It requires that the
 City undertaking CEQA review must, upon request of a California Native American tribe, begin
 consultation as part of a project review to consider impacts to “tribal cultural resources.” A tribal
 cultural resource is defined as a site, feature, place, cultural landscape, sacred place or object with
 cultural value to a California Native American tribe, which may include non-unique archeological
 resources. Consultations can have an impact on project budgets and timing. The City regularly
 consults with local tribes concerning projects, and thus far, these consultations have not resulted in
 any impediments to the development review process.
 Military Compatibility
 Senate Bills SB 1462 and SB 1468 require that the General Plan disclose any land use conflicts with
 military air space, and/or training routes. In addition, the law requires disclosure of any military
 operations or installations within 1,000 feet of the City. Potentially, land use conflicts to these
 resources could constrain housing production. Based on mapping analysis conducted by the
 California Office of Planning and Research there are no conflicts with military land or air uses in or
 around Williams. Please refer to Figure 3.

 D.      NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
 Non-governmental constraints are those that are generated by the private sector and that are beyond
 the control of local governments. Some of the impacts of non-governmental constraints can be
 offset to a minimal extent by local governmental actions, but usually the effects are very localized
 and have little influence on the total housing need within the jurisdiction or market area. Non-
 governmental constraints to affordable housing in Williams consist of three major factors: price of
 land, availability of financing, and cost of construction.
 The City has a limited ability to influence these factors except through adequately planned
 annexations. Land costs are impacted by the number of adequate sites that are available. Regional
 demand and costs have a great impact on land costs. Construction and financing costs are also
 determined at the regional, state, and national levels by a variety of private and public actions, which
 are not controlled by the City.
 The major barrier to providing housing for all economic segments of the community concerns the
 nature of the housing market itself. Development costs have risen to the point where building
 affordable housing for low income segments of the community can be difficult to provide in
 Williams.
 Price of Land
 A key factor determining housing cost is the price of raw land and any necessary improvements.
 Land costs for residentially or commercially zoned properties are expected to be relatively low by
 California standards, depending upon location, status of subdivision, or other improvements to the
 property, but individual lots that are “ready to build” can cost considerably more. Property with
 higher values are typically those that are “ready to build” with urban services and/or zoning
 entitlements. However, most of these are located within tract home subdivisions where developers
 will not sell the lots individually, but sell an entire home built to suite. However, complete
 subdivision tracts are for sale in Williams that can sell at between $25,000 and $45,000 per lot.
 These are generally the most valuable properties. There are also a number of lots in Williams within
 the older west section of town that can be built on individually as infill development that range in
 price between $15,000 and $30,000. Larger tracts of land are available that would require
 subdivision and improvements that would result in similar costs once improvements are made.
 Properties of one to five acres generally have sold for $60,000 to $200,000, with an average price of
 $143,000. Only two properties of more than five acres sold in in 2006 at $100,000 for
 approximately 10 acres and $410,000 for approximately 63 acres. No more recent sales have been
 found, but the residential land market has not significantly changed since 2006.
 Construction Costs
 Many factors can affect the cost of building a single-family house, including the type of construction,
 custom versus tract development, materials, site conditions, finishing details, amenities, square
 footage, and structural configuration. According to the Building Valuation Data published by the
 Building Safety Journal, construction costs for a single-family home range from $102 to $130 per
 square foot. Multifamily units typically cost $94 to $137 per square foot. A reduction in amenities
 and the quality of building materials can result in lower sales prices. The cost of a 1,200 square foot
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                           58

 single-family home would range from $122,400 to $156,000. These estimates do not include the
 cost of the land and developer impact fees.
 Prefabricated factory-built or manufactured housing, which is permitted (Under the City’s Zoning
 Ordinance Permitted Uses) are ministerial permits. They are approved administratively by staff.
 The review is limited to determining compliance with parking, setbacks, coverage, height regulations
 in all residential districts (in accordance with State law). Based on bids in 2008 and 2009 for the
 City’s Housing Rehab Program, the cost ranges from $85,000 to $132,000 for a mobile home
 purchase and installation. These estimates do not include the cost of land and developer impact
 fees.
 Although construction costs are a significant portion of the overall development cost, the City can
 do little to mitigate its impact. Because construction costs in Williams are similar to those in the
 area, the cost of construction is not considered a major constraint to housing production.
 Finance Costs
 One of the most significant factors related to the provision of adequate housing for all segments of
 the population is the availability of affordable financing. Throughout the 2000s, interest rates were
 less than 8% on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, and in 2005 through the first half of 2015 they have
 been lower than 4% and are still trending lower.
 Mortgage Lending Trends in California
 Currently, the mortgage lending market is enjoying a boom in refinancing, the biggest since 1998,
 which encourages some to predict that lower housing costs will free up consumer dollars for other
 uses, including remodeling.

                                       30-year loan (not including insurance and property tax).
 The monthly payment on a $180,000 house with a 20% down payment, 4% interest rate, and 30-year
 loan would be $716 per month. Assuming a 30% budget for housing, this monthly cost exceeds the
 cost of housing for low income households. Therefore, without some form of subsidy, such as
 home buyer’s assistance, financing an average priced home in Williams is within reach only to
 moderate and above moderate income families.

 E.      SPECIAL CONSTRAINTS
 At-Risk Housing Units
 California Government Code (Section 65583) requires that this element evaluate all low-income
 rental-housing units, which may, at some future time, be lost to the affordable inventory by the
 expiration of some type of affordability restrictions, typically through government housing subsidy.
 This analysis must address a ten-year period, which is divided into two five-year segments coinciding
 with the updating of the housing element. The analysis must contain the following components as
 required by HCD:
        A comprehensive inventory of all subsidized rental housing units;
        A cost comparison of replacing or preserving any units that will become at-risk in the ten-
         year period;
        Identification of non-profit entities qualified to acquire and manage rental housing;
        Identification of possible sources and potential funds for preserving housing units; and
        Inventory of existing and proposed City programs for preserving at-risk units.
 All publicly assisted projects in Williams have been funded through the Low Income Housing Tax
 Credit Program (LIHC) through HUD. These consist of 146 rental-housing units in three
 developments as referenced in Table 9.4-10. The single at-risk complex, Pinewood Court, is due to
 expire in 2021. This means that the City is at risk of losing 25 units of affordable housing within the
 next ten years. However, it is anticipated that this project’s agreement will be extended a second
 time before it expires in 2021. Action Program 5.2 has been added to provide City on-going
 monitoring of at risk housing so as to retain the City's existing affordable housing to the extent
 feasible.

 It is noted that the City approved a permanent farmworkers housing project in 2015, consisting of
 the development of 40 single-family houses and a community center in 2015. This project will be
 reserved for extremely-low and very low income families and is now under construction. In
 addition, the Williams Farm Labor Facility is discussed in more depth in the Farm Worker Housing
 discussion of this chapter.
 Preservation of Affordable Housing - Organizations
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                             60

 The preservation of affordable rental housing at risk of conversion to market rate housing can be
 assisted by non-profit organizations with the capacity and interest in acquiring, managing, and
 permanently preserving such housing. The California Department of Housing and Community
 Development maintains a list of such interested non-profit organizations. Organizations that are
 active and/or have expressed interest in preserving affordable housing in the Williams area include
 the following:
         Central Valley Coalition for Affordable Housing, 3351 M Street, Suite 100, Merced, CA

          414-4400
 Preservation and Replacement
 To maintain existing affordable housing units, the City can either preserve the existing housing or
 facilitate the development of new housing units. Depending on the circumstances of at-risk
 projects, different options may be used to preserve or replace the units. Preservation options
 typically include transfer of the project to non-profit ownership, provision of rental assistance to
 tenants using non-federal funding sources, as well as purchase of affordability covenants. The most
 direct option to pursue replacement of the affordable units is the development of new assisted
 multifamily housing. The City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program provides the opportunity to
 replace housing that is severely dilapidated.
 Transfer of Ownership
 One of the least costly ways to ensure that at-risk units remain affordable for the long term is
 through the transfer of ownership to a non-profit housing provider. By transferring property
 ownership to a non-profit organization, low-income restrictions can be secured indefinitely and the
 project would become potentially eligible for a greater range of governmental assistance. Although
 Highlands Village is already owned by a non-profit corporation, it may also be acquired by another
 non-profit agency to maintain the affordable units.
 Rental Subsidies
 Maintenance of affordable units can also be achieved through rental subsidies from non-federal
 sources such as State, local, or other funding mechanisms that can be structured to mirror the
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                        61

 Section 8 assistance program. Under Section 8, HUD pays the difference between what tenants can
 pay, defined as 30% of the median household income, and what HUD estimates as the fair market
 rent (FMR) on the unit.
 Purchase of Affordability Covenants
 Another option to preserve the affordability of the Pinewood Manor project is to provide an
 incentive package to the owners to maintain the projects as affordable housing. Incentives could
 include writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance, and/or supplementing the
 Section 8 subsidy received to market levels. The feasibility of this option depends on owner’s equity
 in the property, debt burden, and debt payments in relation to project revenue. By providing lump
 sum, financial incentives or ongoing subsides in rents or reduced mortgage interest rates to the
 owner, the City can ensure that some or all of the units remain affordable.
 Construction of Replacement Units
 The construction of new affordable housing units could serve to replace the units within Pinewood
 Manor, should they be converted to market-rate rents. The costs involved in developing housing
 depend on a variety of factors, including density, size of units, location, land costs, and type of
 construction.
 At-Risk Cost Analysis
 In order to provide a cost analysis of preserving at-risk units, costs must be determined for
 rehabilitation, new construction or tenant-based rental assistance.
 Rehabilitation: The primary factors used to analyze the cost of preserving housing for lower-
 income households include: acquisition, rehabilitation and financing. Actual acquisition costs
 depend on several variables such as condition, size, location, existing financing and availability of
 financing (governmental and market). The following are estimated per unit preservation costs for
 the City, according to a market survey of similar projects within the region and private developers.
 New Construction/Replacement: New construction implies construction of a new property
 with the same number of units and similar amenities as the one removed from the affordable
 housing stock. Cost estimates were prepared by using local information and data. The construction
 of new housing can vary greatly depending on factors such as location, density, unit sizes,
 construction materials and on-site and off-site improvements. Table 9.4-12 describes new
 construction costs for a typical apartment in Williams.
               Table 9.4-11 City of Williams Estimated Per-Unit Preservation Costs
                      Fee Type                                 Cost per Unit

              Financing/Other             $35,000 (20-year finance period)
              Total Cost per Unit         $120,000

              Total Cost per Unit               $168,000
              Source(s): City Williams, 2016: Includes entitlement, engineering, agency fees, and
              infrastructure construction. For multi-family, assumes one building with four dwelling units. The
              rehabilitation of existing units instead of new construction is the most cost effective approach
              toward the preservation of at-risk units. It should be noted however, that at-risk units may also
              be preserved through tenant-based rental assistance.
 Tenant-based Rental Assistance (Section 8 Vouchers): This type of preservation largely
 depends on the income of the family, the shelter costs of the apartment and the number of years the
 assistance is provided. If the typical family that requires rental assistance earns $18,450, then the
 family could afford approximately $461 per month for shelter costs. The difference between the
 $461 and the typical rent for an apartment rent of $635 would result in necessary monthly assistance
 of $174 a month or $2,080 per year. For comparison purposes, typical affordable housing
 developments carry an affordability term of at least 20 years, which would bring the total cost to
 $31,600 per family. The total cost of producing new and comparable units is estimated at $128,000
 per unit or $168,000 for a 20-year period (including financing costs), while rehabilitation is estimated
 to be $85,000 per unit or $120,000 for a 20-year period (including financing).
 In summary, purchase and rehabilitation of an existing housing project which has an expired
 agreement would be less expensive and possibly a better investment within the City, to preserve
 affordable units in the City.
 F.       FUNDING AND ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
 Overview
 A variety of resources are available to landowners and developers seeking to provide housing within
 Williams. This section provides information on several of the major programs and resources
 available within the City for use with residential developments. Resources are grouped under local
 providers, private nonprofit agencies, and state or federal programs. A full listing of financial
 resources available to assist in the production, preservation, and maintenance of housing is found in
 Table 9.4-13.
 Non-Profit Housing Agencies
 A number of non-profit housing agencies are available that develop affordable housing. An active
 developer, such as Habitat for Humanity, could constructs and rehabilitates houses for lower income
 families in Williams. Habitat homes are sold to partner families at no profit with affordable, no-
 interest loans. Volunteers, churches, businesses, and other groups provide most of the labor for the
 homes.

Chapter 9, Housing Element                                    63
 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program
 The CDBG program provides funds for a range of community development activities. CDBG
 funds are administered by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
 through a variety of competitive and non-competitive programs. These programs can provide
 funding for a range of activities. The eligible activities include, but are not limited to acquisition
 and/or disposition of real estate or property, public facilities and improvements, relocation,
 rehabilitation and construction of housing, homeownership assistance, and also clearance activities.
 Funding levels for individual programs can vary by year, and decisions to pursue funding for each
 program are made by the City based on potential projects and competitive factors.
 In 2014, the City received about $70,000 in CDBG funds (in addition to the City’s existing $120,000
 in reserved CDBG funding for this program) to expand its Housing Rehabilitation and Home
 Buyers Programs. The City contracts with the Regional Housing Authority of Sutter and Nevada
 Counties (RHASNC) to administer this program for the City (refer to Exhibit C, City’s Housing
 Rehabilitation and Home Buyers Program Summary). Since RHASN started administering this
 program in June 2014, the City has experienced one housing unit rehabilitation.
 Also, the City received $1.3 in CDBG funds in 2014 for rehabilitation of water and sewer lines
 within the West Williams Neighborhood, the lowest income neighborhood in Williams. This
 project, to be completed in 2016, will improve water and sewer services to this neighborhood and,
 therefore, preserve over 500 currently affordable housing units in Williams.
 HOME Investment Partnership Program Funds (HOME)
 Federal HOME funds can be used for activities that promote affordable rental housing and
 homeownership for lower-income households. HOME funds are administered by HCD, through a
 variety of competitive and non-competitive programs. Activities eligible to receive HOME funds
 include building acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, moderate/substantial rehabilitation,
 first-time homebuyer assistance, and tenant-based assistance. A federal priority for the use of
 HOME funds is preservation of the at-risk housing stock. As with CDBG funds, funding levels for
 individual programs can vary by year, and decisions to pursue funding for each program are made by
 the City based on potential projects and competitive factors.
 Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program
 Federally funded program administered by the State offers MCCs through an annual application
 process, which provides first-time homebuyers a credit on their federal income taxes up to 20% of
 the mortgage interest paid for the year. The credit can be deducted from the income tax owed,
 while the remaining 80% of the interest paid on the mortgage remains available as an income tax
 deduction. This program can be used in conjunction with the City’s Homebuyer Program.
 Cal Home Program
 Authorized by SB 1656 in 2002, the Cal Home Program offers financial assistance to cities and non-
 profits for first-time homebuyer assistance, rehabilitation programs, or homeownership
 development projects. Specialized components of the Program assist owners of manufactured
 housing units and shared housing operators.

 Project-Based Section 8
 Project-Based Section 8 is a rent subsidy program in which tenants pay no more than 30% of their
 income for rent with HUD paying the difference up to the contract rent amount. Project-Based
 Section 8 provides for contracts that have terms of up to 20 years, except for those financed by the
 California Housing Finance Agency, which have terms of 30 years.
 Section 515
 The USDA Rural Development administered direct mortgage program provides loans for rental
 housing in rural communities. Loans have terms of up to 50 years with an interest of 1%.
 Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly
 This section helps expand the supply of affordable housing with supportive services for the elderly.
 It provides very low-income elderly with options that allow them to live independently but in an
 environment, that provides support activities such as cleaning, cooking, transportation, etc. The
 program is similar to Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities (Section 811).
 Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities
 This program allows persons with disabilities the opportunity to live as independently as possible by
 increasing the supply of rental housing with the availability of supportive services. The program also
 provides project rental assistance, which covers the difference between the HUD-approved
 operating costs of the project and the tenants” contribution toward rent. The program is similar to
 Supportive Housing for the Elderly (Section 202).
 Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
 This program (LIHTC) encourages the construction and rehabilitation of low-income rental housing
 by providing a federal income tax credit as an incentive to investors. Investors receive tax credits
 for a specified number of years in return for investing equity capital. This program requires a 55-
 year affordability period.
 The new Stoney Creek Senior Complex was developed using LIHTCs. The Green Valley
 Farmworker Housing project that is undergoing construction is also an LIHTC project.

 Energy Conservation
 This section addresses residential energy conservation as one of the ways housing can be made more
 affordable. Section 65583(a)(7) of the State’s Housing Element Law requires that housing elements
 contain an “analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to residential
 development.”
 Utility-related costs can directly affect the affordability of housing in Northern California. However,
 Title 24 of the California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy standards for new
 development, and requires adoption of an “energy budget.” In turn, the home building industry
 must comply with these standards while localities are responsible for enforcing the energy
 conservation regulations.
 The following are among the alternative ways to meet state energy standards:
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                            67

          The use of passive solar construction techniques that require proper solar orientation,
           appropriate levels of thermal mass, south facing windows, and moderate insulation levels.
          The use of higher insulation levels in place of thermal mass or energy conserving window
           orientation.
          The use of active solar water heating in exchange for less insulation and/or energy
           conserving window treatments.
 Other examples of energy saving construction techniques are:
          Locating homes on the northern portion of the sunniest location of building sites.
          Designing structures to admit the maximum amount of sunlight into the building and to
           reduce exposure to extreme weather conditions.
          Locating indoor areas of maximum usage along the south face of the building and placing
           corridors, closets, laundry rooms, power core, and garages along the north face.
          Making the main entrance a small enclosed space that creates an air lock between the
           building and its exterior.
          Orienting the entrance away from winds or using a windbreak to reduce the wind velocity
           against the entrance.
 Site planning techniques, the use of landscaping, and the layout of new developments can also
 reduce energy consumption associated with residential development through reductions in heating
 and cooling needs, opportunities to use non-motorized methods of transportation, and reductions in
 energy inputs to the development of housing.
 PG&E provides a variety of energy conservation services for residents and PG&E also participates
 in several other energy assistance programs for lower income households, which help qualified
 homeowners and renters conserve energy and control electricity costs. These programs include the
 California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program and the Relief for Energy Assistance
 through Community Help (REACH) Program.
 The California Alternate Rates for Energy Program (CARE) provides a 15% monthly discount on
 gas and electric rates to income-qualified households, certain non-profits, facilities housing
 agricultural employees, homeless shelters, hospices and other qualified non-profit group living
 facilities.
 The REACH Program provides one-time energy assistance to customers who have no other way to
 pay their energy bill. The intent of REACH is to assist low-income customers, particularly the
 elderly, disabled, sick, working poor, and the unemployed, who experience severe hardships and are
 unable to pay for their necessary energy needs.
 Retrofit
 There are a number of methods available to improve conditions of existing structures and to
 decrease their energy demand, all of which fall under the general label of “retrofit.” Among the most
 common techniques for increasing building efficiency are: insulation of ceilings, heating-ventilating
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                          68

 air conditioning ducts and hot water heaters; weather stripping and caulking; night setback
 thermostats; spark ignited pilot lights; low-flow shower heads; window treatment to provide shade;
 and furnace efficiency modifications. The City of Williams monitors such modifications on
 substantial rehabilitation projects pursuant to the California Building Codes.
 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers grants or subsidized loans
 to owners and tenants in residential, commercial and agricultural buildings for the purchase and
 installation of conservation and solar measures. These funds are disbursed through the state and
 provide financial assistance to consumers for solar and energy conservation improvements.
 Weatherization in existing dwellings can greatly cut down heating and cooling costs. Weatherization
 is generally done by performing or improving attic insulation, caulking, weather stripping and storm
 windows, furnace efficiency modifications, and certain mechanical measures to heating and cooling
 systems. The U.S. Department of Energy allocates money to States for disbursement to
 community-based organizations.
 Other means of energy conservation in residential structures includes proper design and location of
 windows, window shades, orientation of the dwelling in relation to sun and wind direction, and roof
 overhang to let the winter sun in and block the summer sun out.
 On September 6, 2000, the Legislature responded to the California Energy Crisis by passing AB970.
 The statute known as the California Energy and Reliability Act of 2000, found that there has been
 significant growth in the demand for electricity and that new power plant construction and energy
 conservation have seriously lagged. The Act provides significant investment in conservation and
 demand-side management programs.
 Funding Sources
 Finally, housing element law states that the analysis shall identify and consider the use of all federal,
 state, and local financing and subsidy programs, which can be used to preserve assisted housing
 developments for lower income households. The following funding sources are available in the City
 of Williams for this purpose as replacement housing becomes necessary:
 Conventional Financing: Financing costs are subject to fluctuations of national economic policies
 and conditions. The cost for site preparation and construction is a very important determinant of
 the initial cost to the purchaser. Mortgage rates have an even more dramatic effect on the cost of
 housing to the homebuyer and on the cost of constructing rental units. Interest rates are ultimately
 passed on to the renter by the apartment owner. Interest rates for new house construction and
 purchase of new hopes in 2015 ranged between 3% and 5%. Generally, a 14% interest rate is the
 level at which most buyers are expected to drop out of the market. Fluctuating interest rates can
 have a particularly dramatic effect on the building industry when mortgage rates increase between
 the start of construction and completion of a project. It is anticipated that since 6.25% interest rates
 are currently available, home buying will continue to increase provided other recessionary factors are
 overcome.
 Obtaining permanent financing for qualified homebuyers does not pose irreconcilable constraints,
 with the availability of various home loan programs requiring zero to 5% down payments. Interest
 rates on these financing vehicles average around 6.25%. Assistance is available through the Down
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                          69
 Payment Assistance program to eligible and qualified buyers. Community Development Block
 Grant (CDBG) and HOME programs: The City of Williams is eligible to compete each year for
 CDBG funds through the State Small Cities and Counties program. These funds can be utilized for
 the replacement of substandard housing, rehabilitation of lower income owner-occupied and rental-
 occupied housing units, and other programs that assist households with incomes at or below 80% of
 median income. It can also be used to offset infrastructure costs in support of affordable housing
 development. HOME funds are also obtained through a competitive application process to HCD.
 Funds may be used for rehabilitation, acquisition and/or new construction of affordable housing.
 At least 90% of the households assisted must be at or below 60% of median income. These
 programs also offer financing to low-income families for down-payments for housing. Low-Income
 Housing Tax Credits. Credits can be used to fund the hard and soft costs (excluding land costs) of
 the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of rental housing. Projects not receiving other
 federal subsidy receive a federal credit of 9% per year for 10 years and a state credit of 30% over 4
 years (high cost areas and qualified census tracts get increased federal credits). Projects with a
 federal subsidy receive a 4% federal credit each year for 10 years and a 13% state credit over 4 years.
 Low-Income Housing Preservation and Residential Home Ownership Act (LIHPRHA). LIHPRHA
 requires that all eligible HUD Section 236 and Section 221(d) projects “at risk” of conversion to
 market-rate rental housing through the mortgage prepayment option be subject to LIHPRHA
 Incentives. The incentives to owners include HUD subsidies which guarantee owners an 8% annual
 return on equity. Owners must file a Plan of Action to obtain incentives or offer the project for sale
 to a) non-profit organizations, b) tenants, or c) public bodies for a 12-month period followed by an
 additional three-month sale to other purchasers. Only then are owners eligible to prepay the
 subsidized mortgages.
 G.      LAND AVAILABILITY AND CAPACITY ANALYSIS
 The amount of land available for the development of housing is crucial in considering methods of
 meeting housing need. State law requires that the City provide an adequate number of sites to allow
 for and facilitate production of the City’s regional share of housing. To determine whether the City
 has sufficient land to accommodate its share of regional housing needs for all income groups, the
 City must identify “adequate sites.” Under State law (California Government Code section
 65583[c][1]), adequate sites are those with appropriate zoning and development standards, with
 services and facilities, needed to facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of housing for
 all income levels. The California Department of Housing and Community Development, in its
 guidelines that interpret State law (Housing Element Questions and Answers, Question #23) states
 that:
 The locality’s sites are adequate if the land inventory demonstrates sufficient realistic capacity at
 appropriate densities and development standards to permit development of a range of housing types
 and prices to accommodate the community’s share of the regional housing need by income level. A
 two-part analysis is necessary to make this determination:
  The locality’s sites are adequate if the land inventory demonstrates:
        There is realistic development capacity of suitable land, which is or will be served by facilities
         and infrastructure, accommodate the locality’s total new construction need by income group
         over the next five years;
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                            70

         That these available sites appropriately zoned (considering local development standards and
          land costs) for a variety of housing types (single-family, multifamily, mobile homes, etc.) and
          at appropriate densities to facilitate the development of housing to meet the locality’s
          regional housing need by income level category, including the need for very low- and low-
          income households.
 Residential sites identified in this section meet the criteria listed above, and are within the definition
 of “adequate sites,” in accordance with State law as discussed below.
 The projected Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for the City identified a need for
 potentially producing 307 dwelling units between January 1, 2014 to July 1, 2019. This is further
 broken down as 69 units for very-low, 50 units for low, 58 for moderate, and 130 units for above-
 moderate income households. This land has access to adequate water, sewer and storm drain
 infrastructure. Based on the City’s General Plan and Zoning Code, the City has the potential
 Realistic Development Capacity to create over 1,090 new dwelling units. Realistic Development
 Capacity consists of 80% of maximum density in all residential zoning districts except for U-R-HD-
 Urban Residential High Density, which is calculated at 16 units per acre when minimum density for
 this district is 16 units per acre (refer to Table 9-4.14). Relative to higher density multiple family
 development, which currently provides for much of the City’s existing lower-income family housing
 needs, the City has the ability to produce over 380 potentially higher density housing units (for the
 23.86 acres zoned U-R-HD at an assumed density of 16 units per acre). This exceeds the 119 units
 of Low and Very Low Income housing units identified in the 2014-19 Regional Housing Needs Plan
 for the City All of these identified residential high density zoned vacant parcels are located adjacent
 to available utilities, such as sewer and water. To further extend the City’s commitment to
 producing these high density units, Action Policy 2.1 of Section 9.6 of this Element provides that
 that the City reserve sewer and water capacity for at least 119 low and very low income equivalent
 dwelling units. In addition, the City has capacity for development of over 650 lower density units
 that exceeds the 58 Moderate and 130 Above Moderate Housing units identified in the Regional
 Housing Needs Plan. Figure 4 consists of a map of all the residentially zoned vacant or
 underutilized properties in the City that coincide with Table 9.4-14. Table 9.4-15 summarizes how
 the City fully exceeds the land capacity requirements of the Regional Housing Needs for Colusa
 County.

 9.5      HOUSING ACHIEVEMENTS DURING THE 2009-14
          PLANNING CYCLE
 A.       OVERVIEW
 State law (California Government Code section 65588 (a)) requires each jurisdiction to review its
 housing element as frequently as appropriate to evaluate:
         The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the
          attainment of the state housing goal.
         The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community’s housing goals
          and objectives.
         The progress of the City in implementation of the housing element.
 According to the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD),
 Housing Element Questions and Answers: A Guide to the Preparation of Housing Elements, the
 review is a three-step process:
 1.       Review the results of the previous element’s goals, objectives, policies, and programs. The
          results should be quantified where possible (e.g., the number of units rehabilitated), but may
          be qualitative where necessary (e.g., mitigation of governmental constraints).
 2.       Compare what was projected or planned in the previous element to what was actually
          achieved. Analyze the significant differences between them. Determine where the previous
          housing element met, exceeded, or fell short of what was anticipated.
 3.       Based on the above analysis, describe how the goals, objectives, policies and programs in the
          updated element are being changed or adjusted to incorporate what has been learned from
          the results of the previous element.
 This chapter documents the City’s achievements under the 2009-14 Housing Element with respect
 to the actions and objectives contained in the Element and describes the relative success of the
 City’s efforts to implement the 2009-14 programs. It also contains recommendations for program
 changes to address current and projected needs and state requirements between 2009 and 2014.
 B.       SUMMARY OF ACHIEVEMENT
 Since the adoption of the last housing element update, the City of Williams implemented a number
 of actions to plan for, accommodate, and facilitate the construction, rehabilitation, and preservation
 of affordable housing. The accomplishments from this time are provided in Table 9.5-1. It
 identifies all residential units that have been approved and/or constructed to date in Williams that
 contribute to meeting the regional housing needs.

                   mobile homes installed within mobile home parks and manufactured houses built on lots.
                   Moderate and Above: The number is based on the number of building permits
                   issued for single-family dwellings since January 1, 2009. Moderate Income Houses were
                   newly constructed stick built single-family houses on separate lots.

 9.6      FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS STRATGEY
 A.       OVERVIEW
 This section of the Housing Element contains the City’s strategy for meeting housing needs. As
 required by State law, this chapter contains quantified (numerical) objectives for housing
 construction, housing rehabilitation, and the preservation of affordable housing, with a six-year
 program of actions that:
         Provides regulatory concessions and incentives and uses local, federal, and state financing
          and subsidy programs to support the development of affordable housing;
         Identifies adequate sites with appropriate zoning, development standards, services and
          facilities to encourage the development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels;
         Assists in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of low- and moderate-
          income households;
         Addresses and, where appropriate and legally possible, removes governmental constraints to
          the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing, including housing for all
          income levels and housing for persons with disabilities;
         Conserves and improves the condition of the existing affordable housing stock;
         Promotes housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex, marital
          status, ancestry, national origin, color, familial status, or disability; and
         Preserves assisted housing developments for lower-income households.
 Williams has traditionally provided a substantial amount of Colusa County’s affordable housing.
 The income of Williams residents is generally low, requiring a focus in housing strategy aimed at
 ensuring adequate provision of affordable housing. Rising housing prices have also significantly
 increased the number and percent of homeowners paying more than 30% of their incomes for
 housing, as well as a high number of mobile homes and rate of substandard housing. Although the
 City has accommodated residential development for all population segments through subsidies and
 other methods, its ability to meet future housing needs will be affected by environmental conditions
 and rising costs of water and sewer services from local providers.
 For these reasons, Williams housing strategy relies on reducing regulatory constraints, re-use of
 underutilized properties, improvement of existing housing stock, and promotion of mixed-use
 developments to meet future housing needs. The City also seeks to achieve a greater balance in
 housing development so that greater opportunities for market-rate housing are provided and
 affordable housing is integrated with market-rate units in new residential developments.
 To calculate the projected housing needs for extremely low-income households, the City assumed
 50% of its very low-income regional housing need are extremely low-income households. As a
 result, from the very low-income need of 69 units, the City has a projected need of 34 units for
 extremely low-income households. Many extremely low-income households will be seeking rental
 housing and most likely facing an overpayment, overcrowding or substandard housing condition.
 Some extremely low-income households could have disabilities, including those with developmental

 disabilities and other special needs. A summary of the City’s extremely low-income population is
 included in the Community Profile Section of the General Plan.

 Housing Element.
 B.       QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
 The purpose of this section is to establish quantified objectives to meet the City’s share of the
 Colusa County Regional Housing Need Allocation Plan (RHNP). It is important to recognize the
 quantified objectives do not represent a ceiling on development, but rather a target goal based on
 needs, resources, and constraints.
 The housing element process begins with the California Department of Housing and Community
 Development (HCD) allocating a region’s share of the statewide housing need to Colusa County and
 the two incorporated jurisdictions of Williams and Colusa through what is known as the Regional
 Housing Need Determination. This determination is based on Department of Finance population
 projections. The RHNP identifies the number of dwelling units, including the number of affordable
 dwelling units, by income group, that each jurisdiction in Colusa County must accommodate for
 between June 1, 2014 and June 30, 2019. According to the RHNP Plan, 307 new housing units are
 allocated to the City of Williams (Table 9.6-3). Approximately 39% of the City of Williams housing
 allocation, or 119 units, are intended to be developed at densities and prices affordable to very low-
 and low-income households.
 Williams’ Housing Element must demonstrate how it will accommodate the production of these
 units -- the City must show that there is adequate land properly zoned to accommodate its allocation
 of units and that barriers to the production of dwelling units are minimized or eliminated. The
City of Williams 2010-30 General Plan
Chapter 9, Housing Element                              96

 quantified objectives are shown below in Table 9-6. 3 and they are based on what is financially
 feasible. The City of Williams has established quantified (numerical) objectives for several program
 categories to provide measurable standards for monitoring and evaluating program achievements.
 The quantified objectives for the City’s share of Colusa County’s future housing needs and housing
 construction differ because the housing objective is based on the City’s estimate of the number
 homes that will actually be constructed, rehabilitated, etc. and affordable to each income group.
 The future housing needs objective addresses the City’s ability to accommodate housing based on
 the availability of appropriately zoned vacant and underutilized land, with public services and
 facilities. These homes may or may not be built depending on market trends and the availability of
 funding assistance to developers of affordable housing.
 The “New Construction” row represents the number of new housing units that potentially may be
 built using public and/or private sources. The “Rehabilitation” row represents the number of
 existing units expected to be rehabilitated. The Conservation of Rental Units row does not include
 any units of very-low income units at risk, since the only project anticipated to be at risk, Pinewood
 Manor, 25 units, does not expire until 2021. However, the City would expect that Pinewood Manor
 to be identified as units targeted for conservation in the next housing cycle.

 Quantified Objectives cover 2014-2019, based on anticipated market rate housing production (for moderate-and above
 moderate-income), availability of financial resources to assist in the construction of very low- and low-income housing, and the
 City’s past track record of producing affordable housing. Also assumes an annual population growth rate of 0.7% (refer to
 population projections.

                              PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROGRAM
 Public Participation (Additional information to be completed after final planning
 commission and City council approval of document)
 Public participation in preparation of the Housing Element is required under Government Code
 Section 65588(c). This housing element was developed through the combined efforts of City staff,
 the City's Planning Commission, the City Council, and the City's consultant. Public input was
 received through workshops conducted on October 21, 2013, September 22, 2014 and July 25, 2016
 with the Planning Commission. Public hearings for consideration of the Housing Element were
 conducted by the Planning Commission on August 22, 2016 and with the City Council on
 September 21, 2016. Notices were both e-mailed and sent through the U.S. mail to public agencies.
 Notices were published in the Colusa County Sun Herald. For the July 25, 2016 Workshop and the
 subsequent public hearings with the Planning Commission and City Council, notices and flyers were
 developed in both English and Spanish and a Spanish language interpreter was made available at
 these meetings. Flyers were also distributed to the library, post office and various businesses
 throughout Williams at least ten days before the meetings were held. In addition, organizations that
 represent the interests of low-income and special needs households, or are otherwise involved in the
 development of affordable housing, were consulted during the preparation of this element as
 specified above.
 To comply with Senate Bill 18, and Assembly Bill 52, the City consulted the Native American
 Heritage Commission and various Native American Tribes on the City’s list. No substantive
 comments were received by the contacted tribes.
 The draft Housing Element has been available in City Hall and was posted on the City’s website for
 review and comments. During various City Council/Planning Commission meetings, public
 comments were received. However, none of these people indicated concerns regarding housing
 issues. The only written comments received during this public outreach program were from
 California Rural Legal Assistance Inc. (CRLA). Responses to comments by the City were made to
 CRLA in the form of the staff report to the Planning Commission, which was also distributed to
 CRLA separately before the workshop.
 Details of the public participation process, including letters, notices and public agency information
 are referenced in the following pages of this Appendix.
 The City will actively engage the community in the progress of the housing element implementation,
 including specifically working with developers, service providers and other community interests to
 accomplish the various implementing programs.

                                                    Opportunities for future improvement of Old Highway 20, creating
                                                     new opportunities for increased regional mobility and economic

                                                     6th and 7th Streets stretching from the City limits on the north and
                                                     south, and particularly including the community’s gateways and key

                                                    Rehabilitation and reuse of empty downtown buildings along with
                                                     further expansion of downtown to retain it as the commercial center
                                                     and strengthen it as a local and regional destination;

                                                    Opportunity to expand the sphere of influence to protect the City’s
                                                     interests with respect to peripheral development.
                                             Given the above, the purpose of this chapter is to establish the necessary
                                             policy guidance that will enable the City to plan effectively for future growth
                                             and development, while keeping in mind the existing land use context. Sound
                                             and continuous planning is essential to ensure that Williams is not only
                 3.2

prepared for serving the anticipated infrastructure needs, but also preserving
and enhancing its community character. 2
The policies and guidance of this chapter, together with the Future Land Use
and Growth Plan, will aid the decisions of the Planning and Zoning
Commission and City Council. To ensure the outcomes envisioned and
expressed by this General Plan, it is important to follow the guiding
principles and policies set forth in this and the remaining elements of the
plan. Significant land use decisions may include those that affect the
boundaries of the corporate limits or sphere of influence, the consistency of
zone change requests with the land use plan (and corresponding zoning map),
requests for service or infrastructure extensions either outside of the City
limits or in an area not contemplated for development by this plan, review of
tentative maps, or amendments to the implementing regulations, among
many others.
Lastly, the purpose of this chapter is to fulfill the requirements of
the California Government Code, which requires “land use” among
the mandatory general plan elements.3 The law requires a land use
element that designates the general distribution, location, and extent
of the uses of land for housing, business, industry, open space
(including agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment
of scenic beauty), education, public buildings and grounds, solid and
liquid waste disposal facilities, and other public and private uses. The
element also must identify areas that are subject to flooding. Each of
these are addressed in this chapter.
Context and Environs
It is important to first understand the community context before
establishing a plan for the future. This section recognizes William’s
place and role in the larger region, together with the assets and                By way of its informal arrangement of larger lots
constraints of its natural and built environments. These are                     and small acreages that are intermixed with

THE REGION
The City of Williams is settled in the Sacramento Valley between the first
foothills of the Coast Range on the west and the Colusa Basin on the east. It
is a free-standing community, meaning that it surrounded by open,
agricultural lands with the nearest communities of Maxwell, Colusa, and
Arbuckle being eight miles north, 11 miles east, and 12 miles south,
respectively. The community has generally maintained a compact urban form
as development has mostly occurred in a contiguous manner. While
unincorporated South Williams has developed, to date, with a countryside

                                McCarl Ranch, and George Estates)4 continue a similar pattern to that of the
                                original town area. Each of the proposed developments is within or directly
                                abutting the City limits.
                                As the community grows during the 20-year horizon of this plan it will
                                become increasingly important for development to occur in a well-planned
                                and fiscally responsible manner. This is for the purposes of efficient
                                infrastructure and municipal service provision, continuity of the street and
                                pedestrian system, and preservation of small-town character and a well
                                defined community identity. Haphazard development would strain the City’s
                                fiscal resources and ability to provide utility services while deteriorating its
                                highly regarded small-town atmosphere. For this reason, the City must make
                                good and sound decisions regarding the pattern and timing of development,

DEVELOPMENT PATTERN
The pattern of development is oriented along the major corridors, including
mostly industrial and limited commercial development adjacent to I-5 and the
CFNR alignments downtown retail/office and public uses along 7th Street
both north and south of E Street, and street-oriented commercial uses along E
Street extending from 11th Street across I-5 to the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation
Canal. There are industrial and ag-industrial uses to the southeast along
Husted Road. The community is surrounded by agricultural lands. The
remaining areas of the community are residentially developed with mostly
single family detached dwellings, together with a few attached and multiple
family dwellings (including duplexes, senior living, migrant housing, and
apartments).
The developed pattern is broadly bound by Old Highway 20 on the north,
Husted Road on the east, Davis Road on the west, and Theatre Road (as
extended westward) on the south. The community is divided by the I-5 and
CFNR corridors, which act as barriers for both vehicular travel and
particularly, pedestrian foot-traffic. Old Highway 20 and the extents of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) floodplain create
significant barriers to the north, forming an artificial development boundary
for the foreseeable future. Although to a much lesser extent, E Street forms a
pedestrian barrier due to its relative traffic volumes and speeds. To date, the
Glenn-Colusa Irrigation Canal has formed an edge to development, although
development is expected in the forthcoming business park and a tentative
map has been received for the triangular area bound by the canal, E Street,
     4
and Husted Road. Lastly, portions of South Williams create a barrier to
development given the existing ownership and land use patterns. As
development occurs, it is important to acknowledge and plan
accordingly for these natural and artificial barriers, which,
together, define the areas that are most suitable for future
growth.
While the general patterns of use are fairly well defined by
the street and block system, there are many instances where
residential and nonresidential uses abut one another or are in
close proximity. Depending on the nature of the use and its
scale and intensity this may present a nuisance for the use of
lesser intensity. In these current situations, there is no form
of separation or buffering to protect against adjacent
incompatible uses. Since these uses must address one another
at certain locations, the means by which the abutting uses are       The treatment between adjacent incompatible

      (e.g. locations of building and parking, access, and service areas; lighting and
      noise standards, building height and scale limitations, etc.), bufferyard
      treatments, or through provisions of open space and separation.
      Land Use
      The City currently uses a conventional land use system whereby the land use
      designations relate to the general use of land and broad definitions of
      density/intensity. For instance, the designations include agricultural
      exclusive; rural residential; residential low and medium density; residential
      multi-family;        residential, professional; retail, heavy, and highway
      commercial; light and heavy manufacturing; open space; public use; and
      urban reserve. Similarly, the zoning ordinance is largely based on use types,
      such as residential one-family, two-family, and multiple-family. With a focus
      on the use of land there are few or no provisions in either the plan or
      development regulations that affect the character of development. (Refer
      below to “Character of the Built Environment” for a definition of character
      and an explanation of how it differs from land use.)
                    The existing land use inventory is displayed in Figure 2.12,
                    Existing Land Use, located in Chapter 2, Background Studies.
                    The land use designations relate to the use of property within
                    the City limits and SOI and, to the extent discernible, the
                    existing character of development. The existing land use
                    categories are described as follows:
                     Agriculture refers to the peripheral areas that are used for
                      agricultural purposes, where residences and farm buildings are
                      clearly an accessory to the principal farm operations. By their
                      purpose and nature the character of the agricultural areas is
                      rural.
                     Traditional residential describes the original town
                      neighborhoods. This area is uniquely defined because, while
                      the use is single family, its character is distinguishable and
                      wholly different from the more recently developed Nicolaus
                      Estates and Valley Ranch. As a result, this area must be
                      handled in a way that will preserve its character. (see Figure
                      3.1, Similar Uses in Different Character Settings on Page
                      3.7)
                     Auto-urban residential refers to the balance of the residential
                      areas, including Valley Ranch and Nicolas Estates. These
                      contemporary neighborhoods are patterned and characterized
                      by consistent lot frontages and building setbacks, a regular
                      pattern of driveways, greater proportions of floor area to lot
                      area, and a more uniform home design and scale.
                     Auto-urban residential, attached is used to describe
                      development such as the Valley West Care Center, Pinewood
                      Court, Pinewood Manor Apartments, Williams Migrant
  3.6

  Housing, and the duplexes along Virginia Way. Auto-urban areas are
  characterized by an auto orientation (e.g. a relative higher percentage of site
  imperviousness), higher density, reduced setbacks, and tighter spacing
  between units.
 Auto-urban commercial describes the retail and office uses along 6th and
  7th Streets and along E Street between 11th Street and Vann Street. These
  properties are oriented to the auto with expansive on-site parking and
  broader setbacks from the street frontage.
   Urban commercial refers to the immediate downtown area along 7th
    Street from just south of F Street north to D Street. It also extends west
    along E Street between 6th Street and 8th Street. These areas are urban in
    character by reason of their build-to frontage conditions, zero side yard
    setbacks, and enclosure of the street environment.
   Auto-urban industrial describes all the industrial properties by reason of
    their design to accommodate on-site parking and circulation, storage and
    display of materials and equipment, and outdoor activity areas.
   Public and semi-public uses include government and other public and
    semi-public uses such as City buildings (City Hall and Fire Station, Police
    Headquarters, and Public Works Department and Corporation Yard),
    buildings and facilities of the Williams Unified School District,
    Sacramento Valley Museum and Old Gym, and California Highway
    Patrol.

`
                                                   Parks and open space include the community’s parks and public open
                                                    spaces that are devoted to public use, including wetlands and storm

                                               Community character is a system for evaluating the features of development
                                               that both individually and collectively contribute to the micro-character of a
                                               neighborhood or district, and, in turn, influence the macro-character of the
                                               whole community. The components that distinguish the character of
                                               development include more than its land use (as depicted in Illustrative 1:
                                               Similar Uses in Different Character Settings), including the amount and use of

                                               As a land use system, community character goes beyond typical
                                               categorization of the functional use of land to account for the physical traits
                                               and design attributes that contribute to its “look and feel”. A character-based
                                               land use system focuses on development intensity, which encompasses the
                                               density and layout of residential development; the scale and form of non-
                                               residential development; and the amount of building and pavement coverage

                                               or landscaping. This applies both on individual development sites and across
                                               entire areas.

       VISION
       The land use vision is as follows:
       Williams will be a community noted for its good planning made evident by the
       quality and sustainability of development, preservation of open space, protection of its
       agricultural and environmental resources, and conservation of its original town area
       and neighborhoods. It has a wealth of housing choices settled in highly livable
       neighborhoods that are walkable, well connected, and accessible to community parks
       and trails. A revitalized downtown is the hub of civic pride and cultural and
       entertainment activities for residents and visitors alike. The economy is strong and
       stable through the City’s foresight in planning for its business and industrial
       expansion.
       Realization
       While the vision and policies will help guide land use decisions they are
       incomplete without a specific implementation framework. The purpose of
       this section is to translate the vision in the form of key recommended actions.
       Given the values and expectations of the community, these steps are advisable
       and necessary to preserve and enhance neighborhood character, revitalize
       downtown, improve corridor design, and achieve a quality community
       character.
       PRESERVING AND ENHANCING NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER
       Through community dialogue, residents voiced the importance of preserving
       the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods, while also providing
       for quality, livable neighborhood environments. In particular, the uniqueness
       of the original town neighborhoods warrants standards that permit new
       investment and reinvestment in ways that embrace its genuine, traditional
       character. In other words, building additions or infill construction must be
       cohesive in their scale and design so as not to disrupt the neighborhood
       fabric. At the same time, the vitality of the well established areas must be
       stabilized and strengthened to sustain their economic and cultural values. In
       the same way, structural alterations and use conversions must occur in a
       sensitive, compatible manner, or not occur at all. This may be handled
       through the development of applicable standards and then, effective
       administration and enforcement.
       There are notable differences in the character of the traditional and more
       contemporary neighborhoods. Both provide nice, livable environments that
       offer choice in neighborhood settings and home styles, sizes, prices, and
       amenities. With the impending growth that has the potential to greatly affect,
       if not transform, the future community character, the City has a window of
       opportunity to determine the type and quality of new development. This
       may be achieved through the general plan policies and more specifically, by
       new or revised standards of the zoning and land development ordinances.
       This is particularly important as the City
  3.10

is already considering tentative maps for 600 new lots.6 This equates to
approximately 2,220 new residents7, which is 48.4 percent of the additional
4,585 people expected in Williams by 2030. Therefore, without a proactive
stance the quality of development will be left to market decisions that may
not mirror the City’s expectations.
Among the considerations in the design of new neighborhoods is the
following:
 Their location relative to existing development. This relates to the
    continuity of the street and pedestrian system as means for achieving a
    walkable community environment, as well as the character transition and
    the means of compatibility within and between developments.
 The style and form of development, meaning the patterns and
    arrangement of streets and lots, the amount and treatment of open space,
    the mixture of uses and housing types, and the sizes and variations in lots
    and home sites.
 The layout of individual lots (widths and depths) and block frontages with
    respect to the placement and patterns of driveways, the location(s) of
    garages (front/side loaded, attached/detached, and street/alley access),
    handling of on- and off-street parking, and the setbacks and spacing
    between homes.
 The design of individual homes concerning their heights, rooflines, façade
    treatments, and mixture of material types.
 The aesthetic treatments relating to the street and pedestrian
    environments, common and private landscaping, design and materials of
    fences and screening walls, and the integration of amenities (parks, civic
    and open spaces, wetlands, trails and greenways, lakes, etc.)
While each of these contribute to the character and appearance of
neighborhoods, the standards for realizing them must be cognizant of market
conditions and therefore, be both suitable and reasonable for Williams. It is
the purpose of this plan to emphasize the community’s consensus for
realizing quality development, with the appropriate standards to be
determined during the plan implementation phase.
Policies
3.1. The integrity of the original town neighborhoods will be protected and
      enhanced through conservation measures and allowances for
      improvement and reinvestment.
3.2. Unique standards will be prepared for the original town neighborhoods
      to retain the existing patterns and forms of development and to avoid
      inappropriate infill development or use conversions.
6
   The tentative maps include: George Estates, McCarl Ranch, Mayberry Ranch,
Meadowlands
Subdivision, and Valley Ranch Unit 3.

`
       3.3. New neighborhood development standards will be created to ensure
            livable and sustainable living environments. Such standards will prevent
            monotony and promote innovation and quality. 6
       3.4. Neighborhood conservation standards will be used to ensure a
            conforming status of all existing neighborhoods and to regulate new
            construction or property improvements in a manner consistent with the
            existing character.
       3.5.     New development that occurs within or immediately adjacent to the
                boundaries of the Traditional Residential land use district must be
                cohesive in their design and suitably transitioned.
       3.6.     Any structural alterations of use conversions within any
                neighborhood must be consistent with the intent of the
                neighborhood conservation standards.
                     3.7.    The City will continue to facilitate developments that
                             offer a variety of living options and environments
                             provided they contribute positively to the intended
                             community character.
                     3.8.    Existing neighborhoods will be stabilized through
                             proactive code enforcement and strengthened through
                             neighborhood planning and empowerment.
                     3.9.    The quality of infrastructure within the well established
                             neighborhoods will be improved through capital
                             reinvestment projects.
                     3.10    The City will encourage higher density housing
                             developments that provide affordable housing
                             opportunities to the community.
       Actions
       3.a.     Adopt and incorporate into the zoning ordinance a neighborhood
                conservation district for the area delineated in Figure 2.2, Existing
                Land Use, as Traditional Residential. The purpose of this district is to
                set standards for redevelopment, new development, and expansion of
                existing single family homes such that they embody the unique
                characteristics of the neighborhood. Within the district would be
                subdistricts to account for the districts and standards at the time of
                development, with noted allowances that are acceptable within the
                character context. This district would alleviate the need for variances
                as all properties would remain conforming.
       3.b.     Amend the standards of the residential districts to include an average
                rather than minimum lot size. This allows variability in the lot
                frontages resulting in different home sizes, floor plans and price
                ranges.
       3.c.     Adopt and integrate into the zoning ordinance anti-monotony
                standards requiring sufficient variability in the design of individual
                homes within a specified distance of one another. The standards
  3.12
         would provide for variations in roof lines, façade treatments, and
         building materials.
3.d.     Adjust the setbacks in the residential districts according to its
         character narrowing setbacks in the Urban Residential district and
         increasing them in the Auto-Urban Residential and Suburban
         Residential districts. Furthermore, require variations in the front
         setbacks to create a more interesting street environment.
3.e.     Embed floor area ratios (FAR) within the housing palette to better
         control the scale and spacing of homes commensurate with the
         intended character.
3.f.     Prepare a neighborhood improvement plan for the original town
         neighborhoods to organize and coordinate with neighborhood
         representatives to identify improvement projects, regulatory
         adjustments, enforcement targets, and needed amenities. The plan
         should be backed by grants and seed funding for individual property
         improvements and a capital budget for street, sidewalk, utility,
         drainage, lighting, and park projects.
3.g.     Adopt and incorporate into the zoning ordinance a Residential
         Urban High Density Zoning District that provides minimum density
         standards of 16 units per acre to provide more affordable housing
         opportunities, particularly for low and very low income families and
         to meet the State’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation.
3.h.     Adopt and incorporate into the zoning ordinance facilitated
         processing of affordable and emergency housing developments for
         low, very low and extremely low income families.
DOWNTOWN REVITALIZATION
Among the first commercial buildings constructed in Williams were those
adjacent to the railroad and in Downtown. By reason of the times, before the
emergence of the auto and the resulting transformation of contemporary
development patterns, buildings were constructed in a dense pattern with
their fronts addressing the street and abutting one another to each side. The
town’s center of commerce was immediately flanked by plots of home sites.
What was then a matter of necessity, or even convenience, may now serve as
a defining principle to guide how Williams develops in the coming years. This
is to say that downtown may – and should – continue as the heart of the
City; a focal point for civic functions and institutions, local and niche
businesses, and culture and entertainment. However, as the community
grows and faces development pressure along I-5 and on its fringes, the City
must be both deliberate and resolute in its commitment to preserve the
character and economic vitality of downtown.
Downtown has done well to maintain its identity. It is strategically located
and immediately accessible to the interstate. While there are needed
improvements to infill vacant parcels, rehabilitate and reuse empty buildings,
and better define the limits of the downtown district, it has maintained its
                                                                               3.13

`
       historic, small-town genuineness. Preserving this special character will be vital
       as the community initiates the redevelopment process. Doing so warrants a
       downtown master plan as a guiding policy and strategy document that is
       complimented by a robust implementation framework outlining public
       investments, private redevelopment projects, and a realistic financing plan.
       To preserve the urban character of downtown a new zoning district is
       warranted. Presently, downtown is guided by the same uses and height and
       area regulations as the commercial frontage on E Street. The character of
       these areas is much different, and must remain so if downtown is to maintain
       is urban fabric. As is, some of the permitted uses are not suitable to
       downtown and the minimum setbacks may conflict with the intended urban
       form.
       Redevelopment is ordinarily facilitated by public action. The City’s initiative
       of the recent blight study is a positive first step toward establishing a
       redevelopment district. Such district will allow increased authority through a
       non-profit downtown development entity to acquire and assemble properties,
       solicit developer interest in private or public-private investment projects,
       initiate public improvements, and aid business and property owners in
       business development, expansion, and entrepreneurship. There are many ripe
       properties for both redevelopment and new development in and immediately
       adjacent to downtown. However, these must happen in the context of a
       broader downtown master plan if it is to reach its economic potential.
       Policies
       3.11.    Preserve the cultural significance of downtown through development
                and employment of design guidelines for alterations to existing
                buildings. Utilize the guidelines also to ensure the architectural
                appropriateness of newly constructed buildings.
       3.12.    Retain the urban character of the existing buildings along 7th and 8   th
                Streets and establish new standards to guide new development to
                occur in an urban context.
       3.13.    Downtown will be the center of the City’s public and civic life by
                retaining its important public institutions, such as the library and
                City Hall, and by adding new ones that will strengthen its vitality
                over time. The City will consider the impact of new commercial
                development on the competitiveness and economic vitality of
                downtown.

Actions
3.i.    Amend the zoning ordinance to include a new Downtown district.
        This district is necessary by reason of the unique, urban character and
        its intended use and building types. The standards shall include:
        • Zero front and side yard setbacks to preserve the existing block
             frontage and to re-establish it in other areas of the district.
        • A minimum rather than maximum building height to create two
             (or more) story buildings. This encloses the street and reinforces
             the urban fabric. Given market conditions, two-story buildings
             shall accommodate upper floor office and residential uses.
        • Uses that are suitable within a downtown environment and
             include those with building typologies that contribute to an
             urban context and pedestrian orientation.
        • Provisions for on-street and common (public and/or private)
             parking, including allowance for first floor (under building)
             parking, particularly for retirement housing.
        • Building design standards to embrace a pedestrian streetscape
             environment, with distinction between floors and fenestration of
             doors and windows.
3.j.    Amend the zoning map to delineate the boundaries of a Downtown
        district, as exhibited in Map 3.1, Downtown District.
3.k.    Amend Chapter 17.11, Signs, to create a new section for “Signs in the
        Downtown District.” The permitted signs in this district shall
        include projecting signs and provisions for awning, overhang, and
        window signage. The allowances and limitations regarding sign area
        shall be modified according to the urban context.
3.l.    Revise the purpose statement of the C-2 district to clearly distinguish
        its intent from that of the downtown district. Generally, this district
        is intended for larger-scale, independent sites and centers that are
        appropriate along I-5 and other defined corridors.
3.m.    Prepare a downtown master plan to guide the strategies and
        improvement projects necessary to support the formation of a
        redevelopment district. The master plan shall entail the type and
        character of future land use, specific use and building types, street and
                                                                                  3.15

                                            general financing plan.
                                   3.n.     Coordinated with the master plan, conduct an infrastructure
                                            assessment and prepare a capital improvement plan. The purpose of
                                            this plan is to outline the phasing and timing of capital infrastructure

                                   appearance and revitalization of the properties and businesses at the gateways
                                   and along the City’s major arteries. The highly visible I-5 frontage is of
                                   essential importance to cast a positive image in the eyes of passers-by.
                                   Fortunately, much of this corridor frontage is yet to be developed yielding
                                   opportunity to better define the character and quality appearance of new
               3.16

development. Also, the interchanges at E Street and Old Highway 20, and to
a lesser extent at Husted Road, are the community’s front doors, followed by
the entrance corridors along North and South 7th Street and other points of
access to the community.
The City has a significant near-term opportunity to enhance its appearance
along I-5, including the type and quality of development in the new business
park, and long the commercial frontage of Valley Ranch. The appearance of
these developments will signal the City’s values and expectations for its
community character. This will relate to the types of uses permitted and the
site and building design of new development. Existing uses along this frontage
(and elsewhere) may also be enhanced over time with improved standards,
proactive code enforcement, and both public and private investment.
Development fronting on E Street and 7th Street outside of downtown is of an
auto-urban character. This is due to their auto-orientation whereby parking
covers as much or more than 50 percent of the site. This is largely due to the
nature of uses, but also responsible is the use of minimum front yard setbacks
in the C-1, C-2, and C-H zoning districts. Given the need and requirements
for parking, the building placement is left to the individual site design, which
commonly exceeds the minimum front setback. Instead, site design should be
controlled by the intended character of development, with more deliberate
and explicit standards.
Perhaps the greatest challenge confronting the community is the
types of uses and the development standards (or lack thereof) of
the properties along North and South 6th Street and 7th Street.
These corridors have developed with a mix of commercial and
industrial uses of varying intensities. Outdoor display and storage
is visually prevalent and the conditions of the buildings and
grounds are “tired”, if not blighted. This circumstance requires a
long-term strategy, together with both short and mid-term
regulatory changes, an advocacy program for code enforcement,
and improvement plans. The City may choose to be passive or
proactive with the outcomes weighing on the approach taken.

                                                district shall cover all or at least the frontage of I-5 and E Street (east
                                                of I-5) for the City’s new business park development. The standards
                                                of this district shall include improved site and building standards, an
                                                increased landscape surface ratio, better landscaping and screening
                                                requirements, and new signage standards to result in a campus-like

                                                standard. This district would include better standards to compliment
                                                and to be compatible with adjacent neighborhoods. Standards would

                                                City shall acquire landscape easements from the adjacent property
                                                owners and through the course of new development.
                                        3.y.    Acquire easements at the I-5/Old Highway 20 and Husted Road

                                        3.z.    Prepare a corridor revitalization plan for 7th Street, extending from
                                                Old Highway 20 to the south City limits (excluding the segment
                                                with the downtown district). The plan shall document the physical
  Public streetscape enhancements               elements that contribute to its appearance (including use types and

      development standards for which compliance would be required
      either at the time of an occupancy change , a building permit, or in
      given time increments.
3.aa. Prepare an overlay district with new use and site development
      standards for the properties on either side of 6th Street and 7th Street
      and extending a distance of 150 feet or more.
3.bb. Amend the zoning ordinance to consolidate the C-2 and C-H districts
      into a new Auto-Urban Commercial district and develop design
      standards and guidelines for new development in these areas. This
      district shall include the following:
      • Site design standards requiring parking to the side and rear of
           buildings (rather than in front). On sites where this is infeasible
           by way of its size or orientation the standards shall include a
           broader streetscape bufferyard with increased landscaping and
           parking lot landscaping.
      • A built-to-line (in place of a minimum setback).
      • Increased side and rear setbacks and bufferyard standards to
           separate and screen adjacent properties.
      • Building design standards relating to building scale and
           articulation, façade and roofline standards, and building
           orientation.
      • A minimum landscape surface ratio.
3.cc. Establish landscaping standards to compliment and replace those
      outlined in Section 17.13.110, Off-Street parking – Landscaping. The
      new standards shall include provisions for the following:
      •      Street trees adjacent to all street right-of-way, based on a ratio
             of trees per linear feet of frontage (typically one shade tree per
             25 or 30 feet of frontage).
      •      On-lot landscaping requiring trees (deciduous and evergreen)
             and shrubs within the side and rear setbacks and other required
             on-site green spaces.
      •      Screening in the form of shrubs and/or earthern berms
             adjacent to all parking and vehicular use areas.
      •      Landscaping within parking lots that is based on a ratio of
             islands per parking spaces, instead of five percent of the
             interior of a parking lot as now required. This will allow a
                                                                                3.19

                        area.
       3.dd.     Amend Chapter 17.108, Design Review, and develop design
                 standards and guidelines, to include more definitive and explicit
                 standards relating to the height and scale of buildings adjacent to
                 residential areas, architectural forms and details, solar panel
                 installations, outdoor lighting levels and dark-sky provisions,
                 building and neighborhood monotony, building shapes and materials,
                 and landscaping, screening, and fencing.

       The term “land use” literally relates to the use of land. However, it is the
       design of individual uses, districts, and neighborhoods that influence the
       “look and feel” (character) of development. Therefore, the character of an
       area is more distinctly defined by the intensity of development, the
       arrangement of buildings and parking areas, the preservation and use of open
       space, and other site and building design features.
       It is a combination of land use and design that determine the compatibility
       and quality of development. Aesthetic enhancements, such as attention to
       building detail, abundant landscaping and screening, sign control, and site
       amenities, also contribute to the appeal of a neighborhood or commercial
       area. It is each of these considerations that are collectively responsible for
       William’s character and the impressions left on visitors and passers-by.
       Mixing character types is usually disruptive. For instance, constructing a
       standalone store or office building with on-site parking in the midst of a
       downtown block may
       damage the fabric of that block by breaking the storefront façade and creating
       an undesirable gap for pedestrians. Conversely, siting a larger brick home
       amidst the traditional, original town neighborhood may disrupt the
       uniqueness and disturb the
        character of the area. Plans, policies, and regulations must be mindful of the
       context in which development or redevelopment occurs.
       The City’s current land use plan and zoning ordinance are both based on the
       use of land, without any provisions that relate to their character. The City’s
       design review standards address compatibility broadly and aesthetics very
       generally, without much substantive detail. Instead, site design is left to very
       broad standards of the respective zoning district. By way of example, the
       minimum lot area, width, and minimum yards are the same in the C-2 district
       as those in the C-1 district, even though the intent of these districts is much
       different. Furthermore, there is overlap in the permitted uses of the two
       districts without any differentiation in scale or site design.

As the City approaches its expected future
development it must be acknowledged
that this is the time and opportunity to be
more      intentional     as    to    quality
development outcomes. For this reason,
this land use element is based on a
community character land use system,
which translates to an equivalent zoning
structure. This will allow the community          A character based system differs from the City’s current use-based system in
to be deliberate as to the type, pattern,         that each of the above development may be permitted in the same district.
                                                  A use-based land use and zoning system would require each of these to be in
and character of future development. (see         separate districts even though their relative densities and impacts are the
Figure 3.3, The Rationale of Character-           same.
Based Land Use Districts)
Policies
3.27.    The land use plan and zoning districts will address for the character
         of development, which accounts for the design/intensity of
         development, the arrangement of buildings and parking areas, and
         the preservation of open space.
3.28.    The design review standards will be revised and a design manual will
         be created to better define and illustrate explicit site and building
         standards.
3.29.    The character of existing areas will be protected by requiring
         development of a compatible character or adequately transitioning
         and buffering areas of different character.
3.30.    Specific plans shall express the site and building design standards of
         the subject development through design illustrations and/or a pattern
         book.
3.31.    The uses and height and area standards of each zoning district will
         differ according to its intended character.
Actions
3.ee.    Rewrite the zoning ordinance to replace the current districts with
         those based on development character. These districts are reconciled
         with the Future Land Use and Growth Plan and include those
         exhibited in Table 3.2, Land Use Districts, and described below in the
         section entitled, “Future Land Use and Growth Plan”.
3.ff.    Integrate a housing palette into the zoning ordinance. The palette
         provides for different housing types and establishes the dimensional
         standards for each. This is applicable within the planned development
         option of the Suburban Residential and Urban Residential districts.
         In these districts, different variations or combinations of housing is
         permitted, which is balanced by a proportional amount of open
         space. Additionally, each district has a maximum allowed density to
         control the character, together with other performance standards
         (e.g. bufferyards). The standards of the palette control the scale and
                                                                                                               3.21

`
               spacing of dwelling units, which is essential to preserve the intended
               character.
       3.gg.   Add provisions to the zoning ordinance for bufferyards. Different
               from the conventional means of screening adjacent uses, bufferyards
               vary according to the context of adjacent uses. The standards are
               based on a relative opacity, which may be met through combinations
               of buffer width, plant type and density, and structural elements
               (fences and earthen berms).
       3.hh.   Establish minimum open space standards within each district, which
               may be used for storm water detention, resource protection (e.g.
               riparian buffers along streams), bufferyards, and/or parks, trails, and
               open space. The amount of private or common open space relates to
               the character of development. For instance, in the Agriculture and
               Estate Residential districts, there is a high proportion of private open
               space whereas the Suburban Residential and Urban Residential
               districts have increasing percentages of common (public or semi-
               public) open space.
       3.ii.   Adopt scale standards to better manage the character of development.
               For instance, scale is a controlling factor in the Suburban
               Commercial district to ensure compatibility with adjacent or nearby
               neighborhoods. This is particularly important given similar use types
               between this and the more intensive Auto-Urban Commercial
               district. The scale standards shall include a floor area ratio as well as a
               maximum square footage and height.
       3.jj.   Incorporate development options within each zoning district.
               Different lot sizes and percentages of open space maintain the district
               character while allowing market flexibility and adjustment to site
               conditions. In other words, a smaller lot may be used and clustered to
               set aside adequate open space to preserve agricultural resources, such
               as the orchards, or to fulfill the City’s storm water management
               objectives. A comparable density and character is achieved.
       3.kk.   Utilize density bonuses as an incentive for promoting open space
               preservation, more efficient, clustered development, and housing
               choice.
       3.ll.   Establish and maintain a Design Manual that includes development
               standards and guidelines that defines and illustrates the City’s design
               expectations for new development and signage.
       Future Land Use and Growth Plan
       The Future Land Use and Growth Plan is an important planning tool for the
       City to manage the type, pattern, and scale of future development, as well as
       the location and timing of annexation and sphere of influence adjustments.
       The plan is to be used to guide decisions relating to zone change requests and
       annexations and sphere of influence adjustments. The plan will also be used
       to determine the requisite transportation improvements (through any
       necessary amendments of the Citywide Circulation Study), together with the
  3.22

capacity requirements for the water and wastewater systems and other public
facility and service provisions.
The land use designations reflected on the plan directly correspond with the
districts of the new zoning ordinance. In this way, the intended character of
development that is expressed by this plan will be directly implemented by
the zoning ordinance. This assures quality, sustainable development that is
compatible with the existing adjacent uses.
Through the course of General Plan development, three alternative scenarios
were analyzed relative to different assumptions of population growth. These
scenarios are shown in Map 3.2, Scenario A – Low Growth; Map 3.3,
Scenario B – Moderate Growth; and Map 3.4, Scenario 3 – High Growth.
The alternatives delineate the future land use and character of development
and the planned future growth areas within the City limits and a part of the
sphere of influence that is planned to accommodate future development.
Scenario B – Moderate Growth, was chosen as the preferred land use and
growth plan, which subsequently, was amended to account for community
input. The outcome of this scenario planning exercise is Map 3.5, Future
Land Use and Growth Plan, which is the basis of this plan and the requisite
provision of facilities and infrastructure.
  Figure 3.5, Alternative Development
  An alternative would utilize different lot sizes and housing types to maintain an equivalent density while
  setting aside open space to preserve rows of existing orchards and to provide for on-site detention. The
  latter is more sustainable as it promotes urban agriculture, provides housing choice, and offers amenities.
                                                                                                         3.23

`
       The land use scenarios relate to the use of land (e.g. residential, commercial,
       industrial), but also reflect the intended character of development. This
       approach observes the use of land with an added focus on the relative
       relationship among the land areas that are used for buildings, landscaping, and
       vehicular use areas. Rather than emphasizing the separation of uses into
       different districts, a character based system relies upon a mix of open space
       and intensity controls to ensure that development within each district has a
       predictable character. In this way, by using these measurable controls, a site
       may accommodate different types of housing or forms of development while
       preserving the intended character (see inset for more information). This will
       help William’s meet its requisite housing requirements, protect against
       monotonous subdivisions (versus neighborhoods), and achieve desirable
       outcomes.
       The plan is based on the following assumptions:
       • A Year 2030 population of 9,822 persons, reflecting an increase of 4,535
            persons or 186 percent over the 2009 estimate of 5,287 persons.
       • An average number of persons per household of 3.7 persons, consistent
            with the 2000 U.S. Census.8
       • Assumed density ranges and average densities as follows:
       District                                 Density Range            Average Density
       Agriculture                   0.00 to 0.08              0.08
       Estate Residential            0.35 to 0.50              0.43
       Suburban Residential          1.35 to 3.25              2.13
       Urban Residential             4.17 to 5.009             3.48
       Urban Residential
       High Density                  Min. 16.00                16.00+
       The acreages of land use types and corresponding populations for the
       preferred scenario are shown in Table 3.1, District Acreages and
       Corresponding Populations, as shown on the next page:
       8
         This varies from the population density factor of 3.03 persons per residential dwelling
       unit used in Chapter 16.36, Parks and Recreation Facilities Dedication/Fee. Final
       determination of this factor is yet to occur.
       9
          The density for multiple-family is excluded from the average density of the Urban
       Residential district so as not to unreasonably skew the average upward. The added
       population resulting from multiple family development is accounted for in the Downtown
       district.

Land Use Designations
The land use designations reflected in Map 3.5, Future Land Use and
Growth Plan are further detailed on the next page in Table 3.2, Land Use
Districts. The table reflects the districts and the allowable development types
within each district, together with the lot sizes, percentages of open space,
and densities for the residential districts; and the heights, percentage of green
space, and floor area ratios for the nonresidential districts. A description of
the individual districts, how they relate to existing development, and the
purpose of each district is described below.
Agriculture – The character of the surrounding rural area is dominated by
         agricultural fields, pasturelands, and orchards, where homes are
         customarily an accessory to the principal agricultural use. The
         landscape is accented by a few farmsteads, outbuildings, and mostly an
         unbroken, flat horizon leading westward to the mountain range and
         state game refuge.
         The purpose of the Agriculture district is to preserve the rural,
         agricultural character and by doing so, managing a contiguous and
         efficient pattern of urban development. This also helps to preserve a
         definitive edge to the community and protect its freestanding state. To
         achieve the intended rural character, the district is designed with 90
         percent open space and a one acre minimum lot size. Any residential
         development would be clustered to maintain an open viewshed. This
         preserves agricultural productivity and minimizes land use conflicts.
                                                                                                                                     3.25

                                   Estate Residential – South Williams resembles an estate residential character
                                        by reason of its larger lots and small acreages, together with intermixed
                                        expanses of open space in the form of pastures and orchards. The result of
                                        this pattern is a visual openness. Due to larger tracts and an increased
                                        separation between properties the buildings are visually apparent yet
                                        secondary to the open landscape.
                                        The purpose of the Estate Residential district is to provide a rural lifestyle
                                        within a municipal setting and with access to public utilities. The existing
                                        large lot development is informal, meaning that it has occurred on an
                                        individual lot basis rather than within an estate development. The district
                                        allows 2.5 acre single family tracts, which is a common size among what
                                        presently exists. A minimum 10 percent open space is required with an
                                        estate development for storm drainage, buffering, and recreation
                                        purposes. Alternatively, and particularly where development occurs
                                        proximate to an established orchard, a clustered development of one acre
                                        lots and 35 percent open space is also permitted. Clustered would offer a
  3.26

     43 percent density bonus while also preserving open space and the natural
     landscape.
Suburban Residential – The distinguishing factors of the Suburban
     Residential character is increased open space, both on larger individual
     home sites or cumulatively throughout a development, together with
     preserved open space within and between buildings and developments.
     Open space and vegetative cover are essential for creating a balance
     between building mass and “green mass”. Suburban development may be
     in the form of small acreages or large lots, or clustered around common
     open space.
     The Suburban Residential district affords three development types. A
     single family development may have near half-acre, 20,000 square foot
     lots with 15 percent open space. The use of 10,000 square foot clustered
     single family lots with 35 percent open space offers a 33 percent density
     bonus. An additional 81 percent bonus is afforded for a planned
     development, which requires a minimum open space 50 percent. This
     development type is suitable to accommodate regional storm drainage
     improvements, to preserve established orchards or agricultural
     operations, or simply to integrate passive open space and/or recreational
     facilities. A planned development would require more than one housing
     type to achieve maximum densities.
Urban Residential – An urban residential character is reflective of the City’s
     more recent neighborhoods, particularly including Valley Ranch and
     Nicolaus Estates. These developments are characterized by smaller lots,
     reduced dimensions around and between homes, and high building
     coverage and impervious ratios. Developments of this character type are
     usually highly patterned, meaning that they have uniform setbacks and
     similar building mass and scale. The home orientation and garage access
     are also near identical from lot-to-lot.
     The Urban Residential district includes four development types ranging
     from single to multiple-family with options for clustered and planned
     development. As the lot size decreases the density correspondingly
     increases, with increasing percentages of open space to preserve the
     intended character. The single family development type includes 6,000
     square foot lots, similar to the current single- and two-family zoning
     districts.10 It requires 15 percent open space, which will accommodate the
     City’s park and recreation facilities dedication requirement, together with
     provisions for bufferyards within and between adjacent developments.11
     A cluster development may reduce the average lot size to 4,000 square
     feet per dwelling unit with 25 percent open space allowing a 14 percent
     density bonus. A planned development with a variety of dwelling unit
10
   This includes the Residential One Family (R-1) and Residential Two Family (R-2)
districts.

                                                                                   3.27

`
           types and hence, an average lot size of 2,500 square feet per unit requires
           35 percent open space. A two-story multiple family development requires
           a comparable 2,500 square feet per dwelling unit and a minimum 45
           percent open space, which accommodates common open space and
           provisions for adequate bufferyards.
       Urban Residential High Density (R-U-HD) – Located in either the Urban
           Residential or the Neighborhood Conservation neighborhoods, this
           district encompasses five lots of approximately 30 acres, intended to
           provide more intense higher density residential development of at least 16
           units per acre and give more opportunity to provide for the City’s
           affordable housing needs for low and very low income families. Unlike
           the other districts, this district will have its own set of structured
           development standards more conventionally structured in the Zoning
           Ordinance.
       Neighborhood Conservation – The Neighborhood Conservation district
           envelopes all existing neighborhoods, plus those for which a tentative
           map has been submitted to the City. The purpose of this district is to
           establish unique standards that match the circumstances at the time of
           development and presently. It also prevents creation of nonconforming
           uses and situations caused by the application of new or different
           standards. Essentially, standards may then be established that are
           commensurate with the built environment, including certain allowances
           and waivers to allow building additions and improvements.
           There are no standards outlined for this district in Table 3.2, Land Use
           Districts, above. These standards will be written concurrently with the
           zoning ordinance rewrite.
       Suburban Commercial – The Suburban Commercial district is for office,
           retail, and related businesses that are in close proximity to low density
           neighborhoods or in areas of the community for which aesthetics and
           design are important. This district is for single or multi-tenant buildings
           that are limited to 15,000 square feet in scale. The purpose of this
           limitation is to reflect a building scale that, through good building and
           site design, may be cohesive with the adjacent uses. In particular, this
           district is differentiated by its scale, together with heightened building
           and site design standards.
           As exhibited in Table 3.2, Land Use Districts, development is limited to
           one story with 15 percent green space. The different in floor area
           between retail and office uses is due to their relative parking
           requirements. The floor area ratio is less than that of the Commercial
           district so that these sites are more residential in character.
       Commercial – The Commercial district is for office, retail, and related
           businesses outside of the defined Downtown district. These commercial
           districts include single or multi-tenant buildings on individual sites,
  3.28

   which are characterized by on-site parking. Their character will be
   differentiated by way of scale limitations and design and siting standards.
   For instance, in the context of an abutting neighborhood, a commercial
   development would be limited in building mass and height, together with
   other performance and site design standards (e.g. access, circulation,
   parking and loading, lighting, noise, etc.) to ensure compatibility.
   The development types include one and two-story buildings, with the
   difference in floor areas attributable to building height and required
   parking. The percentage of green space is increased for offices and two-
   story buildings to accommodate public space and buffering from adjacent
   uses.
Downtown – The Downtown district is for the immediate downtown core
   along Seventh Street south of E Street, as well as on both sides of E Street
   stretching from Sixth Street to Eighth Street. Downtown is intended to
   have an urban character, which is a result of building enclosure due to
   narrow or no setbacks, preferably a minimum two-story building height,
   high building coverage and floor area ratios, and on-street or off-site
   parking.
   Downtown is intended for commercial office and retail uses, as well as
   high density residential use. The floor area ratios are calibrated for
   (minimum) two to four story buildings, which may be for any individual
   use or a mixture of allowable uses. A floor area ratio is used in place of
   density to allow maximum flexibility as to residential unit size thereby
   accommodating both small and large units. The two residential
   development types allow for on-site parking beneath the structure for
   elderly housing and off-site parking for all other residential unit types. A
   higher percentage of green space is required for elderly housing to
   accommodate outdoor space (e.g. gardens, plazas, etc.). The mixed use
   arrangement may include any combination of uses with provision for on-
   and off-street parking.
Business Park – The Business Park district is intended for the Valley Ranch
   nonresidential development, as well as other highly visible areas with I-5
   frontage. The purpose of this district is to result in a planned
   environment with a higher standard of development. It may include uses
   that are traditionally designated as “light” industrial including offices and
   warehousing where operational activities occur mostly indoors, or where
   provisions are made for a heightened appearance and quality development
   standard.
   The Business Park district allows up to three-story buildings with 20
   percent set-aside for common green space. A higher percentage of green
   space is to create a campus-like setting with ample land for public space,
   landscaping, and buffering between sites and around the perimeter of the
   development. A floor area ratio of 0.88 would allow a building of
   approximately 172,500 square feet on a 4.5 acre site, for instance.
                                                                                 3.29

`
       Industrial – This land use designation is to accommodate larger-scale and/or
           more intensive industrial uses, which may include manufacturing uses
           and those with outdoor operations and storage. This will accommodate
           the existing uses along the railroad as well as the long-standing industrial
           area in Southeast Williams.
           This district is designed to accommodate a broad assortment of a one-
           story industrial developments. A minimum 10 percent green space is to
           allow adequate provision for perimeter bufferyard treatments. Bufferyard
           and other site design standards will be established dependent upon
           visibility and proximity.
       Land Use Policies
       The following policies may be used to guide the implementation of the
       Future Land Use and Growth Plan.
       Growth Pattern
       3.32.    The City will grow contiguously to manage the efficiency of public
                services and municipal infrastructure provision, to maintain a
                compact and well defined community form, and to oblige its fiscal
                responsibility.
       3.33.    During its annual budget process, the City Council will strike a balance
                between 1) extending infrastructure to facilitate redevelopment of
                blighted structures or properties, 2) facilitating infill development of
                vacant parcels, and 3) improving services to developed sites.
       3.34.    Development will occur first within the existing corporate limits
                where the infrastructure and services are readily available.
       3.35.    Annexation will occur in strict adherence with the Future Land Use
                and Growth Plan. Requests for annexation in areas not shown in this
                plan will warrant further study, a showing of cause to support the
                request, and require a general plan amendment.
       3.36.    The sphere of influence will be expanded soon after General Plan
                adoption for the expansion of the corporate limits to exert influence
                and protect the City’s long-term planning interests.
       Service Provision
       3.37.    Decisions to provide municipal infrastructure and public services will
                include, among others, the location of subject development relative
                to:
                • existing development; and
                • the area of existing utility service; and
                • the City limits; and
                • existing sphere of influence.
       3.38.    Development or individual uses outside the corporate limits will not
                be prematurely provided municipal infrastructure until annexation is
                warranted and executed, subject to conformance with the Future
  3.30

       Land Use and Growth Plan. Services will be provided to these areas
       through mutual aid and other agreements and mandates.
3.39.  Development and future annexation will occur in areas that are most
       suitable for the extension of services and infrastructure, e.g.
       proximity and capacity of roads and utilities, fire and police response
       sites, etc.
3.40.  Infrastructure and public services will be brought to a sufficient,
       quality standard within the developed area, requisite with needs.
3.41.  The City’s land use pattern shall focus new development and
       significant redevelopment where adequate public services and utility
       capacity are already in place or projected for improvement, including
       streets, water, wastewater, and drainage infrastructure.
3.42.  Adequate public facilities and services are required concurrent with
       annexation and development.
Environmental Sensitivity, Resource Protection, and Flood Prevention
3.43.  Future development and redevelopment shall be planned and
       implemented with appreciation for the physical environment and
       natural features of the community and with recognition of potential
       physical constraints to ensure appropriate siting of various types of
       development.
3.44.  Development will occur in a manner that is compatible with the
       existing agricultural resources, including agricultural cropland,
       orchards, and ranchlands).
3.45.  Sensitive resources, including floodplains, wetlands, riparian buffer
       areas along stream channels, and valued view sheds, will be protected
       and preserved.
3.46.  The agricultural use and rural character of the City’s perimeter shall
       be maintained through the strict enforcement of zoning, as
       applicable, and influence exerted by the City within its sphere of
       influence.
3.47.  Agricultural resources will be observed so as not to unnecessarily
       encroach upon their operations or create nuisance conditions.
3.48.  Resources will be protected and integrated as amenities into
       development.
3.49. The City will identify and annually review areas subject to flooding
       within its City Limits and Sphere of Influence.
3.50. The City will consider the location of natural resources to be used
       for groundwater recharge and stormwater management.
Conservation and Compatibility
3.51.  The original town neighborhoods will be conserved through
       regulatory provisions and proactive planning measures.
3.52.  New development will be compatible with existing and well
       established neighborhoods through appropriate use and design
       transitioning and cohesive types and patterns of development.
                                                                               3.31

`
       3.53.   Development patterns shall provide for transitions and buffering
               between various land use intensities. Where land uses of incompatible
               intensities abut, there shall be adequate bufferyards to separate them.
       3.54.   The overall development pattern will transition from urban to
               suburban to rural with increased distance from the City center.
       3.55.   The traditional street and lot pattern will be respected in the design
               of new areas adjacent to the original town area.
       3.56.   Potential adverse impacts on adjacent land use types shall be
               considered in the City’s development review process (including
               factors such as noise, odor, pollution, excessive light, traffic, etc.).
       3.57.   New development or redevelopment on “in-fill” parcels in developed
               areas shall maintain compatibility with existing uses and the
               prevailing land use pattern in the area.
       3.58.   Land uses with unusual characteristics or a higher likelihood of
               raising compatibility issues shall be subject to more focused review
               and approval through a special approval process. Reasonable
               conditions or permit provisions shall be applied to mitigate potential
               adverse impacts on nearby properties and uses.
       Redevelopment and Revitalization
       3.59.   Downtown will continue to serve as the center of civic uses and
               activities and as a venue for culture and entertainment.
       3.60.   Reuse and redevelopment of existing property will strictly adhere to
               the policies and principles of this general plan and the provisions of
               the development ordinances.
       3.61.   An increased focus will be devoted to corridor revitalization and
               enhancement.
       Community Design
       3.62.   Walkability and good connectivity will be promoted through
               continuity of the street and pedestrian system, together with a
               compact community form.
       3.63.   Development along I-5 and the City’s primary arteries will be
               designed with an increased standard of quality and appearance.
       Land Use
       3.64.   Residential development shall be oriented away from I-5 and other
               primary streets without adequate transitioning standards and situated
               within the roadway network and relative to other land uses so as to
               minimize high volumes of through traffic.
       3.65.   Residential areas shall not be situated next to intense nonresidential
               uses without provisions for increased separation and bufferyards.
               Less intense nonresidential development may be appropriate next to
               residential development with performance standards to mitigate
               adverse impacts.
  3.32

3.66.   Medium to high-density housing shall be developed at a density and
        scale that is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood and
        available utilities and roadway capacity. Larger multi-family
        developments shall be located on sites with adequate space for off-
        street parking, accessory structures, and recreational activity, and
        toward the edge of single-family residential areas where higher traffic

                             Public Safety
                                                                      Chapter 4
Since 1975, the California Government Code has required an element of the          CONTENTS
General Plan to address public safety, which was combined with the seismic
                                                                                   Purpose................................... 4.2

                                                                                   Seismic & Geologic Hazards .. 4.8
natural or manmade hazards. Therefore, this chapter is comprised of the
following:                                                                         Fire Protection Services ......... 4.10

     combined with inadequate flood storage and lacking system capacity leads
     to inundation during heavy storm events. This inundation is mostly in
     the rural, undeveloped areas although there is property and structural
     flooding along the northern fringes of development, which (anecdotally)
     has stretched along 6th and 7th Streets as far south as D Street.
     Fortunately, this flooding has not been significant enough to lead to a
     loss of life, but it has caused structural damage and thus, affects the value
     of development in these areas. In the context of public safety, the
     mitigation of flooding is often discussed and thus, among the highest
     priorities for the community.
 Seismic and geologic hazards are an important consideration in the state
     due to the presence of fault lines and their proximity to developed areas.
     While there are no active faults near Williams or in Colusa County, the
     northern Sacramento Valley can expect regular low-intensity shocks.
     However, according to the State Division of Mines and Geology, the
     possibility of a major earthquake cannot be ruled out. The City must
     therefore, take the necessary steps to prepare itself and its residents
     against such natural hazard. Other seismic and geologic considerations
     include landslides, subsidence, expansive soils, erosion, and volcanic
     eruptions, which have varying degrees of hazard for Williams.
                                                                                                            4.1

                                 Structural fires and wildfires are a constant hazard in Williams as they
                                  are in any community. The Williams Fire Protection Authority was
                                  formed in 1994 for the purpose of protecting life and property within the
                                  City of Williams and the surrounding rural area. From their single
                                  station, they provide response to medical and fire calls and for other
                                  emergency response purposes. The Authority is responsible for reviewing
                                  site and building plans and both administering and enforcing compliance
                                  with the California Fire Code.1 The areas that are most susceptible to
                                  wildfires are those to the west of Williams, which increase in severity
                                  with distance from the community.
                                 Police services include the protection of persons and property within the
                                  City limits. The Williams Police Department is responsible for crime
                                  prevention and law enforcement, as well as community education. The
                                  areas outside the City limits are the responsibility of the Colusa County
                                  Sheriff’s Department and the California Highway Patrol along I-5.
                                 Hazardous materials management is important to ensure the safe
                                  storage, handling, and transportation of hazardous materials within and
                                  through the community. Most of the hazardous materials that have the
                                  potential to affect Williams are those associated with agricultural
                                  operations, including the use of aerial and ground application of
                                  chemicals. Additionally, major transportation routes such as I-5, Old
                                  Highway 20, and CFNR Railroad are used to transport these materials to
                                  and through Williams. Proper handling and management of any
                                  accidental releases or spill events is a primary consideration.

FLOOD PROTECTION
Williams is confronted with persistent flood hazards due largely to the
upstream watershed. In general, there are approximately 125 square miles of
mountains and farmland that drain into the network of creeks and drainage
canals above the City. Therefore, rainfall events often exceed the capacity of
the conveyance systems, which results in overflows of storm waters that flow
into developed portions of the City. As a result, the City has had several
disaster declarations, which has resulted in costly damages and emergency
construction.
The City lies mostly within the Freshwater Creek Basin. Two of the basin’s
tributaries include Salt Creek and Spring Creek, both of which flow through
the City and its sphere of influence. As the primary conveyances, the capacity
of these stream channels is often exceeded, even with modest rainfall events.
This is due, in part, to the external hazards attributed to the runoff generated
in areas of the watersheds that are outside of the City. Since these areas are
largely rural and have less affect on property, these watersheds have not been
extensively studied nor have significant, near-term improvements been
identified. Secondly, flooding is caused by a lack of storm drainage
infrastructure within the City. Since much of the drainage within the City is
by way of overland sheet flow and above ground facilities like roadside
ditches, valley gutters, and surface drainage in streets, there is simply an
insufficient capacity to adequately handle the volume of storm water that is
generated outside of and within the City.
The City participated in the Federal Emergency Management Agency
                                                                               Flood hazard zone means an area subject to
(FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) program. As part of its
                                                                               flooding that is delineated as either a special
administration of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP),                  hazard area or an area of moderate hazard
FEMA publishes flood hazard maps (known as FIRMs). The purpose                on an official flood insurance rate map issued
of a FIRM is to show the areas in Williams that are subject to flooding             by the Federal Emergency Management
                                                                                   Agency. The identification of flood hazard
and the risk associated with these flood hazards. One of the areas               zones does not imply that areas outside the
shown on the FIRM is a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The                     flood hazard zones, or uses permitted within
SFHA is the area that has a 1-percent or greater chance of flooding in         flood hazard zones, will be free from flooding
any given year; this area is also referred to as the 100-year floodplain.                                   or flood damage.
The flood hazard and risk information presented on the FIRMs is the
result of engineering studies that are performed by engineering companies,
other Federal agencies, or communities, which are reviewed for compliance
with FEMA guidelines and approved by FEMA.
The City’s involvement in NFIP requires it to adopt and enforce minimum
floodplain management standards. These floodplain management
requirements are designed to prevent new development from increasing the
flood threat and to protect new and existing buildings from anticipated flood
events. The City must therefore, require permits for all development in the
SFHA and ensure that construction materials and methods used will
minimize future flood damage. In return, the Federal Government makes
flood insurance available for almost every building and its contents within the
                                                                                                          4.3

    community. No insurance may be obtained for structures built within the
    designated floodway or below the elevation of the 100-year flood. However,
    insurance is available in the 100-year floodplain for homes built with the first
    floor of living area above the 100-year flood elevation.
    Land development results in an increase in the amount of impervious surfaces
    and decreased ground cover and vegetation. These conditions limit
    infiltration and, without adequate mitigation, can increase storm water run-
    off rates and volumes, and decrease the time required to reach and surpass the
    capacities of the drainage conveyance systems. For this reason, the City must
    be cognizant of the impacts of new development, and adequately prepare for
    and plan to mitigate these impacts with good design principles and adequate,
    up-to-date standards.
    There have been a large number of studies undertaken to address the flooding
    conditions in and around Williams.2 Two of the more recent include
    Preliminary Technical Memorandum for Flood Hazard Mitigation Study
    Project Alternatives and the Storm Drainage Master Plan. These two studies
    offer recommendations regarding the design capacities for sizing storm
    drainage infrastructure and detention basins, structure and non-structural
    measures to reduce existing flooding problems, preparation of a storm water
    management plan, and considerations applicable to new development. Many
    of these recommendations warrant consideration concurrent with the
    implementation of this general plan update.
    Policies
    4.1.      The City will require applicants for development to submit drainage
              studies that adhere to storm water design requirements and
              incorporate measures from the Storm Drainage Master Plan to
              prevent on- or off-site flooding.
    4.2.      Future development will include adequate provisions for on- and/or
              off-site collection, storage, and conveyance of storm water, in
              accordance with the City’s policies and standards.
    4.3.      Land within the floodplain that is indicated for future development
              in this general plan will mitigate flooding conditions through the
              means required by the City and FEMA.
    4.4.      New development shall not cause downstream property owners,
              watercourses, channels, or conduits to receive storm water runoff at a
              higher peak flow rate than would have resulted from the same storm
              event occurring over the development site with the land in its
              natural, undeveloped condition.
    2 The Preliminary Technical Memorandum for Flood Hazard Mitigation Study Project
    Alternatives, March 28, 2003, references a bibliography of more than 30 reports and
    studies throughout the Sacramento Valley.
4.4

4.5.    Storm retention/detention facilities will be integrated into the open
        space set-asides of future land developments and used as amenities and
        recreational areas.
4.6.    Storm detention basins will be jointly used as public open space and
        recreational facilities where such improvements are determined by
        the City to be needed and warranted.                                                             Vegetated Swale
4.7.    The City will continue to participate in the National Flood
        Insurance Program and in so doing with maintain their regulations in
        compliance with the standards of the Federal Emergency
        Management Agency (FEMA).
4.8.    The City will promote and encourage the use of natural drainage
        configurations such as depression areas, wetlands, and natural swales
        versus underground storm drainage infrastructure.
4.9.    The design of drainage improvements will be sensitive to community
        aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (trails, playing fields), wetlands,
                                                                                                                   Bioswale
        and water quality mitigation.
4.10.   The City will encourage design strategies to reduce the impact of
        impervious surfaces on storm water quality through the use of water
        gardens, rain barrels or cisterns, pervious pavement, vegetated swales,
        swale blocks, and green roofs, among others.
4.11    Review this Public Safety Element concurrently with the periodically
        updated Housing Element to update any new information regarding
        floodplain mapping and/or regulations and to ensure consistency.
4.12.   Discourage extensive areas of impermeable surfaces and promote the
        use of permeable materials for surfaces such as driveways and parking
        lots.
4.13.   The City will identify flood hazard information.
4.14    In its pending new Drainage Master Plan, the City will identify goals,
        objectives, and feasible implementation measures to protect itself
        from unreasonable risk of flooding.
4.15.   The City will take a comprehensive approach to flood mitigation,
                                                                                          Among the “green infrastructure”
        and include floodplain management ordinances.                                  strategies are the use of vegetated
                                                                                    swales and bioswales to improve storm
Actions                                                                                                      water quality.
4.a.    The City of Williams will coordinate with agencies having
        jurisdiction over the upstream lands to identify flood control
        alternatives and employ better flood management practices as a
        means to mitigate flooding conditions in the community.
4.b.    The City will require a minimum of 100-year flood protection for
        new construction, and strive 100-year flood protection for
        unincorporated communities. Should FEMA increase these
        minimum standards, the City will mirror the new level of protection
        at the local level.
4.c.    Update the Storm Drainage Master Plan to revise the assumptions
        relating to the future types and patterns use and their corresponding
        levels of imperviousness. This is particularly relevant and important
                                                                                                       4.5

               considering the open space ratios that are integrated into the land use
               and zoning districts.
    4.d.       Maintain a Flood and Drainage Master Plan that addresses the
               following, at a minimum:
                Storm water and drainage improvements for all sections of the
                    City that are needed to accommodate planned growth;
                Coordination with irrigation districts, the County and other
                    affected flood control agencies to develop uniform standards for
                    irrigation and storm water conveyance infrastructure; and
                Standard measures used for new development to address localized
                    flooding, such as measures to avoid off-site drainage impacts from
                    adjacent agricultural operations.
    4.e.       At the time the City reaches a size by which it is required to comply
               with Section 402(p) of the Federal Clean Water Act, prepare a Storm
               Water Management Plan (SWMP) to fulfill the requirements for
               improving the quality of storm water discharges from Small
               Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4) for Phase II
               municipalities.
    4.f.       Begin identifying Best Management Practices (BMPs), particularly
               construction site storm water runoff control and post-construction
               storm water management, to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the
               storm water system. These should be integrated as standards into the
               City’s subdivision regulations.
    4.g.       Through improved land development practices and regulations,
               establish a hierarchy for managing storm water with the following
               priorities: minimize impervious surfaces, attenuate flows by use of
               open, vegetated swales and natural depressions and preserve existing
               natural stream channels, infiltrate runoff3, provide storm water
               retention and then
               detention structures, provide velocity dissipation structures or
               channel design, and construct storm sewers.
    4.h.       Require new development projects to provide site or project specific
               storm drainage solutions with are consistent with the approach
               outlined in the Storm Drainage Master Plan.
    4.i.       Require storm water storage facilities to be designed to store 115
               percent of the required storm volume to support the development as
               means to reduce the need to clean out accumulated sediments and
               other solids.
    4.j.       Require new development projects to construct elements of the
               master plan infrastructure system that are within or abutting their
               project boundaries.
    3 Infiltration is based on the extent practicable considering Group D soils that have a high
    runoff potential.
4.6

4.k.       Allow the use of temporary onsite detention basins as an interim
           measure, subject to applicable engineering standards, only until such
           time as the City’s permanent drainage system is completed. Funds, in
           an amount to be determined, must be deposited with the City to pay
           for the future decommissioning and filling of the temporary
           detention basis.
4.l.       Pre-plan for the incorporation of recreation elements into
           future detention basins by acquiring sufficient additional
           land and programming recreational facility improvements,
           as applicable.
4.m.       Investigate the feasibility of the alternatives outlined in the
           Preliminary Technical Memorandum for Flood Hazard
           Mitigation Study Project Alternatives. The structural
           alternatives include improving the conveyance capacity of
           Freshwater and Salt Creeks and the supporting network of
           drainage laterals, replacing bridge crossings to remove
           obstructions, constructing diversion dams to channel flows
           away from the City, constructing flood detention and
           multi-purpose flood retention reservoirs, constructing
           levees to the west and north of the City with removable                      The joint use detention facility that also provides a
           floodwall sections, and elevating existing structures. The                     wetland, park, and play fields in Valley Ranch is
                                                                                           exemplary of the approach advocated by this
           non-structural alternatives include land acquisition,
                                                                                                                                general plan.
           cropland storage, channel restoration, upland re-vegetation,
           and improved maintenance of stream channels.
4n.        Investigate and adopt the necessary funding approaches to facilitate
           development of the City’s storm drainage system, including
           consideration of a storm drain utility fee for improvements within
           the existing developed area4 and development impact fees, assessment
           district(s), and/or special tax districts for new development.5
4.o.        Annually review areas subject to flooding, levee failure, and dam
           inundation, including any relevant information developed by FEMA,
           the California Department of Water Resources, and other agencies,
           and update City-wide flood risk maps accordingly in compliance
           with AB 162.
4.p.       During preparation of the Capital Improvement Program, review the
           conditions of bridges, culverts, railroad trellis structures, and other
           flood control and storm water conveyance infrastructure and include
           necessary improvements on the CIP to ensure safety of persons in the
           City and adequate conveyance of flood waters.
4.q.       In accordance with California Government Code Sections 65302.9
           and 65860.1, once the Central Valley Flood Protection Plan (CVFPP)
           has been adopted in July 2012, the City will review, and if necessary
4
  This would be subject to the provisions of Proposition 218, the “Right to Vote on Taxes
Act” of 1996.

                                                   are consistent with the CVFPP.
                                          4.r.     Review the Municipal Code and revise as necessary to ensure that
                                                   development standards are consistent with the requirements of state

                                                        above the base flood elevation;
                                                    New construction in the floodplain as established by FEMA shall
                                                        be designed and constructed so that they do not contribute to
                                                            cumulative flooding problems that could pose a hazard to
                                                            surrounding landowners or the public.

                                                            SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
                                                            The State of California has identified five areas of critical
                                                            seismic concern including surface ruptures, ground shaking,
                                                            ground failure, tsunamis, and seiches. Each of these is caused
                                                            by earthquake activity thereby creating hazards for life and
                                                            property, which has the potential anywhere in California.
                                                            While there are no active faults in Williams or Colusa
                                                            County, the northern Sacramento Valley is to expect low-
                                                            intensity shocks from time to time. Williams is not at risk for
                                                            tsunamis or seiches due to its inland location and the absence
                                                            of nearby large bodies of water.
This map published by the California Geologic
Survey indicates the fault traces that are present in       The faults that are in the Valley are what are referred to as
the area to the west of Williams.
                                                            quaternary, meaning they were active 200,000 years ago, or
                                                            even pre-quaternary (active two million years ago). Much of
                                          the earthquake preparedness efforts conducted in the area to date have
                                          considered earthquakes that occur outside of Colusa County. The nearest
                                          known fault is at Sutter Buttes (lying midway and slightly north between
                                          Colusa and Yuba City) for which the maximum credible earthquake could
                                          measure a magnitude of 5.7 on the Richter scale. Ground shaking from this
                                          level of earthquake would be felt and observed as to its cause. The damage
                                          would be moderate to major, with general damage to foundations, partial to
                                          complete collapse of unreinforced masonry structures, partial damage to
                                          reinforced masonry structures, and underground pipes broken. Therefore,
                                          there are seismic risks in Williams and throughout Colusa County for which
                                          preparedness is wise and warranted.
            4.8

In 2004, the City adopted a resolution to adopt the Colusa County
Operational Area Local Hazard Mitigation Plan.6 This plan was required by
Federal law7 as a prerequisite for the receipt of Federal grant funds, and
establishes parameters of O.E.S. to carry out post disaster mitigation
activities. The goals of the plan is to provide the basis for funding pre-
mitigation priorities for projects that save lives and reduce damage. This plan
includes a series of mitigation strategies that are applicable to the City of
Williams. These primarily relate to enforcing earthquake preparedness
activities and inspections based on city and county codes, public education
and preparedness drills, bringing buildings to code, preparing to reduce flood
damage, and enforcing wild fire defensible zones around homes. Specifically
related to Williams, the mitigation measure identified is to maintain the
integrity of stream banks to protect against flooding. This plan is required to
be updated in 2010, which is the sole responsibility of the Colusa County
Office of Emergency Services. It is advisable for the City to actively engage in
this update process.
Policies
4.16. The City will continue to coordinate with the Colusa County Office
          of Emergency Services and the California State Office of Emergency
          Services to collect, account for, and distribute geologic data for use in
          preparedness and hazard mitigation planning.
4.17. Geotechnical investigation will be required by the City for any
          development proposed to occur in an area of known subsidence for
          which engineering modifications may be necessary to mitigate or
          eliminate adverse impacts.
4.18. The City supports the Williams Fire Protection Authority (WFPA),
          efforts to continuously seek to lower its fire insurance rating Public
          Protection Classification (PPC) by improving the availability of
          water and the adequacy of fire flows and investing in an advance
          communication system.
4.19. The City will comply with state seismic and building standards in the
          design and citing of its critical emergency response facilities, and
          coordinate with other local agencies, such as the Williams Unified
          School District, to facilitate their compliance as well.
Actions
4.t.      Coordinate with the Colusa County Office of Emergency Services in
          their 2010 update of the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan. Specifically,
          the City should seek to elaborate on this plan to ensure its interests
          in hazard preparedness, as well as consistency with this general plan.
          This will require a new resolution to replace Resolution 04-38.
4.u.      Update from time to time the City’s building standards to stay
          current with amendments to the California Building Code.

  Resolution 04-28, adopted by the City Council of the City of Williams on December 8,
2004.

  Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 and 44 CFD, Part 201
                                                                                       4.9

                                             4.v.      Investigate buildings within the City of Williams that were
                                                       constructed of unreinforced masonry and built prior to the current
                                                       standards of building construction to document their location and
                                                       make record of needed code compliance.
                                             4.w.      Update and keep current an emergency response plan for the City
                                                       that outlines the roles and responsibilities of different agencies, the
                                                         command center location, areas of shelter, means of public
                                                         notification, and the methods for providing emergency response.
                                                         FIRE PROTECTION SERVICES
                                                         According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire
                                                         Protection, the City of Williams is within a Local Responsibility
                                                         Area (LRA) that is unzoned as to its fire hazard severity zone.
                                                         Essentially, this means that the City is at low risk for wild land
                                                         fires. Areas further west in the foothills and mountains of Colusa
                                                         County have an increased potential for fire hazard.8 Although the
                                                         risk is low within the community, it is important for the City to
                                                         remain cognizant of this potential threat,
                                                         and to prepare itself in a manner that protects life, property, and
                                                         resources from wildfires. Therefore, it is prudent for the City to
                                                         adapt its fire protection planning to incorporate good practices for
                                                         limiting the exposure to unnecessary fire hazards.
                                                         The State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection classify areas in
The yellow and pink areas lying west of Williams         which the primary financial responsibility for preventing and
are within the State Responsibility Area. These
are within the other moderate (yellow) to other          suppressing fires is that of the state. These include: lands covered
very high (pink) fire hazard severity zones.             wholly or in part by timber, brush, undergrowth or grass, whether
                                                         of commercial value or not; lands which protect the soil from
                                             erosion, retard run-off of water or accelerated percolation; lands used
                                             principally for range or forage purposes; lands not owned by the Federal
                                             government; and lands not incorporated. By Board regulations, unless specific
                                             circumstances dictate otherwise, lands are removed from State Responsibility
                                             Areas (SRAs) when housing densities average more than three units per acre
                                             over an area of 250 acres. CAL FIRE has SRA responsibility for the
                                             protection of over 31 million acres of California´s privately-owned wild
                                             lands. The area to the west of Williams is within the SRA, for which the
                                             WFPD has a contract with the Lake Napa Unit for fires within this area.
                                             The responses of the Williams Fire Protection Authority may be grouped
                                             into three categories: fire calls, emergency medical calls, and non-fire calls.
                                             The latter are for investigations of possible fire hazards, false alarms, and
                                             other miscellaneous calls. The numbers of calls within each of these categories
                                             is outlined in Chapter 2, Background Analysis. In short, the WFPA’s
                                             incident response has been maintained at roughly one hundred calls per

thousand population (0.11), which is significantly lower than the national
average of 0.19 per thousand. While a majority of these calls are within the
City of Williams, the entire service area is over 200 square miles.
Fire protection services for the 3,187.3 acres that exist within the City Limits
are managed from one station located at 810 E Street. While a one and one-
half mile radius covers the entire City limits from this location, the response
time to East Williams is dependent upon whether or not there is a train
crossing E Street. If so, fire response must be rerouted north to Old Highway
20, which lengthens the trip and increases the time of response. As the
community expands eastward a second station is warranted on the east side of
town. This is based on the Insurance Services Organization (ISO) guideline
that a fire station can cover one and one-half road miles from an existing
station. As new growth occurs beyond these limits, either during the horizon
of this general plan or beyond, further consideration should be given of
establishing a second fire station.
The Insurance Services Organization (ISO) rating is four (out of a possible
ten, with one as the highest) within the City and six for a distance up to five
miles from the fire station. This is important as insurance companies use
Public Protection Classification (PPC) information to help establish the
premiums for fire insurance
- generally offering lower premiums in communities with better protection.
The ISO rating is determined using a manual called the Fire Suppression
Rating Schedule (FSRS), which evaluates three major areas:

     system accounts for 10 percent of the total classification. The review         The Insurance Services Office

     percent of the total classification. ISO reviews the water supply a
     community uses to determine the adequacy for fire-suppression purposes.
     The organization also considers hydrant size, spacing, type, and
     installation, as well as the inspection frequency and condition of fire
     hydrants.
The Fire Suppression Rating Schedule (FSRS) measures the major elements of
a community's fire-suppression system and develops a numerical grading
called a Public Protection Classification (PPC). The items considered in the
FSRS and the percentage weighting of each item in the calculation that leads
to a PPC rating is as follows:
                                                                                               4.11

     Receiving and handling of fire alarms
     Receipt of fire alarms by commercial telephone — ISO compares the                   2%
     number of telephone lines provided with the number of telephone lines
     needed for emergency and business calls. The number of needed lines
     depends on the population served by the communication center. ISO also
     evaluates telephone directory listings.
     Operators — ISO compares the number of fire alarm operators provided                3%
     with the number of operators needed. The number of needed operators
     depends on whether the community is meeting its performance standards
     with existing operators for receiving and dispatching alarms. Alternatively, if
     performance data is unavailable, the number of needed operators is
     based upon the number of alarms received.
     Alarm dispatch circuits — All fire departments (except for single-station           5%
     departments with full-time personnel receiving alarms directly at the station)
     need adequate means of notifying personnel of fire locations. ISO
     evaluates the type and arrangement of those facilities.
     Subtotal                                                                            10%
     Fire department
     Pumpers — ISO compares the number of in-service pumpers and the                     10%
     equipment carried with the number of needed pumpers and the
     equipment identified in the FSRS (or equivalency list). The number of
     needed pumpers depends on the Basic Fire Flow, the size of the area
     served, and the method of operation.
     Reserve pumpers — ISO evaluates the adequacy of the pumpers and their               1%
     components with one (or more in larger communities) pumper out of
     service.
     Pump capacity — ISO compares the pump capacity of the in-service and                5%
     reserve pumpers (and pumps on other apparatus) with the Basic Fire Flow.
     ISO considers a maximum Basic Fire Flow of 3,500 gpm.
     Ladder/service — Communities use ladders, tools, and equipment                      5%
     normally carried on ladder trucks for ladder operations, as well as for
     forcible entry, utility shut-off, ventilation, salvage, overhaul, and lighting. The
     number and type of apparatus depend on the height of the buildings,
     needed fire flow, and the size of the area served.
     Reserve ladder and/or service — ISO compares the adequacy of ladder                 1%
     and service apparatus when one (or more in larger communities)
     apparatus is out of service.
     Distribution of companies — ISO credits the percentage of the community             4%
     within specified response distances of pumpers (1-1/2 miles) and
     ladder/service apparatus (2-1/2 miles).
     Company personnel — ISO credits the personnel available for first alarms            15%
     of fire. For personnel not normally in the fire station (for example,
     volunteers), ISO reduces the value of the responding members to reflect
     the delay due to decision, communication, or assembly. ISO then applies
     an upper limit for the credit for manning, as it is impractical for a very large
     number of personnel to operate a piece of apparatus.

Training — Trained personnel are vital to a competent fire-suppression            9%
force. ISO evaluates training facilities and their productivity; training at fire
stations; training of fire officers, drivers, and recruits; and building
familiarization and prefire planning inspections.
Subtotal                                                                          50%
Water supply
Adequacy of water supply — ISO compares the available water supply at             35%
representative community locations with the needed fire flows for those
locations. The supply works, the water main capacity, or fire hydrant
distribution may limit the available supply.
Hydrants: size, type, and installation — ISO evaluates the design capacity        2%
of fire hydrants.
Hydrants: inspection and condition — ISO evaluates the frequency of fire          3%
hydrant inspection, the completeness of the inspections, and the condition
of the hydrants.
Subtotal                                                                          40%
Divergence
Divergence — An inadequate water supply may limit the ability of even the best fire
department to suppress fires. Similarly, an inadequate fire department may not be
able to make effective use of an abundant water supply. So, if the quality of the fire
department and the water supply are different, ISO adjusts the total score
downward to reflect the limiting effect of the less adequate item on the better one.
TOTAL                                                                             100%

The WFPA has established a response time standard to determine the
effectiveness of fire services in Williams. A six minute response time on 90
percent of its calls has been determined to be the target for the purpose of
saving lives and structures. Currently, the Authority has a response time of
approximately seven minutes. Another station location on the east side of I-5
would improve response time.
Municipal Code Chapter 17.112 establishes a fire facilities development fee
that imposes upon residential, commercial, industrial and other land
development projects an equitable share of the cost of additional and
expanded fire needs created by new development projects. The amount of the
fee was initially established by Resolution 91-13 in 1991. The amount of the
fee remained unchanged until Resolution 03-24,9 which established updated
fees to allocate a fair portion of the costs of the fire facilities. This resolution
also provided that, “Commencing on July 1, 2004, the Fee shall be adjusted
on July 1 of each year to reflect the increase, if any, in the cost of living…”. In
light of the expected future growth this annual review is warranted.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Hazardous materials are substances that are dangerous to the public’s health
and safety, particularly if they are improperly used, stored, transported, or
disposed. Hazardous materials include substances known to be toxic,
flammable, explosive, corrosive, infectious, carcinogenic, or radioactive. The
most significant concerns for such substances in the City of Williams are the
presence of I-5 and the CFNR Railroad. This is due to the potential for
accidents or spills along these corridors that could release hazardous materials
like gasoline, diesel fuel, or hazardous substances or wastes that may be
transported.
Hazardous materials also include many household products such as cleaning           AB 2765 provides common-

Williams will assume command responsibilities for all hazardous material
incidents within the City limits. Outside of the City limits is the
responsibility of the Colusa County Office of Emergency Services. The
Colusa County Environmental Health Department is then responsible for
performing all assessments of environmental contamination
and/or human exposure and providing oversight of cleanup activity and
coordination with the lead state agency having cleanup jurisdiction.
In the ordinary course of training the firefighters of the WFPA all full-time
staff and volunteers are trained as Firefighter I and First Responder, which
includes basic hazardous materials fire training. There is no hazardous
materials team within Colusa County, which draws on the master mutual aid
system for any incidents.
All hazardous materials handlers who store in excess of 55 gallons, 500
pounds, or 200 cubic feet of gas are required to submit Hazardous Materials
Management Plans. These plans provide emergency responders like the
                                                                                               4.17

     WFPA emergency contact information, site specific chemical inventories, and
     vicinity and facility maps. Furthermore, owners/operators of above ground
     tanks containing in excess of 660 gallons of petroleum hydrocarbons must
     comply with the state Aboveground Petroleum Storage Act, which requires
     preparation of a Spill Prevention and Countermeasure Plan.
     There are currently no designated routes for the transportation of hazardous
     materials within the City. Most materials are transported by truck for which
     designated truck routes have also not been established within the City.
     Lastly, given the extent of agricultural operations and activities around the
     community another public health concern is related to the aerial spray
     application of agricultural pesticides. The use of crop dusters in close
     proximity to town may allow drifting into adjacent residential areas. The use
     of buffers and other approaches is prudent to minimum conflicts between
     urban and agricultural uses activities.
     Policies
     4.35. The City will coordinate with appropriate federal, state, and regional
              agencies to address local sources of groundwater and soil

              basic hazardous materials fire training.
     4. 40. The City will establish hazardous materials routes, which should be
              listed in the National Hazardous Materials Registry managed by the
              U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety
              Administration (FMCSA).
     4.41. The City will establish designated truck routes through and around
              the City via an ordinance adopted by the City Council.
     4.42. The City will establish safeguards for the aerial spraying of pesticides
              and other agricultural chemicals within or in near proximity to the
              City limits.
     4.43. New development adjacent to areas of ongoing agricultural
              development shall provide agricultural buffers that are adequate to
              protect residents from the harmful effects of agricultural chemical
              use.
4.18
4.44.   The City will educate the public as to the types of household
        hazardous waste and the proper means of disposal.
4.45.   The City will require that development project proposals address
        existing hazardous materials concerns, particularly past agricultural
        uses, through preparation of Phase I or Phase II hazardous materials
        studies.

Relationships with Other Master Plans
For water and wastewater services, the City is in the process of studying its
services and facilities and master plans are pending. The water and wastewater
sections of this chapter are not intended to supplant those studies nor their
recommendations. These sections address additional polices to ensure
alignment between the pending plans and the City’s development policies.
In November, 2007, the City adopted the Storm Drainage Master Plan and it
is currently being implemented through the City’s Capital Improvement
Program and through new development. The Storm Drainage section of this
chapter makes policy recommendations for further refinement of this
ongoing process.

                                   The City has not yet undertaken the task of thoroughly studying community
                                   needs and gaps in service. This chapter lays out action plans to identify those
                                   gaps and makes policy recommendations for further refinement of this
                                   ongoing process.

                                   to identify those gaps.
                                   The City of Williams does provide full police and fire protection
                                   services. The policies for these services and facilities as well as for
                                   emergency response services are included in Chapter 4, Public Safety.
                                   As in most cities, the City of Williams relies on the school district, as
                                   well as private and public colleges and other education providers for
                                   such services. The education section of this chapter does not lay out
                                   plans that would conflict with ongoing plans and efforts. It provides
                                   policies for enhanced interaction with these entities and for
                                   development policies. It also makes recommendations for City provided
                                   services that would further enhance public education.

                                   Regarding fire suppression, the City received a technical memorandum
                                   in 2008 identifying deficiencies in pressure in areas of the water system.
                                   The consultants found that in general the existing system can meet
                                   maximum daily and peak hour demands. However, there is no

to install an additional well.
Wastewater Collection and Treatment
Chapter 2 describes the current wastewater service in the City of
Williams, including recent improvements. The City has begun
significant repairs to the wastewater collection system. These included a
replacement of the existing 0.5 MGD treatment plant. The new
treatment plant will increase the capacity to 0.59 MGD, allowing for
approximately 16% additional capacity than exists today. The plant can
be expanded to twice its current capacity to 1.0 MGD. The future
capacity of the plant will allow for the projected population growth as
well as commercial and industrial users at roughly the same ratio as
exists today. A particularly large utility user coming to the area would
require a development agreement with the City that addresses cost
allocations and timing of service provision.
Storm Drainage
As discussed in Chapter 2, the City of Williams experiences significant
flooding issues due to a combination of an inadequate drainage system
coupled with Salt Creek’s overflowing its banks during rain events. In 2007,
the City conducted a Storm Drainage Master Plan, completed in November
of that year. The Master Planned area includes approximately nine square
miles, encompassing all of the City Limits and its Sphere of Influence (SOI),
with the exception of the area north of Old Highway 20. The study area also
included acreage to the east and to the south that would likely be included in
the City’s future SOI. The study concluded in a design of a Drainage Master
Plan which includes detention basins, basin outlets, culverts, interconnected
                                                                                           Salt Creek north of Williams
storm drains, and a number of open channels connecting some of the
detention basins.
Shortly afterward, the City began implementation of the plan. In 2008, the
City adopted an amendment to add a storm drainage fee for all new
development (Chapter 13.06). This fee goes to a separate fund, to be used
“solely for the construction or reimbursement for funds of local drainage
within the local drainage area”. The Storm Drainage Master Plan includes an
implementation strategy where new development will include installation of
the drainage elements that are shown on the Plan. Those developments that
do not encompass drainage features shown on the Plan may include
temporary onsite detention basins if feasible.                                                        Drainage Ditch

                                       The detention areas are the key to addressing the flooding     issues facing the
                                       current and future City because they will time the release     of water so that
                                       water collecting on sites during a rain event does not flow    to a system that
                                       has already reached its capacity. The water is held back and   metered out at a
                                       time when the system is better equipped to handle it.
                                       The recommendations relative to land use policies in this General Plan are
                                       aligned with the City’s goal of addressing its drainage issues. This plan sets
                                       forth a land use system that requires a minimum amount of open space in all
                                       developments, with density bonuses to encourage increased percentages of
                                       open space. The rationale for this approach is to provide incentives for cluster
                                       development thereby creating less impervious surfaces, subsequently leading
                                       to less storm water runoff and more open space for groundwater recharge. In
                                       addition to reducing the volume of storm water, there are water quality
                                       benefits when open space is increased because the natural areas capture
                                       pollutants before they ever enter the groundwater. Natural drainage
                                       configurations are supported by this plan and must be further accommodated
                                       by ordinances that include the use of natural swales; wide grassed ditches to
                                       filter water before entering a water course; and reconfiguration of drainage
                                       ditches to a wider, more natural stream channel with greater storage and flow
                                       capacity.
                                             The Master Plan includes “Design Standards” that ensure proper
                                             operation and maintenance of the system. The result of a well-
                                             functioning detention basin system presents potential design issues to the
                                             City. There is a wide range of options for detention pond design. Some
                                             are unsightly depressions in the ground that turn to muddy puddles
                                             when it rains or can even be dangerously deep concrete lined holes that
                                             need to be fenced off for safety reasons. However, detention basins can
                                             also become an amenity for the surrounding area if designed and
                                             maintained properly. The Storm Drainage Master Plan’s Design
This detention basin meets engineering       Standards do not specifically address aesthetics. The Plan states that
standards, serving only its drainage
function.                                    “passive recreational elements should be incorporated in portions of
                                             detention facilities that have the greatest potential for flood risk and
                                             frequency” and that “active recreation elements are more suitable in
                                             areas within detention facilities having lesser degrees of flood risk and
                                             frequency”. The Storm Drainage Master Plan presents an opportunity to
                                             further develop design standards to build on these concepts and specify
                                             recreational features that should be included in the future detention
                                             basin areas. The nature of the uses that these areas would include should
                                             be coordinated with additional parks and recreation programming (see
                                             Parks section in Chapter 7, Open Space and Conservation).
This detention basin meets engineering
standards but also addresses a
recreational need.

Due to fact that the Master Plan study predates the pending work of the
Central Valley Flood Protection Plan, it is not aligned with the Program
Environmental Impact Report. Once that report has been adopted, a new
Storm Drainage Master Plan should be initiated.
Future Improvements and Needs
The goal for water and wastewater utilities has been to address current
deficiencies in the trunk lines and overall systems. Immediate plans for
improvements will allow a modest increase in future capacity. In the case of
storm drainage, the City assumed full build-out of the current City and the
acreage around it where city growth is likely to occur. This system is
anticipated to be implemented with future development, while existing
developed areas will be improved through the CIP.
The City has not historically been in the practice of building facilities to any
significant level of unused capacity. Doing so would result in unreimbursed
capital and maintenance costs. The City supports growth in the form of
businesses and industries that will bring jobs and opportunities to its citizens
and will work with future utility customers to serve them with the least cost
to new and existing users of the systems.
Policies
5.1.     The City of Williams will provide utilities concurrently with
         development.
5.2.     The City of Williams will provide utility service in logical order and
         therefore will not extend trunk facilities through significant expanses
         of vacant land. Exceptions will be made for industries that will make
         a significant contribution to the sustainability of the community.
5.3.     Improvements to the collection, distribution, treatment, and
         conveyance system will be commensurate with the demands of new
         development.
5.4.     The City will identify non-development related NPDES permitting
         requirements to ensure they coordinate with development related
         regulations. Work to align all NPDES related efforts shall be a
         continuing effort.
5.5.     The City’s ongoing efforts to improve the drainage system and to
         coordinate them with parks and recreational needs shall be
         communicated to all decision makers and City staff to ensure
         alignment.
5.6.     The City will amend its Storm Drainage Master Plan to take into
         consideration the Central Valley Flood Protection Plan and to
         incorporate design standards that go beyond engineering to
         incorporate aesthetic features.

Actions
5.a.    Adopt best management practices for piping, manholes, bedding and
        backfill materials, and incorporate these standards into the City’s
        technical specifications for construction projects. Subsequently,
        implement additional checklist items related to NPDES compliance.
5.b.    Continue developing the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP)
        to repair and replace aging and deteriorated sewer lines, which will
        improve the flow efficiency, reduce inflow and infiltration into the
        collection and treatment systems, and help to mitigate ground water
        impacts.
5.c.    Execute plans to install a new water well.
5.d.    Further develop plans for a second water storage tank.
5.e.    Amend the zoning ordinance to include ground water protection
        measures in site development standards. Include open space
        provisions in the density standards.
5.f.    Amend the subdivision ordinance to include ground water protection
        measures in future subdivisions.
5.g.    In accordance with AB 1881, the Water Conservation Landscape Act
        of 2006, develop water efficient landscaping standards for new
        development to include:
         Requirements for specific species of plantings;
         Prohibition of invasive species;
         Submittal requirements for landscaping and irrigation plans (and
             requirement for both to be installed per approved plans);
         Landscaping and hardscaping to be designed based on
             “hydrozone” specifications;
         Provision for recirculating and recycling water systems;
         Requirements for a soil report with recommendations regarding
             the most efficient types of planting and irrigation for the specific
             soil types existing on a site;
         Specific “plant factors” in compliance with state standards for
             high, medium and low water using plantings; and
         Irrigation to be designed according to hydrozone needs.
5.h.    Develop design standards for detention basins based on type –
        aesthetic design for single use basins and recreational standards
        (development requirements) for joint use.
5.i.    For joint use detention basins, on a case-by-case basis, determine the
        proper cost share between drainage mitigation to be borne by future
        development versus public benefit of additional recreational
        infrastructure. Distinguish cost participation depending on the
        number of dwelling units that will be served by the recreational use.
        Establish guidelines for parkland dedication credit in future
        residential areas.
5.j.    Develop different sets of standards and specifications for drainage
        features. Draft the standards to correspond with the Land Use Plan
        character – rural, suburban, auto-urban, and urban.

5.k.      Incorporate into City standards and specifications means for
          addressing storm water quality, including a first preference for non-
          structure best management practices such as bio-
          retention, vegetated swales and buffer strips,
          constructed wetlands, and other environmentally
          sensitive design and construction practices.
City Facilities
Community Center
For some time now the City has known of its gaps in services
that in other communities are largely filled by a combination
of the private sector, semipublic -social services) and
municipalities. In 2001 the Community Facilities Needs
Assessment was conducted, which identified a “severe shortfall”
of meeting space and space for social and recreational activities.
It also laid out the City’s continued need for adequate
education, health care, child care, and senior care. The
Assessment’s recommendation for a multi-purpose community                City Hall has served its function well for a relatively

Williams Community Center. That Study assumed the same
level of need as the 2001 Assessment.
The 2010-2011 Budget includes funds to rehabilitate the Veterans building to
serve as the Community Center. Rehabilitation work will include new
restrooms as well as both interior and exterior rehabilitation.
Other Facilities
Chapter 2, Background Analysis, provides an inventory of existing City
buildings and grounds. There are three buildings that house City staff – the
Police Department, City Hall, and the Public Works facility. During the
2010-2011 budget year a new annex will be installed at the intersection of G
Street and Sixth to provide new offices for the relocation of the Building and
Planning Department staff. The Museum, in addition to having historical
artifacts on display, provides some meeting room capacity.
The City currently has 35 employees distributed in 11 departments. Several
services that are typically housed in separate departments in larger cities are
included in another department in Williams. As the City grows, at some
point these services will need to be split onto departments in their own right,
potentially within their own, separate facility.
Future Facilities Needs
The City’s staffing needs will grow along with its population. At a minimum,
the city will need to add employees at the current ratio of staff members per
population to maintain current levels of service. Table 5.1, Additional
Staffing Needs, projects the City’s staffing needs based on the population

projections that were done in Chapter 2. It assumes the current ratio of
manpower for Williams’ current population. As cities grow, the need for
certain services evolve, and others tend to shift from the private sector to the
local government. These include services such as emergency medical services
(EMS), animal control, municipal courts, libraries, cultural programs and
venues, etc. However, such needs have not yet been identified as priorities
and therefore the projections do not include any assumptions for service
enhancements.
Table 5.1, Additional Staffing Needs, shows the future additional
employees that will need to be added to each department in the intervening

  * Includes officers projected in Chapter 4 plus support and command staff
years between 2010 and 2030. Overall, by 2030, 30 employees will need to be
added. The individual department distribution is reflected in the table. These
numbers assume no split or shifts in individual departments, although it is
likely that the projected significant percentage change will necessitate
reorganization between now and 2030.
Table 5.2, Additional Workspace Needs, reflects the additional work space
that will need to be added to the City’s facilities to accommodate the
additional work force. The numbers reflect an assumption that an average of
153 square feet of work space is required for each new employee, plus an
additional 25% for auxiliary use such as lobbies, file rooms, meeting rooms,
etc. plus an additional 10% for internal hallways and aisles. Based on these
assumptions the City will need approximately 4,632 additional square feet of
office space by 2030. However, the Police Station was built with additional
capacity and could potentially absorb the 1150 square feet needed to
accommodate the police department by 2030, leaving an additional 3,482
square feet for other office uses that would be needed in the next 20 years.

 Despite the fact that the facility needs are relatively small at this time in
 Williams, the offices and facilities are largely scattered throughout the City.
 The uses were established in response to an immediate need coupled with an
 opportunity to acquire property at a modest cost. However, this approach
 was piecemeal and has likely resulted in inefficiencies in service delivery.
 Many larger cities eventually discover the time, money and space saving
 advantages of creating centers where city services can be brought back
 together into a single area. These consolidations have the added benefit of
 stimulating economic development by attracting businesses to locate around
 them. The City of Williams is still of a manageable size. Planning for a city
 center now, and then taking steps over time to accomplish this goal, will save
 Williams from facing an untenable task of consolidation that growth will
 bring.
 Policies
 5.7.      The City will provide facilities and services at a minimum of its
           current manpower ratio per 1000 persons.
 5.8.      The City will evaluate service provision annually with its budget
           process to determine necessary additions to the workforce and
           facility expansion to meet increasing demands of growth.
 5.9.      The City will determine enhancements annually with its budget
           process to identify necessary growth in its services to continue to
           meet service needs.
 5.10. The City recognizes the opportunity to consolidate services into a
           single area to streamline service delivery.

 5.l.      Identify and then evaluate specific areas of the City as potential “City
           Center” sites.
 5.m.      Workshop the concepts with the City Council and further develop a
           long range plan for city facilities.

                                    5.n.      Identify expansion options for all facilities in the short run for the
                                             interim needs that will present themselves prior to having
                                             accomplished consolidation.
                                    5.o.     Estimate the City’s population annually and project a one, two, five,
                                             ten, and twenty year population to recalibrate the City’s future needs
                                             for facilities and services. Include development pressures and gauge
                                             the likelihood that they will come to fruition in the estimates and
                                             projections.
                                    Education
                                    New Community College
                                    A significant addition that will benefit the City will be the new Woodland
                                    Community College campus in Williams that broke ground early 2010. The
                                        new 3 acre facility is located next to the California Highway Patrol offices
                                        at the intersection of Husted and E Street. Operational by the Spring
                                        semester in 2011, the facilities will offer a two year degree program to all
                                        adults, including college preparatory classes for low-income students.
                                        Classes will be taught in mathematics, science, economics, agriculture,
                                        accounting, computer science, business, etc. The site has room for possible
                                        future expansion.
                                        Public Schools
                                        Chapter 2 provides a summary of the 2007 Williams Unified School
                                        District (WUSD) facilities needs study and master plan. The existing 52
The Woodland Community College          acre school complex in Williams houses all of the City’s public schools –
under construction on E Street near     elementary, middle, and high schools. There are currently approximately
Husted Road.
                                        1200 students accommodated at the site, which has room to roughly
                                        double the enrollment by expanding the schools on-site. The study
                                    anticipated that the City’s high rate of growth over the prior years would
                                    continue, and that the population would reach a total of over 22,000 by 2026.
                                    That growth assumption resulted in recommendations for expansion of the
                                    existing facilities with additional needs for future school sites. The 2007
                                    Master Plan showed four potential sites, two east of the existing City Limits,
                                    and two south of the existing City Limits. These were shown as options to
                                    provide flexibility in the choice of future WUSD sites.
                                    The projections for population growth have been adjusted in this General
                                    Plan to roughly half of the population than was anticipated at the time of the
                                    study. Since there was enough facility expansion capacity on the existing
                                    school complex to accommodate 100% growth according to the 2007 Master
                                    Plan, the new population projection of 9,822 by 2030 should not necessitate
                                    further expansion until after 2030.
                                    Other Education Opportunities
                                    Some cities offer a program to educate community leaders regarding
                                    municipal matters. Typically referred to as “City 101”, they provide

information to city’s grass roots leadership about the inner-workings of the
local government. Such programs result in a more informed citizen base that
interacts more effectively with city officials. The programs also pave the way
for mutual support of the citizens with the decision makers and vice-versa.
“Graduates” of “City 101’s” make better contributions when invited to sit on
city boards and committees.
Policies
5.11. The City of Williams remains open to all opportunities to coordinate
          efforts to continuously improve public education.
5.12. The City values a close working relationship with WUSD.
5.13. The City supports the Woodland Community College and will
          facilitate its anticipated expansion.
5.14. The City will consider adding a new program to educate community
          leaders of the services the City provides.
Actions
5.p.      Support WUSD efforts to expand permanent buildings on site to
          decrease the need for temporary buildings.
5.q.      Maintain the City/WUSD relationship to continue sharing school
          and City facilities and services.
5.r.      Create written agreements with WUSD regarding school facility use
          as public parks.
5.s.      Take steps to lay out a program for an annual “Williams 101” that
          targets community leaders and teaches them about all City functions,
          including SOI residents.
Health and Social Services
Health and Medical
Chapter 2 lists the medical facilities that are available to Williams’
citizens. The larger facilities that offer a wider choice of services are
located outside of the City in other municipalities. As the City grows, it
will come to a point where it will reach the critical mass to attract larger
facilities to it.
Local provision of doctor’s offices and clinic space has grown over the
last decade. However, during the initial community input process of this
General Plan, citizen comments indicated that there continues to be a
need for expansion of such services. The City’s plans for the Community
Center as laid out in the 2001 Assessment will work in concert with the
private health industry toward meeting the goal of adequate provision of
                                                                                  This nursing home provides a needed
healthcare services.
                                                                                                     service in Williams.
Social Services
There is also a need in Williams in the area of social services. There appears to
be no central office where citizens can go in the City to become informed of

their options. The plans for the Community Center that were laid out in the
2001 Assessment will take a major step in the beginning to fill gaps. There is
no office or position that the City provides that serves as a point of contact
for social service assistance.
Policies
5.15. The City recognizes there continues to be need to fill gaps in the
         provision of health care within a reasonable distance.
5.16. The City recognizes that there are significant issues regarding access
         to social services for its citizen.
Actions
5.t.     Streamline development approvals by eliminating lengthy review
         processes and allowing staff-level approval for all health and social
         service related uses.
5.u.     Ensure that all staff members understand that health and social
         service providers are a priority for the City so that they may facilitate
         establishment and retention of such uses.
5.v.     Continue to evaluate significant gaps and address those that the
         market has not covered through programming and the Community
         Center.
5.w.     Monitor and reevaluate services provided at the Community Center
         annually and adjust as appropriate.
5.x.     Consider an additional City staff position that can act as a
         clearinghouse of contact information for assistance that is available in
         the City, County, and region.
Growth Management
The City’s land use pattern is compact although it exhibits some
characteristics of sprawl to the south where large rural lots have been divided.
While the extent of such development is not highly apparent or of significant
consequence, it will be important to maintain its compact form as
development occurs. This is so due to the efficiency of extending
infrastructure and providing services, protecting the views of the hillsides to
the west, and generally preserving the small town character.
Haphazard growth is highly inefficient. Costs associated with the provision
of both capital and social infrastructure are much higher than they are for
more compact patterns of development. This is particularly relevant and
important when the community is confronted by limited fiscal resources and
increasing demands for service. In addition to its fiscal consequences, sprawl
encourages the degradation of natural resources by prematurely committing
areas to the impacts of urban development. Phased and orderly growth
mitigates this situation by comprehensively addressing the impacts of
development on the natural systems. Piecemeal development is detrimental to
any type of comprehensive framework. The underlying premise of managed

growth is simply to direct development to areas that are either currently
served or may be efficiently provided with public facilities and services
concurrent with new development. This is based on a desire for Williams to
grow in a fiscally responsible manner.
Growth Path
The existing form of the community is that each of the neighborhoods is
generally contiguous and interconnected. The areas within the City limits
that remain undeveloped include significant acreage planned for industrial
and business uses to the north and south east of I5. West of I5, future
residential is anticipated to the south with future commercial to the north.
There are a total of approximately 2600 acres in the City limits of which
approximately 990 acres are developed and 1600 acres are vacant. There are
several tentative maps that have been approved to the south, west of I5. With
the significant downturn in the housing market, these maps may expire.
Regardless of whether they expire or become active developments, it is clear
that this area is in the City’s growth path. There has been interest in
nonresidential development to the northeast, east of I5. The California
Highway Patrol offices just relocated to that area and will soon be joined by
the new Community College. This development is likely to attract more,
especially uses that can benefit from the location of the College. Areas outside
of the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) in the acreage to the east are also
within the City’s growth path. The areas to the south and to the east of the
City are relatively free of natural barriers.
Future Housing Needs
According to the projected population scenarios, the City is expected to reach
a population of 9,822 persons by the Year 2030. To accommodate the
additional people, an additional 1100 dwelling units are required, which
would mean construction of an average of 55 dwelling units annually.
Expansion of the Sphere of Influence
This plan provides for an extension of the Sphere of Influence. Continually
planning for the future of the City and its growth will help to ensure a high
quality of living and to protect and expand its unique character. The area
proposed for an expansion principally includes those properties that are
within, immediately abutting, or in near proximity to the City limits and
existing SOI. Generally, the expanded area encompasses the properties which
both influence and are influenced by the City of Williams and are within the
City’s growth path to the east and to the south. Figure 5.1, Proposed Sphere
of Influence, is a map of the proposed expansion to the City of Williams
SOI.
The expansion of the existing sphere of influence is necessary and essential to:
●    allow for proper long-range planning for the areas immediately abutting
     and within the influence of the City;

                                          ●    ensure an orderly and logical progression of the urbanized area in the
                                               most fiscally sound manner;
                                          ●    defend the City’s interests with respect to the conservation of resources;
                                          ●    have influence on the type, pattern, and character of development in near
                                               proximity to the community’s corporate boundaries; and
                                          ●    generally protect the health, safety, and welfare of Williams’s residents.
                                          Before expansion of the SOI may become official, there is a series of steps that
                                          must be taken. The State of California requires the following:1
                                          ●    Meet with the County to come to an agreement regarding expansion of
                                               the SOI
                                          ●    Forward the agreement to the state’s local formation commission
                                          ●    Prepare and forward a service plan to the commission
                                          ●    Receive commission certification
                                          ●    Adoption of the agreement by both the City and the County
                                               Agreement between the City and County would give significant weight
                                               to the case, but if agreement cannot be reached, the City could still apply
                                               to the commission requesting expansion. The submission should include
                                               supporting arguments regarding the proposed approach to land use
                                               regulations, including open space preservation; the need for public
                                               facilities and services in the area; and the adequacy of the City to provide
                                               those facilities and services. However, there is a history of collaboration
                                               between the City and the County of Colusa regarding Spheres of
                                               Influence. In 2006 there was a joint meeting with commissioners from the
                                               City of Williams and Colusa and from Colusa County. There was general
                                               agreement that it is important to improve control and coordination
Orderly growth will expand the character       within fringe areas, that developments should be integrated into existing
of Williams rather than change it to look
like“Anyplace, USA.”                           communities rather than isolated from them, and that housing
                                               developments should not occur in areas where the existing infrastructure
                                          is not equipped to meet the needs of its future residents.
                                          Policies
                                          5.17. The City recognizes that it needs to expand its Sphere of Influence to
                                                    advance the City and allow for its growth in a logical, fiscally
                                                    responsible manner.
                                          5.18. The City will facilitate infill development and new development
                                                    within the existing City Limits. Growth within these areas, and the
                                                    expansion of facilities and services to facilitate it, will soon push the
                                                    next logical area of growth beyond the existing SOI. This growth
                                                    will result in the need to further plan for growth.
                                          5.19. The City recognizes that the path of growth is to the south and to
                                                    the east of its existing SOI.

Actions
5y.       Meet with Colusa County to discuss expansion of the SOI with the
          goal of reaching an agreement. Use previous discussions as a basis for
          further steps. Discuss the benefits to the County of cost savings
          because County services will not be needed in the long run for the
          acreage as annexation occurs.
5.z.      Prepare a service plan covering existing and future service and
          facilities needs and addressing the manner in which the City intends
          to provide them within the future City Limits.
5.aa.     Forward both the draft agreement and service plan to the Local
          Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO).
Annexation
Annexation allows the community to extend its municipal services,
regulations, voting privileges, and taxing authority to new territory. It is a
mechanism provided under State law for promoting orderly growth and
urbanization by coordinating land development with construction or
improvement of public facilities and provision of adequate public services
through phased expansion of the City’s corporate limits.
The City’s annexation policies and program should include an ongoing
process of appropriate planning and preparation for future annexations in
compliance with the requirements of State law and consistent with this
General Plan. The City should conduct studies periodically to identify and
                                                                                  Growth potential to the east
monitor the areas designated for development, where land use management is
most needed. These studies should consider anticipated infrastructure
improvements that may create a demand for new urban development. Based
on these studies and evaluation of potential annexation options, an
annexation plan should be developed and periodically updated, which would
become the basis for developing annual or periodic annexation proposals. The
annexation plan should identify specific properties targeted for eventual
incorporation, and should be based on careful research as to the available
utilities and infrastructure and existing land use in the area. Potential
constraints to the development of infrastructure or extension of services
should be a primary consideration.                                               Growth potential to the south
The annexation planning process should be conducted in conjunction with
the review and updates to this General Plan. The Future Land Use Plan
should be updated, as needed, to support the City’s annexation program.
Timely preparation of an annexation plan is essential to identify properties
within the area designated for development that are in the City’s interest to
annex prior to development.
In addition to preparing for City-initiated annexations, the City should
establish clear policies and guidelines to determine when future land owner

petitions for annexation within the designated development area will be
accepted. Potential considerations may include:
●   proximity to the City’s existing service areas and the feasibility of
    extending adequate facilities and services in a timely manner;
●   results of a fiscal impact assessment;
●   capital budget limitations; and,
●   intangible costs and benefits.
Policies
5.20. Annexation will occur prior to or concurrent with development of
         the designated development area to properly plan for and coordinate
         the extension of adequate public facilities and services.
5.21. The City will anticipate and effectively manage its long-term pattern
         of growth in a forward-looking and fiscally responsible manner,
         while balancing the needs of current residents and existing
         infrastructure investments.
5.22. The City will ensure that future growth is closely coordinated with
         infrastructure investments, compatible with existing development,
         environmentally sensitive, and fiscally responsible.
5.23. In order to maximize the efficiency of the existing infrastructure, the
         City will direct growth toward developable and under-utilized areas
         within the designated infill and development areas before additional
         territory is considered for annexation.
5.24. The City will utilize its annexation authority to extend its
         jurisdiction to encompass critical areas, such as major transportation
         corridors, public facilities, and areas provided services subject to the
         policies of this plan, which may require regulatory protection and
         control of development.
5.25. Seek unified revenue sharing agreement with the County for
         streamlining annexations into the City.
Actions
5.bb. The City will establish criteria for considering the suitability of
         requested extensions to the corporate limits within the designated
         urban area.
5.cc.    The City will prepare an annexation plan and conduct associated
         service planning for gradual expansion of the corporate limits and
         extension of facilities and services, where determined feasible and
         beneficial to the City.
5.dd     The City will use of fiscal impact analyses to assess the projected
         costs of providing services and weigh them against the anticipated
         revenues of each annexation proposal, whether initiated by the City
         or a property owner. Fiscal impacts will be assessed on a multi-year
         time frame, recognizing that first-year costs may exceed revenues
         because of up-front service extension costs and capital expenditures,

as well as the lag time before initial collection of taxes and fees.
Intangible benefits of proposed annexations will also be evaluated.

establishing a pattern of land use that minimizes the exposure of community
residents to excessive noise. Policies, implementation measures, and
mitigation options are presented in this chapter to address existing and
foreseeable noise problems.
Purpose
The purpose of this general plan element is to provide a basis for
comprehensive local policies to control and abate environmental noise and to
protect the citizens of Williams from excessive noise exposure.

  Although airports are considered transportation as well as land uses, for the purposes of
noise mitigation, they are better discussed in terms of land use.

                                      The fundamental goals are to:
                                       Provide sufficient information concerning the community noise
                                          environment so that noise may be effectively considered in the land use
                                          planning process.
                                       Develop strategies for abating excessive noise exposure through cost-
                                          effective mitigation measures, in combination with appropriate zoning,
                                          to avoid incompatible land uses.
                                       Protect those existing regions of the planning area whose noise
                                          environments are deemed acceptable, and also those locations throughout
                                          the community deemed “noise-sensitive.”
                                       Protect existing noise-producing commercial and industrial uses in the
                                          City of Williams from encroachment by noise-sensitive land uses.
                                         Protect the existing and future citizens of Williams from the harmful
                                          effects of exposure to excessive noise. More specifically, the goal is to
                                          protect existing noise-sensitive land uses from new uses that would
                                          generate noise levels that are incompatible with those uses, and to
                                          discourage new noise-sensitive land uses from being developed near
                                          sources of high noise levels.
                                         Protect the economic base of Williams by preventing the encroachment
                                          of noise-sensitive land uses into areas affected by existing noise-producing
                                          uses. More specifically, the goal is to recognize that noise is an inherent
                                          by-product of many land uses, including agriculture, and to prevent new
                                          noise-sensitive land uses from being developed in areas affected by

                                      Measuring sound directly in terms of pressure would require a very large and
                                      awkward range of numbers. To avoid this, the decibel scale was devised. The

                                      aspect of the decibel scale is that changes in levels (dB) correspond closely to

human perception of relative loudness. Figure 6.1, Typical A-Weighted
Sound Levels of Common Noise Sources or Environments, shows examples
of noise levels for several common noise sources and environments.
The perceived loudness of sounds is dependent on many factors, including
sound pressure level and frequency content. However, within the usual range
of environmental noise levels,
perception of loudness is
relatively predictable, and can
be approximated by weighting
the frequency response of a
sound level meter by means of
the standardized A-weighting
network. There is a strong
correlation       between       A-
weighted        sound        levels
(expressed     as    dBA)      and
community response to noise.
For this reason, the A-weighted
sound level has become the
standard tool of environmental
noise assessment. All noise
levels reported in this General
Plan element are A-weighted.
Community noise is commonly
described in terms of the
“ambient” noise level, which is
defined as the all-encompassing
noise level associated with a
given noise environment. A
common statistical tool to
measure the ambient noise level
is the average, or equivalent,
sound level (Leq), which
corresponds to a steady-state,
A-weighted        sound       level
containing the same total
energy as a time-varying signal
over a given time period
(usually 1-hour). The Leq is the
foundation of the composite
noise descriptor, Ldn, and shows
very good correlation with

                                  The Day-Night Average Level (Ldn) is based on the average noise level over a
                                  24-hour day, with a +10 decibel weighting applied to noise occurring during
                                  nighttime hours (10:00 P.M. – 7:00 A.M.). The nighttime penalty is based on
                                  the assumption that people react to nighttime noise exposures as though they
                                  are twice as loud as daytime exposures. Because the Ldn represents a 24-hour
                                  average, it tends to disguise short-term variations in the noise environment.
                                  Criteria for Acceptable Noise Exposure
                                  The State Office of Planning and Research (OPR) Noise Element Guidelines
                                  include recommended exterior and interior noise level standards for local
                                  jurisdictions to identify and prevent the creation of incompatible land uses
                                  due to noise. The OPR guidelines contain a land use compatibility table,
                                  which describes the compatibility of different land uses with a range of
                                  environmental noise levels in terms of Ldn. A noise environment of 60 dB Ldn
                                  or less is considered to be “normally acceptable” for residential uses according
                                  to those guidelines.
                                  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also offers guidelines for

Community Noise Survey
To quantify existing noise levels in the quieter parts of the City, a
community noise survey was performed at eight locations, which are
removed from major noise sources. These survey locations were chosen to
provide adequate representation of the entire City. Three of the eight
locations were monitored over a continuous 24-hour period, while the other
five locations were each monitored for two short term periods during
daytime and nighttime hours.             The community noise survey noise
measurement locations are illustrated in Figure 6.2, Noise Monitoring
Locations. The results of the community noise survey are provided in Table

Notes:
   Ldn values for short-term measurement sites (Sites 1-5) were estimated based on average measured values. Two
    measurement sessions were completed during daytime hours for these sites to better assess daytime noise
    exposure – one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
   Ldn for long-term measurement sites (Sites A-C) were calculated based on measured Hourly Leq data.
   Survey was conducted in Williams, California on January 27-28, 2010.

                                                  negatively impact adjoining land uses;

                                                  use; or
                                              Establishment of a new land use that will be negatively impacted by the
                                                  proximity of an existing noise producing use.
                                             The responsibility for noise mitigation should fall to the party creating the
                                             impact. In other words, a noise-sensitive development should be designed to
                                             accommodate noise emanating from an existing use, and noise producing uses
                                             should be designed to reduce noise that will project onto existing noise-
                                             sensitive areas.

Policies
6.1. All noise analyses prepared to determine compliance with the noise
       level standards contained within this Noise Element shall be prepared
       as described in Action 6.
6.2. The City should have the flexibility in its ordinance and policies to
       consider the application of 5 dB less restrictive exterior noise standards
       than those prescribed in Table 6.2, Noise Guidelines for New Uses
       Affected by Transportation Noise Sources, and Table 6.4, Non-
       Transportation Noise Guidelines, in cases where it is impractical or
       infeasible to reduce exterior noise levels within infill projects to a state
       of compliance with their standards. In such cases, the rationale for such
       consideration should be clearly presented and disclosure statements and
       noise easements should be included as conditions of project approval.

     Notes:
     1. Interior noise level standards are applied within noise-sensitive areas of the various land uses, with windows and doors in the closed
          positions.
     2. Where there are no sensitive exterior spaces proposed for these uses, only the interior noise level standard shall apply.
     3. Hospitals are often noise-generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are applicable only at clearly identified areas
          designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
     4. If this use is affected by railroad or aircraft noise, a maximum (Lmax) noise level standard of 70 dB shall be applied to all sleeping rooms
          with windows closed to reduce the potential for sleep disturbance during nighttime noise events.
     5. Due to the noise-generating nature of agricultural activities, it is understood that residences constructed on agriculturally-designated
          land may be exposed to elevated noise levels. As a result, a 65 dB CNEL exterior noise level standard is applied to noise-sensitive
          outdoor areas of these uses.
Actions
6.a. The City of Williams shall adopt an ordinance requirement for an
       acoustical analysis to be prepared with subdivision processes and site
       plan applications. This analysis shall include the following provisions:
       1.      Be prepared by qualified persons experienced in the fields of
               environmental noise assessment and architectural acoustics.
                                       2.    Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient
                                             sampling periods and locations to adequately describe local
                                             conditions.
                                       3.    Estimate projected future (20 year) noise levels, and compare
                                             those levels to the adopted policies of this general plan and
                                             adopted ordinance standards.
                                       4.    Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with
                                             the adopted policies and standards of this general plan and
                                             ordinance standards.
                                       5.    Estimate interior and exterior noise exposure after the prescribed
                                             mitigation measures have been implemented.
                                             The City of Williams shall adopt a local amendment to the
                                             Building Code to address interior noise standards.
                                6.b.   Any extreme noise producer not specifically exempt shall be
                                       discouraged or prohibited by City Codes and policies.
                                Transportation Noise Sources
                                In addition to traffic on I-5 and trains on the CFNR, the ambient noise
                                environment in Williams is defined primarily by traffic on SR 20, local traffic
                                on City streets, commercial and industrial uses, active recreation areas of
                                parks and outdoor play areas of schools, and to a small extent, aircraft
                                operations associated with the Williams Soaring Center. With the exception
                                of the Williams Soaring Center and a small crop dusting airport west of the
                                City, there are no airports within the Williams City Limits, and the nearest
                                known airport is the Colusa County Airport south of the City of Colusa.
                                Because existing traffic volumes on City streets are relatively low, the
                                ambient noise environments in the residential areas of the City – which are
                                somewhat distant from I-5 and SR 20 – are similarly low. These noise sources
                                are discussed individually below.

                                traffic data to develop Ldn contours for these roadways, as well as other
                                smaller roadways in the City as summarized in Table 6.3, Existing Traffic
                                Noise Levels and Contour Distances. Exterior decibel levels should not

Husted Road, I-5, SR 20, E Street, and are the most heavily traveled roadways
in the City. The predicted Ldn at a reference distance of 100 feet and the
distances from the centerlines of the major roadways to the 60, 65, and 70 dB
Ldn contours are summarized in Table 6.3, Existing Traffic Noise Levels
and Contour Distances. The FHWA Model input data for the studied

The noise level standards for noise-sensitive areas of new uses affected by
traffic or railroad noise sources in Williams are shown by Table 6.2, Noise
Guidelines for New Uses Affected by Transportation Noise Sources.
Where the noise level standards are predicted to be exceeded at new uses
proposed within Williams, which are affected by traffic or railroad noise,
appropriate noise mitigation measures should be included in the project
design to reduce projected noise levels to a state of compliance with Table
6.3, Existing Traffic Noise Levels and Contour Distances.
Policies
6.6. For capacity enhancing rail, or the construction of new rail, a
       acoustical analysis shall be prepared. If the project would result in a
       significant noise level increase as defined below, or if the project would
       cause noise levels to exceed the noise standards of Table 6.2, Noise
       Guidelines for New Uses Affected by Transportation Noise
       Sources, noise mitigation measures shall be considered to reduce rail
       noise levels to a state of compliance with the Table 6.1. A significant
       increase is defined as follows:
Pre-Project Noise Environment (Ldn)            Significant Increase
Less than 60 dB                                         5+ dB

Greater than 65 dB                                      1.5+ dB
There are various factors which may affect the feasibility or reasonableness of
the mitigation which shall be considered including the following:
                                                        1.     The severity of the impact;

                                                 within industrial facilities are controlled by Federal and State employee
                                                 health and safety regulations (OSHA), but exterior noise levels may exceed
                                                 locally acceptable standards. Commercial, recreational, and public service
                                                 facility activities can also produce noise that affects adjacent sensitive land
                                                 uses. Those land uses that are sensitive to noise should be prevented from
                                                 locating noise producing uses and should be protected from introduction of
                                                 new noise producing uses. Table 6.5, Non-Transportation Noise

Notes:
1.       The standards in this table shall be reduced by 5 dB for sounds consisting primarily of speech or music, and for
         recurring impulsive sounds. If the existing ambient noise level exceeds these standards, then the noise level
         standards shall be increased in 5 dB increments to encompass the ambient.
3.       Interior noise level standards are applied within noise-sensitive areas of the various land uses, with windows and
         exterior doors in the closed positions.
4.       Outdoor activity areas of transient lodging facilities are not commonly used during nighttime hours.
5.       Hospitals are often noise-generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are applicable only at
         clearly identified areas designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
6.       The outdoor activity areas of these uses (if any), are not typically utilized during nighttime hours.
                                                         Airports/ Aircraft Noise Sources
                                                         The only airstrip located near the City of Williams is located at the
                                                         Williams Soaring Center at the corner of E Street and Husted Road,
                                                         near the eastern City limit. This facility is primarily used for the
                                                         operation of gliders and their tow planes. Although Williams Soaring
   One of the airstrips near Williams
Center aircraft overflights of the City occur, these flights are by small, single-
engine planes, and are infrequent. As a result, the existing ambient noise
environment of the City of Williams is not significantly influenced by aircraft
noise.

       1.    Provide minimum noise insulation to 45 dB CNEL within new
             residential dwellings, including detached single family dwellings,
             with windows and exterior doors closed in any habitable room.
       2.    Provide disclosure statements to prospective buyers that the
             parcel is located in an area which may be exposed to frequent
             aircraft noise events (arrivals, departures, overflights, engine run-
             ups, etc.).

             Office granted to the City of Williams, recorded with the
             Williams Recorder, and filed with the City Planning Department
             shall be obtained from each residential parcel. The Avigation
             Easement shall acknowledge the property location near a source
             of aircraft noise and shall grant the right of flight and
             unobstructed passage of all aircraft into and out of the subject
             Airport.
Industrial Uses (Fixed Noise Sources)
Descriptions of existing fixed noise sources in the City are provided below.
These uses are intended to be representative of the relative noise generation of
such uses, and are intended to identify specific noise sources that should be
considered in the review of development proposals. Site-specific noise
analyses should be performed where noise-sensitive land uses are proposed
in proximity to these (or similar) noise sources, or where similar sources are
proposed to be located near noise-sensitive land uses. Table 6.5, Non-
Transportation Noise Guidelines.
Bar Ale, Inc. Operations at the Bar Ale, Inc. facility consist primarily of
the manufacturing of livestock and equine feeds. Typical noise-producing
equipment associated with the facility includes the main manufacturing
plant, and forklifts and heavy trucks. The plant may operate 24-hours a
day, and produces a noise exposure level of approximately 62 dB Leq at a
distance of 165 feet (from the main plant equipment). This facility is             Industrial area in Williams
located at 1011 5th Street in an industrial area of the City.
The DePue Warehouse Company operates several rice drying and storage
facilities throughout the City of Williams. Known locations include 1700 E
Street, 401 C Street, 602 5th Street, and 5999 Freshwater Road. It is our
understanding that these facilities operate during the rice harvesting season
(approximately October thru February). These facilities were not in full
operation during our noise level measurements (February 2010); however,
loading of dried rice onto a transport truck at the 602 5th Street facility
produced noise exposure of approximately 66 dB Leq and 77 dB Lmax at a
distance of 75 feet. It is assumed that these facilities have the potential to
produce much higher noise exposure during the rice harvest.
Morning Star Packing is a large tomato processing and packing facility
located at 2211 Old Hwy 99 on the southeast corner of the City limits. The
facility processes raw tomatoes into canned tomato pastes and canned diced
tomato products. This facility includes large processing and packaging plants,
substantial storage areas, and a rail spur to the CFNR for transport to and
from the facility. This facility may operate 24-hours a day, and is expected to
be busiest during the primary northern California tomato harvest of June
thru October.
American Commodity Company (ACC) is a large rice drying and storage
facility located at 6133 Abel Road on the east side of the City limits. Like the
DePue Warehouse Company facilities, it is expected that this facility is
busiest during the rice harvest (approximately October thru February). This
facility may operate 24-hours a day. Noise exposure from drying and loading
operations at the facility was measured to be approximately 64 dB Leq at a
distance of 550 feet from truck loading and assumed drying equipment. This
facility may produce substantially higher noise exposure during busier times,
and would be expected to produce significant heavy-truck operations.
The Williams Redi-Mix facility located at 2385 Husted Road is a concrete
batch plant and aggregate/landscape materials supplier. Typical hours of
operations are 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Noise produced by this facility is primarily
associated with plant equipment operation, front loader use, and heavy truck
movements. Typical noise exposure associated with this type of facility is 75
dB Leq and 80 dB Lmax at a distance of 100 feet from the plant, with heavy
equipment operations (e.g., front loader and trucks) producing similar noise
exposure.
Christman Drier is a large rice drying and storage facility located at the
corner of 5th Street and B Street in the central part of the City. Like the
DePue Warehouse Company and ACC facilities, it is expected that this
facility is busiest during the rice harvest (approximately October thru
February). This facility may operate 24-hours a day during peak times.

General Service Commercial & Light Industrial Uses
Noise sources associated with service commercial uses such as automotive and
truck repair facilities, tire installation centers, car washes, loading docks,
corporation yards, recycle center, and hardware and feed stores are found at
various locations within the City of Williams. Many of these sources are
located on E Street, 5th Street, and 7th Street. The noise emissions of these
types of uses are dependent on many factors, and are therefore, difficult to
quantify precisely. Nonetheless, noise generated by these uses contributes to
the ambient noise environment in the immediate vicinity of these uses, and
should be considered where either new noise-sensitive uses are proposed
nearby or where similar uses are proposed in existing residential areas. Table

         thereby keep the use of noise barriers at a minimum.
Parks and Schools
There are several park and school uses within the City limits. These uses are
distributed throughout the City. Noise generated by these uses depends on
the age and number of people utilizing the respective facility at a given time,
and the types of activities they are engaged in. School playing field activities
tend to generate more noise than those of neighborhood parks, as the
intensity of school playground usage tends to be much higher. At a distance

                                     of 100 feet from an elementary school playground being used by 100 students,
                                     average and maximum noise levels of 60 dB (Leq) and 75 dB (Lmax),
                                     respectively, can be expected. At organized events such as high-school
                                     football games with large crowds and public address systems, the noise
                                     generation is often significantly higher. As with service commercial uses, the
                                     noise generation of parks and schools is variable.

                                     sensitive outdoor areas. Mixed-use developments will commonly consist of
                                     residential units on elevated floors above office or commercial uses. As a
                                     result, such uses may not include a clearly delineated noise-sensitive outdoor
                                     area, in which case satisfaction with the City's interior noise level standards
                                     should be considered adequate.

Noise Mitigation Options
Any noise problem may be considered as being composed of three basic
elements: the noise source, a transmission path, and a receiver. The
appropriate acoustical treatment for a given project should consider the
nature of the noise source and the sensitivity of the receiver. The problem
should be defined in terms of appropriate criteria (Ldn, Leq, or Lmax), the
location of the sensitive receiver (inside or outside), and when the problem
occurs (daytime or nighttime). Noise control techniques should then be
                                 selected to provide an acceptable noise environment for the receiving
                                 property while remaining consistent with local aesthetic standards and
                                 practical structural and economic limits. Fundamental noise control
                                 techniques include the following:
                                     Use of Setbacks
                                     Noise exposure may be reduced by increasing the distance between the
                                     noise source and receiving use. Setback areas can take the form of open
                                     space, frontage roads, recreational areas, storage yards, etc. The available
                                     noise attenuation from this technique is limited by the characteristics of
                                     the noise source, but is generally about 4 to 6 dB per doubling of distance
                                     from the source.
                                     Use of Barriers
                                     Shielding by barriers can be obtained by placing walls, berms or other

                                     the source and receiver, and is improved with increasing the distance the
                                     sound must travel to pass over the barrier as compared to a straight line
                                 from source to receiver. The difference between the distance over a barrier
                                 and a straight line between source and receiver is called the "path length
                                 difference," and is the basis for calculating barrier noise reduction.
                                 Barrier effectiveness depends upon the relative heights of the source, barrier
                                 and receiver. In general, barriers are most effective when placed close to
                                 either the receiver or the source. An intermediate barrier location yields a
                                 smaller path-length-difference for a given increase in barrier height than does
                                 a location closer to either source or receiver.
                                 For maximum effectiveness, barriers must be continuous and relatively
                                 airtight along their length and height. To ensure that sound transmission
                                 through the barrier is insignificant, barrier mass should be about 4 lbs./square
                                 foot, although a lesser mass may be acceptable if the barrier material provides
                                 sufficient transmission loss. Satisfaction of the above criteria requires
                                 substantial and well-fitted barrier materials, placed to intercept line of sight to
                                 all significant noise sources. Earth, in the form of berms or the face of a
                                 depressed area, is also an effective barrier material.
                                 Transparent noise barriers may be employed, and have the advantage of being
                                 aesthetically pleasing in some environments. Transparent barrier materials
                                 such as laminated glass and polycarbonate provide adequate transmission loss
                                 for most highway noise control applications. Transparent barrier materials
                                 may be flammable, and may be easily abraded. Some materials may lose
                                 transparency upon extended exposure to sunlight. Maintaining aesthetic
                                 values requires that transparent barriers be washed on a regular basis. These
properties of transparent barrier materials require that the feasibility of their
use be considered on a case-by-case basis.
The attenuation provided by a barrier depends upon the frequency content of
the source. Generally, higher frequencies are attenuated (reduced) more
readily than lower frequencies. This results because a given barrier height is
relatively large compared to the shorter wavelengths of high frequency
sounds, while relatively small compared to the longer wavelengths of the
frequency sounds. The effective center frequency for traffic noise is usually
considered to be 550 Hz. Railroad engines, cars and horns emit noise with
differing frequency content, so the effectiveness of a barrier will vary for each
of these sources. Frequency analyses are necessary to properly calculate
barrier effectiveness for noise from sources other than highway traffic.
There are practical limits to the noise reduction provided by barriers. For
highway traffic noise, a 5 to 10 dB noise reduction may often be reasonably
attained. A 15 dB noise reduction is sometimes possible, but a 20 dB noise
reduction is extremely difficult to achieve. Barriers usually are provided in
the form of walls, berms, or berm/wall combinations. The use of an earth
berm in lieu of a solid wall may provide up to 3 dB additional attenuation
over that attained by a solid wall alone, due to the absorption provided by the
earth. Berm/wall combinations offer slightly better acoustical performance
than solid walls, and are often preferred for aesthetic reasons.
Site Design
Buildings can be placed on a project site to shield other structures or areas, to
remove them from noise-impacted areas, and to prevent an increase in noise
level caused by reflections. The use of one building to shield another can
significantly reduce overall project noise control costs, particularly if the
shielding structure is insensitive to noise. As an example, carports or garages
can be used to form or complement a barrier shielding adjacent dwellings or
an outdoor activity area. Similarly, one residential unit can be placed to
shield another so that noise reduction measures are needed for only the
building closest to the noise source. Placement of outdoor activity areas
within the shielded portion of a building complex, such as a central
courtyard, can be an effective method of providing a quiet retreat in an
otherwise noisy environment. Patios or balconies should be placed on the
side of a building opposite the noise source, and "wing walls" can be added to
buildings or patios to help shield sensitive uses.
Another option in site design is the placement of relatively insensitive land
uses, such as commercial or storage areas, between the noise source and a
more sensitive portion of the project. Examples include development of a
commercial strip along a busy arterial to block noise affecting a residential
area, or providing recreational vehicle storage or travel trailer parking along
the noise-impacted edge of a mobile home park. If existing topography or
development adjacent to the project site provides some shielding, as in the
case of an existing berm, knoll or building, sensitive structures or activity
areas may be placed behind those features to reduce noise control costs.
Site design should also guard against the creation of reflecting surfaces which
may increase onsite noise levels. For example, two buildings placed at an
angle facing a noise source may cause noise levels within that angle to increase
by up to 3 dB. The open end of "U"-shaped buildings should point away
from noise sources for the same reason. Landscaping walls or noise barriers
located within a development may inadvertently reflect noise back to a noise-
sensitive area unless carefully located. Avoidance of these problems while
attaining an aesthetic site design requires close coordination between local
agencies, the project engineer and architect, and the noise consultant.
Building Design
When structures have been located to provide maximum noise reduction by
barriers or site design, noise reduction measures may still be required to
achieve an acceptable interior noise environment. The cost of such measures
may be reduced by placement of interior dwelling unit features. For
example, bedrooms, living rooms, family rooms and other noise-sensitive
portions of a dwelling can be located on the side of the unit farthest from the
noise source.
Bathrooms, closets, stairwells and food preparation areas are relatively
insensitive to exterior noise sources, and can be placed on the noisy side of a
unit. When such techniques are employed, noise reduction requirements for
the building facade can be significantly reduced, although the architect must
take care to isolate the noise impacted areas by the use of partitions or doors.
In some cases, external building facades can influence reflected noise levels
affecting adjacent buildings. This is primarily a problem where high-rise
buildings are proposed, and the effect is most evident in urban areas, where an
"urban canyon" may be created. Bell-shaped or irregular building facades and
attention to the orientation of the building can reduce this effect.
Noise Reduction by Building Facades
When interior noise levels are of concern in a noisy environment, noise
reduction may be obtained through acoustical design of building facades.
Standard residential construction practices provide 10-15 dB noise reduction
for building facades with open windows, and approximately 25 dB noise
reduction when windows are closed. Thus a 25 dB exterior-to-interior noise
reduction can be obtained by the requirement that building design include
adequate ventilation systems, allowing windows on a noise-impacted facade to
remain closed under any weather condition.
Where greater noise reduction is required, acoustical treatment of the
building facade is necessary. Reduction of relative window area is the most
effective control technique, followed by providing acoustical glazing (thicker
glass or increased air space between panes) in low air infiltration rate frames,
use of fixed (non-movable) acoustical glazing or the elimination of windows.
Noise transmitted through walls can be reduced by increasing wall mass
(using stucco or brick in lieu of wood siding), isolating wall members by the
use of double- or staggered- stud walls, or mounting interior walls on resilient
channels. Noise control for exterior doorways is provided by reducing door
area, using solid-core doors, and by acoustically sealing door perimeters with
suitable gaskets. Roof treatments may include the use of plywood sheathing
under roofing materials.
Whichever noise control techniques are employed, it is essential that
attention be given to installation of weather stripping and caulking of joints.
Openings for attic or subfloor ventilation may also require acoustical
treatment; tight-fitting fireplace dampers and glass doors may be needed in
aircraft noise-impacted areas.
Design of acoustical treatment for building facades should be based upon
analysis of the level and frequency content of the noise source. The
transmission loss of each building component should be defined, and the
composite noise reduction for the complete facade calculated, accounting for
absorption in the receiving room. A one-third octave band analysis is a
definitive method of calculating the A-weighted noise reduction of a facade.
A common measure of transmission loss is the Sound Transmission Class
(STC). STC ratings are not directly comparable to A-weighted noise
reduction, and must be corrected for the spectral content of the noise source.
Requirements for transmission loss analyses are outlined by Title 24 of the
California Code of Regulations.
Use of Vegetation
Trees and other vegetation are often thought to provide significant noise
attenuation. However, approximately 100 feet of dense foliage (so that no
visual path extends through the foliage) is required to achieve a 5 dB
attenuation of traffic noise. Thus the use of vegetation as a noise barrier
should not be considered a practical method of noise control unless large
tracts of dense foliage are part of the existing landscape.
Vegetation can be used to acoustically "soften" intervening ground between a
noise source and receiver, increasing ground absorption of sound and thus
increasing the attenuation of sound with distance. Planting of trees and
shrubs is also of aesthetic and psychological value, and may reduce adverse
public reaction to a noise source by removing the source from view, even
though noise levels will be largely unaffected. It should be noted, however,
that trees planted on the top of a noise control berm can actually slightly
degrade the acoustical performance of the barrier. This effect can occur when
high frequency sounds are diffracted (bent) by foliage and directed downward
over a barrier.
In summary, the effects of vegetation upon noise transmission are minor, and
are primarily limited to increased absorption of high frequency sounds and to
reducing adverse public reaction to the noise by providing aesthetic benefits.

outputs. Nearly a century later, rice crop was the largest in California’s
history. The 1950 construction of the Glen Colusa Canal propagated this
trend, bringing more surface water to the region.
Today, a predominance of rice fields continues to populate the 25 square
mile region around Williams. Within Colusa County, the number of
acres devoted to rice farming increased by almost 80 percent between
1990 and 2008 from 83,800 to 150,200 acres.4 The per acre unit
production of rice also increased by over 150 percent during this same
period making rice the most profitable crop in the County. The
primary use of open space in and around Williams is active farming, as
illustrated in Map 7.1, Management Landscape. Rangeland is scattered
throughout the agricultural fields, with a significant patch of wildlife and
natural land reserve to the east of the City.
                                                                                    Several private orchards are located on the

food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops and is available for these uses.
Farmland of Statewide Importance is similar in quality but has minor
shortcomings, such as greater slopes or less ability to store soil moisture.6
As the country has transitioned to denser development patterns, high-
quality farmland has been lost to industrial and urban uses, resulting in
agricultural practices on marginal lands. Protecting high-yielding land is
of local and national importance in meeting the necessary food supply.
As urban development extends to agricultural land, the City should take
an active role in promoting sensible development practices that respect
the rural infrastructure and needs of neighboring farmers and ranchers.
Growth management strategies can include the use of clustered or
“conservation” subdivisions to protect open space while permitting
appropriate residential development intensities. Natural and man-made
buffers can help to mitigate potential conflicts between active farms and
high-density residential development, including the strategic placement
of vegetation and roadways. Setbacks can also reduce the negative
impacts of agricultural impacts, such as aerial spraying, by ensuring a safe
distance from houses to farm fields.

following policies and actions expand on these themes, extending the
functional role of agriculture to cultural ties with the land.
Policies
7.1       Zoning regulations will be used to preserve the rural scale and
          character of the “Agricultural/Rural” zoning district, including
          adequate transitions and buffering areas between different character
          types.
7.2       The history and tradition of local agricultural will be promoted
          through cultural events and programming.
7.3       Agriculture and ranching activities will be supported through
          financial incentives and access to municipal venues and facilities.
7.4       Prime farmland shall be prioritized for agricultural (rather than
          industrial or residential) uses to ensure the most efficient use of land.
7.4a      Properties containing Williamson Act contracts shall have executed a
          Notice of Non-Renewal prior to annexation into the city limits of
          Williams.
7.4b      Work with the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) on
          issues of mutual concern including the conversion of agricultural
          land.
Actions
7.a       Restrict permitted activity and densities in the “Agricultural/Rural”
          zoning district to complement rural character, including low-density
          development and minimal infrastructure requirements. Examples
          include single-family detached homes, manufactured homes, and
          outdoor and entertainment facilities.
7.b       Require additional permitting and approval to develop on prime
          agricultural land.
7.c       Specify bufferyard requirements and lot setbacks that address
          conflicts between agricultural and residential land uses.
7.d       Educate agricultural landowners and establish incentive programs to
          encourage the donation of conservation easements.
7.e       Support and promote activity associated with the private farmer’s
          market located on Seventh Street.
7.f       Consider funding a marketing campaign that promotes the purchase
          of “local” products from the City of Williams and Sacramento Valley
          region.

                               A publication of the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA)
                               entitled Recreation, Park and Open Space Standards and Guidelines includes
                               criteria for the provision of parks and recreation facilities. The criteria are
                               based on a national survey of municipalities of all sizes and geographic
                               regions. These standards serve as a baseline to compare the current service
                               levels against national standards. Many communities perceive these standards
                               as a minimum, hoping to surpass them. Standards are typically calibrated to
                               reflect local participation trends, user characteristics, demographics, climate,
                               natural environment, and other factors specific to each community.
                               Current Parkland Needs (Acreage)
                               Chapter 2, Background Analysis, lists the City’s current inventory of
                               parkland. There are five parks in all, covering a total of 28 acres. Land
                               devoted to public parks is about 2.8% of the City’s inventory of developed
                               property. Four of these parks are classified as neighborhood parks, taking the
                               NRPA size standards and the existing equipment into consideration. In
                               Williams, most of the neighborhood parks exceed the NRPA neighborhood
                               park standards in terms of size. The City currently provides 1.85 acres of
                               neighborhood parkland for every 1,000 persons, which falls within the
                               national standard. The City’s current parkland dedication requirements of
                               one acre per 1,000 population will allow the City to remain within the
                               standard overall. One park, Valley Vista, is classified as a community park.

                               evaluation of park service areas helps to determine whether there is sufficient
                               coverage and where new parks are needed to fill the deficient areas. The
                               NRPA establishes a maximum service area of a quarter mile around a
                               neighborhood park and of one mile around a community park.

covered by a continuation of the City’s current coordination efforts to share
school and City resources. The school is located within a quarter mile of the
homes in the underserved area. The City and Williams Unified School
District have a cooperative relationship with a joint use agreement. In the
future, the City may want to consider adding one neighborhood or pocket
park within the northern neighborhood to augment the school’s
recreational offerings to the neighborhood.
At this time, the City of Williams does not provide any pocket park
services. Pocket parks are recommended by the NRPA to serve relatively
small groupings of the population, with an eighth mile service area and
at a size between a quarter- to half-acre per 1,000 persons. To meet this
standard, 1.32 acres distributed at five sites would need to be added.
Valley Vista is Williams’ sole community park and serves all of Valley
Ranch and the older residential areas to the west to about Ninth Street.
Map 7.4, Community Park Service Area, shows the current one-mile
service area of the community park. The smaller quarter-mile service
area around the park shown in red reflects the additional neighborhood
park service that the park provides. The map indicates that the park
would serve almost the entire eastern Sphere of Influence (SOI) and
beyond, including the two potential future school sites to the east.
However the western portion of the City remains underserved according
to NRPA standards. A second community park located in the southwest
corner of the City, or preferably within the area that is currently in the
SOI south of Hankins Road (but should be annexed in before parkland is
acquired) would cover the current residents and prepare the City for
future growth to the south and to the southwest.
Future Parkland Needs
The City does not currently offer regional park services. Regional parks
are large park facilities that serve several communities. They range in size
from 100-499 acres. The regional park is a natural area or developed area
for a variety of outdoor recreation such as ball fields, playgrounds,
boating, fishing, swimming, camping, picnicking, and trail systems.
NRPA guidelines for these parks are five to 10 acres per 1,000 persons,
but they should not be smaller than 100 acres. Under those guidelines,
Williams does not need to provide regional park services until it reaches
a population that is nearly five times its current size, or at the point
where there is a policy decision made to serve not only the City’s but         Valley Vista Community Park serves as a model

     existing infrastructure and system gaps; future growth patterns; and capital
     improvement budgets. To do so will require a coordinated effort to seek out
     trail opportunities within rights-of-way, utility and drainage easements,
     public access ways, and as dedicated bike lanes along major streets and rural
     roads. Such an interconnected system of bicycle and pedestrian facilities
     accommodates recreation needs while also providing alternative modes of
     travel.
     The California Department of Parks and Recreation has a Statewide Trails
     Office, which establishes a vision applicable to all recreation trails, including
     ones designed and maintained by the City of Williams. The mission is to:
     Promote the establishment and maintenance of a system of trails and greenways
     that serves California’s diverse population while respecting and protecting the
     integrity of its equally diverse natural and cultural resources. The system should be
     accessible to all Californians for improving their physical and mental well-being
     by presenting opportunities for recreation, transportation, and education, each of
     which provides enhanced environmental and societal benefits.11
     The City should seek to fulfill this vision, resulting in health, recreation,
     transportation, clean air, social, economic, educational, energy conservation,
     environmental, and resource protection benefits. The following policies
     augment the land use approach, as outlined in Chapter 3, Land Use and
     Character. Trail and greenway development ties into community design
     principles that promote multi-modal, livable centers catering to pedestrians
     and bicyclists. These types of corridors enhance the system’s overall
     connectivity, a central theme in transportation and land planning.
     Policy
     7.12      A comprehensive, interconnected trail system will offer pedestrian
               walkways, bike paths, and equestrian trails throughout the
               community
     7.13      The creation of inter-city trails will enhance recreational
               opportunities and promote walking as a viable travel mode.
     7.14      The creation of linear greenways will serve as a vehicle to protect
               natural resources and provide for natural scenic corridors.
     7.15      The local trail system will connect local residents to regional, state,
               and federal trail systems.
     7.16      Pedestrian paths will adhere to ADA accessibility guidelines,
               including possible redesign of existing sidewalks, sidewalk curb cuts,
               ramps, and trails.

Actions
7.p     Invest in a multi-use trail over the E Street bridge, allowing for safe
        and accessible, multi-modal travel across the Interstate divide.
7.q     Include provisions in the subdivision regulations to allow for or
        require the construction of off-street trails, including design
        specifications for appropriate surface materials and construction
        practices.
7.r     Prepare a comprehensive trail and greenways master plan that
        identifies the locations of bike lanes, trails, greenways, and pedestrian
        linkages throughout the City. Attention shall be given to identify
        sidewalk improvements in and around Downtown and the well
        established areas of town where roadways may require “retrofitting”
        to accommodate such improvements. Generally, the plan shall:
7.s     Inventory and map all existing trail segments and sidewalks
        throughout the City.
7.t     Identify missing and incomplete segments needed to improve
        continuity, particularly those adjacent to schools, parks, public
        buildings, and other pedestrian generators and attractors, such as
        Downtown.
7.u     Inventory possible accessibility barriers for disabled persons.
7.v     Identify natural areas and other infrastructure corridors within the
        community that could serve as linear linkages and/or greenbelts.
        These areas shall be acquired and developed for recreational use
        and as trails and connections.
7.w     Propose trail extensions that would connect the City’s trail
        network with County, State, and Federal trail systems.
7.x     Recommend appropriate cross sections for different facilities
        including sidewalks, multi-purpose paths, and bike lanes.
7.y     Prepare a near-term capital improvement plan and program for
        those trail or sidewalk segments that would have an immediate
        impact, meaning those by which connections may be made to and
        between significant destinations with relatively little planning and
        investment.
7.z     Identify long-term costs associated with trail maintenance, and
        include these into the capital improvement plan.
7.aa    Based on the results of the above inventory prepare an application
        for the Safe Routes to School Program. Under this program
        Caltrans makes grants available for the construction of facilities
        that improve and enhance the safety of pedestrians and bicycle

Land Development and Subdivision Design
Land use and community design policies directly impact total open space,
site selection criteria, and landscape requirements. Chapter 3, Land Use and
Character, begins to address conservation principles in land planning, a
decision-making process that influences flora and fauna for a service area
extending far beyond the site boundaries.
Open space can be regulated through each land use district, requiring a
specific percentage of open space per square foot of development.
Buildings, parking areas, sidewalks, driveways, or roadways are excluded
from this total. For instance, suburban residential districts would
require more open space than suburban commercial districts, but less
than estate residential districts. The zoning ordinance can incorporate
restrictions that offer sufficient flexibility for profitable development
while preserving the natural environment.
                                                                               Valley Vista Community Park is integrated

are enriched with lush, colorful perennials. Street trees along major roadways
can reduce traffic speeds and increase pedestrian safety, while bioswales in
parking lots can serve as on-site detention basins and increase stormwater
runoff filtration. Many of these functional benefits are coupled with visual
enhancements, improving the City’s quality of life and overall attractiveness
to prospective investors and tourists.
Context
Colusa County’s habitat is characterized by diverse forests to the west and
agricultural lands to the east, as illustrated in Map 7.5, Colusa County Land
Cover. Although the City of Williams is surrounded by farmland with
patches of rangeland, the City has a mixture of mature and newly planted
vegetation dispersed across the community. The older residential
neighborhoods are characterized by canopy trees and elaborate
groundcover, while the newer developments are distinguished by young
trees evenly dispersed. This contrast is underscored when comparing
neighborhoods on the east and west sides of Interstate 5.
Although the City doesn’t have any natural forests, residents are within
close proximity to the Mendocino National Forest, which falls within
Colusa, Lake, Glenn, Mendocino, Tehama, and Trinity counties. 60,000

Wetlands are located throughout Colusa County, but there are relatively few
within the City of Williams. Figure 7.2, Wetlands in the City of Williams,
identifies these locations. Wetlands are characterized by aquatic-type
vegetation and hydrology present.17 Due to their unique and significant
habitats, they are protected by the Federal government 404 permit program,
which requires U.S. Army Corp of Engineers approval before placing fill for
development purposes. Although agricultural uses and grazing are allowed,

                                       Circulation
    Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
    This is one of several other General Plan elements that have been updated as
    part of the City of Williams 2010 Comprehensive General Plan Update
    Program. An effective Circulation Element accurately coordinates estimated
    increases in the intensities of land uses (found in the Chapter 3, Land Use and
    Character Element) with improvements in the circulation system to provide
    sufficient capacity for the resulting increases in travel demand. In
    coordination with this Circulation Element, the Land Use and Character
    Element has helped and continues to improve on the City’s development
    patterns within the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) to improve circulation
    efficiencies. For example, mixed use development has been emphasized in the
    Land Use and Character Element, particularly in the downtown area. This
    allows frequently visited destinations to be accessible by multiple
    transportation modes.
    The Circulation Element has been designed to be consistent with and directly
    related to other elements of the General Plan. In particular, the Future Land
    Use Plan, presented in Chapter 3, Land Use and Character, proposes
    substantial residential and commercial growth and development east of
    Interstate 5. If this development occurs, Williams will more than double in
    size and population, with corresponding increases in trip generation and
    vehicular traffic on streets throughout the City. This Chapter describes the
    improvements that will be needed to accommodate this growth.
    Since traffic levels on the circulation system are one of the major generators of
    noise, the Circulation Element is also related to the Noise Element of the
    General Plan. Traffic safety is an important concern of the Circulation
    Element; similarly with the policies in the Public Safety Element. Factors of
    safety and seismic safety affect the location and design of circulation
    infrastructure, both in terms of structural safety and the need for evacuation
    and emergency routes.
    There are also a number of policies and actions in the Land Use and Character
    Element that relate to the Circulation Element. For example,
       •   Action 3.g of the Land Use and Character Element regarding the
           development of a downtown master plan includes provisions for the use
           of on- and off-street parking in common for certain uses.
       •   Action 3.l provides for streetscape enhancements in the downtown. An
           entire section of the Land Use Element and Character Element is
           devoted to community entryways and corridors.
       •   Action 3.w of this Chapter encourages the development of a corridor
           master plan on 7th Street (Old Highway 99).
       •   In the same vein, Action 8.m-2 of this Circulation Element emphasizes
           the need for the City to collaborate with other agencies in developing a
           master design plan for 7th Street. Components in this design would
           include more detailed plans for amenities, such as separated sidewalks,

                           City of Williams, California
       street trees and other landscaping, street furniture, and other features as
       appropriate.
The Draft Citywide Circulation Study, prepared in 2007 based by Omni-
Means, in October, 2007, was used as a basic improvement needs to
accommodate anticipated growth in Williams. This study was further updated
to coincide with the Draft Land Use and Character Element update by the
Technical Memorandum prepared by Omni Means on March 1, 2012. These
studies includes a complete description and analysis of the City’s circulation
system and incorporates an evaluation of existing transportation facilities, a
buildout development summary, a transportation capital improvement
program and a circulation element with a number of proposed policies and
programs for possible implementation by the City. These studies are
incorporated into this document by reference (refer to Appendices B and C).
Appendix B serves and the list of recommended improvements. Based on
further evaluation of the revised land use scenario for 2010 General Plan
Update, a number of improvements shown in the 2007 Study were shown as
no longer necessary in the 2011 Technical Memorandum
Multi-Modal Strategy
This Circulation Element includes all the State required topics that must be
included in a Circulation Element in addition to identification of issues of
concerns and potential solutions to address them to include the primary
circulation system, the secondary circulation system, and goals, policies, and
programs. Williams circulation system in this General Plan is designed to
accommodate multiple methods of travel including automobile, pedestrian,
bicycle, and public transit. Such a strategy is often called “multi-modal.”
The City’s transportation planning will therefore encourage pedestrian and
bicycle use. Consequently, the City will not design roads simply to
accommodate vehicular traffic during peak demand periods. The City will
design its circulation infrastructure to facilitate a more sustainable proportion
of vehicular and non-vehicular trip. The City will emphasize pedestrian and
bicycle safety over vehicular traffic flow and speed in the downtown area,
residential neighborhoods where higher pedestrian activity is expected.
Circulation Element Organization
A Circulation Master Plan was developed to guide the future expansion of the
City’s circulation system and to define the functional classification of the
system to meet the travel needs of the community. Shown on Map 8.1 is the
City’s Circulation Master Plan.
Roadways
Functional classification designates all streets and highways within the City
Limits and Sphere of Influence (SOI). These categories include Freeway,
Highway, Arterial (Major and Minor), Major Collector, Collector, and Local
streets. Each classification has specific standards and criteria through which
design and routes are developed. These criteria include:

                                      Circulation
      1. Existing and potential development and land use intensities as provided
           under the General Plan Land Use Map;
      2. Expected peak traffic loads;
      3. Potential physical improvements such as road widening; and
      4. Special designations such as scenic routes.
     The following classification system is consistent with national standards, and
    provides a framework for the planning of a city-wide/area-wide
    transportation system. The Freeways and Expressways fall under the
    jurisdiction of Caltrans and hence their construction standards are dictated by
    the policies and standards of Caltrans. Additional definitions for the City’s
    Street Classification System are summarized below:
    Freeways – Characterized by high speeds and limited controlled access,
    freeways primarily serve regional and long distance travel. I-5, the only
    freeway through the City of Williams (controlled and maintained by
    Caltrans), is a four-lane freeway that extends from Mexico to the Oregon
    border, providing regional access to the City of Williams from Redding,
    Sacramento, and the San Francisco Bay Area. This roadway has an average
    daily trip (ADT) rate of approximately 60,000 vehicles. Within the City’s
    Sphere of Influence, I-5 has interchanges at Husted Road, E Street and SR 20.
    Expressways and/or Major Arterials – Have four lanes with restricted
    driveway access, but with a mix of grade-separated interchanges and at-grade
    intersections. SR 20, the only expressway in Williams (controlled and
    maintained by Caltrans), is a state highway facility that traverses in the east-
    west direction through central and northern California connecting Interstate
    Highway 5 with Interstate Highway 80. Regionally, SR 20 serves as an
    interregional auto and truck travel route that connects the Central Valley
    with the cities of Williams, Marysville, Grass Valley, and Nevada City.
    Within the City’s SOI, SR 20 is predominantly a two-lane arterial.
    Minor Arterials – Have four lanes and medium carrying capacity that are
    principally for travel between larger land uses within the community. Husted
    Road and E Street between Husted Road and 6th Street, designated the City’s
    the minor arterials, are currently two-lane roadways that extends east and
    west from I-5, connecting with SR 20 and Old Highway 99 to the west and
    Husted Rd. to the east. The posted speed limit on E Street varies from 25 mph
    to 35 mph. E Street forms all way stop controlled intersections with 7th Street
    and 5th Street. The roadway has half-street improvements as it crosses I-5,
    without any bicycle lanes.
    Major Collectors (Industrial Streets) – Have two lanes that may be upgraded
    to an arterial in the future and usually limit on-street parking to maintain
    smooth flow. Old Highway 99 (7th Street), the only designated Major
    Collector in Williams is a two-lane north south arterial that traverses parallel
    to I-5, and connects to it via the Husted Road interchange ramps. Old

                           City of Williams, California
Highway 99 West traverses through a mixed use commercial and residential
areas. This roadway is designated as 7th Street between B Street and Theatre
Road.
Collector Streets – Have two lanes for carrying relatively low capacity at
slower speeds and are used to connect neighborhoods as well as arterials. A
collector street serves abutting property and carries traffic to and from the
higher street classifications. There are 18 roadway sections within the City’s
SOI that are designated Collectors (see Table 8.1).
Local Streets – Have two lanes that provide access for smaller residential
subdivisions which are characteristic of low speed, low capacity roads that
provide direct access to adjacent land uses and are typically meant only for
local, as opposed to through traffic. These consist of all other City Streets not
designated freeways, expressways, arterials or collector roads.
Roads not listed in the table are designated as Local Streets.

                                            Streets
                                            Local streets are intended to provide direct access to/from adjacent property.
                                            Local streets serving residential areas should ideally carry small volumes of
                                            traffic so that neighborhood residents’ “livability” thresholds are not
                                            exceeded. The City may also consider implementing physical traffic calming
                                            measures and/or enforcing ordinance measures to restrict through truck
                                                       traffic on local streets serving residential areas. Local streets should
                                                       exhibit sound design qualities and should provide easy access to all
                                                       emergency vehicles. City standards for the design of local streets
                                                       should be strictly adhered to.
                                                       LEVEL OF SERVICE THRESHOLD
                                                       The Citywide Traffic Circulation Study quantifies current and
                                                       projected future traffic operations through the determination of
                                                       level of service (LOS). Level of service is a qualitative measure of
                                                       traffic operating conditions, whereby, a letter grade “A” through
                                                       “F” is assigned to an intersection or roadway segment representing
                                                       progressively worsening traffic conditions. For the analysis of
                                                       transportation facilities, LOS D has been taken as the City’s

                                            and intersections currently operate at acceptable levels (see Tables 8.4 and 8.5).

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE FULL BUILDOUT
As listed in Table 8.6 and shown on Map 8.2, 17 intersections are expected to
exceed the City’s acceptable Level of Service, LOS D at the City’s full plan
buildout. These intersections will eventually need to be signalized to
accommodate the City’s land use distribution and growth. Table 8.7 presents
mitigated General Plan buildout with improvements planned in Appendix A
of this Circulation Element. A more specific list of City-wide circulation
system improvements are presented in Appendix A of this document. It is
noted that planned improvements in this Element will mitigate future growth
to a higher level LOS than the City’s acceptable LOS.

                           Truck Access and Routes
                           Trucks play an important role in the movement of goods and the delivery of
                           services. The California Vehicle Code, Section 35701 grants local agencies the
                           authority (by ordinance) to establish Truck Routes. Many communities have
                           established truck routes as a means of reducing conflicts between incompatible
                           uses. By prohibiting or restricting trucks from some residential streets, the
                           noise, safety, and structural pavement deterioration problems caused by
8.14                                                                                      Final May 2012

trucks can be eliminated or minimized. At the same time, it is essential to
ensure adequate truck access to all commercial and industrial locations.
The federal Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA) has
designated certain truck routes through the State of California. I-5 and SR 20
are designated as National Network and Terminal Access, respectively and
described in more detail as follows:
     •   I-5 - National Network (Federal): The National Network (NN) are
         federal highways primarily comprised of the National System of
         Interstate and Defense Highways. The NN routes are not signed for
         STAA trucks access. NN routes.
     •   SR 20 - Terminal Access (State, Local): Terminal Access (TA) routes
         are portions of State routes or local roads that can accommodate
         STAA trucks (defined as truck tractor-semitrailer (or double) that
         conforms to the requirements of the STAA. The State Highway TA
         routes.
Regulations establishing truck routes must not be so strict that they prohibit
efficient movement of trucks within and through the City. On the other
hand, as the City and neighboring communities continue to grow, the need
for regulations prohibiting trucks from interfering with residential livability
will also continue to grow. Designated truck routes within and through the
City include Old Highway 99W, 6th Street, 5th Street, 4th Street, Vann Street
north of E Street and Husted Road are the north-south truck routes. B Street,
C Street and D street east of 7th Street/Old Highway 99W, SR 20 and E
Street are other major east-west truck routes within the City. Map 8.3 shows
the designated truck routes within the City of Williams.
Transit/Bus Service
The Colusa County Transit provides a Dial-A-Ride system with fixed timed
routes to Williams, as well as the communities of Colusa, Arbuckle, Maxwell,
Grimes, Princeton, Sites and Stonyford. The agency also provides out-of-
county medical transportation on an on-call basis to Chico, Davis, Lincoln,
Marysville, Oroville, Roseville, Sacramento, Willows, Woodland and Yuba
City. In addition, they provide curb-to-curb service to the general population
and door-to-door service for disabled passengers.
The Colusa County Transit Agency (CCTA) provides a General Public
Paratransit service to the County of Colusa. It currently (2011) operates a fleet
of six ADA compliant vehicles, with seating capacity of 19 passenger and two
wheelchair positions with 14 fixed routes, a Dial-a-Ride service Monday
through Friday weekdays (7:00 am to 5:00 pm), and a commuter service to
Colusa on Friday. CCTA operates a modern transit office and facility at 715
D Street in Colusa that is well equipped with maintenance, communication,
and storage. It has 11 buses, two medical vehicles and staff support vehicles to
accommodate additional growth and demand in Colusa County. CCTA
meetings are held each month and are open to the public. CCTA also has an
“Unmet Needs” advisory meeting, which is held in December of each year to
 Final May 2012                                                                   8.15

                                       Circulation
     provide input for possible changes that are reasonable to meet. This group is
     made up of service providers and passengers that represent different groups in
     the community.
     CCTA is funded by Local Transportation Funds (LTF), Transportation
     Development Act (TDA), State Transit Assistance (STA), Federal Stimulus
     money and other sources. The recently developed Yuba College Satellite
     Campus and the Williams Migrant Camp are heavy users of CCTA.
     According to Barbara Salazar, General Manager of CCTA (phone
     conversation on January 20, 2011), ridership in Colusa County has dropped in
     recent years from about 280 passengers per day to about 120. However, she
     did indicate that as the economy has started to improve in 2011, ridership is
     increasing. She noted a need for after-hours transit service, such as a taxi
     service. As the City of Williams grows, increased transit service for
     employment, shopping, recreation, and medical appointments will continue
     to increase.
     Bicycle and Pedestrian Circulation
     Williams’ neighborhoods and business districts will be served by a system of
     on and off-street pedestrian and bicycle routes. The bicycle and pedestrian
     path system is intended to connect all areas of the community to all major
     destinations.
     Sidewalks, bicycle/pedestrian paths, and /or bicycle lanes will be required
     along public right-of-way, as directed by the City (refer to Figure 8.1,
     Roadway Cross Sections by Functional Classification). Paths will be used in
     areas where there are opportunities in the same corridor to circulate
     pedestrians and cyclists. There has also been a resurgence of the bicycle as a
     vital mode of transportation as a result of automobile-oriented transportation
     difficulties, economics, recreation, leisure time availability, physical fitness
     needs and concern for the environment. This interest is reflected in increasing
     public pressure for pathways and routes where bicycles can be ridden in
     relative safety.
     Senate Bill 277 (Statutes of 1975) established the California Bikeways Act. The
     Act included provisions requiring the State Department of Transportation to
     establish "recommended minimum general design criteria for the
     development, planning, and construction of bikeways..." Also, Assembly Bill
     1358 (Statutes of 2008), the California Complete Streets Act, requires the City
     to incorporate new provisions for multi-modal transportation, such as bicycle
     and pedestrian facilities into the Circulation Element. Providing a safe and
     convenient system for bicycle and pedestrian circulation is an important
     concern of the Circulation Element.
     PEDESTRIAN ORIENTATION
     Sidewalks provide a relatively safe area for pedestrian movement because they
     are separated from most other forms of transportation. Consistent with recent
     legislation under the American Disabilities Act (ADA), all existing and
     planned pedestrian improvements should allow access to all people and
8.16                                                                 Final May 2012

                            City of Williams, California
comply with the design guidelines as set forth within the Act. The first
priority access for sidewalk improvements should be near schools and school
bus stops. Sidewalk improvements should be constructed in these areas first if
capital improvement projects are undertaken by the City or if assessment
districts are formed. Assessment districts and capital improvement projects for
other purposes, such as street widening, may include the installation of curbs,
gutters, and sidewalks.
The second priority areas for sidewalk improvements shall be in commercial
districts. A considerable network of sidewalks exists in commercial areas of
the City. To further encourage and enhance pedestrian circulation,
conditional approval of any development proposal by the Planning
Commission and City Council needs to include a requirement that the
applicant install curbs, gutters and sidewalks where they do not currently
exist. To provide easier access for wheelchairs, City standards, consistent with
ADA requirements, call for ramps at all street corners.
BICYCLE TRAVEL
Unlike pedestrian travel, bicycle travel is linked directly to roadways, often
with limited or no separation from vehicular travel. Safety is, therefore, one
of the most important aspects to consider when planning bicycle facilities.
Most bikeway-related accidents occur because of unsafe or illegal practices by
bicyclists, which are usually compounded by poor road conditions, and
motorists who are not aware of bicyclists. The leading violations of bicyclists
are 1) riding on the wrong side of the road, 2) failure to yield when entering
the roadway, 3) failure to obey traffic signs and signals; and 4) riding at night
without lights.
BIKEWAY DESIGNATIONS
The term "Bikeway" is used to define all facilities that explicitly provide for
bicycle travel. The Department of Transportation has developed different
definitions that are used to systematically categorize different types of bicycle
facilities. Bikeways, then, can be anything from fully grade-separated facilities
to, simply, signed streets. The three classes of bikeways are Bike Paths (Class
I), Bike Lanes (Class II), and Bike Routes (Class III).
    1. Bike Paths (Class I): Class I Bike Paths are completely separated right-
         of-ways designated for the exclusive use of bicycles. Cross-flows by
         pedestrians and motorized vehicles are minimized. Currently, there are
         no designated Class I bike paths in Williams.
    2. Bike Lanes (Class II): Class II Bike Lanes are restricted right-of-ways
         designated for the exclusive or semi-exclusive use of bicycles. Travel by
         motor vehicles or pedestrians are not allowed; however, vehicle
         parking may be allowed if there is sufficient space available for both
         the bicycle lane and the parking lane. Cross flows by motorists are
         allowed, for example, to gain access to parking facilities or adjacent
         land uses. In most cases, Class II Bikeways require a lane of at least
         four feet of well-maintained pavement for the cyclist to ride on.
 Final May 2012                                                                    8.17
                                        Circulation
         3. Bike Routes (Class III): Class III Bike Routes are shared right-of-ways
              either on the street or on the sidewalk, and are designated by signs
              placed on vertical posts or markings stenciled on the pavement. Any
              bikeway which shares a through-traffic right-of-way with motor
              vehicles and pedestrians is considered a Class III bikeway.
     Bicycle facilities, such as bike paths and bicycle parking racks need to be
     provided throughout the City.
     Map 8.4, Bicycle Circulation Plan, shows the City’s designated bike paths.
     Rail Transportation
     Currently there are no passenger or freight services through Williams. Freight
     trains passes through Williams twice a day.
     Union Pacific: California Northern Railroad (CFNR) Company. CFNR
     operates freight service in Northern California over 250 miles of leased Union
     Pacific rail lines, including those that traverse Williams. CFNR provides
     freight service over the following lines:
     •    Schellville to Napa Junction, to a connection with UP at Suisun-Fairfield
          (23.6 miles);
     •    From Vallejo to Napa Junction to Rocktram (13 miles);
     •    Between a connection with UP at Davis to Wyo to a connection with UP
          at Tehama (110.7 miles);
     •    Branch line from Wyo to Hamilton (19 miles); and
     •    Los Banos to a connection with UP at Tracy (54.7 miles)
     Rail freight includes lumber, wine, beer, food products, steel pipe, agricultural
     products, and construction material. Train traffic generally includes four to
     five trains passing through Williams each day. There are both restricted and
     available railroad siding-loading points in Williams. The restricted sites are
     assigned to specific shippers. The available sites are contracted for through the
     Agent for the CFNR in Sacramento. The following nearby companies in
     Colusa County have loading and uploading operations specifically designed
     for their business operations:
     •    Morning Star Tomatoes, which is the largest tomato paste plant in the
          world; and
     •    Colusa County Cannery, which is located approximately one mile south
          of the City limits and includes 1,000 foot, dual-directional siding.
     Available sidings in Williams include:
     •    One team siding is available at the corner of 5th Street and E Street; and
     •    The 10-acre Plank Industrial Park located near the South Interchange
          (Husted and I-5) has dedicated spur right-of-way along 200 feet of the
          industrial park.
8.18                                                                  Final May 2012

                           City of Williams, California
While no studies or plans have been developed to date, establishing a rail-
transit link as part of the transportation corridor between the Williams area
and the Bay and the Sacramento areas would facilitate the long-term economic
growth of the area. Rail transit also offers the potential for more comfortable
and expedient alternatives for the movement of people and products between
the Williams and the Bay Area. This should be a consideration for planning
over the longer-term.
Aviation
The Williams Soaring Center is a small, private glider airport, which is located
along the east side of Husted Road north of its intersection with E Street. The
soaring center has a 2,300 foot paved runway paralleling Husted Road.
The Colusa County Airport is located 12 miles and is about 20 minutes from
Williams. It has a 3,000 foot asphalt runway that accommodates twin engine
and small jet aircraft and serves all general aviation activities including crop
dusters, business/commercial aircraft, emergency aircraft, law enforcement
aircraft besides personnel use aircraft. There are long term plans to extend the
runway another 700 feet for safety purposes. The general aviation airport
offers management, fuel, parking, and car rental services.
Sacramento International Airport is the nearest airport to Williams that
provides commercial airline service. It is known as the gateway to Northern
California destinations, major cities across the U.S., and the world. Passenger
service is provided by 13 major carriers and one commuter airline.
Complete Streets
“Complete streets” are those designed to support safe, attractive, and
comfortable access and travel for all users, whether in motor vehicles, on foot,
on bicycle, or using the public transit. The City will require complete streets
in all new neighborhoods and will improve existing streets to be more
complete in accommodating bicycle and pedestrian movements, as funding is
available. Improvements required for complete streets depend on the type of
street. While all streets will be required to have sidewalks for pedestrians, the
required bicycle improvements will vary. Public transit improvements,
including bus stops and pullouts, should be focused in the downtown area as
service becomes available.
Street Patterns
A community’s street and block patter defines the usefulness of its
transportation network for multi-modal mobility. The 2010 General Plan
requires that development within new growth areas be served by a well-
connected street pattern with small blocks and few or no cul-de-sacs. As future
development occurs, the layout of Williams’ new streets and blocks will
significantly improve the efficiency of the City’s circulation system for all
modes of travel.
The traditional grid street pattern is one approach for ensuring a highly
connected neighborhood. However, modifications to the grid pattern could

                                       Circulation
     also provide a highly connected transportation network (Refer to Figure 8.2).
     In general, highly connected street patterns characterized by:
     •    A dense system of parallel routes, both east-west and north-south, with
          many streets providing through connections;
     •    Minimal use of cul-de-sacs;
     •    Frequent intersections; and,
     •    Frequent points of access.
     Goals
     The City’s General Plan Circulation Element goals are intended to provide
     the overall direction desired by the City for planning and implementing the
     expansion of their circulation system, which meets the changing travel
     demands of their community. The recommended circulation policies will
     establish the link between the adopted goals and the implementing programs,
     and guide how the programs will actually be implemented. The programs,
     themselves, are the specific action items that will accomplish the
