GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
INTRODUCTION
The Housing Element of the General Plan is a comprehensive statement by the City of Dunsmuir of its current and future housing needs for all income levels and proposed actions to facilitate the provision of housing to meet those needs. The policies contained in this element are an expression of the statewide housing priority to allow for the "attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every Californian," as well as a reflection of the unique concerns of the community. The purpose of the Housing Element is to establish specific goals and policies relative to the provision of housing, and to adopt an action plan toward this end. In addition, the element identifies and analyzes housing needs, resources and constraints to meeting those needs.
The City of Dunsmuir Housing Element is based on five strategic goals:
1)	Provide for a variety of housing types and cost for all segments of the population.
2)	Ensure that the City’s development standards and/or processing requirements are not a constraint to the development of affordable housing.
3)	Ensure persons are provided a choice of housing locations within the community regardless of age, race, color, national origin, religion, gender, family status, or disability.
4)	Ensure that the quality, safety, and livability of housing in the city is continually maintained or upgraded, and that dilapidated units that cannot be improved are replaced.
5)	Pursue sustainable development and energy efficiency for new residential development and existing housing stock.
In accordance with state law, the Housing Element is to be consistent and compatible with other General Plan elements. Additionally, the Housing Element is to provide clear policy and direction for making decisions pertaining to zoning, subdivision approval, housing allocations, and capital improvements. State law (Government code Sections 65580 through 65589) mandates the contents of the Housing Element. By law, the Housing Element must contain:
•	An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to meeting those needs.
•	A statement of the community's goals, quantified objectives, and policies relevant to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
•	A program that sets forth a five-year schedule of actions that the local government is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the Housing Element.
The housing program must also identify adequate residential sites available for a variety of housing types for all income levels; assist in developing adequate housing to meet the needs of very low-, low-, and moderate-income households; address governmental constraints to housing
maintenance, improvement, and development; conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing stock; and promote housing opportunities for all persons.
Even though the focus of the Housing Element will be on lower- and moderate-income households, the element must also address the housing needs and policy issues for the entire community and be consistent with the adopted policies of the rest of the General Plan. Thus, the Housing Element's focus is to balance the desires of residents, maintain neighborhood character, manage traffic, and minimize visual and other impacts of new development, while addressing the needs of low- and moderate-income households and special needs groups.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS
State law requires jurisdictions to make a diligent effort to achieve participation by all segments of the community in preparing a Housing Element. The Housing Element was developed through the combined efforts of City staff, the Planning Commission, the City Council, and the City's consultant. Community input was solicited at a public workshop with the Planning Commission on January 22, 2014, during the drafting of the Housing Element. Prior to this workshop the City contacted various housing-related organizations through direct mailings and the community through public notices in the local newspaper. Three members of the public attended. The Planning Commission had a few questions regarding adequate land inventory sites and the required rezoning program from the 2009 Housing Element. Commission members also had questions about emergency shelters and sought clarification as to whether emergency shelters were just for shelter after a natural or manmade disaster.
The City continued to solicit community feedback upon completion of the draft through public hearings of the Planning Commission and City Council. Consistent with Government Code Sections 65090 and 65091, public notices were advertised in the Dunsmuir News at least 10 days prior to the hearings. Further, in an effort to allow all economic segments of the community ample time to review and comment on the draft, the City placed copies for review at Dunsmuir City Hall and the Dunsmuir Public Library for approximately 60 days. On March 9, 2016, as part of the regular Planning Commission meeting, the Planning Commission recommended to the City Council that the housing Element be sent to HCD for the initial review. During that meeting, two members of the public made comments regarding Housing Element and housing in the City. These comments involved some landlords in the City excluding low-income renters in their projects, and where would future housing be placed. On March 17, 2016, as a part of the regular City Council meeting, the City Council approved the sending of the Housing Element to HCD for its initial review. No public comments were made during this meeting.
Special interest groups that received direct mailings during the Housing Element update process were:
•	Golden Umbrella
•	Karuk Tribe
•	Klamath Tribe
•	Modoc Tribe
•	Pit River Tribe
•	Quartz Valley Indian Community

•	Wintu Tribe of Northern California
GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
State law requires that the Housing Element contain a statement of "the means by which consistency will be achieved with other general plan elements and community goals" (California Government Code, Section 65583[c] [6] [B]). This requires an evaluation of two primary characteristics: (1) an identification of other General Plan goals, policies, and programs that could affect implementation of the Housing Element or that could be affected by the implementation of the Housing Element; and (2) an identification of actions to ensure consistency between the Housing Element and affected parts of other General Plan elements.
The remainder of the City's General Plan comprises the following seven elements: (1) Land Use; (2) Open Space and Conservation; (3) Circulation; (5) Safety; (6) Noise; and (7) Historic Preservation. The Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan elements and is entirely consistent with the policies and proposals set forth by the General Plan. As portions of the General Plan are updated in the future, the General Plan (including the Housing Element) will be reviewed to ensure internal consistency is maintained. This includes any future update of the Safety and Conservation elements consistent with Government Code Section 65302 (per Assembly Bill (AB) 162). If any disadvantaged unincorporated communities are identified in the City's sphere of influence due to analysis required to comply with Senate Bill (SB) 244, the City will amend the Land Use Element per SB 244 requirements.
REVIEW OF PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
An important aspect of the Housing Element is an evaluation of programs included in the previously adopted Housing Element. The evaluation provides valuable information on the extent to which programs have been successful in achieving stated objectives and addressing local needs, and the extent to which these programs continue to be relevant in addressing current and future housing needs in the City of Dunsmuir. The evaluation also provides the basis for recommended modifications to programs and the establishment of new objectives in the Housing Element. Appendix A, Housing Programs Implementation Summary, contains an analysis of the City's programs for the prior planning period.
2014-2019 GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
This section of the 2004-2019 Housing Element presents the City of Dunsmuir's updated goals, policies, and programs relative to the development, improvement, and maintenance of housing in the city during the 2014-2019 planning period. These goals, policies, and programs supersede the previous programs (i.e., those evaluated in Appendix A).

In general, housing goals express the desired future conditions for which specific actions are directed. The City's goals are ideals that have been determined by the citizens as desirable and deserving of community time and resources to obtain. Policy statements are more specific and have a shorter range. Programs are action statements that are more specific still and provide well-defined guidelines for decision-making and implementation.

QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
Table 1 summarizes Dunsmuir's quantified objectives for the 2014-2019 planning period. These objectives represent a reasonable expectation of the maximum number of new housing units that will be developed and conserved, and the households that will be assisted over the 2014-2019 planning period based on policies and programs in this document. These objectives have been identified with reference to the Regional Housing Needs Allocation prescribed by the California Department of Housing and Community Development. (See Table B-49 and related discussion.)

Responsibility: City Administrator and Building Department Financing: General Fund Timing: Ongoing	There have been no developer inquiries during the planning period that would have initiated implementation of this program.	Continue.
Program HE. 1.1.2: Encourage the development of affordable housing by maintaining low fee requirements. When fee increases are deemed necessary, lower fees will be maintained, whenever possible, for affordable housing projects. Responsibility: City Council Financing: General Fund Timing: Ongoing	The City increased its sewer and water connection fees in 2011 by $53 and $20, respectively. These fees were maintained in 2012. Overall, the City's fees remain low and do not discourage the production of affordable housing.	Modify to specifically address extremely low-income households and continue.

Program HE.1.1.3: Upon submittal of residential development plans, the City will encourage and support those plans which include lower income housing in areas appropriate to the needs and desires of the population it would serve. "Encourage and support" as used herein means: •	Give priority to processing of affordable housing projects, taking them out of submittal sequence if necessary to receive an early hearing date; •	Consider spreading development fee costs over a 3-5 year payment period to help reduce initial impact, at time of project review; •	Provide density bonus or other concessions in accordance with Government Code Section 65915; •	Allow phasing of infrastructure whenever possible at time of project review; and •	Any other practical actions on the part of the City that will help keep development costs low and protect housing affordability. Responsibility: Building Department and Planning Commission Financing: General Fund Timing: Ongoing	There were no lower-income housing development plans submitted during the planning period that would have initiated implementation of this program.	Modify and continue. Priority processing will be removed from the program. It isn’t necessary in Dunsmuir due to the very low level of development in the city. This program will also be modified to specifically address extremely	low-income households.
Program HE.1.1.4: Pursuant to Government Code §65589.7, the City will develop specific procedures to grant priority sewer and water service to those residential developments that include units affordable to lower income households.

There were no lower-income housing development plans submitted in 2012. The City will continue to meet with organizations and agencies when potential projects or new funding opportunities arise.	Modify to change timing to annually or as appropriate and continue.
Program HE.1.1.5: Given the lack of vacant, developable land in the City that is suitable for multifamily housing, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow for residential use of properties in the Central Commercial (C-2) district without a use permit. However, in each case residential use will be restricted to upper stories with the ground floor reserved for commercial purposes. Responsibility: Planning Commission and City Council Financing: General Fund Timing: February 2011	Development of residential uses on the second floor in the C-2 district without a use permit is currently allowed in practice in the city.

Due to funding constraints, the Zoning Ordinance has not yet been amended as described. Nevertheless, the City intends to make necessary revisions to its Zoning Ordinance as soon as funding permits.	
Program HE.1.2.2: Pursuant to SB 2, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to include separate definitions of "supportive housing", "transitional housing" and "emergency shelters" consistent with Sections 50675.14, 50675.2 and 50801 of the California Health and Safety Code. The City will also amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow transitional and supportive housing as a residential use subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone without undue special regulatory requirements. Further, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow emergency shelters by right (i.e., without a use permit and subject only to the same development and management standards that apply to other allowed uses) in the Central Commercial (C-2) zone.

Appendix B
Housing Needs Assessment


APPENDIX B - HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The Housing Needs Assessment provides a demographic profile of the City of Dunsmuir by analyzing the following types of information: population trends, household income and poverty, special housing needs, housing characteristics, costs and conditions, constraints to development, and resources and opportunities.
The US Census, which is completed every 10 years, is an important source of information for the Housing Needs Assessment. It provides the most reliable and in-depth data for demographic characteristics of a locality. The California Department of Finance (DOF) is another source of valuable data that is more current than the Census. However, DOF does not provide the depth of information that can be found within the US Census Bureau reports. Whenever possible, DOF data and other local sources were used in the Housing Needs Assessment in order to provide the most current profile of the community.
The 2010 Census did not collect information in several categories that are required for the Housing Needs Assessment. Where this is the case, historical DOF data is used. Where DOF data is not available, 2000 Census information is retained. In cases where this is not feasible or useful, this assessment references US Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) data. The ACS provides estimates of numerous housing-related indicators based on samples averaged over a five-year period. Due to the small size of the sample taken in Dunsmuir, the estimates reported by ACS have large margins of error. Where ACS data is used, the numbers should not be interpreted as absolute fact, but rather as a tool to illustrate general proportion or scale.
The data presented in the Housing Needs Assessment will not only guide the development of housing goals and policies, but will also be integrated into the body of the Housing Element to present the current status of housing and housing-related issues in the City of Dunsmuir. Definitions of the various US Census Bureau terms that are used throughout this document have been included in Appendix C, Glossary of Terms, for clarification.
The needs assessment is organized into three main sections. The first section focuses on demographic information, such as population trends, ethnicity, age, household composition, income, employment, housing characteristics, general housing needs by income, and housing needs for special segments of the population. This first section outlines the characteristics of the community and identifies those characteristics that may have significant impacts on housing needs in the community.
The second section identifies possible governmental and non-governmental constraints to housing development in Dunsmuir. The City has planning, zoning, and building standards that guide and affect residential development patterns and influence housing availability and affordability. There are also environmental and housing market conditions that affect the location, availability, affordability, and type of housing that is constructed. The "non-governmental" influences include such factors as: the availability and cost of financing, land and materials for building homes; natural conditions that affect the cost of preparing and developing land for housing; and the business decisions of individuals and organizations in home building, finance, real estate, and rental housing that impact housing costand availability.
The third section identifies the resources and opportunities for affordable housing in the city, which includes an inventory of adequate sites for affordable housing, potential funding resources for housing programs, and a description of the current housing programs that are available to provide affordable housing to the residents of Dunsmuir.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
Population and Household Characteristics
The City of Dunsmuir is a small town with a 2013 population of only 1,630. The city's population decreased by approximately 14 percent between 2000 and 2010 and, based on estimates by DOF, remained nearly constant between 2010 and 2013. The City's population is expected to hold relatively steady or decrease slightly for the duration of the current planning period. According to the 2010 Census, white residents comprise the majority of the city (87.5 percent), followed by Latinos or Hispanics (8.3 percent).
Although the 2006-2010 ACS estimates that the city's median income increased by approximately 53 percent between 2000 and 2010, approximately 69 percent of its households have incomes below the low-income ceiling. The city's poverty rate is approximately 22.9 percent, with 44 percent of female-headed single-parent households below the poverty level. The unemployment rate is estimated to be approximately 20.4 percent, which is slightly higher than either the county's rate (13.4 percent) or the state's rate (10.1 percent,.
Special Needs Housing
Between 2000 and 2010, the retirement age group (55 to 64, increased by approximately 62 percent. The majority of seniors in Dunsmuir own their home (73 percent). Most people with disabilities have a physical disability. Single-parent households make up approximately 12 percent of all households, while approximately 8 percent of total households are female-headed households.
Housing Characteristics
Dunsmuir's housing stock is somewhat older and in need of rehabilitation. According to a 2005 housing conditions survey, the majority of Dunsmuir's housing stock is in need of rehabilitation (65.5 percent), with an additional 59 units (6.9 percent, considered dilapidated and possibly in need of replacement.
According to the US Census, Dunsmuir experienced a 6 percent increase in the number of housing units between 2000 and 2010, for a total of 1,233 units in 2010. Construction trends over the past 13 years suggest very little growth in the city. The US Census also indicated that most of the increase in the city’s housing stock was due to multi-family home construction (99 new units), with no single-family homes added to the housing stock.
Housing Constraints
Governmental Constraints
Development standards in the city do not necessarily constrain the development of affordable housing. Existing zoning requirements, fees, processing times and development requirements do not appear to constrain the production of housing units. The City has adequate land to meet its 2014-2019 Regional Housing Need Allocation.
Non-Governmental Constraints
In early 2014, vacant land prices ranged from approximately $36,765 to $ 176,371 per acre for land zoned for single-family uses. Construction costs for a good quality construction single-family home
B-2
are estimated to be between $187,633 and $344,753 depending on the size and location of the home.
REGIONAL CONTEXT
The City of Dunsmuir is located at the south end of Siskiyou County, approximately 40 miles south of the City of Yreka, the county seat, and 45 miles north of the City of Redding in Shasta County. The city straddles Interstate Highway 5 in a north-to-south direction, and both the Sacramento River and the Union Pacific Railroad run through the town. The city was established in the late 1880s when a rail line was built through the upper Sacramento River Canyon. In the 1950s, Dunsmuir was the largest town in Siskiyou County with a population of over 5,000 people. However, the conversion to diesel trains dramatically reduced the rail workforce in Dunsmuir by approximately 50 percent, and the City’s population fell considerably to less than 2,000 people. The population has fluctuated over the years, but has generally continued to decline. The modernization and decline of both the rail and timber industry and lack of replacement jobs have been the principal causes for the fall of the population over the last two decades. The steep topography of the Sacramento River Canyon, coupled with the physical constraints of developing near Interstate 5 and the railroad, further limits the opportunities for the development of new residential subdivisions in the city, and contributes to the suppression of population growth.
POPULATION TRENDS
Population Growth
The population of the City of Dunsmuir in 2013 is estimated by the DOF to be 1,630. The population decreased from 1,923 in 2000 to 1,650 in 2010, or by 14 percent. The DOF estimates that the city's population further declined by 1 percent, or by 20 persons, between 2010 and 2013. Although negative growth is unusual for the state of California as a whole, it is fairly common for many communities in rural Siskiyou County where a loss of forestry-related jobs over the past few decades has driven the population elsewhere in search of employment. Table B-1 shows population growth rates for communities in Siskiyou County from 2000 to 2013.

Population Projections
Although this negative growth is considerably lower than is typical of California's more urbanized centers, it is fairly common for rural Siskiyou County, where a shortage of economic opportunities deters growth.
The DOF provides projections for all counties through 2060 but does not include city-level data. Table B-2 shows the expected population growth for both the incorporated and unincorporated portions of Siskiyou County between 2000 and 2050. Based on DOF projections, the county is expected to experience an overall annual growth rate of less than one tenth of 1 percent. Based on the City’s historic growth rate and the current economic downturn, it is likely that the City’s future growth rate will resemble the growth rate projected for the county.

Age Characteristics
The distribution of Dunsmuir’s population by age group is shown in Table B-3. As individuals age, their lifestyles, household composition, living preferences, and income levels tend to change as well. For example, young adults (18-34) typically move more frequently and earn less than older adults. As a result, younger adults generally are not ready, or cannot afford, to purchase homes and instead look for rental units to meet their housing needs. In contrast, middle-aged residents (35-54) typically have higher earning potential and higher homeownership rates. Residents approaching retirement age or recently retired (early 60s to mid-70s, tend to have the highest rates of homeownership. After individuals retire, many look for smaller homes on properties that are easier to maintain, or for residential communities that cater specifically to their lifestyles, needs, and preferences.

B-4
The age distribution of the City's population has shifted between 2000 and 2010 (see Table B-3). The number of residents between the ages of 55 and 64 increased by approximately 62 percent, while the number of residents 65 years and older decreased by approximately 22 percent. Other significant changes include declines in the number of residents between the ages of 15 and 24 (approximately 34 percent decline), and between the ages 35 and 44 (approximately 36 percent decline). The number of residents less than 5 years old increased by approximately 20 percent. In general, shifts in age distribution likely reflect aging demographics within the community of Dunsmuir and a lack of jobs for young and mid-career earners.

HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
A household is any group of people living together in a residence, whether related or unrelated. A survey of household characteristics is useful to determine household size trends, income, overcrowding or under-utilization of housing, and the number of special needs households such as large families and female-headed households.
B-5
According to the US Census, there were 763 households in the City in 2010. Approximately 55 percent of the households were owner-occupied, while the remaining 45 percent were renter-occupied.
In 2013, the DOF estimated the average household size in the City of Dunsmuir to be 2.14 persons per household. Large households (i.e., those with five or more persons, comprised approximately 5 percent of households in the city at the time of the 2010 Census, while three- or four-person households constituted approximately 22 percent.
Household Size
Household size by tenure is shown in Table B-5. Most households, both owner- and renter-occupied, were inhabited by one or two persons in 2000. The total number of both owner-occupied and renter-occupied households declined between 2000 and 2010. Owner-occupied households declined by approximately 67 households, while the number of renter-occupied households declined by approximately 37 households. Despite the overall decline in households, the proportion of each category remained relatively static.

Household Growth
Table B-6 shows household growth trends (by occupied housing units, from 2000 to 2010 for the City of Dunsmuir. During this period, the number of households in the city decreased by approximately 12 percent, or 104 units. While several more units may have been constructed during this period than reported above, many serve as vacation homes, and as such, are not considered "occupied" for the purpose of the Census. In fact, because Dunsmuir has
B-6
considerable draw as a tourist destination, the City has a very high percentage of "vacant" housing units (31 percent at the time of the 2010 Census). The actual number of housing units, both occupied and vacant, is estimated by the DOF to be 1,233 in 2010.

Table B-8 illustrates the number of households in each income group based on the 2010 Census. Approximately 69 percent of the City's households have incomes at or below the low-income limit, with approximately 22 percent of all households in the extremely low-income category (195 households). An additional 18 percent of households have earnings in the moderate-income category, while the remaining 13 percent have earnings in the above moderate-income category.

Poverty
The state of California publishes annual income limits for each county that are used to determine eligibility for assisted housing programs within that county. Further, the California Health and Safety Code requires that limits established by the state for the low-, very low-, and extremely low-income categories will be the same as those in the equivalent levels established by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for its Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program. It is important to note that the 2010 median household income reported in Table B-7 is not the same as the median family income established by the state in 2015 and reported in Table B-9.

Table B-10 shows the poverty rates for various age groups, as well as for single-parent households, in the city. The poverty rate is the percentage of people in a given group that live below the poverty level out of the total population. The City's overall poverty rate is approximately 23.1 percent, with 97 persons under 18 years of age living below the poverty level.
The poverty rate is substantially higher for individuals in female-headed single-parent households than it is for other households.The "percent below poverty level" illustrates the proportion of each subpopulation out of the total living below poverty level. This column indicates that approximately 44 percent of all households with children under the age of 18 that are living in poverty are headed by single-parent females, while approximately 56 percent of these households are headed by two parents.

Employment
Table B-11 illustrates labor force information, including that approximately 80 percent of the labor force in the city is employed. Thus, the unemployment rate is approximately 20 percent. While this number reflects high unemployment in the city in the midst of a major global recession, it is also higher than that of either Siskiyou County or the state.

The region's fastest-growing occupations are listed in Table B-12. While this information is not specific to the city, it is nevertheless applicable because residents of Dunsmuir work both within and outside of the City of Dunsmuir. According to the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), the 2013 median income for Siskiyou County is $57,900, which, assuming an annual work schedule of 2,080 hours, equals $27.83 per hour. Of the ten fastest-growing occupations, only two—physical therapists and management analysts—have a median hourly wage that is on par with the County's median hourly wage. Table B-13 notes the County’s largest employers by city. Employment industries and median incomes within the City of Dunsmuir are provided in Table B-14.

Commute
Commute distance and travel time is an important factor in housing availability and affordability and is also an indicator of jobs/housing balance. Communities with extended commutes generally have a poor jobs/housing balance, while communities with short average commutes tend to have a strong jobs/housing balance. The burden of the additional costs associated with extended commuting disproportionately affects lower-income households who must spend a larger potion of their overall income on fuel. This, in turn, affects a household's ability to occupy decent housing without being overburdened by cost.
Table B-15 indicates that the vast majority of Dunsmuir residents work in the city or in nearby McCloud, Weed, or Mt. Shasta, as the travel time to work for more than 75 percent of Dunsmuir residents is less than 25 minutes. The City of Mount Shasta is 12 miles from Dunsmuir, whereas the City of Weed is 19 miles away, and the City of McCloud is 17 miles away.

SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSEHOLDS
Certain groups encounter greater difficulty finding sound, affordable housing due to their special needs and/or circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one's employment and income, family characteristics, disability and/or age. A focus of the Housing Element is to ensure that all persons in the city, regardless of circumstance, have the opportunity to find decent and affordable housing.
State Housing Element law identifies the following "special needs” groups: seniors, persons with disabilities (including those with developmental disabilities), female-headed households, large households, homeless persons, and farmworkers. This section provides a discussion of housing needs for each particular group.
Senior Population
The limited incomes of many elderly people make it difficult for them to find affordable housing. Further, many seniors also have physical disabilities and/or dependence needs that limit their selection of housing. According to the 2010 Census, 210 persons in the City of Dunsmuir are 65 years and older. These 210 persons account for approximately 27 percent of the total population of the city. The majority of seniors own their own homes. As shown in Table B-l 7, approximately 73 percent of senior households live in owner-occupied housing—an increase from 66 percent in 2000. US Census

Persons with Disabilities
Table B-19 illustrates the population of persons with disabilities who may require housing with special features such as wheelchair ramps, special doorbells, roll-in showers, high-set toilets, or other adaptive devices or medical equipment. The majority of individuals in the city with disabilities are in the working age group (16 to 64). Most of the disabilities in this group are either physical (20.3 percent) or employment-related (20.7 percent). Table B-20 reports employment status for 16-64-year-old persons with a disability. Of total working age residents with a disability, 116 persons are employed.

Note: Although the Siskiyou County 5th Cycle Housing Element Data Packet provides working age residents for ages 5-64, it assumes that there are no working age residents below the age 16 years old.
Persons with disabilities typically have special housing needs because of their fixed or limited incomes, the lack of accessible and affordable housing that meets their physical and/or developmental capabilities, and the higher health costs associated with their disabilities. According to the 2000 Census, 1,082 Dunsmuir residents, or approximately 56.3 percent of the population, have some type of disability. Of these persons, 252 are age 65 years or older.
Living arrangements for disabled persons depend on the severity of the disability. Many persons live independently with other family members. To maintain independent living, disabled persons may need special housing design features, income support, and in-home supportive services for persons with medical conditions.
Persons with Developmental Disabilities
Senate Bill (SB) 812 requires the City to include the needs of individuals with a developmental disability within the community in the special housing needs analysis. According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code a "developmental disability" means a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism.
B-l 4
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person's living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The Far Northern Regional Center is one of 21 regional centers in the state of California that provides point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. The center is a private, nonprofit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. Table B-21, provided by the Far North Regional Center, provides information about Dunsmuir’s population of developmentally disabled persons.

Table B-22 provides information about developmentally disabled residents by residence type. There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living with a development disability: rent-subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, inclusionary housing. Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities represent some of the types of considerations that are important in serving this need group. Incorporating "barrier-free" design in all new multi-family housing (as required by California and federal Fair Housing laws) is especially important to provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents. Special consideration should also be given to the affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
In order to assist in the housing needs for persons with developmental disabilities, the City will implement programs to coordinate housing activities and outreach with the Far North Regional Center and encourage housing providers to designate a portion of new affordable housing developments for persons with disabilities, especially persons with developmental disabilities, and pursue funding sources designated for persons with special needs and disabilities. Program HE.l .2.6 is proposed to specifically address the needs of the developmentally disabled.

Single-Parent and Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households, and those headed by single females in particular, experience the full range of housing problems. These problems include: affordability, since the individuals are often on public assistance; overcrowding, because the individuals often cannot afford units large enough to accommodate their families; insufficient housing choices; and sometimes, discrimination. Also, single-parent households with small children may need to pay for child care, which further strains limited incomes. The City recognizes these problems and has included policies and programs in this document to address affordability, overcrowding, and discrimination for all segments of the population.
Table B-23 illustrates the number of households that are headed by a female with no husband present. Female-headed households with no husband present account for approximately 11 percent of all households in the city. Of these households, the majority are renters. Table B-24 reports the presence of children in female-headed households, as well as poverty indicators for female-headed households. Female-headed households with their own children make up approximately 6 percent of all households in the city and 58 percent of all female-headed households. Female-headed households under the poverty level make up 26 percent of all female-headed households, and 3 percent of total city households.

Large Families
A large family is one with five or more family members. Large families are considered a special needs group because they need larger homes, but don't necessarily earn enough to afford the premium price of a larger home. Those homes are often a luxury out of the range of affordability for lower-income families. Thus, a large family may struggle to find suitable affordable housing. The number of large families in the city is shown by tenure in Table B-25. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of large households decreased by approximately 28 percent, or 19 households. The number of renter-occupied households decreased by approximately 29 percent, while the number of large owner-occupied households decreased by approximately 27 percent.

Homeless Persons and Families
For a variety of economic, social and/or personal reasons, individuals and families may find themselves homeless. Their homelessness can be a temporary situation or a semi-permanent way of life. There are a number of different situations in which people become homeless. Each situation is different, requiring different housing needs. Whatever the situation, the most immediate housing needs can be satisfied with three basic shelter types: emergency, transitional, and temporary.
Emergency Shelters
Emergency shelters are needed to take care of individuals and/or families that have had a sudden traumatic event forcing them to become homeless. For instance, battered women and their children may require an emergency shelter that they can stay in without fear of the abusive individual inflicting further harm. Disaster victims may also require an emergency shelter depending on the type of disaster experienced. While some disaster victims may be able to return to their homes shortly after the event, in those cases where there is considerable or a complete loss of property, transitional shelters are often the next step for individuals and families trying to reassemble their lives.
Emergency shelters are typically motels, hotels, homeless shelters, domestic violence shelters, gymnasiums, churches, barracks, and other similar facilities. Their use is short-term and the accommodations are typically sparse.
Through the Siskiyou County Human Services Department, the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program provides assistance to those eligible for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). This program provides eligible individuals approximately $65
B-l 7
per day for 16 days for emergency housing needs. Families are eligible for this assistance one time only. In addition, once more permanent shelter is found, the program will provide the last month's rent (if necessary) and security deposit on an apartment.
Transitional Shelters
Transitional shelters are often required for housing individuals or families after their immediate need for emergency shelter has been satisfied, but they are not yet self-reliant. Transitional housing programs are often combined with a variety of social services intended to provide job training and self-reliance. Transitional shelters are typically single-family residences, detached homes, or apartment houses. Sometimes motels and hotels can serve in this capacity if they are equipped with kitchens.
Temporary Shelters
Temporary shelters are needed to address a variety of situations in which individuals and/or families find themselves homeless. While there is a portion of the homeless population that is voluntarily homeless, these individuals still often require nighttime or poor-weather shelters. Teenage runaways require temporary shelter, counseling, and other social services. Evicted individuals and/or families often need short-term housing until they can find another residence. Seasonal workers, including migrant farmworkers, need short-term low-cost housing for various durations throughout the year.
Single-room occupancy (SRO) units, which are often converted hotels and motels, can be an appropriate type of temporary or permanent housing for extremely low-income persons. However, the City's Zoning Ordinance does not specifically define SRO units, nor does it allow similar uses (e.g., rooming and boardinghouses) in any district. Therefore, in order to facilitate the development of SROs and increase housing options for extremely low-income persons, the City has amended its Zoning Ordinance to include the definition of SRO units, as well as describe specific development standards for these units.
Homeless Population
Homeless persons in need of emergency shelter have rarely been an issue in Dunsmuir. The Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office, which provides law enforcement for the city, reports that the city lacks a permanent homeless population, and that transients are the only homeless persons they encounter. According to the Sheriff's Office, approximately 10 transients may pass through the city over the course of a week during the warmer months of April through October, with fewer during the cooler months. These transients typically stay for a day or two at most and then continue on their way on the pacific Crest trail, 1-5 or on the Rail road. The Salvation Army, which has an office in a local church, assists those in temporary need such as during a fire event.
Natural emergencies that could result in temporary homelessness are fairly uncommon in this area. Should such an emergency occur (e.g., blizzard or flooding), there is ample space in churches, school gymnasiums, and community facilities to temporarily accommodate displaced individuals and families. The City of Dunsmuir does not have a homeless shelter, but homeless shelters are located in the City of Weed approximately 20 miles to the north, in the City of Yreka approximately 46 miles to the north, and in the City of Redding approximately 54 miles to the south. At present these facilities appear to provide adequate housing for the region's homeless population.
B-18
Given the lack of a permanent homeless population, no emergency shelters have been developed in the city. Still, in order to comply with state law and facilitate the development of shelters should one be proposed, the City has amended its Zoning Ordinance to allow emergency shelters by right in the Central Commercial (C-2) district.
Services for homeless individuals and families in Siskiyou County are primarily available in the City of Yreka, the county seat. Table B-26 illustrates the programs in the county and general vicinity that offer assistance.

Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farmworkers typically work in fields, orchards, and processing plants. When workloads increase during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal or migrant labor.
The City of Dunsmuir does not have a large resident farmworker population within its boundaries, nor is the city located in an area known for agricultural production. The city itself is located in a narrow, heavily forested river canyon better known for its trout fishing than anything else. In fact.
B-19
the nearest intensive agricultural operations are located approximately 60 miles northeast of the City near the community of Macdoel. According to the US Census Bureau, only five city residents were employed in farming, forestry, and fishing-related occupations at the time of the 2010 Census. Of course, given the number of professional fishing guides operating out of the city, as well as a US Forest Service office in the City of Mt. Shasta approximately nine miles to the north, it is likely that many, if not all, of the five persons identified in the Census were involved in either the fishing industry or forestry-related work.
As part of the USDA Census, farms were asked whether any hired or contract workers were migrant workers, defined as “a farm worker whose employment required travel that prevented the migrant worker from returning to his/her permanent place of residence the same day." This information is available at the county level. There is no information available about the number of farmworkers and their families living specifically in Dunsmuir.
As shown in Table B-27, the 2007 Census of Agriculture reported approximately 23 migrant farm workers in Siskiyou County. Although there is no real estimate of the number of farmworkers in Dunsmuir, due to the dominant local industries and weather and climate conditions it is likely that there are not many living in the city, and therefore the city does not have a need for farmworker housing. However, housing for farmworkers is, in general, better provided in cities, where services are located nearby. This is particularly true of seasonal farmworkers whose families live with them. Since many of these types of workers receive housing on private farms, separately from governmental programs, it is difficult to assess supply and demand.

HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
Housing Composition
The composition of housing in the city is mostly single-family. Table B-28 displays the estimated number of each type of housing unit for 2000-2010 as reported by the US Census. From 2010 to 2013 the number of single-family units decreased by approximately 4 percent (two units) with an increase in multi-family housing. From 2000 to 2010, multi-family housing increased by 58 units, a 7 percent increase in overall percent of housing units in the city.

Housing Conditions
Housing Element law requires an estimate of substandard housing in the community. Determining the percentage of units built prior to 1970 can provide a rough estimate of rehabilitation or replacement needs. Table B-29 indicates that 958 units in the city were constructed prior to 1970. Therefore, based upon age alone, it would appear that approximately 78 percent of the units in the city may require rehabilitation or replacement depending on the level of maintenance these units have had. This estimate is considered fairly accurate considering the results of the city's most recent housing conditions survey, which occurred in 2005. Of the 852 units reviewed during that survey, 27.6 percent (235 units) were found to be in "sound" condition and 65.5 percent (558 units) were classified as requiring varying degrees of rehabilitation. The remaining 6.9 percent, or 59 units, were classified as "dilapidated" and possibly in need of replacement. It is worth noting, however, that the survey did not include mobile home parks and was performed as a "windshield survey." The inclusion of mobile home parks and a closer inspection of surveyed units would likely result in an increase in the number of units requiring rehabilitation or replacement.

Despite relatively slow growth in the city's housing stock over the past five years, a fair amount of rehabilitation of existing units has taken place.
Occupancy and Tenure
Tables B-30 and B-31 illustrate the tenure and occupancy of housing in the city. Occupancy information is available from the Census Bureau for 2000-2010. The number of occupied housing units decreased slightly between 2000 and 2010, whereas the number of total vacant units increased. These changes likely reflect both a decline in the total number of housing units and increased vacancy resulting from the economic downturn. Between 2000 and 2010, the rate of owner-occupied housing units remained stable at approximately 56 percent.

According to the 2006-2010 American Community Survey, rental households are more likely to live in multi-family buildings, or other housing units except for single-family detached houses, as shown in Table B-32. Accounting for both owner-occupied and renter-occupied multi-family units, multifamily units comprise approximately 34 percent of total occupied housing units within the City of Dunsmuir. Although multi-family units are a small proportion of overall housing units, nearly two-thirds of all rental households live in these multi-family housing units, with only one-third living in single-family detached units.

Overcrowded Housing
The US Census Bureau defines overcrowding as more than 1.01 persons per room. Severe overcrowding occurs when there are more than 1.5 persons per room. Table B-33 illustrates the number and percentage of units in the city according to occupants per room. While the US Census estimates that in 2010 none of the City's owner-occupied households are overcrowded, approximately 5 percent of renter-occupied units are either overcrowded or severely overcrowded.

As shown in Table B-35, the regional median home sales price in March 2012 was approximately $110,000 and in March 2013 was approximately $123,320.The slight home value increase between 2012 and 2013 mirrors state trends, although with only two data points, no definitive trend can be drawn from that increase.
A household can typically qualify to purchase a home that is two and one-half to three times its annual income, depending on the down payment, the level of other long-term obligations (such as a car loan,, and interest rates. In practice, the interaction of these factors allows some households to qualify for homes priced at more than three times their annual income, while other households may be limited to purchasing homes no more than two times their annual income.

Rental Housing Costs
Table B-36 shows the available apartments and houses for rent in the City of Dunsmuir during a survey taken in July 2014. At the time of the survey, apartments comprised the majority of available rentals in the city with only a few listings for houses. No two-bedroom units were available for rent at the time of the survey.

A survey of mobile homes available for rent in the Dunsmuir area yielded the following results: five mobile homes were available for rent, with a median monthly rental cost of $625 (not including utilities). The monthly rent for surveyed mobile homes available for rent ranged from $542 to $750 per month, with a range of one to two bedrooms.

Overpayment
Definitions of housing affordability can vary, but in general a household should pay no more than 30 percent of its monthly income on housing costs. Households that pay more than this are considered "cost-burdened" and households that pay more than 50 percent are considered "severely cost-burdened." Measuring the number of households paying more than these percentages helps define an area’s affordability problem. Overpayment data for all Dunsmuir households by tenure is reported by the 2007-2011 ACS Five-Year Estimates. Table B-38 provides this information for each income category as well as for all households with lower incomes (extremely low-, very low-, and low-income households). Approximately 87 percent of households earning 30 percent or less of the area mean income (AMI) spent more than 30 percent of its income on housing costs; approximately 79 percent of households earning between 30 and 50 percent AMI were also burdened by the cost of housing. Lower income (80% or less of AMI) renter and owner households both experienced high rates of overpayment with renter households experiencing a higher rate of overpayment overall.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Governmental and Non-Govemmental Constraints
Various interrelated factors may constrain the ability of the private and public sectors to provide adequate housing that meets the needs of all economic segments of the community. These constraints can be divided into two categories: governmental and non-governmental.
B-26
Governmental constraints consist of land use controls, development standards, processing fees, development impact fees, code enforcement, site improvement costs, development permit and approval processing, and provision for a variety of housing. Non-governmental constraints include land availability, land cost, construction costs, and availability of financing.
Governmental Constraints
Land Use Controls
The City of Dunsmuir General Plan establishes policies that guide all new development, including residential land uses. These policies, along with zoning regulations, control the amount and distribution of land allocated for different land uses in the city. Table B-40 shows the residential land use designations established by the General Plan.
Table B-40
Residential Land Use Designations
Designation	Maximum Units per Acre	Notes
Low Density Residential (LDR)	6 units/acre	Single-family residential dwellings.
Medium Density Residential (MDR)	12 units/acre	Single-family residential dwellings and duplexes.
High Density Residential (HDR)	40 units/acre	Single-family residential dwellings, duplexes, triplexes, apartments, elder housing, group homes, etc.
Source: City of Dunsmuir General Plan 2006
Residential Development Standards in Residential Zones
Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the General Plan. The Zoning Ordinance also serves to preserve the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods. Table B-41 shows the residential zone districts and permitted densities.

(2j The development standards shown are for multi-family dwellings. Development standards for single-family dwellings are per the R-1 district and development standards for duplexes are per the R-2 district.
(3)	The Zoning Ordinance does not specify the maximum number of allowable units per acre, but instead identifies the minimum lot area required per dwelling unit. Therefore, the equivalent number of dwelling units per acre is shown. However, because the General Plan allows fewer units per acre than the Zoning Ordinance, in practice the maximum number of units per acre is limited to those allowed by the General Plan.
(4)	The Zoning Ordinance does not specify parking spaces, but instead requires one garage or carport per dwelling unit that is at least I O' x 20'. Therefore, the equivalent number of parking spaces is shown.
Parking standards in all residential districts require a minimum of two parking spaces per unit except for studio and one-bedroom apartments which only require one space. Additionally, mobile home parks in the Multiple-Family Residential and Professional (R-4, district are required to provide only one space per unit. These requirements are minimal and are not considered a constraint to development.
The City's two high density multi-family zones are the Multiple-Family Residential (R-3) and Multiple-Family Residential and Professional (R-4) zones. Aside from the R-4 zone permitting rest homes, professional offices, and a few other nonresidential uses with a use permit, these districts are nearly identical in the type of housing that is allowed. The primary difference with regard to residential uses is that mobile home parks are allowed the R-4 district upon issuance of a use permit.
While obtaining approval of a use permit does require more effort on the part of the applicant than a permit approved by staff, this process does not appear to be a constraint to development of affordable housing. A conditional use permit for those residential uses requiring one entails the property owner submitting an application and site plan for review, along with the appropriate processing fee. These applications are reviewed by staff for consistency with the City’s General Plan and Zoning Ordinance. Staff then conducts an environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (typically a mitigated negative declaration,, schedules a public hearing before the Planning Commission, and notifies property owners within 300 feet of the project. There are no design standards, architectural review, or other criteria applied except normal setbacks, lot coverage, density, and parking requirements. The Planning Commission primarily considers potential environmental impacts, as well as public improvements that may be necessary to support the project (e.g., the extension of sewer and water lines and drainage improvements). In deciding whether to grant a use permit, the Planning Commission must make a finding that establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use or building applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be materially detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort, and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed use or be materially detrimental to property or improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city.
The finding is typical of use permit findings and provides guidance to an applicant as to what conditions must be met to receive a use permit. The Planning Commission can designate conditions of approval as necessary to ensure that the use will meet the required finding. It is important to note that the City does not apply the use permit process to disallow residential uses.
B-28
Rather, the City seeks to provide a process whereby residential uses that are not allowed by right can be facilitated in a manner that will result in projects that are compatible with surrounding uses. The entire process from submittal to public hearing and project approval is typically about six to eight weeks. The process is the same for all uses requiring a use permit. Therefore, the process does not unduly constrain the development of residential uses subject to a use permit.
On- and Off-Site Improvements
In order to maintain the quality of its neighborhoods and safeguard the health and safety of the community, the City requires curbs, gutters, and sidewalks in all new developments. In addition, developers must provide those facilities necessary to serve the development, including roads, sewer lines, drainage systems, water lines, fire hydrants, and street lights. While all development-related improvements add to the cost of housing, the City's standards are similar to other communities in the region and do not constrain the development of affordable housing.
Among the required on- and off-site improvements, roadways typically have the greatest impact on the cost of housing. Further, it is local streets that are the most common street improvements in new subdivisions. However, depending upon the size of the subdivision, improvements to collectors and arterials may also be necessary. The following standards, which are included in Title 16 of the Dunsmuir Municipal Code, are the basic minimums necessary to protect public health and safety:
•	Thoroughfares, major street, or highway:
o Right-of-way: 64-70 feet o Pavement width: 40-48 feet

•	Hillside street:

As noted above, Dunsmuir also requires developers to install storm drains, sanitary sewers, and water lines to serve their subdivisions. Further, developers may be required to pay a pro rata share for improvements to sewer and water trunk lines that are necessary as a result of their project. Again, these improvements are necessary to maintain the quality of the City's neighborhoods and safeguard the community, and do not constrain the development of affordable housing.
Residential Development Standards in the Commercial Zones
The Neighborhood Commercial (C-l) zone and the Central Commercial (C-2, permit residential development by right (i.e., no discretionary approval is required) consistent with the R-4 district. Depending upon the type of residential use being proposed in the C-2 district (e.g., single-family,
B-29
duplexes, apartments), the applicable development standards are those of the corresponding residential district (i.e., R-l, R-2, R-3 or R-4).
Adequacy of Zoning Standards to Facilitate Affordable Housing
Land costs in Dunsmuir are approximately $26,170 per dwelling unit1 for development-ready land suitable for single-family housing. An increase in the base residential density (before a density bonus for affordable housing) above 40 units per acre would not significantly reduce residential development costs or significantly increase the feasibility of affordable housing production. The City, therefore, believes the R-3, R-4, C-l and C-2 zones provide adequate density and development standards to facilitate the production of housing affordable to very low- and low-income households.
Flexibility in Development Standards
Due to the lack of large areas of available vacant land and the almost buildout condition of the City, the City does not have or need a Planned Development zoning district, which typically allows for flexibility in development standards because of the large area where the development would occur. However, the Dunsmuir Municipal Code provides for flexibility in residential development standards for properties allowing a variety of building types and densities in the various zoning districts.
Provision for a Variety of Housing
The Housing Element must identify adequate sites that are available for the development of housing types for all economic segments of the population. Part of this entails evaluating the City's Zoning Ordinance and its provision for a variety of housing types. Housing types include singlefamily dwellings, duplexes, second units, mobile homes, group care facilities, multi-family dwellings, senior housing, supportive housing, and SRO units.
Some housing types are allowed by right and others are allowed with a conditional use permit. Table B-42 summarizes the housing types permitted, conditionally permitted, or excluded under the City's Zoning Ordinance.

Following is a discussion of those particular housing types that may be most appropriate to meet the needs of extremely low-, very low-, and low-income households, as well as an analysis of governmental constraints that may serve as a barrier to the development of these particular housing types.
Second Dwelling Units
"Second unit" means an attached or a detached residential dwelling unit which provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons. It shall include permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel as the singlefamily dwelling is situated.
Assembly Bill (AB) 1866 (Chapter 1062, Statutes of 2002), also known as the "second unit law," amended the California Government Code to facilitate the development of second units. This amendment now requires localities to allow second units ministerially without discretionary review or hearings. To be considered a ministerial review, the process used to approve second units must "apply predictable, objective, fixed, quantifiable and clear standards." Applications for second units should not be subject to onerous conditions of approval or public hearing process or public comment.
The second unit law established maximum standards for second units on lots zoned for residential use that contain existing single-family dwellings. No other standards can be applied to the approval of second units than those listed in Section 65852.2(b) of the Government Code, except the City may require that the primary structure be owner-occupied. The City may apply the following standards:
-	The unit is not intended for sale and may be rented.
-	The lot is zoned for single-family or multi-family use.
-	The lot contains an existing single-family dwelling.
-	The second unit is either attached to the existing dwelling and located within the living area of the existing dwelling or detached from the existing dwelling and located on the same lot as the existing dwelling.
B-31
-	The increased floor area of an affached second unit shall not exceed 30 percent of the existing living area.
-	The total area of floor space for a detached second unit shall not exceed 1,200 square feet.
-	Requirements relating to height, setback, lot coverage, architectural review, site plan review, fees, charges, and other zoning requirements generally applicable to residential construction in the zone in which the property is located.
Per 2009-2014 Housing Element Program HE.2.1.7, the City has revised the Zoning Ordinance to allow by right secondary dwelling units in the Single-Family Residential R-l district.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
As part of a governmental constraints analysis. Housing Elements must analyze constraints upon the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities. This includes a review of zoning and land use policies and practices to ensure: compliance with fair housing laws; a provision exists for group homes for more than six persons; a broad definition of family is included in the Zoning Ordinance in order to provide occupancy standards specific to unrelated adults, as well as comply with Fair Housing Law; and siting or separation requirements for licensed residential care facilities do not impact the development and cost of housing for persons with disabilities.
In accordance with state law, the City must allow licensed residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons in any area zoned for residential use, and may not require facilities serving six or fewer individuals to obtain conditional use permits or variances that are not required of other family dwellings. Not only does the Zoning Ordinance include a definition of group home that is based upon Health and Safety Code Section 1500 et seq., but these facilities are allowed by right in all residential zones and the Neighborhood Commercial (C-l) district, and conditionally permitted in the Central Commercial (C-2) zone similar to other residential uses. Further, the City allows group care facilities serving more than six persons in all districts with a conditional use permit. The City does not have any special requirements for residential care facilities, such as minimum distances between facilities.
The occupancy standards of the Zoning Ordinance comply with Fair Housing Laws in that they do not restrict occupancy based upon relationship. The 2009-2014 Housing Element included a program (HE.2.1.4) to revise the Zoning Ordinance definition of family to include clients of group homes. The City adopted a revision of the Zoning Ordinance which included this text change in June of 2015. The Zoning Ordinance definition of family is as follows: "Family" means one or more persons occupying the premises and living as a single housekeeping unit, as distinguished from a group occupying a hotel, club, fraternity or sorority house. A family may include the clients of group homes."
Supportive Housing
Supportive housing is defined by Government Code Section 65582(f) as housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population, and that is linked to an on-site or off-site service that assists the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. Per Government Code Section 65582(h) target population means persons with low incomes who have one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health condition, or individuals eligible for services provided pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing with
B-32
Section 4500) of the Welfare and Institutions Code) and may include, among other populations, adults, emancipated minors, families with children, elderly persons, young adults aging out of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans, and homeless people.
The 2009-2014 Housing Element included a program (HE.1.2.2, to include a definition of supportive housing in the Zoning Ordinance. The City adopted a revision of the Zoning Ordinance which included this text change in June of 2015. The Zoning Ordinance definition of supportive housing is as follows: "Supportive housing means housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target populations as defined by 53260(d) of the California Health and Safety Code, and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community."
Additionally, the Zoning Ordinance revision included supportive housing as a permitted use in all zoning districts which allow residential uses. Supportive housing does not require any development standards not required of other housing in the zoning district.
Emergency Shelters and Transitional Housing
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801) defines an emergency shelter as "housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or households may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay."
California legislation (SB 2 (Cedillo, 2007)) requires jurisdictions to identify a zone where emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted use without first obtaining a conditional use permit or other discretionary approval. Further, the zone(s) identified must have land available to accommodate an emergency shelter. While the City's Housing Needs Assessment indicates few homeless persons in the City and little need for a shelter, the City conducted a staff level review of its zoning districts and vacant land in order to comply with state law and determined that the Central Commercial (C-2) district would be the most appropriate for the siting of emergency shelters because there would more likely be public transit and other services available (e.g., coin operated laundries, groceries,. While there is limited vacant land in the C-2 district with which to develop a homeless shelter (1.45 acres between five parcels), there are numerous underutilized commercial structures that could easily be repurposed to accommodate a shelter.
The 2009-2014 Housing Element included a program (HE.1.2.2) to include a definition of emergency shelter in the Zoning Ordinance. The City adopted a revision of the Zoning Ordinance which included this text change in June of 2015. The Zoning Ordinance definition of emergency shelter is as follows: "Emergency shelter means housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or households may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay." Additionally, this Zoning Ordinance revision included the "Emergency Shelters" as a permitted use by right in the Central Commercial zoning distinct.
SB 2 further requires that transitional housing be considered a residential use subject only to the same restrictions that apply to similar housing types in the same zone. Transitional housing is defined in Government Code Section 65582 (g, as rental buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program requirements that require the termination of assistance and recirculating of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at a predetermined future point in time that shall be no less than six months from the beginning of the assistance.
B-33
The 2009-2014 Housing Element included a program (HE.l .2.2) to include a definition of transitional housing in the Zoning Ordinance. The City adopted a revision of the Zoning Ordinance which included this text change in June of 2015. The Zoning Ordinance definition of transitional housing is as follows: "Transitional housing means a building configured as rental housing development, but operated under program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six months."
Additionally, the Zoning Ordinance revision included transitional housing as a permitted use in all zoning districts which allow residential uses. Transitional housing does not require any development standards not required of other housing in the zoning district.
Single Room Occupancy Units
Housing elements must identify zoning to encourage and facilitate single-room occupancy units. SRO units are often the most appropriate type of housing for extremely low-income persons. The City's Zoning Ordinance does not specifically define SRO units, but does define similar uses, boardinghouses and rooming houses, and allows SRO type uses in the R-3, R-4, C-l and C-2 zones with a use permit. The development standards for these are the same as other uses in the respective zones and do not constrain the development of SRO types. However, to ensure the facilitation of SROs, the City has amended its Zoning Ordinance in June or 2015 to specifically define SRO units and describe development standards for this housing type. The City's definition of SROs is as follows: “Single-room occupancy residential unit means a compact dwelling unit with limited cooking and living facilities that is the primary residence of its occupant(s) and is within a multiple-unit structure." SROs are permitted with a Conditional Use permit on the Multiple-Family Residential (R-3) district, and the Multiple-Residential and Professional R-4 district, Neighborhood commercial C-l district.
Zoning Ordinance Section 17.16.110 defines the following development standards for SROs:
A.	Tenancy of single-room occupancy residential units shall not be less than thirty (30) days.
B.	Each unit shall accommodate a maximum of two (2) persons.
C.	No unit may exceed four hundred (400, square feet.
D.	Single-room occupancy residential unit facilities shall provide individual or shared bathing facilities and may provide individual or shared kitchen facilities.
E.	Common laundry facilities shall be provided at a rate of one (1) washer and dryer per ten (10, units, with a minimum of one (1) washer and dryer.
F.	An on-site management office or manager's unit shall be provided.
G.	On-site parking shall be provided at a rate of one (1) space for every two (2) units.
H.	Each unit shall have a separate closet.
Housing for Farmworkers
The City of Dunsmuir revised the Zoning Ordinance to include the definition of employee housing which addresses farmworker housing. The Zoning Ordinance defines employee housing as follows:
B-34
"Employee housing - large" means housing for employees consisting of no more than thirty-six (36, beds in a group quarters or twelve (12, units or spaces designed for use by a single family or household.
"Employee housing - small" means housing for employees consisting of six or fewer persons in a single family dwelling.
As is shown in Table B-42, Employee housing small is allowed by right in all residential and the C-l and C-2 districts in the City. There are no areas identified as agricultural zoning in the City and while the Zoning Ordinance does define large employee housing, the need for this type of housing is non-existent in the City.
Development and Processing Fees
Many of the large, vacant residentially zoned parcels do not currently have on- and off-site improvements in place, such as streets, sidewalks, and water and sewer connections. Therefore, the City requires developers to construct these improvements and/or pay fees to help deter the costs of providing infrastructure, public facilities, and services. Impact fees that apply to new residential single-family and multi-family construction are listed in Table B-43. The City also collects fees from developers to help cover the costs of planning and processing permits. Processing fees are calculated based on average staff time and material costs required to process a particular type of application. Planning and processing fees are summarized in Table B-44. It is important to note that these fees are provided for informational purposes only and are subject to change.
As concluded in Table B-45, the City’s development impact fees are similar to or less than other cities in the region. While these costs will likely be passed on to the ultimate product consumer, thus impacting housing prices, these requirements are deemed necessary to maintain the quality of life desired by City residents.

Source: www.building-cost.net 2015, City of Dunsmuir 2015
Notes: Typical single-family unit estimated at 1,200 square feet and muitifamily at 900 square feet.
Including the cost of building permits and planning fees, which are roughly $2,008 per unit for a 1,200 square foot single-family or 900 square foot multifamily dwelling, development fees average $9,681 for a typical 1,200-square-foot single-family dwelling and $5,908 per 900 square foot multifamily unit. Depending on housing unit size and type, City and school district fees amount to between 5.5 and 10 percent of the total cost of each new housing unit. The fees for a typical single-family unit are approximately 5.5 percent of overall development costs. The fees for a typical multi-family unit are approximately 4.7 percent of overall development costs. While these costs will likely be passed on to the ultimate product consumer, thus impacting housing prices, these fees are on par with other cities in the region, are deemed necessary to maintain the quality of life desired by City residents, and do not constrain the development of affordable housing. Permit Processing Times
The time involved in processing development applications can become a constraint to affordable housing development. However, because Dunsmuir is a small community that receives few applications and almost no complicated applications, the processing of a residential application occurs expeditiously. In Dunsmuir, most development applications for single-family and multifamily developments take approximately two to four weeks to process as long as no discretionary approvals are needed. If an applicant proposes a development that requires discretionary review, such as one that requires a use permit, the processing time can extend to two months regardless of whether it's a single-family or multi-family project. Table B-46 lists the typical review
B-36
times for each type of permit or approval process in the City. These review periods do not present constraints to development as some review is needed to ensure the maintenance of health and safety standards. Further, the City encourages developers to submit applications concurrently whenever possible to minimize the total processing time and related project costs.

Building Codes and Enforcement
The City utilizes the 2013 California Building Code for its code requirements and deviates from it only in the case of snow load (i.e., the City has a higher standard for roofing due to local conditions,.Therefore, because the California Building Code serves to protect public health and safely, it does not pose a significant constraint to the production or improvement of housing in Dunsmuir.
Code enforcement typically occurs when the building inspector is processing other permits on the site, or when complaints are filed. City staff works with the Siskiyou County Health Department when the complaint appears to be a matter of both health and safety.
Most complaints come from renters who make complaints against their landlord. The inspection may reveal building or health code violations which are then written up with a timeline for correction and follow-up inspections. If there are no code violations, but other non-code situations occur, the renter is given a question and answer sheet prepared by the California Department of Consumer Affairs, which helps to define the renter's rights and options in the matter. Complaints in mobile home parks are referred to the enforcement section of HCD.
Non-Governmental Constraints
Land Costs
The cost of raw, developable land creates a direct impact on the cost of a new home and is considered a possible constraint. A higher cost of land raises the price of a new home. Therefore, developers sometimes seek to obtain City approvals for the largest number of lots allowable on a parcel of land. Residential land costs in Dunsmuir as of August 2013 are shown in Table B-47. Singlefamily land prices ranged from $36,765 per acre to $176,371 per acre. Although there were no multi-family properties on the market at the time of the survey, four multi-family properties were sold within the prior nine months, ranging in costs from $25,000 to $130,000.

Construction and Labor Costs
Factors that affect the cost of building a house include the type of construction, materials, site conditions, finishing details, amenities, and structural configuration. An Internet source of construction cost data (www.building-cost.net), provided by the Craftsman Book Company estimates the per square foot cost of a single-story four-cornered home in the city to be approximately $156 per square foot. This cost estimate is based on a 1,200-square-foot house of good quality construction including a two-car garage, central heating, and air conditioning. The total construction costs excluding land costs are estimated at $187,633 for a spec house in a housing tract and $344,753 for a custom home. If labor or material costs increased substantially, the cost of construction in the city could rise to a level that impacts the price of new construction and rehabilitation.
Availability of Financing
The cost of borrowing money to finance the construction of housing or to purchase a house affects the amount of affordably priced housing in the city. Fluctuating interest rates can eliminate many potential homebuyers from the housing market or render a housing project that could have been developed at lower interest rates infeasible. When interest rates decline, sales increase. The reverse has been true when interest rates increase. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic growth in alternative mortgage products, including graduated mortgages and variable rate mortgages. These types of loans allow homeowners to take advantage of lower initial interest rates and to qualify for larger home loans. However, variable rate mortgages are not ideal for low-and moderate- income households that live on tight budgets. Variable rate mortgages may allow lower-income households to enter into homeownership, but there is a definite risk of monthly housing costs rising above the financial means of that household. Therefore, the fixed interest rate mortgage remains the preferred type of loan, especially during periods of low, stable interest rates. Table B-48 illustrates interest rates as of May 2013. The table presents both the interest rate and annual percentage rate (APR) for different types of home loans. The interest rate is the percentage of an amount of money which is paid for its use for a specified time and the APR is the yearly percentage rate that expresses the total finance charge on a loan over its entire term. The APR includes the interest rate, fees, points, and mortgage insurance, and is therefore a more complete measure of a loan's cost than the interest rate alone. However, the loan's interest rate, not its APR, is used to calculate the monthly principal and interest payment.

HOUSING RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
At-Risk Housing Analysis
California Government Code Section 65583(a)(9) et seq. requires that the Housing Element include an analysis of the assisted low-income housing units in the city that may be lost from the inventory of affordable housing within the next 10 years as a result of the expiration of some type of affordability restriction.
The City of Dunsmuir currently has no multi-family housing projects that receive federal or state subsidies in order to maintain affordability of the units. Additionally, the City has no locally subsidized units and has not issued any mortgage revenue bonds for this type of activity. Further, the City has not approved any density bonuses with financial assistance, does not have an in-lieu fee program, and has not assisted multi-family housing with redevelopment or Community Development Block Grant (CDBG, funds. Consequently, there are no multi-family housing projects that are considered to be at risk.
Rehabilitation Program
The City's rehabilitation loan program is currently funded by a revolving loan account. The City applied for CDBG funds in the past that were used to give rehabilitation loans. As repayments of these loans are received, the money is put back in to a loan account to give to new applicants. Loans are made to households in target income groups and can be used for structural rehabilitation, room additions to relieve overcrowding, and total reconstructions. The actual amount of funds available to loan fluctuates and depends on the rate of repayment from existing loans. Interest rates for owner-occupied units are usually set at 3 percent but can be as low as 0 percent for very low-income households, and life of the loan can be up to 30 years. Five households have been assisted in the past five years. Currently, the program is temporarily suspended until addition funding can be obtained or repayments are of a sufficient amount to offer rehabilitation loans. Program HE.4.1.1 has been include in this Housing Element in order to obtain additional grant funding for the rehabilitation loan program.
Housing Authority
The state of California does not own or operate public housing; public housing is administered directly through local public housing authorities. However, for those jurisdictions that do not have
B-39
a local public housing authority, HCD has a Housing Assistance Program that administers the Section 8 program in those counties.
The Shasta County Housing Authority administers the Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program for Siskiyou County and its jurisdictions. The program provides a voucher to recipients to use to help pay their rent for any rental unit that accepts the voucher. The recipients pay part of the rent based on 30 percent of their income and the Section 8 program pays the remaining amount. Shasta County administers a total of 195 vouchers throughout Siskiyou County and 25 within the city. An additional 28 active applicants are on the City of Dunsmuir Housing Choice Voucher waiting list.
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
Pursuant to the State Government Code Section 65584, HCD has developed a Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) plan for Siskiyou County. The RHNA plan identifies a need for 530 new residential units in all of Siskiyou County (i.e., including the unincorporated areas, over a five-year period (January 1,2014 to June 30,2019). The need for 530 units is shared and distributed amongst each of the communities in the county, with each community's share determined by its proportion of the county’s overall household population. Thus, the City of Dunsmuir's share of regional housing needs is 23 units, or 4.6 units per year over a five-year period. In an attempt to provide housing for all income groups in the city, these 23 units are further divided amongst the various income categories identified and defined in Table B-49.
Table B-49
Regional Housing Needs, 2014-2019
Income Category	Regional Housing Needs	Percent of Total	Progress	Remaining

Pursuant to Government Code Section 65584.09, local governments that fail to implement an adequate sites program during the prior planning period, and which have an unaccommodated housing need from the prior planning period, are required to accommodate the unmet housing
B-40
need during the subsequent planning period. The 2003 Housing Element had a program to rezone at least two acres in the R-3 or R-4 zones to facilitate the development of at least 30-50 units. This rezoning was not accomplished during the 2003 Housing Element planning period and as such was carried over to the 2009 Housing Element as Program HE.l .3.2. Program HE.1.3.2 required the rezoning of one site to either R-3 or R-4 large enough to accommodate at least 32 affordable units. The City had enough vacant land inventory to meet its 2009-2014 RHNA for housing units affordable to lower income households so no additional rezoning of land was necessary to meet the 2009-2014 RHNA need. As such, the City had a 2003 Housing Element unaccommodated need of 32 housing units affordable to lower income households. Therefore, an analysis of unaccommodated need is presented in this 2014 Housing Element to determine the additional lower income housing units needed for the 2014-2019 Housing Element.
In December 2015, the City amended the General Plan land use map for a 1.5 acre property from Service Commercial to High Density Residential and rezoned the property from Central Commercial C-2 to Multiple Family Residential R-3. Currently, this property has a vacant dilapidated hotel on a portion of the site. Removal or repair of this hotel would be necessary in order to use this property for multifamily purposes. However, the property owner has expressed interest in possible multifamily construction for the site. Rezoning of this property has allowed for a potential 60 multifamily units based on allowable densities in the R-3 zone. Realistic capacity would be more like approximately 48 units. Inclusion of this parcel would remove any unaccommodated need and provide a surplus of 35 units.
As is shown in Table 50 and Table 51, the City has enough vacant or underutilized land in the R-3 zoning distinct to realistically accommodate 55 dwelling units. Additionally, the City has enough vacant land in the C-2 zoning district to realistically accommodate 22 dwelling units. The combination of this vacant and underutilized land will allow for the development of 77 dwelling units which could accommodate the 42 lower-income housing need. Therefore, the City currently does not have an unaccommodated need.

VACANT LAND INVENTORY
Table B-51 lists most of the vacant land in the city that is appropriately zoned to accommodate residential development. As noted in Table B-51, there are 305.99 acres of Single-Family Residential (R-l) zoned land with the potential to result in 205 units; 5.12 acres of Duplex Residential (R-2) zoned land with the potential to result in 35 units; 2.20 acres of Multiple-Family Residential (R-3, zoned land (of which, 1.5 acres is underutilize land, with the potential to result in 55 units; and 1.45 acres of Central Commercial (C-2, zoned land with the potential to result in 22 units.
Many of the parcels listed in Table B-51 identify potential constraints to development, the most notable of which is the very attribute that makes Dunsmuir such an attractive place to live: the upper Sacramento River canyon. Because the city is located in a heavily forested, narrow-walled canyon, steep slopes confine development in the city to an area that is approximately 0.37-mile wide on average by 4.5 miles in length. Where slopes in the city are relatively gentle, the land was long ago developed with residential and commercial uses. Further, as the supply of easily developable land diminished, houses were increasingly developed on steeper slopes or in areas with limited access. The vacant land that remains typically has severe slope constraints, does not meet the City's minimum lot size, is located in a 100-year floodplain, or is completely inaccessible. There are a few notable exceptions, principally with regard to a couple of large properties designated for low density residential development. However, these large parcels typically lack the infrastructure necessary for them to be developed.
Staff reviewed the properties identified in Table B-51 on a lot-by-lot basis in order to determine maximum allowable densities and realistic buildout capacities. Where residential development potential has been identified on commercial lots, realistic buildout capacities are based on the likelihood of these lots developing with residential uses. This is typically due to adjacent residential development within those commercial districts. Where constraints to development were identified, these constraints were taken into consideration and are reflected in realistic buildout capacities that are less than the maximum allowable densities. While staff may have underestimated the development potential of some properties, assessments were based on recent development trends in the city, characteristics unique to the site (e.g., size, shape, slope, access), and the likelihood of access and/or infrastructure being developed to accommodate development in the near term. However, estimates of buildout capacity are not intended to limit development of these properties in any manner. The analysis was conducted with the sole purpose of determining whether the City could accommodate its share of regional housing needs with existing vacant residential land, or if the City would need to rezone properties in order to facilitate the development of housing.
Affordable housing is permitted in a variety of residential zone districts. However, most affordable projects will occur in the R-3, R-4, C-l, and C-2 zones since they permit higher densities and are a better fit for projects that are supported by government assistance. The smallest vacant parcel noted in Table B-51 that conforms to City development standards and is appropriate for multifamily development is of sufficient size (0.20 acre) to easily accommodate a triplex with 1,200-square-foot units and a two-car garage each. As noted above, there are a total of 2.20 acres of R-3, and 1.45 acres of C-2 zoned lands with the combined potential to result in 77 units which can accommodate the 10 lower-income units in the City's 2014 RHNA.
Public sewer and water service is readily available within 100 feet of most of the vacant parcels identified on Table B-51. Where sewer and water services are located more than 100 feet away, this has been noted. However, the distance to infrastructure only becomes a constraint to the development of larger vacant parcels (i.e., those greater than one-acre in size, because sewer and water lines, if not located within 100 feet, are typically located just a little bit further beyond.
B-42
The wastewater treatment plant was designed to serve a much larger population than currently present and, as a result, has adequate excess capacity (average dry weather flow of 0.16 million gallons per day) to serve projected growth in the city through the current planning period and beyond. The city's water system was similarly designed to serve a much larger population than currently present and has adequate excess capacity (maximum day demand of 0.55 million gallons per day) to accommodate projected growth in the city through the current planning period and beyond. As such, the City's basic infrastructure is more than adequate to handle projected growth.
As documented in Table B-52, in addition to the 77 units available for higher density development discussed earlier in this section, the land inventory indicates 35 units can be accommodated in the R-2 zone at densities appropriate for moderate-income units and 205 units can be accommodated at lower-densities which would most likely yield housing for those with abovemoderate incomes. As such, the City has available land to meet its 2014-2019 RHNA. Refer to Appendix E for the location of those sites identified in Table B-52.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
Opportunities for energy conservation can be found for both existing and future housing developments. Conservation can be achieved through a variety of approaches including reducing the use of energy-consuming appliances and features in a home, physical modification of existing structures or land uses, and reducing the reliance on automobiles by encouraging more mixed-use and infill development and providing pedestrian access to commercial and recreational facilities.
Some energy conservation features are incorporated into the design of residential structures in the City of Dunsmuir due to the requirements of Title 24, which outlines measures to reduce energy consumption. These measures include low-flow plumbing fixtures, efficient heating and cooling opportunities, dual pane windows, and adequate insulation and weatherstripping. Incorporating new technology within residential developments offers developers a chance to design projects that allow for maximum energy conservation opportunities. Although energy regulations establish a uniform standard of energy efficiency, they do not ensure that all available conservation features are incorporated into building design. Additional measures may further reduce heating, cooling, and lighting loads and overall energy consumption. While it is not feasible that all possible conservation features be included in every development, there are often a number of economically feasible measures that may result in savings in excess of the minimum required by Title 24.
Constructing new homes with energy-conserving features, in addition to retrofitting existing structures, will result in a reduction in monthly utility costs. There are many ways to determine how energy efficient an existing building is and, if needed, what improvements can be made. Many modern building design methods are used to reduce residential energy consumption and are based on proven techniques. These methods can be categorized in three ways:
1.	Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and keeps natural heat out during the summer. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating demands. Proven building techniques in this category include:
•	Location of windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to minimize solar gain in the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter.
•	Use of "thermal mass," earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and tiles that absorb heat during the day and release heat at night.
•	Use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat exchange between the interior of a home and the exterior.
•	Location of openings and the use of ventilating devices that take advantage of natural air flow.
•	Use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window openings during the summer but allow solar gain during the winter.
•	Zone heating and cooling systems, which reduce heating and cooling in the unused areas of a home.
2.	Building orientation that uses natural forces to maintain a comfortable interior temperature. Examples include:
•	North-south orientation of the long axis of a dwelling.
•	Minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces.
B-51
•	Location of dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening breezes.
3.	Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques include:
•	Use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home.
•	Use of natural or artificial flowing water.
•	Use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
In addition to these naturally based techniques, modern methods include:
•	Use of solar energy to heat water.
•	Use of radiant barriers on roofs to keep attics cool.
•	Use of solar panels and other devices to generate electricity.
•	High efficiency coating on windows to repel summer heat and trap winter warmth.
•	Weatherstripping, duct sealing, and other insulation to reduce heat gain and loss.
•	Replacement of home heating and cooling systems with energy-efficiency models.
•	Use of natural gas for dryers, stovetops, and ranges.
•	Use of energy-efficient home appliances.
•	Use of low-flow showerheads, faucet aerators, and thermostatic shut-off valves to reduce hot water use.
Major opportunities for residential energy conservation in the city will include insulation and weatherproofing, landscaping and maximizing orientation, lowering appliance consumption, and maximizing on solar energy.

Appendix C Glossary of Terms
APPENDIX C - GLOSSARY OF TERMS
The following definitions are for commonly used terms in a Housing Element:
Above Moderate Income: Above moderate-income households are defined as households with incomes over 120 percent of the county median.
Accessible Units: Indicates certain units or all units in the property are wheelchair-accessible or can be made wheelchair-accessible. Accessible units also may include those that are accessible to people with sensory impairments or can be made accessible for people with sensory impairments.
Affordability: Annual cost of housing includes mortgage, principal, and interest payments as amortized over 25 years with a 25 percent down payment or gross rent that does not exceed 30 percent of gross annual household income or 30 percent of gross annual income devoted to rental housing, including utilities are defined as "affordable."
Affordability Covenant: A property title agreement that places resale or rental restrictions on a housing unit; also known as a deed restriction.
Affordable Housing: Refers to the relationship between the price of housing in a region (either sale price or rent) and household income. Affordable housing is that which is affordable to households of very low, low, and moderate incomes. For housing to be affordable, shelter costs must not exceed 30 percent of the gross annual income of the household.
Assisted Housing: Assisted housing refers to a unit that rents or sells for less than the prevailing market rate due to governmental monetary intervention or contribution. The terms "assisted” and "subsidized" are often used interchangeably.
At-Risk Housing: Applies to existing subsidized affordable rental housing units, especially federally subsidized developments, that are threatened with conversion to market rents because of termination of use restrictions, due to expiration or non-renewal of subsidy arrangements.
Below Market Rate (BMR) Unit: A housing unit that sells or rents for less than the going market rate. It is typically used in reference to housing units that are directly or indirectly subsidized or have other restrictions in order to make them affordable to very low-, low-, or moderate-income households.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): The state CDBG program was established by the federal Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC 5301, etseq.). The primary federal objective of the CDBG program is the development of viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. "Persons of low and moderate income" or the "targeted income group" are defined as families, households, and individuals whose incomes do not exceed 80 percent of the county median income, with adjustments for family or household size.
C-l
Condominium: A building or group of buildings in which units are owned individually, but the structure, common areas, and facilities are owned by all owners on a proportional, undivided basis.
Continuum of Care: An approach that helps communities plan for and provide a full range of emergency, transitional, and permanent housing and service resources to address the various needs of homeless persons at the point in time that they need them. The approach is based on the understanding that homelessness is not caused merely a lack of shelter, but involves a variety of underlying, unmet needs—physical, economic, and social. Designed to encourage localities to develop a coordinated and comprehensive long-term approach to homelessness, the Continuum of Care consolidates the planning, application, and reporting documents for the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's Shelter Plus Care, Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Single-Room Occupancy Dwellings (SRO) Program, and Supportive Housing Program. (US House Bill 2163,.
Cost Burden: A household has a "housing cost burden" if it spends 30 percent or more of its income on housing costs. A household has a "severe housing cost burden" if it spends 50 percent or more of its income on housing. Owner housing costs consist of payments for mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts to purchase, or similar debts on the property; real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance on the property; utilities; and fuels. Where applicable, owner costs also include monthly condominium fees. Renter calculations use gross rent, which is the contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities (electricity, gas, water, and sewer) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.) if these are paid by the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else). Household income is the total pre-tax income of the householder and all other individuals at least 15 years old in the household. In all estimates of housing cost burdens, owners and renters for whom housing cost-to-income was not computed are excluded from the calculations.
Census: Every 10 years, the Census Bureau conducts a national household survey, producing the richest source of nationally available small-area data. Article I of the Constitution requires that a census be taken every 10 years for the purpose of reapportioning the US House of Representatives. The federal government uses decennial census data for apportioning congressional seats, for identifying distressed areas, and for many other activities. Census data are collected using two survey forms: the short form and the long form. Short form information is collected on every person and includes basic characteristics, such as age, sex, and race. The long form is sent to one out of every six households and collects more detailed information, such as income, housing characteristics, and employment. Most of the indicators in DataPlace are from the long form, and are thus estimates based on the sample of households. These values may differ considerably from the same indicators based on the short form data, particularly for small areas.
Density: The number of housing units on a unit of land (e.g., 10 units per acre).
Density Bonus Programs: Allows minimum density increase over the zoned maximum density of a proposed residential development, if the developer makes a specified amount of units affordable to lower-income households.
C-2
Disability: A long-lasting physical, mental, or emotional condition. This condition can make it difficult for a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being able to go outside the home alone or to work at a job or business.
Down Payment Assistance: The most popular loans for these programs are with the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). FHA allows 100 percent gift funds for your down payment and some allowable closing costs. The gift can be from any relative or can be collected through charitable organizations like Neighborhood Gold/The Buyer Fund. Another popular tactic, which can be used in a broader range of loan programs, is to borrow from a 401K. A withdrawal can be made without a penalty and pay it back over a specified period.
Development Impact Fees: A fee or charge imposed on developers to pay for a jurisdiction's costs of providing services to new development.
Development Right: The right granted to a land owner or other authorized party to improve a property. Such right is usually expressed in terms of a use and intensity allowed under existing zoning regulation.
Dwelling Unit: Any residential structure, whether or not attached to real property, including condominium and cooperative units and mobile or manufactured homes. It includes both one-to-four-family and multi-family structures. Vacation or second homes and rental properties are also included.
Elderly Units: Specific units in a development restricted to residents over a certain age (as young as 55 years and over). Persons with disabilities may share certain developments with the elderly. Element: A division or chapter of the General Plan, Master Plan, or Comprehensive Plan.
Emergency Shelter: A facility designed to provide free temporary housing on a night-by-night basis to homeless families and individuals.
Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG): A grant program administered by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided on a formula basis to large entitlement jurisdictions.
Extremely Low-Income Limit: The upper limit for the extremely low-income category, set at 30 percent of the HUD area median family income. This is not an official program eligibility income limit, except when associated with a specific family size (e.g., "single person," "family of two," "family of three").
Fair Market Rent (FMR): Freely set rental rates defined by HUD as the median gross rents charged for available standard units in a county or standard metropolitan statistical area. FMRs are used for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program and other HUD programs and are published annually by HUD.
Farm Labor Housing (Farm Worker): Units for migrant farm workers that can be available for transitional housing for the homeless when not occupied by migrant farm workers.
C-3
Family Income: In decennial census data, family income includes the incomes of all household members 15 years old and over related to the householder. Although the family income statistics from each census cover the preceding calendar year, the characteristics of individuals and the composition of families refer to the time of enumeration (April 1 of the respective census years). Thus, the income of the family does not include amounts received by individuals who were members of the family during all or part of the calendar year prior to the census if these individuals no longer resided with the family at the time of census enumeration. Similarly, income amounts reported by individuals who did not reside with the family during the calendar year prior to the census but who were members of the family at the time of enumeration are included. However, the composition of most families was the same during the preceding calendar year as at the time of enumeration.
FHA Insured: The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgages so that lower- and moderate-income people can obtain financing for homeownership.
First-time Homeowner Program: A first-time homebuyer program provides low-income first-time homebuyers down payment assistance in the form of a second mortgage loan to serve as "gap financing." These loans can be up to $40,000 depending on the amount of assistance required by the individual homebuyer.
General Plan: The General Plan is a legal document, adopted by the legislative body of a city or county, setting forth policies regarding long-term development.
Group Quarters: A facility which houses groups of unrelated persons not living in households; examples include dormitories, institutions, and prisons.
Habitable (room): A habitable room is a space in a structure for living, sleeping, eating, or cooking. Bathrooms, toilet compartments, closets, storage or utility space, and similar areas, are not considered habitable space.
Habitat for Humanity: Habitat for Humanity is a nonprofit, ecumenical Christian housing ministry that seeks to eliminate poverty housing and homelessness from the world, and to make decent shelter a matter of conscience and action. Through volunteer labor and donations of money and materials, Habitat builds and rehabilitates simple, decent houses with the help of the homeowner (partner) families. Habitat houses are sold to partner families at no profit, financed with affordable, no-interest loans. The homeowners' monthly mortgage payments are used to build still more Habitat houses.
Hispanic or Latino: In decennial census data, Hispanics or Latinos are those who classify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the census questionnaire — "Mexican," "Puerto Rican," or "Cuban" — as well as those who indicate that they are "other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino." People who do not identify with one of the specific origins listed on the questionnaire but indicate that they are "other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino” are those whose origins are from Spain, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or South America, the Dominican Republic, or people identifying themselves generally as Spanish, Spanish-American, Hispanic, Hispano, Latino, and so on. People who are Hispanic or Latino may be of any race.
C-4
Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME): HOME provides formula grants to states and localities that communities use—often in partnership with local nonprofit groups—to fund a wide range of activities that build, buy, and/or rehabilitate affordable housing for rent or homeownership or provide direct rental assistance to low-income people.
Homeless Person: An individual living outside or in a building not meant for human habitation, or which they have no legal right to occupy, in an emergency shelter, or in a temporary housing program which may include a transitional and supportive housing program if habitation time limits exist. This definition includes substance abusers, mentally ill people, and sex offenders who are homeless. (US House Bill 2163).
Household: A household is made up of all persons living in a dwelling unit whether or not they are related by blood, birth, or marriage.
Housing Authority: An organization established under state law to provide housing for low- and moderate-income persons. Commissioners are appointed by the local governing body of the jurisdiction in which they operate. Many housing authorities own their own housing or operate public housing funded by HUD.
Housing Choice Voucher Program: A subsidy program funded by the federal government and overseen by the California Department of Housing and Community Development to provide low rents and/or housing payment contributions for very low and low-income households. Formerly known as Section 8.
HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development): A cabinet-level department of the federal government that oversees program and funding for affordable housing laws, development, and federally funded financial assistance.
HUD Area Median Family Income: HUD is required by law to set income limits that determine the eligibility of applicants for HUD's assisted housing programs. Income limits are calculated annually for metropolitan areas and non-metropolitan counties in the US. They are based on HUD estimates of median family income, with adjustments for family size. Adjustments are also made for areas that have unusually high or low income to housing cost relationships.
Income Categories: The federal and state governments require that local jurisdictions consider the housing needs of households in various "income categories." Income categories are determined by the median household income at the local level.
Large Family or Household: A household or family with five or more members.
Low-Income Household: Low-income households are defined as households with incomes between 50 percent and 80 percent of the area median household income.
Low-Income Housing: Housing that is made available at prices lower than market rates. These lower prices are achieved through various financial mechanisms employed by state and local government authorities.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC): The LIHTC program is an indirect federal subsidy used to finance the development of affordable rental housing for low-income households. The LIHTC
C-5
program may seem complicated, but many local housing and community development agencies are effectively using these tax credits to increase the supply of affordable housing in their communities.
Market-Rate Housing: Housing that is not built or maintained with the help of government subsidy. The prices of market-rate homes are determined by the market and are subject to the laws of supply and demand.
Manufactured Home: Housing that is constructed of manufactured components, assembled partly at the site rather than totally at the site. Also referred to as modular housing.
McKinney-Vento Act: The primary federal response targeted to assisting homeless individuals and families. The scope of the act includes: outreach, emergency food and shelter, transitional and permanent housing, primary health care services, mental health, alcohol and drug abuse treatment, education, job training, and child care. There are nine titles under the McKinney-Vento Act that are administered by several different federal agencies, including HUD. McKinney-Vento Act Programs administered by HUD include: Emergency Shelter Grant Program Supportive Housing Program, Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation for Single-Room Occupancy Dwellings, Supplemental Assistance to Facilities to Assist the Homeless, and Single Family Property Disposition Initiative. (US House Bill 2163).
Median-Income: Each year, the federal government calculates the median income for communities across the country to use as guidelines for federal housing programs. Area median incomes are set according family size.
Mental Illness: A serious and persistent mental or emotional impairment that significantly limits a person's ability to live independently.
Mixed Use: This refers to different types of development (e.g., residential, retail, or office) occurring on the same lot or in close proximity to each other. Cities and counties sometimes allow mixed-use in commercial zones, with housing typically located above primary commercial uses on the premises.
Mobile Home: A type of manufactured housing. A structure movable in one or more sections, which is at least 8 feet in width and 32 feet in length, is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling unit when connected to the required utilities, either with or without a permanent foundation.
Mobile Home Park: A parcel or tract of land having as its principal use the rental, leasing, or occupancy of space by two or more mobile homes on a permanent or semi-permanent basis, including accessory buildings, or uses customarily incidental thereto.
Mobile Home Subdivision: A subdivision of land, plotted in conformance to NRS Chapter 278 and applicable city ordinances for the purpose of providing mobile home lots.
Moderate Income: Moderate income households are defined as households with incomes between 80 percent and 120 percent of the county median.
C-6
Mortgage Credit Certificate Program (MCCs): The MCC is a federal income tax credit program. An MCC increases the loan amount you qualify for and it increases an applicant's take-home pay. The MCC entitles applicants to take a federal income tax credit of 20 percent of the annual interest they pay on their home mortgage. Because the MCC reduces an applicant's federal income taxes and increases their net earnings, it helps homebuyers qualify for a first home mortgage. The MCC is registered with the IRS, and it continues to decrease federal income taxes each year for as long as an applicant lives in the home.
Mortgage Revenue Bond: A state, county, or city program providing financing for the development of housing through the sale of tax-exempt bonds.
Multi-family Dwelling: A structure containing two or more dwelling units for the use of individual households; an apartment or condominium building is an example of this dwelling unit type.
Non-Hispanic: In decennial census data and in Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data after 2003, non-Hispanics are those who indicate that they are not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino.
Permanent Housing: Housing which is intended to be the tenant's home for as long as they choose. In the supportive housing model, services are available to the tenant, but accepting services cannot be required of tenants or in any way impact their tenancy. Tenants of permanent housing sign legal lease documents. (US House Bill 2163).
Permanent Supportive Housing: Long-term community-based housing and supportive services for homeless persons with disabilities. The intent of this type of supportive housing is to enable this special needs population to live as independently as possible in a permanent setting. The supportive services may be provided by the organization managing the housing or provided by other public or private service agencies. There is no definite length of stay. (US House Bill 2163)
Persons with a Disability: HUD's Housing Choice Voucher program defines a "person with a disability" as: a person who is determined to: 1, have a physical, mental, or emotional impairment that is expected to be of continued and indefinite duration, substantially impedes his or her ability to live independently, and is of such a nature that the ability could be improved by more suitable housing conditions; or 2) have a developmental disability, as defined in the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act. (US House Bill 2163)
Project-Based Rental Assistance: Rental assistance provided for a project, not for a specific tenant. A tenant receiving project-based rental assistance gives up the right to that assistance upon moving from the project.
Public Housing: HUD administers federal aid to local housing agencies that manage the housing for low-income residents at rents they can afford. HUD furnishes technical and professional assistance in planning, developing, and managing these developments. It provides decent and safe rental housing for eligible low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. Public housing can be in the form of high-rise apartments or scattered-site single-family homes.
Rehabilitation: The upgrading of a building previously in a dilapidated or substandard condition for human habitation.
C-7
Rental Assistance: A rental subsidy for eligible low- and very low-income tenants. This assistance provides the share of the monthly rent that exceeds 30 percent of the tenants' adjusted monthly income.
Rent-to-Own: A development is financed so that at a certain point in time, the rental units are available for purchase based on certain restrictions and qualifications.
Rural Housing Service (RHS): A part of the US Department of Agriculture's Rural Development. The RHS offers financial aid to low-income residents of rural areas.
Second Units: Also referred to as "granny" or "in-law apartments." Second units provide a second housing unit on the same lot as a single-family dwelling unit.
Section 8: Section 8, now known as the Housing Choice Voucher Program, is a subsidy program funded by the federal government and overseen by the California Department of Housing and Community Development to provide low rents and/or housing payment contributions for very low- and low-income households.
Service Needs: The particular services required by special populations, typically including needs such as transportation, personal care, housekeeping, counseling, meals, case management, personal emergency response, and other services preventing premature institutionalization and assisting individuals to continue living independently.
Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Dwelling: The SRO program provides rental assistance for homeless persons in connection with the moderate rehabilitation of SRO dwellings. SRO housing contains units for occupancy by one person. These units may contain food preparation or sanitary facilities, or both.
Special Needs Projects: Housing for a designated group of people who desire special accommodations, such as services, in addition to the housing. Services may or may not be provided as part of the rental project. Examples of special needs populations are people with physical disabilities, developmental disabilities, mental illness, or those who need assisted living. It also includes health care facilities.
Substandard Housing: This refers to housing where major repair or replacement may be needed to make it structurally sound, weatherproofed, and habitable.
Subsidized Housing: Typically refers to housing that rents for less than the market rate due to a direct financial contribution from the government. There are two general types of housing subsidies. The first is most commonly referred to as "project-based" where the subsidy is linked with a particular unit or development and the other is known as "tenant-based" where the subsidy is linked to the low-income individual or family. The terms “assisted" and "subsidized" are often used interchangeably.
Supportive Housing: Housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population, and that is linked to an on-site or off-site service that assists the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. Target population means persons with low incomes who have one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance
C-8
abuse, or other chronic health condition, or individuals eligible for services provided pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 4500) of the Welfare and Institutions Code) and may include, among other populations, adults, emancipated minors, families with children, elderly persons, young adults aging out of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans, and homeless people.
Supportive Services: Services provided to residents of supportive housing for the purpose of facilitating the independence of residents. Some examples are case management, medical or psychological counseling and supervision, child care, transportation, and job training.
Transitional Housing: Buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program requirements that require the termination of assistance and recirculating of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at a predetermined future point in time that shall be no less than six months from the beginning of the assistance.
Department of Veterans Affairs VA-Guaranteed: VA-guaranteed loans are made by private lenders to eligible veterans for the purchase of a home which must be for their own personal occupancy. To get a loan, a veteran must apply to a lender. If the loan is approved, VA will guarantee a portion of it to the lender. This guaranty protects the lender against loss up to the amount guaranteed and allows a veteran to obtain favorable financing terms.
Very Low-Income Limit: Very low-income households are defined as households with incomes less than 50 percent of the area median household income.
Veteran: Anyone who has been discharged from the military generally after at least two years of service whether they served on active duty in a conflict or not. (US House Bill 2163).
Workforce Housing: Refers to housing that is meant for residents making low, moderate, or above moderate area median income. Some programs focus on employers providing assistance to their employees; some are instituting inclusionary programs, while others give preference to this group in their homeownership programs. Some jurisdictions have programs for specific segments of the workforce that are vital for the everyday function of the community such as teachers, policeman, and other public employees.
Zoning: Zoning is an activity under taken by local jurisdictions to direct and shape land development activities. The intent of zoning is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by ensuring that incompatible land uses (e.g., residential vs. heavy industrial) are not located next to each other. Zoning also impacts land values, creating and taking away "capitol" for and from property owners. For example, a lot that is zoned for commercial development is more valuable (in financial terms) than a lot that is zoned for open space. Typically, lots that are zoned for higher densities have greater value on the market than lots that are zoned for lower densities. Zoning is one of the most important regulatory functions performed by local jurisdictions.
C-9
US CENSUS TERMS
Children: The term "children," as used in tables on living arrangements of children under 18, are all persons under 18 years, excluding people who maintain households, families, or subfamilies as a reference person or spouse.
Own Children: Sons and daughters, including stepchildren and adopted children, of the householder. Similarly, "own" children in a subfamily are sons and daughters of the married couple or parent in the subfamily. (All children shown as members of related subfamilies are own children of the person(s) maintaining the subfamily.) For each type of family unit identified the count of "own children under 18 year old" is limited to never-married children: however, "own children under 25"and “own children of any age," as the terms are used here, include all children regardless of marital status. The counts include never-married children living away from home in college dormitories.
Related Children: Includes all people in a household under the age of 18, regardless of marital status, who are related to the householder. It does not include householder's spouse or foster children, regardless of age.
Ethnic Origin: People of Hispanic origin were identified by a question that asked for self-identification of the persons’ origin or descent. Respondents were asked to select their origin (and the origin of other household members) from a "flash card" listing ethnic origins. People of Hispanic origin in particular were those who indicated that their origin was Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or some other Hispanic origin. It should be noted that people of Hispanic origin may be of any race.
Family: A group of two or more people who reside together and who are related by birth, marriage, or adoption.
Family Household (Family): A family includes a householder and one or more people living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All people in a household who are related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her family. A family household may contain people not related to the householder, but those people are not included as part of the householder's family in census tabulations. Thus, the number of family households is equal to the number of families, but family households may include more members than do families. A household can contain only one family for purposes of census tabulations. Not all households contain families since a household may comprise a group of unrelated people or one person living alone.
Family Size: Refers to the number of people in a family.
Family Type: Refers to how the members of a family are related to one another and the householder. Families may be a "married couple family," "single parent family," "stepfamily," or "subfamily."
Household: A household includes all the people who occupy a housing unit as their usual place of residence.
C-10
Household Income: The total income of all the persons living in a household. A household is usually described as very low income, low income, moderate income, and above moderate income based on household size and income, relative to regional median income.
Household Size: The total number of people living in a housing unit.
Household Type and Relationship: Households are classified by type according to the sex of the householder and the presence of relatives. Examples include: married couple family; male householder, no wife present; female householder, no husband present; spouse (husband/wife); child; and other relatives.
Householder: The person, or one of the people, in whose name the home is owned, being bought, or rented. If there is no such person present, any household member 15 years old and over can serve as the householder for the purposes of the census. Two types of householders are distinguished: a family householder and a non-family householder. A family householder is a householder living with one or more people related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. The householder and all people in the household related to him are family members. A nonfamily householder is a householder living alone or with non-relatives only.
Housing Unit: A house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms, or a single room occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to the intended occupants whenever possible.
Median: This measure represents the middle value (if n is odd) or the average of the two middle values (if n is even) in an ordered list of data values. The median divides the total frequency distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases fall below the median and one-half of the cases exceed the median.
Median Age: This measure divides the age distribution in a stated area into two equal parts: one-half of the population falling below the median value and one-half above the median value.
Median Income: The median income divides the income distribution into two equal groups; one has incomes above the median and the other has incomes below the median.
Occupied Housing Unit: A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the usual place of residence of the person or group of people living in it at the time of enumeration, or if the occupants are only temporarily absent—that is, away on vacation or a business trip. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living quarters.
Overcrowded Units: Overcrowded units are occupied housing units that have more than one person per room.
Per Capita Income: Average obtained by dividing aggregate income by total population of an area.
C-ll
Population Estimate (Population Estimates Program): The Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program produces July i estimates for years after the last published decennial census (2010), as well as for past decades. Existing data series such as births, deaths, federal tax returns, Medicare enrollment, and immigration, are used to update the decennial census base counts. PEP estimates are used in federal funding allocations, in setting the levels of national surveys, and in monitoring recent demographic changes.
Population Projections: Estimates of the population for future dates. They illustrate plausible courses of future population change based on assumptions about future births, deaths, international migration, and domestic migration. Projections are based on an estimated population consistent with the most recent decennial census as enumerated. While projections and estimates may appear similar, there are some distinct differences between the two measures. Estimates usually are for the past, while projections typically are for future dates. Estimates generally use existing data, while projections must assume what demographic trends will be in the future.
Poverty: Following the Office of Management and Budget's Directive 14, the Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to detect who is poor. If the total income for a family or unrelated individual falls below the relevant poverty threshold, then the family or unrelated individual is classified as being "below the poverty level." Poverty Rate: The percentage of people (or families) who are below poverty.
Race: The race of individuals was identified by a question that asked for self-identification of the person's race. Respondents were asked to select their race from a “flashcard” listing racial groups.
Severely Overcrowded: Occupied housing units with 1.51 or more persons per room.
Single-Family Detached Homes: A one-unit residential structure detached from any other house (i.e., with open space on all four sides). A house is considered detached even if it has an adjoining shed or garage.
Single-Family Attached Housing: A one-unit residential structure that has one or more walls extending from ground to roof separating it from adjoining structures. This category includes row houses, townhouses, and houses attached to nonresidential structures.
Tenure: Refers to the distinction between owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing units. A housing unit is "owned" if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit, even if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. A cooperative or condominium unit is "owned only if the owner or co-owner lives in it." All other occupied units are classified as "rented," including units rented for cash rent and those occupied without payment of cash rent.
Two-Family Buildings: These dwellings may also be referred to as single-family attached because a duplex with a shared wall would qualify in both categories. Other two-family buildings would include older single-family homes that have been converted into two separate living spaces or “flats" that do not share walls, but a floor/ceiling.
C-12
Units in Structure: A structure is a separate building that either has open spaces on all sides or is separated from other structures by dividing walls that extend from ground to roof. In determining the number of units in a structure, all housing units, both occupied and vacant, are counted.
Unemployed: All civilians 16 years old and over are classified as unemployed if they (1) were neither "at work" nor "with a job but not at work" during the reference week, and (2) were actively looking for work during the last four weeks, and (3) were available to accept a job. Also included as unemployed are civilians who did not work at all during the reference week, were waiting to be called back to a job from which they had been laid off, and were available for work except for temporary illness.
Unemployment Rate: The proportion of the civilian labor force that is unemployed, expressed as a percent.
Vacancy Rate: The proportion of the housing inventory that is available “for sale” or “for rent." It is computed by dividing the number of available units by the sum of occupied units and available units, and then multiplying by 100.
Vacant Housing Unit: A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of enumeration, unless its occupants are only temporarily absent. Units temporarily occupied at the time of enumeration entirely by people who have a usual residence elsewhere are also classified as vacant. New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place. Vacant units are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements; that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished.
White: In decennial census data, the White category includes persons having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as “White" or report entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish. The "alone" designation, as used with decennial census data, indicates that the person reported only one race.

1.0 Introduction
1.1	PURPOSE
This document is the General Plan for the City of Dunsmuir. It incorporates by reference the Housing Element (prepared and periodically updated separately), and any future elements to be adopted by the City as an element of the General Plan.
The General Plan, simply described, is the City's "constitution" for development. It is an effort by the City to consider and respond to the needs and expectations of its residents concerning future development. This "constitution" is formatted within the legal framework established by the State and is based on knowledge of existing physical and social potentials and limitations concerning the City of Dunsmuir. The General Plan is developed by establishing basic "goals" and "programs" to resolve and/or direct significant community issues. Once a draft is completed, it is reviewed by the community and adopted by the City Council as the general plan for the City. This document is then used regularly by the City Council, Planning Commission and staff when dealing with matters affecting the physical, economic and social development of the community.
The General Plan is also regularly referred to by individuals or businesses contemplating potential development activity within the community. The document explains what the community expects from new development and where development should occur. Goals in the General Plan also aid the Council in seeking grants and other funding to address local issues and needs.
1.2	PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION & LOCATION
The City of Dunsmuir is located in Northern California near the southern border of Siskiyou County on Interstate 5 (see Figure 1-1). It is situated at the upper end of the Upper Sacramento River Canyon with the Cascade Mountains generally to the east and the Klamath Mountains to the west. The Shasta-Trinity National Forest is near the City both to the east and west. Situated in a steep and relatively narrow canyon, the City parallels the Sacramento River, the Union Pacific Railroad and Interstate 5. The elevation of the City on the south is 2,250 feet above sea level and 3,270 feet at the airport on the north end. According to the U.S. Census, the population of the City of Dunsmuir in 2000 was 1,923. The California Department of Finance estimates that the 2005 population of Dunsmuir was 1,897.
1.3	STATE MANDATES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN
Local planning and land use powers are granted to cities and counties by the State Constitution. However, State legislation shapes the manner in which these powers are exercised. California state law requires that every city and county adopt a General Plan to guide the physical development of the land within the jurisdiction's boundaries (California Government Code §65300). The general plan is intended to serve as the "constitution" for the jurisdiction concerning development and establishes guidelines for land use and development.
State law requires that the Plan be comprehensive and that specific subjects or "elements" be addressed in the Plan. The required elements as specified by Government Code §65302 (a) through (g) are:
•	Land Use	•	Housing	•	Open	Space	• Safety
•	Circulation	•	Conservation	•	Noise
City of Dunsmuir General Plan

1.0 Introduction
Some elements like the Open Space Element encompass a number of planning issues while others, such as the Noise Element, address a more specific topic. Because local conditions vary, the relevance and importance of each issue will differ from city to city. The General Plan needs only to address each required element to the extent that it is applicable to the City, as long as the minimum requirements of the law are satisfied.
State law also allows the local jurisdiction to include additional, or "optional" elements, to address specific issues of concern, as well as combining required and optional elements as deemed appropriate (Government Code §65303). The Dunsmuir General Plan, for example, combines the Open Space and Conservation Elements. It also contains an optional "Historic Preservation Element".
1 A TERM AND SCOPE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
Since the General Plan affects current and future generations, State law requires the Plan to take a "long-term" perspective, typically 1 0 to 20 years into the future. This Plan addresses planning for Dunsmuir through the year 2025.
In addition to addressing the mandatory planning topics, the General Plan must also have the following characteristics:
Long-range: The General Plan is intended to be long-range to avoid incremental planning decisions that may occur over many years and that may eventually conflict with each other. This General Plan considers issues that may impact the City throughout the next two decades.
Comprehensive: The Plan must coordinate all major components of the community's development, covering the entire incorporated area of the City as well as any other land that bears relation to the City's planning issues. In addition, the Plan must address the full range of issues associated with the City's physical development including possible annexations and activities within the City's sphere of influence.
General: Because it is long-range and comprehensive, the Plan must be general in nature. The Plan's purpose is to serve as a broad framework for detailed public and private development.
Internally Consistent: All parts of the Plan (text, diagrams and figures in all elements) must be fully integrated and not in conflict with each other.
1.5	USE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
The City of Dunsmuir General Plan is intended to serve as a tool to assist the City Council, Planning Commission, staff and other commissions and committees in formulating and implementing community guidelines and programs.
The General Plan has the following main purposes:
*	To enable the City Council and Planning Commission to reach agreement on long-range development policies.
•	To provide consistency in community development policy over the life of the plan. This allows for changes in the plan, but only after reasonable study and consideration.
City of Dunsmuir General Plan
December 2006

1.0 Introduction
•	To provide a basis for judging whether specific private development proposals and public projects are in harmony with the City's long-range policies.
•	To allow other public agencies and private developers to design projects that are consistent with the City policies, or to seek changes in those policies, when warranted, through the process of amending the General Plan.
•	To provide an agreement among different agencies for development in unincorporated portions of the Planning Area.
Uses and Standards: The General Plan's land use classifications, as outlined in the Land Use Element, are not as specific as zoning ordinance classifications. For example, multiple zoning districts may be consistent with a single General Plan land use classification, as long as the densities and unit types allowed in each zoning district are also permitted in the relevant General Plan category. Further, zoning district standards will typically address building setbacks, building height, fencing and parking, while these details typically are not addressed in the General Plan..
Spatial Correlation: The Zoning Map should reflect the general pattern of land use depicted on the General Plan land use map. However, the two need not be identical. Boundaries of land use classifications depicted on the Land Use Map are intended to be generalized; zoning boundaries are more precise and parcel specific.
Timing: State law allows a "reasonable time" for reconciling any inconsistencies between the City's General Plan and the City's Zoning Ordinance. The City anticipates that all zoning and General Plan inconsistencies will be addressed within the first five (5) years following adoption of the General Plan.
1.6	DUNSMUIR GENERAL PLAN HISTORY
Dunsmuir began its long-range planning program almost 50 years ago in 1957. This program has continued with updates at intervals to the present. The following discussion summarizes these activities:
•	The "1957 Master Land Use Plan" reviewed and categorized land use and population distribution in the City. The population during that period (1 954 estimate) was 3,984.
•	The "1963 Master Plan Report" reviewed the changes caused by the construction of the major segments of Interstate 5 in Dunsmuir and also included the following:
1.	Land use, streets, park and public building standards.
2.	Land Use Plan.
3.	Street Plan.
4.	Community Facility Plan.
5.	Zoning Ordinance review.
•	The "1973 Economic Survey" reviewed various demographic and environmental statistics and focused on economic conditions, City services and transportation. The survey noted that "tourism and recreation is by far the strongest economic potential of the area."
•	The "1979 Land Use and Housing Elements" were the two most ambitious planning efforts at that time. This document took into account additions to the City up to Mott Airport and the washout of the Prospect Avenue Bridge. This effort, for planning purposes, divided Dunsmuir into four planning areas and followed the State mandate to categorize and designate land uses within the

1.0 Introduction
City. This 1979 planning document also served as the genesis for the major structural rehabilitation and historic preservation efforts that have taken place since that time.
•	The "1985 General Plan" was the most thorough of these planning efforts. It placed greater emphasis on specific planning goals, development policies and proposed implementation measures.
•	In March 2004, the City adopted an updated Housing Element as part of the General Plan. Later that spring the City Council authorized the update of the City's General Plan as a means to reflect current issues, address related legal requirements and to reevaluate and consider the shifting attitudes and expectations of its citizens.
1.7	THE PLANNING AREA
A general plan must include all territory within the boundaries of the jurisdiction for which the plan is being adopted. It should also include any area outside the jurisdiction which, in that jurisdiction's judgment, bears a relation to its planning concerns. Since many planning and development issues cross over political boundaries, California planning law provides for extraterritorial planning. This is a process by which the City can indicate to its neighboring jurisdictions its concern for the future use of land and resources adjacent to the current city limits. In the case of Dunsmuir, adjacent lands are primarily under the jurisdiction of Siskiyou County. Some land in the vicinity is managed by the U.S. Forest Service.
The Siskiyou County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) has adopted a sphere of influence for the City. The boundary of the sphere of influence basically circles the City and recognizes the area of anticipated future City expansion as well as an area of special concern due to its proximity to the city. The current area of the City is approximately 1,800 acres. The area of the sphere of influence outside the city limits is about 4,600 additional acres. Therefore, the total planning area encompasses approximately 6,400 acres, or 10 square miles. Figure 1-2 depicts the planning area for the Dunsmuir General Plan.
1.8	SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONCERNS
The State has mandated General Plan requirements to emphasize planning for the physical and environmental development of the City. However, there is another important aspect of planning for the future, and that is the need to address the social and economic concerns of the citizens. Policy and implementing programs have been developed with consideration given to the impacts on low-and moderate-income households as well as on business development, employment, and the costs and revenues of the City.
1.9	CONTENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN
Each issue addressed in the General Plan should include three basic steps: data and information gathering and analysis; formulation of appropriate policy; and recognition of implementation measures that will support the policies of the Plan.
Data and Analysis: State planning law stipulates that specific background information be adopted for certain mandatory elements (e.g., Housing Elements) as part of each General Plan.

1.0 Introduction
Background information on the other elements may be adopted by reference or summarized in the Plan, but should be readily available to the decision-makers and citizens alike.
Policy Development: Policy consists of those parts of the General Plan that direct private and governmental action. Fora policy to be useful, it should be clear and unambiguous. The decisionmakers need to be aware of the difference between "shall" and "should". "Shall" indicates an unequivocal directive, whereas "should" (and words such as "may" and "possibly) signifies a less rigid directive to be applied in the absence of compelling considerations.
Implementation: An implementation program is an integrated set of specific measures and actions that the City intends to take to support and/or carry out a policy of the General Plan. Similar to the required background data, the Open Space, Housing and Noise Elements require specific implementation measures or programs. The programs for the other elements must be developed by the City to reflect local concerns rather than a set of general statements. It has been observed that a few well-conceived measures will usually accomplish more than a long list of possibilities.
1.10	CONTENTS OF GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
Each element of this General Plan contains: 1) the legal basis for the element; 2) a narrative discussion of background issues to provide an understanding of issues being addressed; and 3) goals, objectives, policies and implementation measures to address identified planning topics. Goals often have multiple objectives, policies and implementation measures.
The following terms apply within this General Plan:
Goal: A declaration of the ideal future state of the community with regard to the issue being addressed (e.g., "An economically vital downtown commercial district").
Objective: A statement that provides for an attainable, and preferably measurable and time-specific, intermediate step toward achieving a previously stated goal (e.g., "The City would like to see 75% greater occupancy of vacant storefronts along Main Street within the next five years").
Policy: A specific statement that guides decision-making. It is based on and helps implement a previously stated objective (e.g., "In order to attract new businesses to the downtown commercial district, the City shall provide a variety of economic incentives to owners of properties located along Main Street for the improvement of building facades and interior retail spaces").
Implementation Measure: An action, procedure or program that can be adopted by the City in order to facilitate the respective policy (e.g., "in order to attract new retailers to the downtown commercial district, the City shall provide low-interest loans to businesses located along Main Street for the improvement of retail spaces").
1.11	KEY PLANNING ASSUMPTIONS
Assumptions are statements of apparent facts and observations concerning development issues and trends in the planning area. These assumptions, along with the goals, policies and implementation measures, provide the basic framework for the General Plan. The following assumptions serve as the basis upon which the Dunsmuir General Plan is framed:
City of Dunsmuir General Plan
December 2006

1.0 Introduction
•	Residents of Dunsmuir locate or remain here primarily due to the small town atmosphere, the mountainous environment, affordable housing and overall quality of life.
•	Population growth will remain slow and constant during the life of the Plan until such time that new development occurs in the northernmost area of the City or possibly through annexation to the south.
•	Employment opportunities will show some limited expansion in response to an increase in tourism and demand for local services.
•	There will be a continuing demand for affordable single-family housing and increased demand for multifamily housing.
•	The primary means of transportation will be the automobile due to the need to access a greater variety of commercial and professional services and jobs in the Mt, Shasta/Weed area or, more regionally, in the Redding area or Yreka and other aresas of Siskiyou County. There will be no major construction or reconstruction of County roads or State highways in the area during the life of the Plan.
•	Tourism and cottage industries will most likely lead employment growth in Dunsmuir. Historically, the loss of significant employment in logging and railroad industries are being replaced by recreation, tourism and public service jobs, and by persons who are employed in other communities and/or telecommute.
•	Due to lack of land with relatively level topography, few large industries are expected to move to Dunsmuir. The most likely industries will be small businesses that employ less than twenty people.
•	Due to limited employment opportunities in Dunsmuir, many new residents moving into the community will tend to be either retired, or the heads of the household will be employed elsewhere and commuting to work, or they will frequently telecommute to a job located out of the County.
•	The historic small town character of Dunsmuir, coupled with the wealth of natural resources in the area, especially the Sacramento River, are among the strongest assets of the City for healthy development and sustainable economic growth.

2.0 Land Use
2.1	INTRODUCTION
As described in the California General Plan Guidelines, the land use element functions as a guide to planners, the genera! public and community decision makers as to the ultimate pattern of development for the city. In practice, it is the most visible and often-used element in the local general plan. Although all general plan elements carry equal weight, the land use element is often perceived as being most representative of the general plan.
The land use element also has the broadest scope of the seven required genera! plan elements. It integrates most of the concerns of the other elements and plays a critical role of balancing land use needs and issues with identified constraints and opportunities.
2.2	POPULATION TRENDS
Population projections play a major role in the formulation of a general plan. The distribution and extent of designated land uses is largely based on the expected demands of a projected population. This includes the need for supporting public facilities and services. Table 2-1 below shows historic population trends.
Table 2-1: Population Trends, City of Dunsmuir Population Percent Change

1980	2,2530)	+1.8%
1990	2,129(1)	-5.5%
2000	1,923(2}	-9.7%
J) 1970, 1980 and 1990 data from	) 996 Housing Element
(2) Census 2000 Summary Fite (SF J), Table DP 1
As noted in Table 2-1, between 1990 and 2000 the City of Dunsmuir experienced a 9.7 percent decline in population. During this same time period, for comparison, Siskiyou County experienced a 1.8 percent increase in population. The decline in the City's population has primarily been the result of the loss of timber and railroad-related jobs and the relocation of many families who were employed in those industries. There has also been an increase in the number of dwellings that are being used primarily as seasonal homes. The new population, as noted by Table 4 and Table 7 of Dunsmuir's Housing Element (updated, 2004), is generally older with smaller families as indicated by a decline in the number of persons per household between 1990 and 2000. The average household size in Dunsmuir, according to the 2000 Census, is 2,22 persons per household.
With the past declining population trend, it is difficult to project the future population of Dunsmuir for the next twenty years with much reliability. However, with a growing economy in southern Siskiyou County, it is logical to assume that Dunsmuir will eventually benefit from this activity and the past trends of declining population will cease.
One significant [imitation to growth in Dunsmuir is the lack of vacant land suitable for development. Most vacant lands in the City have either substantial topographic constraints or lack adequate access. While developable lands do exist between the north Dunsmuir Avenue interchange and the airport, these lands have not yet been subject to much development pressure.

2.0 Land Use
On the positive side, the community of Dunsmuir is growing gradually with a few new dwellings added each year. It has been recognized as an attractive place for retired and semi-retired individuals and couples seeking the lifestyle of a small community.
Given these circumstances, it is presumed that the historic decline in population will cease and modest increases will begin to be recorded during the current planning period. Table 2-2 projects population changes in Dunsmuir for the next twenty years.

2010	1,910
2015	1,958
2020	2,033
2025	2,110
Projection Assumptions:
(1)	2006-2010: Those factors causing past population decline will cease and the population will increase slightly.
(2)	2011-2015: Growth will occurat 0.5% annually
(3)	2016-2025: Growth will increase slightly to 0.75% annually
2.3	LAND USE ANALYSIS
Residential Land Use: The single-family dwelling is the most typical housing type available throughout the community. As noted in Dunsmuir's Housing Element, 61 percent of all dwellings in the City were constructed before 1950. Residential development typically occurs on lots ranging in size from 5,500 to 6,500 square feet. The small size of many parcels and the topographic constraints caused by slopes that often exceed 15 percent limit the size of a dwelling that can be constructed. In many instances these constraints have also made the construction of garages impractical, resulting in extensive street parking. Only six new single-family dwellings were constructed in the City during the period of January 2001 to March 2004.
As noted in the 2000 Census, of the 1,168 dwelling units in the City at that time, 384 (32.9 percent) were rented. Although not identified therein, nearly all of these rented dwelling units are single-family dwellings. Multifamiiy units in Dunsmuir are limited and include typical two-story apartments, apartments over commercial development in the downtown area, and duplexes scattered throughout the community.
The City in the year 2000 had a 25.9 percent vacancy rate with 303 vacant units. Of this total, 133 dwellings were considered to be seasonally occupied dwellings that were vacant at the time of the 2000 Census {i.e., April 1, 2000). These seasonal dwellings represent 1 1 percent of the total housing stock; an uncharacteristically high number suggesting the desirability of Dunsmuir as a second home community.
Commercial Land Use: Currently the City has two primary commercial areas; 1) the downtown and related historic district, and 2) the north Dunsmuir Avenue area. The downtown area along Dunsmuir Avenue contains a variety of retail, personal service, food service and office uses. The downtown is representative of a main street business community of the early to mid-1900's. At one time it

accommodated alt of the business needs of the community and the traveling public. Now many of the buildings are vacant at ground floor level and a few apartments exist on the second floor. With use of the old hotel and other three-story and larger buildings for residential use, the area has accommodated a significant residential population.
The Historic District, located downtown on both Dunsmuir Avenue and Sacramento Avenue, contains numerous buildings representing the architecture of the early to mid~1900's. The City has adopted development standards for this area as a means to maintain the historic character and increase the area's attractiveness for commercial use and tourism.
The North Dunsmuir commercial area provides for a variety of uses, many of which serve tourists and accommodate local neighborhood needs. Businesses in this area include motels, gas stations, a grocery store and a variety of other commercial activities with an orientation toward "highway commercial" activities.
Heavy Commercial: The Dunsmuir Zoning Code includes a C-M, Commercial Services, Zoning District. This district was intended to be applied to "heavier" commercial uses than those typically allowed in the central and neighborhood commercial areas. While Heavy Commercial uses in the City are fairly limited, the addition of water, sewer and other services north of the north Dunsmuir Avenue interchange may provide further opportunities for commercial activities served by this category.
Industrial Land Use: Uses that may be categorized as industrial are extremely limited and scattered in the City of Dunsmuir. There is no single location where a concentration of industrial uses exists. The largest industrial parcel in the City is land accommodating the railroad and its related activities. The only other parcel zoned for industrial activity in the City was an auto dealership in the past and is currently being used for the sales and service of boats and recreational vehicles.
Public Agency: Schools, government offices and the airport are the most typical uses within this category. Public agency lands may also include lands that house public utilities, but that are not publicly owned.
Open Space: Recreation and open space lands are described in more detail in the Open Space and Conservation Element. Briefly, however, it should be noted that open space land uses include parks and public recreation facilities. The Sacramento River also provides unique and valuable open space and recreation opportunities through the City of Dunsmuir.
Resource Lands: Resource lands are lands that are identified as containing natural conditions or resources that may be suitable for timber production, provide substantial wildlife habitat, and/or serve to protect portions of the watershed. Much of the resource lands surrounding the City also have valuable scenic resources that are an important element of the City's viewshed. Resource Sand typically contains slopes greater than 30 percent that inhibit development. Resource lands may also include private and public open space areas, including lands within the National Forest.
Future Growth: A city's sphere of influence typically includes the area that the city will conceivably annex and expand into, but it may also include areas of particular concern to city planning, even if it is unlikely that the city would ever annex those lands. Much of Dunsmuir's sphere of influence contains steep slopes ranging from 20 to 50 percent. These areas are generally too steep to accommodate urban development. These canyon hillsides represent the City's viewshed and, in that context, are of concern to the City. They will likely remain as open space or resource lands. Approximately 1,500-

2.0 Land Use
2,000 acres of the sphere of influence contain slopes under 20 percent, which could theoretically be developed for urban uses with the extension of roads and infrastructure. This area is almost entirely located north of the north Dunsmuir Avenue interchange on both sides of Interstate 5 to a point approximately one-half mile north of the airport.
Portions of the city-owned airport property could possibly accommodate some additional residential development. The Airport Master Plan contemplated "aviation compatible residential" development on the eastern side of the 126-acre site on which the airport is located. Consideration of land use issues at and around the airport are addressed later in this Land Use Efement.
There are a variety of constraints to development in the North Dunsmuir area. Constraints include: lack of good through access, especially on the east side of the freeway; heavy freeway noise from Interstate 5; lack of water supply, storage and distribution; lack of wastewater infrastructure; and heavy forest cover. These constraints do not preclude development, but would require the combined efforts of the City and major properly owners in the area to plan and prepare this area for development.
Due to the potentially large capital expenditures for infrastructure, timing of development will be critical. It will be necessary to have a sufficient demand for housing and support uses to accommodate a large project that will be capable of financing necessary up-front costs with the expectation of sufficient sales to cover development costs and generate acceptable profit for the developer.
The provision of adequate access is a constraint to development, especially the need to provide multiple accesses for public safety in the event of wildfire. Basic access is available to the west area from the Mott Road interchange and Mott Road, which connects to Dunsmuir Avenue and the north Dunsmuir Avenue interchange to the south. The east side has Old Highway 99 serving much of the area, but needs to be better connected to the north Dunsmuir Road interchange.
With the airport, freeway and, to some extent, the railroad in the area, lands on the west side of the freeway with gentle topography also have the opportunity to attract industrial and commercial users. This would also require adequate water and wastewater infrastructure.
To accommodate a variety of land uses and plan for needed infrastructure, it may be desirable to develop a special development plan or "specific plan" for the area. A specific plan, which is typically a step between general plan land use designations and a more detailed subdivision map, is very appropriate for a large area affecting more than one property owner. Normally this level of planning is initiated and financed by property owners, but it could also be initiated by a city or in cooperation with a city. Besides establishing a detailed development plan and development standards for the area, a specific plan would also provide plans for infrastructure staging and financing.
Annexations of land to a city are typically initiated by property owners as they desire to develop their land or otherwise need city services. On the part of cities, annexations must be approached cautiously to ensure that the future cost of providing services to annexed lands will not become a financial burden to the city. For this reason, cost of providing services must be fully evaluated prior to annexation. In many instances, the cost of services to the potential annexation can be offset through annexation agreements that ensure that the city will receive a healthy share of sales tax, transient and occupancy taxes (i.e., TOT), and other tax sources.

2.0 Land Use
Mixed Use-Planned Development: Due to the complexity of planning issues surrounding the airport, the area surrounding it has been designated Mixed Use-Planned Development (MU-PD). The MU-PD land use designation is typically applied to lands that are suitable for a compatible mixture of land uses including, but not limited to, light industrial, commercial, residential, and/or public uses. Prior to development of properties designated MU-PD, projects shall be subject to approval of a Development Plan that, when approved, will be incorporated into a Planned Unit Development (PUD) Ordinance for the site, if appropriate. Approved Development Plans and related PUD ordinances for particular sites shall specify the appropriate development standards, code regulations and performance standards to be applied to development of the site.
2.4	DESCRIPTION OF LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
One of the fundamental sections of a genera! plan's land use element is the description of land use categories and designations. Descriptions of land use categories must include statements of the standards of population density and building intensity that are appropriate for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan. For the City of Dunsmuir, these descriptions are provided in Table 2.3 below. Figures 2.1a and 2.1b are visual depictions of planned land uses throughout the City and serve as the City's General Plan Land Use Maps. Since it is a requirement of law (California Government Code §65860) that a city's zoning ordinances be consistent with the general plan, it is also wise to describe the zoning districts that are typically associated with particular general plan land use designations. This is done in Table 2.4 following the land use maps.
The following table provides a genera! description of the land use designations that are used by the City of Dunsmuir. The City may, in the future, adopt additional classifications that are not included in this list.

2.5	LAND USE ELEMENT SPECIAL SECTIONS: HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT AND AIRPORT LAND USE
The Dunsmuir Land Use Element includes the following discussions of two particular special land use issues: 1) Hillside Development and 2) Airport Land Use.
2.5.1	HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT
Background:
Development in the City of Dunsmuir is significantly constrained by topography. Being located in a river canyon with steep canyon walls, opportunities for further development and City expansion are
City of Dunsmuir General Plan
December 2006
17
2.0 Land Use
limited. Initial development of the City occurred along the relatively flat areas near the railroad, the Sacramento River and Sacramento Avenue, gradually moving up the side of the canyon as more land was needed. The canyon floor following the river is fairly narrow. Most of the developed area of the City lies in a strip ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 feet wide within the canyon. Even then, existing development, especially in central Dunsmuir, is located on slopes of 12 to 15 percent or greater. Development in the City typically stops when slopes dramatically increase to 30 to 50 percent on both the east and west sides of the canyon.
Little undeveloped land remains in the City with slopes of less than 30 percent. One single large parcel of approximately 38 acres lies northeast of the Dunsmuir Elementary School and easterly of the Mountain Estates Subdivision. Lack of water pressure in this area (another consequence of steep topography) is currently a significant development constraint. However, work on a new water tank, which will ultimately provide water pressure to the area has been initiated. Slopes on this parcel range from 1 4 to 30 percent and, with appropriate standards and density limitations (2-3 units per gross acre), could generate 76 to 1 14 new dwelling units.
As a comparison, slopes in the Mountain Estates Subdivision to the west of this vacant parcel, range from 10 to 16 percent. As experienced within this project, parcels from 0.25- to 0.50- acre lots can be accommodated on slopes in this range without significant problems. Most of the homes are constructed on the natural grade, using split-level designs and/or moderate grading. Some natural vegetation remains on most lots since the lot size is large enough to allow the construction of the dwelling plus some limited level area without affecting the entire parcel. However, some street grades within the subdivision do begin to approach, and possibly exceed, the maximum desired limits of 1 0 to 1 2 percent, particularly near the intersection with Siskiyou Avenue. Street grades at this degree become a challenge for emergency equipment even in good weather conditions. Snow and ice make the road and intersections on steep grades extremely hazardous for all drivers.
When topography is steeper than 10 to 16 percent, there is greater pressure to create padded lots with buildable areas and usable yards. This grading removes most vegetation and results in artificially created slopes which increase the potential for erosion. Fortunately, within the Mountain Estates Subdivision, the smallest lot is approximately 11,000 square feet, with most of the lots being somewhat larger. This allows for greater flexibility and is more environmentally sensitive than the minimum 5,500 square foot lots allowed in the R-l residential zone district.
Within the City's sphere of influence, there is a considerable area north of the north Dunsmuir Avenue interchange, and northerly to and past the airport, that contains slopes under 20 percent. The slopes on the west side of Interstate 5 are more moderate than the slopes on the east side. Slopes with grades of 20 percent or less can, with appropriate standards, be developed with limited impact to the terrain, and at the same time allow for the construction of roads that can accommodate vehicles safely without excessively steep grades. Development can occur on slopes up to 30 percent but only with more restrictive development controls. When topography exceeds a 10 percent grade, site development becomes more complicated and costly. These slopes typically require steeper road grades and an increase in the size of cut and fill slopes. Development of these slopes also often results in increased erosion and the loss of natural vegetation. These complications and development costs will typically increase proportionately as topographic grades increase up to 20 percent and greater.

2,0 Land Use
Development Standards:
The most significant issues related to hillside development are fire prevention and emergency accessibility, erosion control, and preservation of natural terrain and vegetation. Another concern is the visual impact related to the type and extent of development to occur on each lot. Ordinances adopted to address these issues usually contain standards addressing the following:
•	Definition of a hillside, (those lands where special development standards apply);
•	Restrictions prohibiting division of land with excessive slopes;
•	Standards to retain part of each lot in a natural state;
•	Erosion control standards;
•	Limitations on the maximum height of cut and fill slopes;
•	Requirement for identification of building pads on each lot;
•	Emergency accessibility; and
•	Fire prevention standards.
The following discussion comments on some of the issues related to these standards:
Definition of Hillside: Since hillside developments require standards that are different from those on more level land, it is necessary to establish a threshold clearly determining when hillside standards are applicable. It is common to set a standard defining all lands with an average grade of 10 percent or greater as hillside lands. The average grade is determined by taking cross sections of the existing topography, perpendicular to the topographic contours, approximately every 100 feet across the site. Applying this approach, it is possible that only a portion of a project site might meet the criteria and be subject to hillside standards, with the remainder meeting normal development standards. However, in Dunsmuir, most land will exceed 1 0 percent and would be subject to hillside standards.
Only one provision of the City Code currently addresses hillside standards. Section 1 6.20.020 defines street design standards and allows a narrower street and options for curb, gutter and sidewalk when "approved average street grade exceeds fifteen (15) percent, and where zoning and deed restrictions prohibit future reduction of lot widths or areas." Adoption of a 1 0 percent standard for defining "hillside development" would require modification of this ordinance standard.
Excessive Slopes: Dunsmuir is surrounded by slopes that are considered to be too excessive to permit safe and environmentally sound development. Many hillside slopes are 30 to 50 percent and are nearly impossible to develop without causing severe impacts on the environment (e.g., erosion hazard, loss of habitat) and creating situations that are dangerous due to poor or inadequate emergency assess. Slopes exceeding 30 percent should be designated as excessive slopes, unless they are small areas and the predominant slope is considerably less than 30 percent. These steep slopes are best recognized as resource lands and left undeveloped, or are only allowed to be developed when kept in large acreage parcels with appropriate building pads and access routes specified, and fire safe standards can be satisfied.
Erosion Control and Natural Environment Preservation: These two issues are closely related and affected by hillside development. The construction of roads and related infrastructure requires increased use of cuts and fills. As cross slopes increase, the size of cuts and fills also increase. As these slopes are constructed, all natural vegetation within the cut and fill profile is lost, including adjacent vegetation in many instances due to effects on roots and drainage. The loss of vegetation cover and the exposure of unprotected soils on steep slopes dramatically increases the potential for

2.0 Land Use
erosion, siltation, and the possible undermining of the road structure should slopes fail due to excessive erosion.
Standards should be provided that will limit the extent of cuts and fills, retain as much of the site in its natural state as possible to reduce stormwater runoff and reduce the impacts of erosion. These standards typically include limitations on the maximum height of allowed cuts and fills, and require larger lots with undisturbed areas as the average slope increases. Since the Mountain Estates Subdivision has slopes ranging from approximately 10 to 16 percent, and lots range from approximately 10,000 to 15,000 square feet (or more), and since this density seems to work well without significant site impacts, the following example could apply: A 1 0,000 square foot lot would be required when the average cross slope is 10 percent, a 1 1,000 square foot Sot if the average cross slope is 1 1 percent, etc., continuing to increase the lot area an additional 1,000 square feet with each one percent slope increase.
Coupled with this formula could also be a natural area requirement where, for example, each lot is required to maintain a minimum of 25 percent of the lot in a natural state. As the slope of the lot increases, the amount of land kept in an undisturbed state should also increase. One approach is to increase the 25 percent minimum requirement by the average slope of the land. For example, if the slope of the land is 20 percent, the 25 percent minimum requirement would be increased another 20 percent, i.e., 25 percent plus 20 percent would require 45 percent of a lot with a 20 percent slope to be left in a natural state.
Coupling the above standards with limitations on the maximum height of cut and fill slopes, along with measures to stabilize these slopes, will significantly reduce erosion potential and reduce environmental impacts of hillside development. To ensure that these criteria can be met when reviewing a project, the development plan (tentative subdivision map, parcel map, etc.) should identify building pads on each proposed lot. The area outside of the building pad would be the area that is required to be left natural. To determine the size of both the lot and building pad, the development plan would also need to identify the average cross slope of the lot.
Fire Prevention and Emergency Access: Fire protection and accessibility for emergency vehicles are essential elements of proper hillside development. This is especially important when the project area has a heavy brush and timber cover. To reduce the impact of wildfires within a hillside project, care must be taken to provide an ample supply of water; minimize the use of dead-end roads or keep them very short; keep roads of sufficient width to accommodate two-way traffic; and clear brush and trees around structures. Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations comprises the basic wildland fire protection standards of the California Board of Forestry. These "Fire Safe Regulations" are used whenever the Board reviews projects proposed in State Responsibility Areas. However, these standards can easily be adopted for use by local fire districts as well. These regulations are considered to be minimum standards and, in some instances, are not applicable to an urban environment. A few of the applicable minimum standards are:
Minimum street width: Two nine-foot traffic lanes Maximum street grade: 1 6 percent
Maximum length of dead-end road: Based upon parcel size
For example, Title 14 states that the minimum length of a dead-end road shall not exceed 800 feet for parcels zoned for less than one acre. As parcel sizes increase, so to do the allowable dead-end

road lengths. For example, for parcels zoned one to 4.99 acres, the maximum dead-end road length is 1,320 feet. Other standards apply to parcels zoned five acres and larger.
2.5.2	AIRPORT AREA LAND USE
Background
The Dunsmuir Municipal Airport and immediate area was acquired from Siskiyou County in January 1964 and was annexed to the City at that time. The airport was originally operated by the County in the 1 930's as an emergency landing facility for civilian airlines. At that time it was a dirt runway. Over the years it has been improved, correcting humps and elevating the south end, and eventually paving the runway. The airport is used by the U.S. Forest Service, local residents and tourists. In 1991, the City adopted the Airport Master Plan 1990-2010, which identified aviation forecasts, identified impacts on adjacent land uses, and determined facilities and improvements needed to meet future needs.
It is the intent of this portion of the Land Use Element to focus on land use issues at the airport and on lands adjacent to that facility to acknowledge related constraints and opportunities and to consider alternatives for appropriate land uses.
The airport and surrounding City lands are comprised of approximately 126 acres. The single 2,700-foot runway and related uses affect 46.2 acres of this total, leaving approximately 80 acres available for non-airport activities. Forecasts for airport use neither anticipate the need for additional runways or lengthening of the current runway.
The Airport Master Plan suggested that much of the surplus lands could be developed with other nonairport land uses. Since most of this land lies outside of the 60 dB noise contour, airport noise was not considered to be a significant factor affecting land use, (It should be noted, however, that the Airport Master Plan was prepared before the County adopted the Siskiyou County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, discussed below.) A small area east of the north end of the runway could be affected by noise and would best be used for non-residential purposes. The remaining site is constrained primarily by topography, access limitations, existing easements and heavy forest vegetation. The slopes in this area range from about 6 to 1 7 percent. While these slopes would influence the size of lots and basic practical density of development, the topography is not generally a severe constraint for potential development.
A major issue and constraint concerning development in the vicinity of an airport is concern that development could, in turn, be a constraint to continued or expanded operation of the airport. Homeowners in the vicinity of airports often complain about noise and potential aircraft safety issues and sometimes demand curtailment of airport operations or closure of the facility. In order to protect the viability of the airport, the City should be cautious about allowing land uses in the vicinity that may, in the future, threaten the continued use of the airport. Additionally, the City of Dunsmuir receives Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grants periodically for the continued operation of the Dunsmuir Mott-Municipal Airport. As a condition of the grants, the City gives the FAA assurances that no conflicting uses will be allowed in the vicinity of the airport for 20 years from date of grant issuance.
Another significant development constraint at this time is the lack of public sewer and water in the area. An existing well provides water to a small reservoir that supplies water to the airport in a two-inch line. A line of this size is too small to be of much aid should water be needed for fire protection in

2.0 Land Use
the area. The airport is currently served by a septic system. There are no sewer facilities in or near the area. Providing a sewer system to serve this and other lands in the area could be a significant task. Due to the population that could be accommodated in the area east, south and west (across the freeway) of the airport, and the distance from the existing sewage treatment plant, an entirely new treatment system may be necessary, and/or major changes to the existing plant and collection system will be needed. At the very least, a master sewage collection system for the area north of the north Dunsmuir Avenue interchange will iikely be required.
The 1994 Dunsmuir Master Water Plan notes the need for a new 0.8 million-gallon reservoir above the potential residential area to the east, to be supplied by two wells. This system would provide service to the airport and lands both east and south of the airport.
Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
The Siskiyou County Airport Land Use Commission adopted the Siskiyou County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP) in July 2001. The basic function of the ALUCP is to promote compatibility between the airports in Siskiyou County and the land uses that surround them. One of the seven airports addressed in the plan is the "Dunsmuir Municipal - Mott Airport".
The ALUCP was adopted by the Siskiyou County Airport Land Use Commission as a tool in fulfilling its duties to review land use proposals at public airports and on land adjacent to those airports. The plan also sets compatibility criteria applicable to local agencies in their preparation or amendment of land use plans and ordinances, and to land owners in their design of development proposals.
In brief, California statutes (Public Utility Code Sections 21670 et seq.) give county airport land use commissions (ALUCs) two principal powers, first, ALUCs must prepare and adopt an airport land use plan for public airports in their jurisdiction. Secondly, they are responsible for reviewing plans, regulations and other actions of local agencies and airport operators for consistency with that plan. Current law emphasizes local general plans as the primary mechanism for implementing the compatibility policies set forth in an airport land use plan. The county and each affected city is required to make its general plan consistent with the ALUC's plan or, if in disagreement, systematically override the commission's plan.
The Siskiyou County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, as it applies to the Dunsmuir Airport, was based on the airport master plan for that airport prepared in 1 990. The ALUCP describes the distinctions between an airport master plan and an airport land use compatibility plan. Issues addressed by an airport master plan are primarily on-airport issues to guide the development and management of the facility. An airport master plan is prepared by the agency that owns and/or operates the airport. The land use compatibility plan, however, addresses land use issues outside and around the airport with the purpose of ensuring the orderly expansion of airports and to adopt land use measures that minimize the public's exposure to excessive noise and safety hazards.
As described in ALUCP Section 2.4, Review Criteria for Land Use Actions, the primary criteria for assessing whether a land use plan, ordinance or development proposal is compatible with a nearby airport are set forth in the ALUCP's Primary Compatibility Criteria matrix, Table 2A. These criteria are to be used in conjunction with the compatibility map and policies for each airport as presented in ALUCP Chapter 3. The ALUCP includes a Compatibility Map for the Dunsmuir Municipal-Mott Airport, This figure is reproduced in the Dunsmuir General Plan as figure 2-2. Table 2A from the ALUCP is also included as Table 2.5.
City of Dunsmuir General Plan

2.0 Land Use
Appendix G of the ALUCP includes an initial review of the land use policies of each jurisdiction affected by that plan; namely, the County of Siskiyou and the cities of Montague and Dunsmuir. As described in the ALUCP, typically the emphasis in such a review would be on comparing adopted general plan land use designations with the compatibility zone criteria set forth in the ALUCP. However, according to the plan, since these jurisdictions rely more on zoning than their general plans as the basis for determining which types of land uses are allowed in a given location, Appendix G provided a review of the consistency between the local zoning designations and the ALUCP criteria. In the discussion of "Individual Airport Environs" (page G-3), the ALUCP included the following assessment concerning the Dunsmuir Municipal-Mott Airport (refer to Figure 2.2 for information concerning the zones):
(1)	The 5-acre minimum parcel size requirement in Zone B will prohibit future lot splits within the existing rural residential strip lying between Mott Road and Interstate 5. New construction on existing residential lots would be allowed, however.
(2)	Development of high-intensity uses should be avoided on the northern part of the St. Germain property situated within Zone B south of the airport.
(3)	The areas zoned for neighborhood commercial development along Interstate 5 northwest and southwest of the airport preferably should be changed to a more compatible use. If commercial uses are allowed, the Compatibility Plan requires they be limited to a maximum of 25 people per acre in accordance with the criteria for Zone B.
(4)	Commercial and industrial zoned property along the railroad line west and northwest of the airport lies within Zone Cl and thus is restricted to activities with 75 people per acre or less. Existing development in this area appears to be consistent with this limitation and future development, assuming that it is similar in character, would also be compatible.
It is not practical to quote all of the provisions of the ALUCP that may be relevant to the Dunsmuir General Plan and subsequent consideration of proposed projects by the City of Dunsmuir. The Siskiyou County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan should be consulted for a more comprehensive understanding of provisions that may be relevant.

Notes from Table 2-5:
]. Residential development should not contain more than the indicated number of dwelling units (both primary and secondary) per gross acre. With clustering, some parcels may be much smaller than others as long as the maximum overall density criterion is not exceeded. Clustering of units is encouraged.
2.	The land use should not attract more than the indicated number of people per gross acre at any time, except for rare special events. This figure should include all people who may be on the property (e.g. employees, customers/visitors, etc.) both indoors and outside. Rare special events are ones (such as an air show at an airport) for which a facility is not designed and normally not used and for which extra temporary safety precautions can be taken as appropriate. These criteria are intended as general planning guidelines to aid in determining the acceptability of proposed land uses.
3.	The uses listed here are ones which are explicitly prohibited regardless of whether they meet the intensity criteria, unless such prohibition is precluded by applicable state statutes. In addition to these explicitly prohibited uses, other uses will normally not be permitted in the respective compatibility zones because they do not meet the usage intensity criteria.
4.	Airport proximity and the existence of aircraft overflights should be disclosed as part of real estate transactions involving property within any of the airport influence area zones. Easement dedication and deed notice requirements apply only to new development.
5.	Hazards to flight include physical (e.g, tall objects), visual, and electronic forms of interference with the safety of aircraft operations. Land use development which may cause the attraction of birds to increase is also prohibited. See the supporting compatibility policies on airspace protection in the ALUCP for details.
6.	For the purpose of these criteria, children's schools include Kindergarten through grade 1 2.
7.	Family day care homes (as defined by state law) are permitted in all Compatibility Zones except Zone A. Noncommercial day care centers ancillary to a place of business are permitted in Zone B and Cl provided that the overall use of the property meets the indicated intensity criteria.
8.	Storage of aviation fuel, other aviation-related flammable materials, and up to 2,000 gallons of nonaviation flammable materials are exempted from this criterion is Zone B.
9.	Objects 35 feet in height are permitted; however, the Federal Aviation Administration may require marking and lighting of certain objects.

Airport Vicinity Development Options
in addition to the need to ensure compatibility with the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, the lack of utility infrastructure in the airport area is expected to delay and complicate future development. Due to the magnitude of issues to be solved, and the cost of providing necessary urban-level infrastructure, a development project must be of sufficient size to provide for their share of development costs. At the same time, there would need to be reasonable assurances that further development is likely to occur in the area and share the infrastructure costs.
Growth in southern Siskiyou County is increasing and represents the greatest share of growth activity in the County. This is most likely occurring due to the scenic qualities and recreation resources of the area and new jobs that have been created in recent years. Should employment opportunities continue to increase in southern Siskiyou County, there will be greater incentives for the development community to seek out areas to provide a variety of housing opportunities. Additionally, with growth will come the increased demand for smaller support industries and businesses that may find a site near the airport to be attractive.
Since if could be some time before the economic factors are ripe for development in the airport area, it is desirable to maintain land use flexibility. The area may be appropriate for offices and light industrial use near or adjacent to the airport. Land set back from the runway may be appropriate for residential development as contemplated in the airport master plan. It is possible that all of these uses could be accommodated in a manner compatible with the airport and other development constraints in the area.
With slopes ranging from 6 to 1 7 percent, residential uses might reasonably range from half-acre lots to 2.5-acre lots. However, due to compatibility issues related to the airport, a minimum of 5-acre parcel size is required for residential lots in the immediate vicinity of the airport. Outside of this zone, residential development would be somewhat less restricted with 2.5-acre minimum lot sizes. The 2.5-acre and larger lots would typically accommodate a house and garage without the need to level the entire lot, potentially leaving much of the natural vegetation undisturbed.
While larger lots would likely result in the preservation of substantial tree cover, these larger lots would generate little financial return relative to the cost of installing infrastructure for community water and wastewater. The 2.5-acre and 5-acre lot sizes could allow for the area to be developed with septic systems, thereby eliminating the need for an extension of sewer service to the area. (The 2.5-acre minimum lot size is necessary to satisfy the requirements of the County Health Department, which has jurisdiction over the issuance of permits for on-site septic systems.) However, septic systems in this area could possibility contaminate the City's water supply; the source of which is downhill from the airport vicinity. This issue will clearly need further analysis as development interest in the area grows.
Water to sen/e this area could be provided via an independent water system developed specifically for the airport area. This would likely include a well or series of wells with a single large storage tank, thereby providing necessary domestic water and fire protection flows.
Aside from low-density residential land use, there are numerous options for development of the airport area including office/light industrial and tourist/recreation activities. The actual option most likely to occur will depend on the economy, housing needs and creativity of developers at the time this area receives development interest. In the meantime, development of large parcels in the area should

2.0 Land Use
require special development plans or a specific plan to ensure that the area isn't sacrificed to haphazard sprawl.
Airport Vicinity Development Standards
The area around the airport is considered to be an area of high wildfire potential. To limit the degree of impact and hazard that a fire may have in this area, basic fire safe standards must be applied. The airport is currently located on a long, dead-end road. Any development on airport property would probably also need to use the same access road and, at this time, would be limited to one point of evacuation if a fire occurred. Given the terrain and the predominant wind direction from the south, an incident on 1-5 below the property could rapidly spread fire into the area and block the only evacuation route to the 1-5 interchange.
The distance from the Interstate 5/Mott Road interchange to the vacant land behind the airport is approximately 3,600 feet. It is another 2,900 feet to the hangers at the end of the proposed airport access road. Until better access is available for adequate evacuation routes in the event of wildfires, little development should occur on the airport property. The fire hazard is even made worse due to the lack of water storage for fire protection and the distance to the area from the City fire station. Fire safe standards also address the adequacy of roads in terms of width, structural strength and turn-a-rounds. Adequate clearance around structures is also very important.
The only apparent solution to the dead-end road is the extension of the airport access road south around the south end of the runway. The route may need to be near the existing powerline until it nears Old Highway 99 south of the Mott Road interchange approximately 1,000 feet. An intersection nearer the interchange would be desirable but may be difficult due to the steep topography on the east side of the road in that location. This southerly road extension would be located off of airport property, which would complicate right-of-way acquisition and development.
2.6	GOALS, OBJECTIVES, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
GOAL LU-1: - A City which attracts tourists and accommodates their needs.
Objective: Being located on interstate 5 and lacking lands for normal job-related industries, the City of Dunsmuir intends to improve the local business environment through the attraction of tourists. The scenic river canyon, river parks, waterfalls, Castle Crags State Park, Historic District and the nearness to Mt. Shasta and forest recreational activities all add to the attractiveness of Dunsmuir as a tourist destination. Protection and enhancement of these qualities will help to further establish Dunsmuir as a desirable place to reside and visit. The City wishes to protect scenic resources and encourage tourist-related services in order to achieve a healthy economy.
Policy LU-1.1: The City shall protect and enhance the scenic and natural qualities of Dunsmuir, its watershed and the Sacramento River.
Implementation Measure LU-1,1.1: The City will support implementation of the implementation measures described in Section 3.0, Open Space and Conservation.
Policy LU-1.2: The City shall continue to improve, enhance and expand parks and increase public access.

Policy LU-1.3: The City shall provide ample zoning to accommodate tourist support services.
Implementation Measure LU-1.3.1: The City shall review zoning along thoroughfares to ensure that there is adequate zoning for tourist support services. If there is inadequate zoning to support tourist services, the City shall consider additional parcels for commercial zoning.
Policy LU-1.4: The City shall encourage tourism within the Dunsmuir area.
Implementation Measure LU-1.4.1: The City shall work with the California Department of Transportation to secure and/or maintain all possible signing reflecting tourist services, historic qualities, historic Highway 99, etc.
Implementation Measure LU-1.4.2: The City will support implementation measures described in Section 7.0, Historic Preservation.
GOAL LU-2: - A sufficient mix and quantity of land uses to serve the needs of the community.
Objective: The City wishes to ensure that a sufficient variety of land uses are available to meet the housing, employment, service and social needs of the existing and future population.
Policy LU-2.1: The City shall provide for a compatible mix and quantity of land uses that will serve the needs of the community.
Implementation Measure LU-2.1.1: The City shall adopt the General Plan Land Use Map, Figures 2.1a and 2.1b, as the official Land Use Map for Dunsmuir.
Implementation Measure LU-2.1.2: The City shall implement the goals, objectives and programs of the Housing Element related to residential development.
Implementation Measure LU-2.1.3: The City shall allow for the development of commercial and industrial areas where suitable land exists with good access, adequate infrastructure and where such uses will have a minimum of conflict with current and future adjacent land uses.

2.0 Land Use
Implementation Measure LU-2.2.1: When appropriate, the City should work with owners of property between the airport and the north Dunsmuir Avenue interchange to establish necessary land use and infrastructure plans and financing to open this area for community expansion and development.
Implementation Measure LU-2.2.2: In response to annexation proposals, lands within the sphere of influence should be pre-zoned in accordance with the General Plan Land Use Plan as a means to maintain a variety of land uses as may be needed as the community grows.
GOAL LU-3: - Responsible development on hillside areas that minimize significant impacts.
Objective: There are very few areas in Dunsmuir that are both undeveloped and reasonably level. A few areas in the sphere of influence have modest grades, but nearly all of the vacant land within the City and the sphere of influence are located on hillsides. For the City to expand, it must anticipate development to occur on these hillside areas. It is the objective of the City to allow for well-planned hillside development, but such development must only occur when it is safe for future occupants and fire-fighting personnel, and when development can occur without significant damage to the environment or impacts to the viewshed.
Policy LU-3.1: The City shall control development on hillsides to avoid or minimize significant environmental impacts and support public safety.
Implementation Measure LU-3,1.1: The City shall establish hillside development standards to be applied to all development projects in areas where cross slopes are 10 percent or greater. These standards should include:
•	Minimum lot sizes that increase proportionately with the slope of the land, (i.e., 10 percent slopes require 10,000 minimum square foot lots, 1 1 percent slopes requires 1 1,000 minimum square foot lot, etc.);
•	Significantly limit development on lots with slopes of 30 percent or greater with no more than one dwelling unit per twenty acres;
•	Require a minimum of 25 percent of each lot to be left forested, with a larger area required depending on the percent slope of the lot. (For example, a lot with a 20 percent cross slope would be required to leave 45 percent forested, i.e., 25 percent minimum, plus 20 percent for the cross slope equals 45 percent.)
•	Limitations on the height of cut and fill slopes;
•	Erosion control and revegetation on all cut and fill slopes; and
•	Application of fire safe and accessibility standards.
Implementation Measure LU-3.1.2: The City shall amend its zoning and development ordinances to apply hillside standards similar to those outlined in Implementation Measure LU-3.1.1 above.
Implementation Measure LU-3.1.3: To support public safety, the City shall coordinate approval of all development projects in hillside areas with the recommendations of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Implementation Measure LU-3.1.4: The City shall require the identification of building pads and non-development areas on all lots in hillside areas.

Implementation Measure LU-4.1.5: The City shall establish, as a high priority, the conservation of existing residential and commercial structures through preservation and rehabilitation, and will support appropriate grant applications when they are used to aid this effort.
Implementation Measure LU-4.1.6: Land uses not conforming to the Land Use Plan may continue, provided that the use is not substantially expanded and, upon termination of the non-conforming use, the use shall only be in accordance with the Land Use Element designation.
Implementation Measure LU-4.1,7: Provisions for protecting and enhancing the neighborhood in Dunsmuir's Historic District are addressed in the Historic Preservation Element of this General Plan.
GOAL LU-5: - A high-quality municipal airport with compatible development in the vicinity of the airport, including development of the City's adjacent property.
Objective: The City wishes to maintain and enhance the airport and supports productive use of land adjacent to the airport, provided that all development respects and adequately resolves development constraints.

3.0 Open Space and Conservation
3.1	INTRODUCTION
California Government Code §65564 requires the inclusion of an open space element in the General Plan and defines open space as: "... any parcel or area of land or water which is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open-space use ..."
The Government Code also describes four types of open space: 1) Open space for the preservation of natural resources; 2) Open space used for the managed production of resources; 3) Open space for outdoor recreation; and 4) Open space for public health and safety. Section 65564 mandates an "action program consisting of specific programs which the legislative body intends to pursue in implementing its Open Space Plan."
Government Code §65302(d) calls for the preparation of a conservation element for the consen/ation of natural resources including water, forest, soils, rivers, fisheries, wildlife, minerals and other natural resources. General plan guidelines note other issues that may be addressed in conservation elements that may apply to the City of Dunsmuir, including:
•	Prevention and control of pollution of streams;
•	Regulation of the use of land in stream channels;
•	Prevention, control and correction of erosion of soils and shores;
•	Protection of watersheds;
•	Location, quantity and quality of rock, sand and gravel resources;
•	Flood control.
The Open Space and Conservation Elements are closely linked in Dunsmuir due to the proximity of the Sacramento River, the steepness of forested canyon walls on either side of the City, and the role open space and natural resources play in supporting Dunsmuir's tourist economy. Without preservation and protection of these resources, the health, safety and economic vitality of the community could be greatly impacted.
Government Code §65301 states that the general plan may be adopted in any format deemed appropriate or convenient, including the combining of elements. Consequently, as has been done in many jurisdictions, the Open Space Element and the Conservation Element for the City of Dunsmuir have been combined into a single element that addresses both subjects.
3.2	BACKGROUND
Open Space
The Sacramento River and other natural features in and around Dunsmuir have had a significant effect on the physical layout and development of the community. The walls of the Upper Sacramento River Canyon, in which the City of Dunsmuir is located, are often steep with a fairly narrow canyon floor on which the City has been constructed. Indeed, most of the City's developed area lies in a strip ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 feet wide. Much of this development, especially in central Dunsmuir, is located on slopes with 12 to! 5 percent grades or greater. Most development on both the east and west sides of town stops rather abruptly when slopes reach grades of 30 percent or more. The north-south oriented streets typically rise in elevation more gently with a gain of 400 feet from the south end of Dunsmuir to the City's north Interstate 5 interchange.

3.0 Open Space and Conservation
Most notable of the open space resources in and around the City is the Sacramento River and the forested canyon walls that surround the community. While the canyon's topography limits development, it offers numerous opportunities for scenic vistas and abundant open space resources. While several attempts have been made to extend development further up the sides of the canyon, nearly all efforts have been unsuccessful. These attempts have often resulted in lots that are too steep or narrow to develop effectively. Steep, dead-end streets are common, which are frequently difficult to negotiate in the winter and are potentially hazardous in the event of fires.
Canyon walls with slopes greater than 30 percent are likely candidates for designation as open space in the form of Resource Lands (see Section 2.0, Land Use Element). Outside of areas that have already been developed, much of the City's sphere of influence is comprised of slopes in the 30 to 50 percent range, especially in the southern half of the sphere. One of the City's primary objectives with regard to open space will be to maintain the forested views and open space values that currently exist in these areas. It should also be noted that much of Dunsmuir's forested viewshed is actually outside the City and its sphere of influence. As the entire viewshed is essential to the "small mountain town" charm of Dunsmuir, it would benefit the City to pursue a policy of cooperation with public and private landholders to protect the viewshed from impacts that may adversely affect the City.
The Sacramento River provides significant open space resources, recreation opportunities and marvelous views as it winds its way through the City. The establishment of parks and other access points along the river serves to provide desired public access to this valuable open space resource. While essential to recreation in Dunsmuir, the river can also be an area of concern during fiood season. Some residential areas in the southeastern part of the City are located in the 100-year floodplain. (See the Safety Element for additional discussion of flood issues.)
Table 3.1 below provides an inventory of public and quasi-public open spaces in the City;

3.0 Open Space and Conservation
The Union Pacific Railroad/ with a 200-foot right-of-way through most of the City, provides "open space" in a different form. This 200-foot wide band is basically undeveloped except for the railroad tracks themselves. The trains, as users of this space, have only a temporary presence as they periodically pass through. Since the railroad right-of-way provides a space separation between urban uses in the community, and in many instances contains various natural features {trees, shrubs and rock formations), it functions as open space. Being located along the river also enhances the open space values of the railroad right-of-way.
Open Space Lands for the Preservation of Natural Resources
It is desirable through the General Plan process to identify lands or areas that contain natural resources that are an asset to, or are a product of, open space. Thel 985 General Plan identifies the Sacramento River as Dunsmuir's "greatest natural resource". The course of the river contributes at least 20 acres of open space within the city limits and is a major attraction for both residents and tourists alike. This is due in part to the river's status as one the state's premier trout fisheries.
While federal and state regulations basically prohibit activities that significantly impact the river, accidents happen. In 1991, a Southern Pacific Railroad train derailed upriver of Dunsmuir in an incident known as the Cantara Spill. The accident spilled 19,000 gallons of herbicide into the river, which resulted in an evacuation of Dunsmuir residents located along the river, temporary destruction of virtually all aquatic life for more than 36 miles downriver, and a corresponding period of a depressed tourism economy in Dunsmuir. While it was an accident, accidents can often be prevented. In this case, the derailment was judged to have been the result of "stringlining". Stringlining occurs when the middle of a train is pulled off the tracks as it rounds a curve. This is caused by having too many empty or light-weight cars placed near the locomotive while heavier cars are situated near the back of the train.
Lessons have been learned from the "Cantara Spill". Unfortunately, however, derailments in the canyon have continued. According to California Trout, there have been 45 train derailments (albeit some fairly inconsequential) in the Upper Sacramento River Canyon since the spill of 1991. With regard to preservation of natural resources, the single most important issue for the City of Dunsmuir to address is protection of its "greatest natural resource". Though neither the state nor local municipalities have any regulatory power over the railroad, the City should continue to participate in an active dialogue with both the owner of the railroad, currently Union Pacific, and the federal government to ensure that Dunsmuir's concerns are heard.
There are also approximately 75 acres of private forested hillsides within the City, as well as hundreds of acres of forested slopes outside of city limits, that can be categorized as natural resource open space. The forested hillsides include lands with slopes that are typically 30 percent or greater. These slopes are too steep for normal urban densities and, in many places, are too steep for virtually any type of development. If development does occur at suitable sites, it should only occur at a very low density (no more than one dwelling unit per five acres) and with great caution to preserving vegetation and reducing erosion. Care must also be taken to ensure safe access, not only for the owners but also for emergency personnel in the case of wildfire. The Land Use Element addresses standards for hillside development.

3.0 Open Space and Conservation
Open Space Lands for Managed Production of Resources
As noted above, forested lands on steep slopes surround the City and comprise the majority of Dunsmuir's viewshed. These lands are in a combination of public management (i.e., lands managed by the Shasta Trinity National Forest) and private ownership. In either instance, they are subject to timber management practices and occasional harvesting. With proper management, both protection of the viewshed and selective harvesting can be accommodated. Proper management not only includes preventing unsightly clearcuts from occurring, but also entails reducing the potential for a catastrophic wildfire through periodic thinning and prescribed burns. Improper management of the forested slopes could result in severe impacts to Dunsmuir's viewshed, natural resources (including the river and its fishery) and economy.
Forest management practices require the processing of timber harvest plans with related environmental assessments designed to address issues such as access, grading, views and other factors that could result in adverse impacts on the forest lands and the adjacent environment. High management costs for forests on steep slopes may mean that these areas will not receive the progressive management that the City desires, and thereby fail to reduce the risk and severity of wildfires. Since most of these lands lie either within the City's sphere of influence or beyond its boundaries, it is incumbent upon the City to maintain a close relationship with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the U.S. Forest Service, and private landholders as a means to promote progressive management practices and protection of these open space lands.
Open Space for Recreation Purposes
There are an estimated 20 acres of open space in Dunsmuir (parks, playgrounds and pool) that have been established specifically for recreation. The Sacramento River, which offers another approximately 20 acres of open space, is one of the premier wild trout streams in California and draws anglers from around the world. During spring runoff when wading is dangerous at best, anglers stick to shore and the river becomes the domain of kayakers and rafters seeking class III thrills. Later in the summer, when river flows subside and the days grow hot, individuals seeking relief from the heat head to the river's many excellent swimming holes.
Trails are also an important element of outdoor recreation. There are a number of trails that provide access to open space resources in the Dunsmuir area. The Pacific Crest Trail, which spans 2,650 miles from Mexico to Canada, comes within three miles of Dunsmuir where it passes through Castle Crags State Park. There are also a number of scenic features in the vicinity, such as Hedge Creek Falls and Mossbrae Falls, that are accessible only by trail. The Hedge Creek Falls trail offers a winding path and short five-minute walk down to the falls. The most frequently used access to Mossbrae Falls requires following a route up the river along the Union Pacific Railroad tracks for approximately one mile. Concepts have been proposed for improved public access to the Mossbrae Falls, but development of a safer, more pleasant trail, which would not be as close to the railroad tracks as the current trail, has been blocked by the steep topography and private property issues in the vicinity of the fails. Trails and paths are also an important feature of the Dunsmuir Botanical Gardens, a fairly recent addition to City Park. While opportunities for walking longer distances off-road do exist in Dunsmuir along the railroad tracks, these are not hiking trails in the ordinary sense. For many people, it is an unnerving experience when confronted with a passing train, not to mention the legal concerns of accessing the tracks.

3.0 Open Space and Conservation
As the City and the number of visitors and tourists grow, more open space lands will need to be acquired to provide additional recreation opportunities. Development of a more comprehensive, accessible and safe trail system should also be considered,
Quimby Act: Local governments in California provide an important role in the establishment of parkland and open space for recreational purposes. The 1 975 Quimby Act (California Government Code Section 66477) authorized cities and counties to pass ordinances requiring developers to set aside land, donate conservation easements, or pay in-lieu fees for park improvements. Revenues generated through the Quimby Act cannot be used for the operation and maintenance of existing park facilities, although they may be used for park rehabilitation.
The intent of the Quimby Act was to assist local municipalities in providing adequate open space for their citizenry by requiring developers to mitigate the impacts of residential development projects. The provisions give authority for passage of land dedication ordinances only to cities and counties. However, if an agency other than a city or county is responsible for providing recreational services, such as is the case with the Dunsmuir Recreation and Parks District, the agency ultimately is the recipient of the land dedication and/or in-lieu fees.
In 1982, the Quimby Act was substantially amended to: further define acceptable uses of, or restrictions on, Quimby funds; provide ratio standards for recreation acreage and population; and provide formulas for determining exactions. Local Quimby Act ordinances must include definite standards for determining the proportion of land to be dedicated and the amount of the fee to be paid.
In order for the City to be able enforce a Quimby Act ordinance, the ordinance must be in effect for a period of at least thirty days prior to the filing of the tentative map of the subdivision or parcel map. As the City of Dunsmuir has yet to pass an ordinance, it would be in the best interest of the City to do so prior to any future development projects. The City's Municipal Code does contain a few provisions that could be used by the City to require developers to contribute to the cost of parklands. However, one of the ordinances requires the developer to pay only $100 per acre of subdivision area. Given the dramatic increase in land values over the past decade, this fee no longer seems to be able to satisfy the intent of the ordinance.
Open Space for Public Health and Safety
Lands typically addressed in this category include those that may be subject to landslides, flooding, high fire risks or watershed protection. With steep slopes, a major river and a climate characterized by warm, dry summers, it is only appropriate that the General Plan address each of these public health and safety issues. Many of these issues also receive further attention in Section 5.0, Safety Element.
There are a few steep, denuded slopes in various locations around the City where small landslides have occurred in the past during heavy rainfall events. The 1 985 General Plan identified 1 1 such sites within the City as having a propensity for landslides or slippage. Fortunately, most of these sites appear to be rather small with the potential for destruction being slight. While the potential for further landslides does exist, these lands are not held as open space as a preventative measure. It would be prudent as a safety precaution, where needed, to maintain open space around these hazards or stabilize these slopes to ensure that any related damage will be avoided or minimized.

3,0 Open Space and Conservation
Lands subject to flooding primarily lie along the Sacramento River, especially in the south end of the community along Butterfly and Scherrer Avenues. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established a floodplain map for Dunsmuir showing the area where properties may be subject to a 100-year flood (that level of flooding which is expected to occur once every 1 00 years, or has a one percent chance of being flooded in any given year). Within this area standards have been established by City ordinance to control development in a manner that will reduce the impact of flooding. Most of the land within the floodplain is privately owned and is currently developed, or is owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. If the private lands subject to flooding were not already developed, density standards could be lowered to reduce the risk and potential extent of flooding. Such lands could also possibly be purchased and added to the community's open space inventory. However, since these iands are developed, the cost of converting these parcels to open space is generally cost prohibitive. For a map of the lands located within the 100-year floodplain, please refer to Figure 5-4 in Section 5.0, Safety Element.
Concerning fire safety, Dunsmuir has been identified as being in a "Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone" pursuant to California Government Code §51 178. Hillsides are particularly susceptible to high fire risks. Those forested hillsides within the City are typically in private ownership. As noted above, there are approximately 75 acres of such land that are highly susceptible to fire hazards and are currently undeveloped. Should these areas develop at a low density, fire safe standards such as those outlined in Titie 14 of the California Code of Regulations should be applied to aid in the reduction of fire risk to structures and the reduction of danger to fire fighters in the event of wildfire. Density reduction is necessary as a means to place fewer persons within a high fire risk area, reducing both the possible incidence of fire and reducing the impact that fire would have should one occur in the area.
Resource Conservation
Most resource conservation issues are closely related to open space preservation. Protection of open space is a means of protecting the watershed, reducing pollution and conserving river and wetland resources. While there are no identified mineral resources within the City of Dunsmuir, there may be some gravel resources along the river. However, mining of these resources would be impractical due to the narrowness of the channel and the density of development along the river.
Watershed Protection
Dunsmuir's watershed, which is basically the drainage of the Upper Sacramento River above the city, is comprised of various drainages encompassing approximately 65,000 acres in size. Watercourses include Ney Springs Creek, Stink Creek, Wagon Creek, Castle Lake Creek, Big Springs Creek, Cold Creek, Big Canyon Creek, Scott Camp Creek and the Sacramento River, including the upper branches of the river (North, South and Middle forks). At least ten perennial or ephemeral creeks flow into the City. Hedge Creek and Bear Creek are the major tributaries within the City limits. Mossbrae Falls and the springs that supply Dunsmuir's drinking water are fed by springs off the Mt. Shasta highlands above the City, Dunsmuir's watershed is a valuable asset in that it provides an important economic resource (tourism) as well as the City's drinking water. Dunsmuir's drinking water is so pure that it does not require treatment, and it is a valued resource in the community. Protection and conservation of watershed resources, both groundwater and surface water, are essential.
Potential degradations to the watershed include those associated with logging operations: pesticides, siltation due to over-harvesting or poor soil management, and similar activities. Lands east of the City

are privately owned and subject to the California Forest Practices Act and the Sands west and north are primarily public lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The state and federal governments play a major role in the protection of Dunsmuir's watershed.
in addition to logging operations, the Upper Sacramento River is periodically subject to adverse impacts from three major sources: upsets at the sewage treatment facility during high rainfall; toxic spills from railroad operations; and residences and facilities with failing septic systems. Each of these three problem areas have been addressed by City and/or state efforts as follows;
a)	Upsets at the sewage treatment facility is primarily due to excessive infiltration/inflow into the collection system due to old, deteriorated lines or direct drainage connections from domestic water sources into the sewer. This situation causes untreated sewage to enter the disposal ponds where it may overflow into the river. In 1981, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Valley Region, issued a Cease and Desist Order to the City for Waste Discharge Requirement Violations. The City received funding to replace approximately 140 house sewer laterals and to replace approximately 3,000 feet of sewer mains. These projects were completed in 1985. The City was listed on the State Water Resources Control Board 1 987 Clean Water Grant Priority list for renovations to the treatment facility.
b)	The RWQCB issued Waste Discharge Requirements to the Union Pacific Railroad governing yard operations in the City. This order prohibits the discharge of pollutants into the Sacramento River.
c)	A small number of residences in Dunsmuir are currently not connected to the community sewer system (Gill Avenue and "Blackberry Hill"). The Regional Water Quality Control Board has mandated that the approximately 25 residences connect to the City sewer system as soon as possible.
The vulnerability of the City's water system to contamination was also demonstrated by an incident that occurred in 1 977 when sewage from the St. Germaine Foundation compound found its way into the springs that supply the City's water. It was learned that the rock strata above the springs had vertical features that were susceptible to channeling sewage from septic systems into the spring aquifer. The City had to chlorinate its water until the problem was resolved by connecting the St, Germaine facility to the City's wastewater treatment system. The incident illustrates that the City needs to be concerned with development proposed above its springs that could again contaminate its water supply, whether or not the development is in the city limits. If such development is proposed outside the city limits, the City needs to advocate its concerns and needs to Siskiyou County.
3.3	OPEN SPACE ACTION PLAN
Government Code §65564 states that every local open space plan shall contain an action program consisting of specific programs which the legislative body intends to pursue in implementing its open space plan. Thereafter, any action by the city by which open space land is acquired or disposed of, or its use restricted or regulated, needs to be consistent with the local open space plan. In the case of Dunsmuir, the open space plan is this General Plan Open Space Element. The open space action plan is Section 3.4; Goals, Objectives, Policies and Implementation Measures, which follows.

4.0 Circulation
4.1	INTRODUCTION
California Government Code §65302(d) states that the circulation element of a general plan shall consist of "the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan."
The Circulation Element of the Dunsmuir General Plan is based upon an assessment of the existing street and highway system, projected land use and the estimated future population and its distribution, local transportation trends, and topographic features within the planning area.
The 1985 Dunsmuir General Plan included a "Scenic Highway Element". In the 2006 update of the general plan, issues concerning scenic highways are incorporated into the Circulation Element.
4.2	BACKGROUND
Existing Street and Highway System
Dunsmuir's street system historically developed adjacent to the railroad and the Sacramento River with the need and intent to utilize the flatter areas of the canyon along the river for development. Growth of the town then progressed uphill on the west side of the river where development was possible adjacent to Old Highway 99, which became Dunsmuir Avenue after Interstate 5 was developed. Development of Dunsmuir continued up the slopes of the canyon, following the contours lines to the extent possible on north-south streets, with steeper grades occurring in an east-west direction. Grades on these streets reach 1 5 to 1 7 percent in some areas. In the North Dunsmuir area on the west side of the freeway, slopes range from 5 to 1 6 percent with most of the steeper grades running in a north-south direction. The development of Interstate 5 removed most of the regional traffic off of Dunsmuir Avenue, but it also created a significant barrier dividing the east and west sides of North Dunsmuir and blocked or otherwise affected some of the local streets in South Dunsmuir.
U.S. Interstate 5 (1-5) is the main highway providing regional access to Dunsmuir, 1-5 runs generally north-south, paralleling the Sacramento River and what are now the tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad. According to Caltrans information, the annual average daily traffic volume on 1-5 at the Central Dunsmuir interchange (for northbound traffic) is approximately 1 9,600 vehicles per day.
Dunsmuir Avenue serves as an arterial and a secondary route for north-south traffic. There are several collector streets that connect the local streets with the arterial system; some of which provide access across the Sacramento River. These are: Scherrer Avenue, Sacramento Avenue, Siskiyou Avenue, Oak Street, Wells Street and Shasta Avenue. Numerous other important local streets provide access to the arterial and collector streets but are not expected to carry the volume of traffic that a collector street carries.
Other than Interstate 5, which is generally four-lanes and, in some sections, five-lanes wide through Dunsmuir, all streets are typically two-lane routes. Dunsmuir Avenue, the only arterial street in Dunsmuir, is also two-lanes wide even though, in many areas, arterials are typically four lanes. However, with the narrowness of the valley and limited vacant land, Dunsmuir Avenue as a two-lane arterial adequately serves existing traffic and the amount of traffic expected in the future.

4.0 Circulation
As development of Dunsmuir proceeds north of the north Dunsmuir Avenue/l-5 Interchange uphill toward the Mott Road Interchange/ an arterial or collector street will likely be needed on either side of the freeway, depending on the intensity of development.
Following are typical standards for new artersals, collectors and local streets:
Arterial
Collector
Local
80 to 1 00 feet 2-4 lanes 64 to 80 feet 2 lanes 56 to 60 feet 2 lanes
Right and left turn lanes Possible right and left turn lanes
On-street parking is allowed on Dunsmuir Avenue and on most collector streets. Due to the narrowness of some streets, parking is sometimes restricted to only one side or, in a few instances, the narrowness prohibits parking on either side of the street.
Rail Facilities
The development of Dunsmuir, both historically and physically, has been shaped by the development of the railroad beginning in the 1 880s. Indeed, the City's former name of Pusher referred to the helper engines based in town that would assist trains up and out of the canyon. The railroad was at one time also a major employer in the area.
The trains are still an important part of life in Dunsmuir with the Union Pacific Railroad Company providing transcontinental freight services through Dunsmuir (on average about 16 trains a day) and rail passenger service provided to destinations north and south by Amtrak. Switching and maintenance yards are also located in Dunsmuir for railroad freight services.
Bus Services
Dunsmuir is served by a local bus service, Siskiyou Transit and General Express (STAGE), which makes several daily stops along Dunsmuir Avenue. The STAGE mainly serves southern and central Siskiyou County. Greyhound bus service is no longer available in Dunsmuir but is available in the City of Weed approximately 15 miles north of Dunsmuir.
Trucking Services
Freight movement to the Dunsmuir area is provided by inter- and intrastate firms. However, there are no local terminal facilities in Dunsmuir. Being located on 1-5, which is the main north-south truck route in California, Oregon and Washington, thousands of trucks pass by Dunsmuir daily.
Aviation
The City of Dunsmuir owns and maintains the Dunsmuir Municipal Airport, also known as "Mott Airport". The airport is located in the far north area of the City. As described in the Dunsmuir Municipal Airport Master Plan: 1990-2010 (1990), the airfield is a utility airport serving general aviation aircraft (Basic Utility-Stage 1). It consists of one runway (designated Runway 14-32) with a northwest-southeast orientation. The runway is 2,700 feet long and 60 feet wide. The airport is located on 126 acres of land, of which only 46.2 acres are used for aviation purposes. The nearest commercial airport is located 50 miles to the south in Redding.

Parking
Private parking for residential and commercial areas is addressed in Section 1 7.12.020 to 1 7.12.120 of the Dunsmuir Municipal Code. The minimum off-street parking space requirement for single-family and multi-family units is at least one garage or carport per dwelling. The City's Industrial District (M) requires one off-street parking space for each three employees or no less than one parking space for each 2,000 square feet of gross floor and ground area. The three commercial districts, C-l, C-2 and C-3 have varying degrees of off-street parking requirements. The C-l commercial district provides for off-street parking by requiring one off-street parking space for each 200 square feet of gross floor area. The C-2 commercial district (located in the downtown area and South Dunsmuir) has no off-street parking requirements. Parking is available on street with a three-hour maximum parking limit. The CM commercial district requires one off-street parking space for every three employees, or a minimum of one parking space for every 1,000 square feet of gross floor area.
Two public parking lots at the south end of the downtown area are located on the north and south sides of City Hall. These lots provide a total of 38 parking spaces. West Pine Street provides 20 angled parking spaces with a three-hour maximum time limit. The provision of public parking and imposition of time limits on parking along Dunsmuir Avenue has somewhat eased what has been perceived as the need for additional parking. Congestion occurs when the parking capacity is reached or when there is snow present to limit available parking. Due to topography and lack of vacant land in or near downtown, additional parking, if it were needed in that area, would probably require the removal of one or more existing structures.
Electrical Transmission
Pacific Power and Light Company (PP&L) provides electrical service to the City and surrounding areas. Electrical power lines generally follow transportation corridors and are above ground. However, according to current Public Utility Commission regulations, ail new facilities for subdivision and commercial developments must be located underground.
An underground utility district exists in downtown Dunsmuir. The district was formed to construct underground utility facilities in the downtown area. PP&L funds available for underground utility projects in Siskiyou County are generally utilized for utility line construction in public right-of-ways. Property owners are generally responsible to install facilities on private property.
Scenic Highways
The 1 985 General Plan for the City of Dunsmuir included a "Scenic Highway Element", partly because of an assumption that one was mandated by California planning law. A separate element for scenic highways is not a general plan requirement. While the protection of scenic resources is an important issue, it has been decided that the issue can be adequately and more appropriately addressed in the context of the General Plan Circulation Element and that a separate Scenic Highway Element is not necessary.
interstate 5 is the only "highway" to pass through the City of Dunsmuir, State Highway 99 became Dunsmuir Avenue after Interstate 5 was developed.
Scenic highways, in general, may be considered to be of four types. The State of California has a scenic highway program. Federally there are two programs including the U.S. Forest Service Scenic Byway Program and the Federal Highway Administration National Scenic Byways Program. The fourth

type of scenic highways are ones that a county or city may designate for their own purposes without applying to be designated by the state or federal programs.
In 1963, the state established the California Scenic Highway Program with the intent that, "The development of scenic highways will not only add to the pleasure of the residents of this State, but will also play an important role in encouraging the growth of the recreation and tourist industries upon which the economy of many areas of this State depend."(Senate Bill 1467) The provisions of the California Scenic Highway Program were added to the Streets and Highways Code.
The following features characterize the program;
•	A system that includes a list of highways eligible to become, or to be designated as, official scenic highways.
•	A process for the designation of official scenic highways, whereby local jurisdictions can develop and implement a scenic corridor protection program containing land use planning standards.
•	A legislatively appointed committee to recommend criteria, review applications, recommend designations and advise concerning revocation.
Segments of Interstate 5 are listed on Caltrans California Scenic Highway System website (with reference to Streets and Highways Code Section 263) as eligible for designation, but the segment passing through Dunsmuir is not listed as eligible. There is a process for adding "eligible" highways to the system. However, even when segments are listed as eligible for the state program, many counties and cities have elected to not pursue designation because of concerns over the program's requirements and expectations for local jurisdictions to adopt restrictive zoning provisions to protect the particular scenic corridor.
Because of the perceived restrictions and imposed standards of the California Scenic Highway Program, rural jurisdictions have typically been more attracted to the federal scenic byway program. The National Scenic Byways Program is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. The program is an effort to help recognize, preserve and enhance selected roads in the United States. The program recognizes certain roads as All American Roads or National Scenic Byways based on one or more archeological, cultural, historic, natural, recreational and scenic qualities. A few highways in Siskiyou County have been recognized as "Scenic Byways" under a program administered by the U.S. Forest Service.
The closest designated scenic highway to the City of Dunsmuir is the "Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway All American Road", which was first recognized as a scenic byway by the U.S. Forest Service before it went on to receive designation by the Federal Highway Administration as an All American Road. This 500-mile long route extends between Crater Lake National Park and the area of Lassen Volcanic National Park and Lake Almanor. It includes Highway 97 to Weed, the segment of interstate 5 from Weed past the City of Mt. Shasta to Highway 89, and Highway 89 east through McCloud toward Lassen Volcanic National Park. Information about this scenic byway/all American road sometimes notes that the "historic town of Dunsmuir" is a recommended side trip of six miles from the Byway on Interstate 5.
Some jurisdictions have designated local "scenic corridors" in their general plans, and they have policies to regulate proposed development in those corridors, but they have done so without the intent

to pursue state or federal scenic highway program status, even when some of the locally recognized scenic corridors are indicated for state and federal highways as well as local roads,
Dunsmuir's 1985 General Plan Scenic Highway Element (which, as will be seen, also addressed scenic pathways) included two goals: A) Identify possible scenic highways and possible scenic paths in Dunsmuir; and 8) Determine steps necessary for official designation as scenic highways and bicycle paths. The Element went on to propose a "scenic highway steering committee" that would address the following questions:
1)	Should a scenic highway/bike path system be developed in Dunsmuir?
2)	What route(s) should the system follow?
3)	What ordinance, controls, agreements and expenditures are needed to institute such a system?
4)	What revenue sources will provide for the system?
The 1 985 General Plan included an assessment of possible scenic highways and pathways. The following discussion is based on the 1985 assessment:
A. Scenic Highways:
Dunsmuir Avenue passes through the center of the City and is the main street. For purposes of this element, the Dunsmuir Avenue corridor is considered scenically significant from the Mott Avenue freeway interchange north of Dunsmuir to the freeway interchange south of town. Dunsmuir Avenue was sectioned into three parts for this review.
Mott Avenue to Hedge Creek Falls. This two-mile section, beginning at the Molt freeway interchange, starts with spectacular vistas of Mt. Eddy to the west and Mt. Shasta to the east. The road then descends south through the pine and oak forest to the beginnings of urbanization south of historic and scenic Hedge Creek Falls (which is trail accessible). Dunsmuir Avenue is a County road until this point and any scenic highway designation would need to be coordinated with the County.
Hedge Creek to the Sacramento River Bridge. This one-mile section of Dunsmuir Avenue passes the residential and roadside commercial (stores and motels) section of north Dunsmuir. This area offers two interesting by-passes off Dunsmuir Avenue: a) Past the historic railroad engine and swimming pool into the City Park; and b) Stagecoach Road to Upper Soda Creek down to the Sacramento River, to River Avenue and over the River Avenue Bridge back to Dunsmuir Avenue. Unique views are offered of the Upper Sacramento River and the riparian setting, and there is access for trout fishing,
Sacramento River Bridge to the South 1-5 Interchange. This 2.3-mile section of Dunsmuir Avenue features the City's Historic District and numerous "Fin de Siecle" [end of the 1 9th Century) and Roaring Twenties era homes and businesses in south Dunsmuir. The Dunsmuir Museum and the "Fountain" are also just off Dunsmuir Avenue. Sacramento Avenue is a suggested historic by-pass from River Avenue to Branstetter Street.

B. Possible Scenic Bicycle Path
When the City adopted the 1985 Scenic Highway Element, planning guidelines suggested that the element should include, "related facilities within the scenic corridors, such as bicycle trails". The Element noted that a bike trail could be constructed along roughly the same Dunsmuir Avenue corridor as discussed above. To the north of the Mott Road-Interstate 5 interchange, a bike path could continue along Old Stage Road. The area to the north is outside the City's planning area and would need to be coordinated with Siskiyou County.
Just north of the 1-5 bridge over the Sacramento River, the prospective bike trail could follow Stagecoach and Upper Soda roads under the i-5 bridge to River Avenue. The bike path could then follow Butterfly, Gillis and First Streets to its end at Cragview Drive just inside Shasta County. Again, bike paths outside the City will need to be coordinated with Siskiyou County and, in this case, possibly Shasta County, too.
4.3	GOALS, OBJECTIVES, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
GOAL C-l: - Safe and easy access to and from all land uses, existing or projected, in the Land Use Element.
Objective: An adequate street system is the backbone of the community, permitting safe and convenient transportation from home to schools, work, recreation, shopping, and to all other community services. Adequate and safe walkways, bikeways and trails for non-motorized transportation is also important. St is the objective of the City to ensure that all transportation routes within the City, motorized and non-motorized, are appropriately designed, constructed and maintained.
POLICY C-l .1: Figure 4-1, Circulation Map, shall serve as the City's General Plan Circulation Map.
POLICY C-l .2: The City shall review existing and proposed roadways, bikeways and walkways to ensure that they meet general safety standards. If it is found that any routes are not safe, the City should make the necessary improvements to ensure that the routes are improved to appropriate safety standards.
Implementation Measure C-l ,2.1: The City shall work with the Siskiyou County Local Transportation Commission to coordinate, as appropriate, the incorporation of the City's Circulation Element provisions into the County's Regional Transportation Plan, and will use the regional planning process to help improve the City's transportation network.
Implementation Measure C-l.2.2: The City will seek resources to develop a non-motorized circulation plan to provide more specific direction for appropriate bikeway and pathway routes and recommendations to accomplish the development of those routes.
POLICY C-l .3: The City supports the provision and improvement of sidewalks and trails to provide for the safety of pedestrians, bicyclists and other non-motorized transportation.
City of Dunsmuir General Plan
December 2006

4.0 Circulation
Implementation Measure C-l .3.1: The City should provide or require sidewalks and/or bike lanes on major streets, when appropriate, as a means to accommodate a variety of transportation modes.
Implementation Measure C-l .3.2: The City should prioritize the provision of sidewalks in the vicinity of schools on major streets that are used by school-bound pedestrian traffic.
Implementation Measure C-l .3.3: The City should work with Caltrans to develop a carpooling lot to encourage and support regional commuting.
Implementation Measure C-l.3.4: The City shall encourage the inclusion of bike and pedestrian paths in subdivision design.
GOAL C-2: - Streets that facilitate evacuation and emergency response in the event of an emergency.
Objective: Some of the streets in Dunsmuir are narrow, steep, and have limited area for vehicles to turn around. Such streets are difficult to access safely with emergency equipment and may make it difficult for residents to escape in the event of an emergency. It is the objective of the City that such streets be improved, when possible, and that future streets will meet adequate standards.
POLICY C-2.1: Within the next 10 years, when practicable, the City shall upgrade streets that do not meet standard fire safe regulations as specified in Title 1 4 of the California Code of Regulations.
Implementation Measure C-2.1.1: The Fire Department should identify those streets that currently do not meet the fire safe requirements of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations and create a priority list of needed improvements.
implementation Measure C-2.1.2: The City should establish a budget to improve all deficient streets as noted above with the goal of bringing such identified streets as near as possible into conformance with Title 1 4 standards within 1 0 years.
GOAL C-3: - Adequate off-street parking for residents and businesses.
Objective: Where inadequate off-street parking occurs, the efficiency of the use of the street for moving traffic deteriorates. Narrow streets become narrower and there is no place to store snow plowed from streets and driveways. With many families owning two or more vehicles, streets can become overcrowded with parked vehicles. Lack of adequate parking in commercial and industrial areas frequently moves parking onto residential streets and reduces the parking convenience for customers. It is the City's desire to improve off-street parking for residents and businesses alike.
POLICY C-3.1: Whenever practical, off-street parking shall be provided as a means to minimize the impact on public streets (especially narrow streets), maintain an area for snow removal, and to adequately accommodate the intended land use.
implementation Measure C-3.1.1: The Zoning Ordinance standards should be evaluated for adequacy. For example, the current standard of one off-street parking space for a singlefamily residential unit, including units in multifamily dwellings, should be evaluated for adequacy.
City of Dunsmuir General Plan

Implementation Measure C-3.1.2: In order to provide additional parking in downtown Dunsmuir to serve the commercial, professional, government and tourist needs, the City, in conjunction with downtown businesses, should provide additional parking through a parking district or some other financial partnership.
Implementation Measure C-3,1.3: The Municipal Code should be amended to require the construction of off-street parking, when possible, whenever substantial improvements are made to existing residential or commercial development, when the amount of parking is non-conforming.
GOAL C-4: - An attractive view of the City and surrounding environment along primary transportation routes.
Objective: The landscape and townscape of Dunsmuir includes valuable scenic as well as historic qualities. The City wishes to protect and enhance the scenic qualities of the community in order to sustain its attractiveness as a place in which to live, support efforts to attract new businesses, and expand the community's appeal to visitors and tourists.
POLICY C-4.1: Maintain the attractiveness of Dunsmuir by protecting and, when practicable, enhancing the scenic qualities of the community along primary transportation routes, especially Interstate 5, Dunsmuir Avenue, and designated bikeways.
Implementation Measure C-4.1.1: The City shall review highway and pathway routes that warrant protection of scenic as well as historic qualities and will consider appropriate measures for protection of those resources. Measures may include designation of scenic routes, zoning provisions to require special review of proposed architectural and landscape design, and other administrative actions to support the goal.
Implementation Measure C-4.1.2: In reviewing project proposals, the City will consider potential project impacts on scenic qualities and will determine if conditions of approval or mitigation measures are needed to protect and enhance scenic resources.

5.0 Safety
5.1	INTRODUCTION
California Government Code Section 65302(g) requires that each city and county develop a Safety Element, "... for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismic activity, dam failure, slope instability leading to mud or land slides, flooding and wildfires." The purpose of the General Plan Safety Element for the City of Dunsmuir is to promote public safety and the protection of residents and property from fires (both urban and forest in origin), natural and geological hazards, and hazardous materials spills.
5.2	BACKGROUND
The City of Dunsmuir is located at an average elevation of 2,289 feet above sea level in the Upper Sacramento River Canyon approximately 12 miles south of Mount Shasta (a dormant volcano with a height of 14,162 feet). The steep canyon walls around the City are heavily forested. Much of these lands are productive timberlands managed by the U.S. Forest Service or owned by private timber companies. Two major surface transportation facilities, Interstate 5 and the Union Pacific Railroad, share a corridor through the canyon and through the City of Dunsmuir. Box Canyon Dam on the Sacramento River (which impounds Lake Siskiyou) is located eight miles north and upstream of Dunsmuir.
Dunsmuir's geographical setting presents several unique public safety concerns:
•	Mount Shasta presents potential hazards from possible future volcanic activity.
•	Landslides caused by seismic or heavy rainfall events or ground subsidence could cause property damage at certain sites in Dunsmuir.
•	Certain areas in Dunsmuir are susceptible to flood damage, especially along the Sacramento River, caused by over-abundant rainfall or snowmelt in the surrounding mountains.
•	The collapse of Box Canyon Dam could inundate much of Dunsmuir within 1 5 minutes of collapse.
•	Dunsmuir is in an area that has substantial forest fire risks and hazards. Wildfires close to Dunsmuir could endanger portions of the City.
•	A toxic or hazardous chemical accident on either Interstate 5 or the railroad could have serious and immediate implications in Dunsmuir.
Volcanic Hazards
Mount Shasta, located twelve miles northeast of Dunsmuir, is a large and imposing volcano. It is believed to have erupted approximately ten or eleven times during the last 3,400 years, and at least three times in the last 750 years. While it has not erupted at regular intervals, its history suggests that it erupts at an average rate of roughly once every 250 to 300 years. The last eruption was believed to have occurred in 1 786. Even though the volcano has not been active for two centuries, Mount Shasta, like Mount St. Helens before 1980, is only dormant and almost certainly will erupt again. (Volcanic Hazards at Mount Shasta, California, by Dwight R. Crandell and Donald R. Nichols. U.S. Geological Sun/ey, pamphlet, 1 987.)

5.0 Safety
The 1 987 USGS pamphlet, "Volcanic Hazards at Mount Shasta" describes the characteristics of volcanic activity which would most likely affect the area near the mountain. Each of these characteristics are discussed below along with the possible effect upon the City of Dunsmuir. For a visual representation of potential impacts, please refer to Figure 5-1 through 5-3 at the end of this element.
Pyroclastic Flows: Pyroclastic flows are streams of hot ash and rock fragments, mixed with hot air and other gases, that move rapidly along the ground surface during an eruption. These flows are especially dangerous due to their high temperatures and their high speeds which may be more than 100 miles per hour. Due to the speed of pyroclastic flows, escape is nearly impossible. They are best avoided by evacuation of threatened areas before an eruption.
Lateral Blasts: This type of blast is a sideways-directed volcanic explosion that carries large pieces of rock and ash at a very high speed along and above the ground surface. The rock debris carried by the lateral blast of Mount St. Helens in 1980 had an initial speed of more than 250 miles per hour, and it was still moving about 60 miles per hour near its outer limit about 15 miles from the volcano. Lateral blasts may cause fatalities as the result of impact, burial or heat.
Dunsmuir is located in Zone 3 for pyroclastic flows and lateral blasts. This is the outer limit of the area potentially affected by these activities, so the likelihood of the threat is limited.
Lava Flows: Lava flows are rarely life-threatening because they move slowly enough for people to get out of their way and seldom occur at the outset of an eruption. Dunsmuir's distance from the volcano is sufficient that such flows are not particularly life threatening. However, fava flows can destroy property and ignite wildfires.
Mudflows: A mudflow is a mass of water-saturated rock debris that moves downslope generally as a fluid. Mudflows can form when lava flows, pyroclastic flows or hot lateral blasts melt snow on the side of a volcano. Mudflows tend to follow stream valleys and can travel long distances generally at a rate of 10 to 20 miles per hour, but faster on steep slopes. Due to their slower speed and distance from Dunsmuir, should a mudflow occur, there should be adequate time in Dunsmuir to evacuate to higher ground. However, before a mudflow would reach Dunsmuir, it would pass Lake Siskiyou. A heavy flow into the reservoir could cause the lake to breach the dam, or could weaken the dam itself causing a structural failure and flood that would reach Dunsmuir in 1 5 minutes or less.
Landslides: A volcanic explosion, severe earthquake or heavy rains could start landslides of rock debris from the side of the volcano. A landslide triggered by an earthquake at Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, traveled about 14 mites beyond the volcano. Mount Shasta has also been subject to mudflows that have been triggered by heavy rains on top of snow, although this type of mudflow is not considered to be a threat to Dunsmuir.
Volcanic Ash: Ash resulting from an eruption could cover a large area and could reach a depth of two inches or greater, depending on the amount of ash released into the atmosphere and the direction of wind at the time. Given that the prevailing winds generally blow in an area between the northeast and southeast, the probability is high that most ash would fall east of the volcano and away from Dunsmuir. However, the area does experience periodic winds from the north.

5.0 Safety
Experience with Cascade Range volcanoes including Mount St. Helens (1980 to present) and Mt. Lassen (1911-1920), demonstrates that eruptive episodes can and do occur in present time involving volcanoes that are generally considered inactive.
Seismic Hazards
There are numerous faults near the City that present potential dangers in the form of ground shaking, landslides and subsidence, and possible collapse of the Box Canyon Dam eight miles north of Dunsmuir on the Sacramento River. An unnamed fault runs southwest from Cedar Lake and ends near the Box Canyon Dam. Another north-south fault runs beneath Mount Shasta. Other faults run north-south on Soda Creek Ridge to the east of Dunsmuir. While none of these faults are known to be active, an earthquake with a 3.1 local magnitude occurred 3 miles southeast of Dunsmuir on November 29, 2005. Earthquake activity in Siskiyou County, as reported by the Siskiyou County General Plan Seismic Element, has been very limited. There has been limited structural damage in the past and there have been no known deaths.
Flooding
The Sacramento River and its local tributaries are subject to flooding caused by unusually heavy rains, snowmelt or both. Flooding at varying levels of intensity occurs frequently and occasionally presents a significant hazard to life, property and infrastructure. The "Big Flood" of 1 974 floated houses down the river. The flood of January 1997 also caused major property and infrastructure damage.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has developed a Flood Insurance Rate Map for Dunsmuir to identify flood prone areas. Flood hazard areas affecting Dunsmuir are indicated in Figure 5-4 at the end of this element. Zone A as identified on the map represents the area of greatest flood hazard as might be expected to occur once every 100 years (or a 1 percent chance in any given year). Zone B is an area expected to have lesser impacts due to the shallower flood depth anticipated. Within these areas properties are required to carry flood insurance. The rates for insurance are dependant on the floodwater depth on the affected parcel. New construction is required to meet the City's Flood Protection ordinance. Typically, placement of the ground-level floor is required to be at least one foot above the 100-year flood level. The key areas subject to flooding located in the A Zone are:
Gill Avenue Cave Avenue Butterfly Avenue Scheme r Avenue Gillis Street
Approx. 6 lots Approx. 22 lots Approx. 39 lots Approx. 12 lots Approx. 3 lots
Additionally a large area north of Grover Street to a point approximately 200 plus feet north of Oak Street is subject to shallow flooding from Alder Creek. Continued implementation of the Flood Ordinance will protect new construction from serious flooding and will help correct the current flood hazard over a long period of time as remodeling activities in the area bring additional structures into compliance with the Ordinance as a means to reduce flood impact and insurance rates.
Dam Failure
Box Canyon Dam, which impounds Lake Siskiyou, is located approximately eight miles north and upstream of Dunsmuir on the Sacramento River. While it is certainly not expected to occur, dams can and do occasionally fail. The Box Canyon Dam lies in the path of potential mudflows from Mount

Shasta, should there be that type of volcanic activity, and near an unnamed fault running southwest-northeast from Cedar Lake to a point near the Dam. Significant events in either one of these areas could result in water breaching the dam or actual dam failure. Aging or other geologic effects could also affect the stability of the structure.
Dam failures, when they do occur, have resulted in significant damage and some deaths since they can fail unexpectedly with little or no warning. A study prepared in 1 983 by the Siskiyou County Public Works Department (Emergency Action Plan-Box Canyon Dam}, identified areas subject to flooding and the approximate time floodwater would reach Dunsmuir (see Figure 5-5. North Dunsmuir would, of course, be hit first after about eight minutes of failure. Central Dunsmuir would be hit in about 1 3 minutes and the southerly City limits in about 16 minutes. The water depth would be significant, approaching Dunsmuir Avenue as it passes near the downtown area. Actual depth of the water would depend on the magnitude of the failure and the size and location of temporary debris dams that occur as the flood clears the river canyon of nearly everything in its path. With early warning, residents within the flood area may have time to reach higher ground. Significant damage would occur, wiping out bridges, power and other infrastructure. Residents could be stranded across the river without a means to cross and emergency services would be severely hampered.
Landslides
The 1985 General Plan identified eleven sites where landslide activity has either occurred or is believed to have the potential to occur. The source for this information has not been identified, nor has a recent survey of landslide prone areas in and around Dunsmuir been conducted. The 1985 General Plan did, however, identify each of these sites on a rough map. These areas have not been identified in this document due to the uncertainty of the past data and the lack of more current studies. Caution must be taken whenever new construction is proposed on steep slopes in order to ensure the safety of future occupants.
Wildfires
The City of Dunsmuir is rated as being in a "Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone" pursuant to California Government Code Section 51 179. Being located in a heavily forested canyon with steep hillside slopes, the potential for a wildfire is very high. Fires in this type of situation are particularly dangerous since they are not readily accessible by most fire equipment due to the steepness of the terrain. Depending on the wind direction, the impacts to Dunsmuir structures from a major fire in the canyon could vary from relatively little damage to major destruction. Afire with limited wind assistance may simply burn up the side of the canyon and away from the City, while a wind blowing from the south could push a fire north through the City in addition to going up the side of the canyon. In this latter scenario, major structural damage in the City is likely. While these scenarios are bad enough, potential mudflows from heavy winter rains on fire-denuded slopes could result in significant damage to property below.
In the past, residential development adjacent to the City has occurred on the fringe of the canyon where steep grades and heavy vegetation cover exist. In some of these situations roads are very narrow, steep and dead-end with only one way in and out. These roads also usually lack adequate turnarounds for fire vehicles. Many of these areas lack fire hydrants as well. Some of the problems mentioned above regarding development outside of City limits also apply to isolated areas within the City. Numerous streets on the west side of the City, especially near Interstate 5, are steep, narrow, lack adequate turnarounds and, in some instances, have heavy vegetation. These characteristics slow the response and effectiveness of fire fighters and could result in a fire quickly getting out of control.

5.0 Safety
While the airport property and lands north of the north Dunsmuir Avenue/l-5 Interchange have received little development pressure at present, this area of the City poses a challenge for timely response by fire equipment due to distance and grade. The airport is over three miles from the Fire Station and requires the equipment to climb over 900 vertical feet on Interstate 5 in that distance. It is anticipated that, as this area of north Dunsmuir develops, a satellite fire station would be needed.
The Dunsmuir Fire Department provides fire and emergency medical services to the City of Dunsmuir and the Dunsmuir Fire Protection District. It is also contracted to provide emergency medical services to the Castle Rock Fire Protection District. The Department consists of approximately 25 volunteers. Hazardous Materials
With two major transportation routes passing through the City, Interstate 5 and the Union Pacific Railroad, and after the experience of the 1 991 "Cantara Spill", it is very possible that a toxic material spill may again affect the City at some point in its future. Winter road conditions and local topography increase the possibility of an accident involving toxic materials. Concerning the transport of materials on Interstate 5, the California Vehicle Code assigns the California Highway Patrol the responsibility for serving as statewide information, assistance and notification coordinator on all hazardous material spill incidents occurring on highways. The County Health Department and state and federal agencies would be actively involved on a similar incident with the railroad.
The Cantara Spill of 1991, which is sometimes regarded as California's largest inland ecological disaster, dramatized the risk of hazards in the Dunsmuir area related to the transport of toxic materials and the potential effects of toxic spills. On July 14, 1 991, railcars of a Southern Pacific train derailed at the hairpin turn of the Cantara Loop at one of the crossings of the Sacramento River. One railcar was ruptured by the fall and spilled approximately 1 9,000 gallons of the herbicide metam sodium into the river. As the metam sodium mixed with the water, highly toxic compounds were created. Virtually all aquatic life in the river between the Cantara Loop, through Dunsmuir and down to Shasta Lake was destroyed.
The river ecosystem has slowly recovered, but the spill had a significant impact on the river as well as the community. During the first six days after the spill, an estimated 480 residents left their homes and went to evacuation centers. While the stay of some residents in the centers were short, others were there for several weeks. Some residents were forced to temporarily leave the area to stay with friends or relatives in unaffected communities. There were many and various health-related complaints as a result of the spill.
In spite of corrective measures taken by the railroad, continued incidences demonstrate that the City is still at risk from railroad-related hazardous material spills. In July 2003, five railcars from a Union Pacific train plunged into the Sacramento River just two miles from the site of the 1991 toxic spill. In January 2005, another Union Pacific train derailment occurred in the canyon just south of Dunsmuir, this time spilling approximately 30 gallons of diesel fuel into the river. Fortunately, neither these or other recent accidents have had a significant effect on the environment or the City, but they demonstrate the continuing vulnerability of the Dunsmuir area to accidents of this kind.

The recent history of Mount Shasta suggests that most future lava flows will originate at the summit or on the northeastern flank of the volcano in sector A. Sector B is less likely to receive lava flows.
Zone 1: areas likely to be affected most frequently. Most future flows from summit eruptions probably would stay within this zone.
Zone 2: areas likely to be affected by lava flows erupted from vents on the flank of the volcano or that move into zone 2 from zone 1.

6.0 Noise
6.1	INTRODUCTION
The basic purpose of a general plan noise element is:
1.	To provide sufficient information concerning the community noise environment so that noise may be seriously considered in the land use planning process. Noise level criteria are to be developed which would be usable in future planning, zoning and building inspection processes that promote the maximum compatibility of land uses and generated noise; and
2.	To protect existing areas whose noise environments are determined to be acceptable, to predict the noise climate, and to determine the level of future monitoring and review.
Note: Table 6-3 at the end of this Noise Element provides definitions of technical terms used herein.
California Government Code Section 65302(f) defines the requirements of a general plan noise element as follows:
A noise element which shall identify and appraise noise problems in the community. The noise element shall recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control in the State Department of Health Services and shall analyze and quantify, to the extent practicable, as determined by the legislative body, current and projected noise levels for all of the following sources:
(1)	Highways and freeways.
(2)	Primary arferials and major local streets.
(3)	Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems,
(4)	Commercial, general aviation, heliport helistop, and military airport operations, aircraft overflights, jet engines test stands, and all other ground facilities and maintenance functions related to airport operation.
(5)	Local industrial plants, including but not limited to, railroad classification yards.
(6)	Other ground stationary noise sources, including, but not limited to, military installations, identified by local agencies as contributing to the community noise environment.
Noise contours shall be shown for all of these sources and stated in terms of community noise equivalent level (CNEL) or day-night average level (Ldn). The noise contours shall be prepared on the basis of noise monitoring or following generally accepted noise modeling techniques for the various sources identified in paragraphs (1) to (6), inclusive.
The noise contours shall be used as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in the land use element that minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive noise.
The noise element shall include implementation measures and possible solutions that address existing and foreseeable noise problems, if any. The adopted noise element shall serve as a guideline for compliance with the state's noise insulation standards.
A general plan noise element, as described above, would include topics that are not applicable to a smaller community like Dunsmuir. For example, there are no significant noise producing industries in Dunsmuir. Furthermore, due to the long narrow shape of the community and the presence of two major noise sources (i.e., Interstate 5 and the Union Pacific Railroad) that extend almost the entire
City of Dunsmuir General Plan
December 2006
64
6.0 Noise
length of the community, standard noise contours do not readily apply. Consequently, the City has determined that little would be gained through the presentation of noise information beyond the information provided herein.
With one main noise source (interstate 5) lying above the City and another (the railroad) below, maintaining a noise level at or below the 60 dB Ldn (a typical standard) is virtually impossible, especially when most of the community is already exposed to noise levels of 65 dB Ldn or greater. This does not mean, however, that some areas of the community, due to topography or building location, do not enjoy slightly lower levels. However, for these reasons, the City has determined there is no need, on a community-wide basis, to take additional noise samples or provide more specific noise contours for the Noise Element. Sufficient information is available to identify affected areas, apply standards, and/or require project related noise analysis and mitigation as a means to minimize the impact of noise, especially for new development.
6.2	BACKGROUND
Dunsmuir is a small, rural community in a mountainous setting that would normally not be associated with the types and levels of noise typically found in urban environments. The City is known for fishing on the Upper Sacramento River, the surrounding forests and outdoor activities that are normally enjoyed in quiet and relative solitude. Open spaces are somewhat synonymous with an absence of noise in order to be fully appreciated. Many residents and visitors come to escape the effects of urbanism, which includes distractions such as noise.
However, the community's location in a long narrow canyon containing a main line of the Union Pacific Railroad and Interstate 5, the main north-south freeway on the west coast, affects and changes a potentially tranquil environment into one substantially impacted by transportation noise. This situation is not entirely new since the railroad and related noise have been factors in Dunsmuir since the town began. As regional vehicular travel increased, Highway 99 (which came through town on what is now Dunsmuir Avenue) became a major thoroughfare. With the advent of more trucks and increased population mobility, Interstate 5 was developed and a major amount of traffic volume was shifted to the freeway. Heavy truck traffic and the grades on the Interstate now make the freeway the main source of noise in Dunsmuir. The magnitude of train noise is still about the same, even if there is less railroad activity than in earlier days.
Noise has been defined as unwanted and unhealthy sound. There is a certain amount of background noise that is tolerable within the community. This is the result of human activities (e.g. traffic, other people's conversations, air conditioning, other machinery and other activities). This average background noise becomes intrusive somewhere in the upper 50 decibel range. It is the intrusive noise with which the Noise Element is particularly concerned, although gradual increases in ambient noise resulting from urban development is also of concern. In recent years it has been increasingly recognized that excessive noise levels can have adverse health effects on people, both in terms of their environment at work or leisure. Some of these effects are difficult to measure, in part because individuals vary so widely in their sensitivity to noise. Nonetheless, these effects are believed to be real and significant.
Railroad Noise Issues
The railroad was the catalyst for Dunsmuir's existence and is still one of the major industries in Dunsmuir. The railroad (now the Union Pacific Railroad) traverses a steep gradient in the Upper
City of Dunsmuir General Plan
December 2006
65
6.0 Noise
Sacramento River Canyon frequently requiring helper engines to ascend the grade to Weed. The added engines produce increased noise. A factor in the noise effect of train operations is the necessary continuance of daily operations into the evening and nighttime hours, especially during the winter when idling diesel engines may not be shut down due to cold temperatures. Train whistles used when trains approach railroad crossings are quite loud and, even though they only last for a few moments, have a pronounced effect on the local noise environment.
It is extremely difficult to forecast the future of railroad noise impacts since forecasts from private operations are difficult to determine. It is noted that railroad operations are not expanding significantly. Railroad noise at the equivalent daily operational level {average throughout the 24-hour day) of 60 dB (A) (Ldri) or greater exposes virtually the entire population of Dunsmuir to substantial amounts of noise. (Source; 1985 General Plan) Some areas are affected by railroad noise considerably more than others. The south Dunsmuir area, for example, is very much subjected to high amounts of railroad noise due to the greater amount of activity that occurs in that area due to storage and switching activities and a greater number of railroad crossings.
One possibility for the reduction of noise associated with train whistles is a new Federal Railroad Administration Rule (49 CFR Parts 222 and 229) effective June 24, 2005. This rule provides an opportunity for localities nationwide to establish quiet zones. To qualify, communities wishing to establish quiet zones must equip proposed grade crossings with adequate safety measures to overcome the decrease in safety created by silencing the train horns. The additional safety measures must be constructed at the community's own expense and must meet federal specifications. The rule also contains language which, for the first time, restricts the volume of train horns.
Interstate 5 Noise Issues
The Interstate 5 (1-5) freeway is the major north-south arterial on the west coast. In 2005, Caltrans reported an annual average daily traffic volume of approximately 19,950 vehicles per day on 1-5. Dunsmuir is at the base of a 1,200-foot grade in a nine-mile stretch south from Mt. Shasta City. The final two miles of the incline are especially steep. The highway is elevated approximately 40 feet above the town in southern Dunsmuir. Interstate 5 is at grade with the City at the Sacramento River Bridge and northerly to the north Dunsmuir Avenue interchange. From there the town is generally situated above the highway to the east and generally below the highway to the west.
Some consequences of this topographical environment are;
(1)	Where Interstate 5 is at the same grade as Dunsmuir (near and north of the Sacramento River Bridge), the dB levels are consistently higher than elsewhere in the City. (71.2 60s Leq vs. city-wide average of 61.7). (Source: Dunsmuir General Plan, 1 985)
(2)	The fact that Dunsmuir is in a canyon leads to the perception that noise is amplified in specific areas. This perception (amplification) is not reflected in the noise readings. A control reading at Interstate 5 in Mt. Shasta, out of the canyon, showed the same dB readings as the Dunsmuir downgrade. (Source: Dunsmuir General Plan, 1985)
The noise problems are particularly evident for the housing units located between Interstate 5 and the railroad. The population in that area (i.e. most of the City) is subject to both of these noise sources at 60 dB(A) or greater. An estimated 70 percent of the City lies within the 65 dB Ldn contour. If the City expanded into its sphere of influence, most of the developable land in the sphere would also lie within
City of Dunsmuir General Plan
December 2006
66
6.0 Noise
the 60 dB Ldn contour. Consequently, noise levels for existing and future residents will always be higher than expected fora small community.
Airport Noise Issues
Aircraft operations generally do not cause noise problems in Dunsmuir. The Mott Airport, owned and operated by the City of Dunsmuir, is located at the northern extremity of the City, While it is located in a potential urban area, the existing and projected 65 dB (CNEL) noise contours do not affect existing residences since the contours are primarily located within City-owned airport land. Projected 2010 contours would have minimal noise impact unless regular landing touchdowns occurred at or near the end of the extended runway.
Total airport usage may increase at a rate of up to five times the normal population growth. This will be reflected partly in the use of single-engine private aircraft by local and area residents. This assumes an increased income and professional level as a significant component of the growth factor. More people will also be more likely to use airplanes for access to Siskiyou County's recreational resources.
The Siskiyou County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) adopted the Siskiyou Courtiy Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP) in July 2001. The basic function of the ALUCP is to promote the compatibility between the airports in the county (including the Dunsmuir Municipal-Mott Airport) and the land uses that surround them. The duty of the ALUC is "... to protect public health, safety, and welfare by ensuring the orderly expansion of airports and the adoption of land use measures that minimize the public's exposure to excessive noise and safety hazards within areas around public airports to the extent that these areas are not already devoted to incompatible uses." (California Public Utilities Code Sections 21670 et seq.). Therefore, noise impacts involving airports is a concern of the ALUC and is addressed in the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan.
The evaluation of airport/land use compatibility in the ALUCP considers the future Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) contours of the airport. These contours are calculated based on aircraft activity forecasts. The CNEL contours are one of the factors used to define compatibility zone boundaries and criteria.
The ALUCP includes Table 2B, Noise Compatibility Criteria, which indicates examples of acceptable noise levels for land uses in the vicinity of an airport. The maximum CNEL considered normally acceptable for residential uses in the vicinity of the airports is 60 dB.
The Land Use Element of the Dunsmuir General Plan includes consideration of airport area land use, including noise as a factor in land use compatibility criteria.
Non-vehicular Noise
Typically, many communities have businesses or industries that generate noise at levels significant enough to have an effect on sensitive receptors near such uses. There are no uses of this nature in Dunsmuir. Should a noise producing activity desire to locate in the City, action should be taken in the review process to ensure noise levels greater than 60 dB will not be present beyond the boundaries of the project sites, especially if neighbors are sensitive receptors such as residential uses, schools, hospitals and similar uses.

Community Noise Survey
During the 1985 Genera) Plan update, numerous points in the community were surveyed to determine the noise levels that were present at that time. This data was gathered with the use a sound level meter provided by the State of California for this survey. Due to the time-lapse between 1 985 and present, and the belief that the noise samples were not done by a professional in this field, the accuracy of the data cannot be verified. Further, some of the noise samples do not identify their distance from the noise source. Regardless, the samples do provide a relative comparison of noise concerning eleven locations in the community. The following notes summarize the survey sites and the results of the 1 985 survey:
•	The Abner Weed gravesite in the cemetery at the south end of town (Vernie Street). This site was chosen as representative of a quiet area with which to compare readings at other sites. The average noise level at this location was 54.7 Ldn.
•	The north end of what was formerly McLaughlin's Grocery store on the sidewalk (Dunsmuir and Wood). The average day-night readings were 64.6 Ldn.
•	The sidewalk in front of the fountain in the downtown area (Dunsmuir and Cedar). The noise level averaged 62.1 Ldn.
•	The second step of the Catholic church facing the intersection (Spruce and Shasta). The level of sound there averaged 55.9 Ldn,
•	North Dunsmuir at the front of the steam engine, facing the freeway (Dunsmuir and Buckboard). The readings averaged 66.3 Ldn.
•	The City Park at the south west corner of the playground area (Dunsmuir and Buckboard). The average sound level was 57.2 Ldn.
•	On Isgrigg under the telephone pole with the fire siren on it. The test included one siren blown at noontime. The readings came to an average of 61.1 Ldn.
•	The House of Glass Motel at the swimming pool facing the freeway (Siskiyou Avenue). The average noise level was 71.2 Ldn.
•	A private residence on Gill Street, just above both the railroad (base of hill) and the river. The noise level at this point was 69.5 Ldn.
•	Siskiyou Avenue below the Elementary School, ten feet above Interstate 5. The average noise level was 75 Ldn.
• Willow Street below the High School, fifteen feet above interstate 5. The average noise level was 76 Ldn.
The average of the survey samples and the representative noise level in the City of Dunsmuir in 1 985 was 64.8 Ldn. There is no evidence to suggest that, in 2006, this noise level has changed significantly, either higher or lower. While the change in the number of daily trains through town is unknown, the volume of traffic on the freeway has increased.

6.0 Noise
A few other examples of local noise occurrences follow:
•	A train blowing a whistle at a railroad crossing at street level produces a sound level averaging 100. The sound of the fire siren at the corner of Isgrigg and Holly streets has the same sound level of 100 Ldn.
•	A police siren test at 25 feet with a police car produced a sound level of 90 Ldn, and at 100 yards a sound level of 80 Ldn.
•	At the train depot, a train coming downhill from Mt. Shasta stopping at the depot came in at a sound level of 84 Ldn.
•	The sound produced by five idling train units and a separate incident of a single unit traveling downhill without a load came to a reading of 75 Ldn.
6.3	GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
GOAL N-l: - Citizens protected from unhealthy noise levels.
Objective: Based on available data, most of Dunsmuir is affected by noise levels that exceed 65 dB. Noise at this level is considered to be unhealthy. It is the City's desire to limit noise within existing developed areas as well as in areas that may accommodate future development.
Policy N-l .1: The City shall take measures within its authority to protect residents and noise-sensitive land uses from high noise levels that would be detrimental to public health and comfort.
Implementation Measure N-l.1.1: To the extent practical, new residential development and development of structures housing other sensitive receptors should take necessary steps to reduce the impact of existing and projected vehicular noise upon future occupants. This action should occur during City review of parcel maps, subdivisions, conditional use permits and other discretionary actions. Such development should meet the standards of Table 6-1.
Implementation Measure N-l.1.2: The City shall adopt an ordinance that requires the implementation of noise reduction techniques on ministerial permits adjacent to sensitive receptors. The techniques used to reduce noise levels to 60 dB could include dual pane windows, air conditioning, increased insulation, solid fencing, earth berms, etc. The standards of Table 6-2 should apply.
Implementation Measure N-l.1.3: The City should develop a noise monitoring program to identify areas in the community having the greatest noise impacts from Interstate 5, and to monitor changes in noise levels over a period of time.
Implementation Measure N-l. 1.4: The City should work with Caltrans to construct noise reduction barriers along Interstate 5 where traffic noise levels have the greatest impacts on residents of the City.

6.0 Noise
Implementation Measure N-l.1.5: During project review of non-vehicular noise generating uses, the City shall require a reduction of noise to standards noted in Table 6-2 at the property line when adjacent uses may be sensitive receptors.
Implementation Measure N-1.1.6: The City shall consider the potential effects of noise in consideration of all proposed general plan amendments or rezoning actions, with the intent to allow only those uses, when practical, that can meet the standards noted in Table 6-1 and Table 6-2.
Implementation Measure N-1.1.7: AH housing receiving CDBG grants for rehabilitation should include improvements to reduce noise to acceptable levels.
Implementation Measure N-1.1.8: The City will continue to work with the Union Pacific Railroad to seek development of mitigation measures to reduce noise impacts through operational modifications or other measures, where possible.
Implementation Measure N-l.1.9: Land use proposals in the vicinity of Mott Airport shall include consideration of noise impacts from the airport. Residential and other sensitive uses shall not be located in areas where noise levels exceed 60 dB.

The exterior noise level standard shall be applied to the property line of the receiving property. The above standards shall be measured only on property containing a noise sensitive land use.
’Note: For the purposes of the Noise Element, transportation noise sources are defined as traffic on public roadways, railroad line operations and aircraft in flight. Control of noise from these sources is preempted by Federal and State regulations. Control of noise from facilities of regulated public facilities is preempted by California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) regulations. All other noise sources are subject to local regulations. Non-transportation noise sources may include industrial operations, outdoor recreation facilities, HVAC units, schools, hospitals, commercial land uses, other outdoor land use, etc.

6.0 Noise
TABLE 6-3:
NOISE ELEMENT DEFINITIONS
The noise exposure information is presented in terms of noise contours expressed in Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) of Day-Night Average (Ldn). CNEL means the average equivalent a-weighted sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of five decibels to sound levels in the evening from 7:00 p.m. to 10 p.m. Ldn means the average equivalent a-weighted sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night before 7:00 a.m. and after 1 0:00 p.m.
Decibel, dB	A unit for describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure, which is 20 micropascals (20 micronewtons per square meter).
A-Weighted Sound Level	The sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a sound level meter using the A-weighting filter network. The A-weighting filter de-emphasizes the very low and very high frequency components of the sound in a manner similar to the response to the human ear and give good correlation with subjective reactions to noise.
Lio	The A-weighted sound level exceeded 10 percent of the sample time. Similarly, L50, L90, etc.
Equivalent Energy Level, Leq	The sound level corresponding to a steady-state sound level containing the same total energy as a time-varying signal over a given sample period. Leq is typically computed over 1, 8- and 24-hour sample periods,
CNEL:	Community Noise Equivalent Level. The average equivalent A-weighted sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of five decibels to sound levels in the evening from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and after addition of 10 decibels to sound levels' in the night before 7:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m.
Ljn	Day-Night Average Level. The average equivalent A-weighted sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night before 7:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m. (Note: CNEL and Ldn represent daily levels of noise exposure averaged on an annual basis, while Leq represents the equivalent energy noise exposure for a shorter time period, typically one hour.)
Noise Exposure Contours	Lines drawn about a noise source indicating constant energy ievels of noise exposure. CNEL and Ldn are the metrics utilized herein to describe annoyance due to the noise and to establish land use planning criteria for noise.
Ambient Noise Level	The composite of noise from all sources near and far. In this context, the ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given location.
intrusive Noise	That noise which intrudes over and above the existing ambient noise at a given location. The relative intrusiveness of a sound depends upon its amplitude, duration, and frequency and time of occurrence, and tonal or informational content as well as the prevailing ambient noise level.
Noisiness Zones	Defined areas or regions of a community wherein the ambient noise levels are generally similar (within a range of 5 dB for example). Typically, all other things being equal, all sites within any given noise source will be of comparable proximity to major noise sources. Noise contours define different noisiness zones.

7.0 Historic Preservation
7.1	INTRODUCTION
The Historic Preservation Element is included in the City of Dunsmuir's General Plan to encourage the identification and protection of important historical features in the City and its sphere of influence. This includes some historic sites and structures that are currently in Dunsmuir's Historic Commercial District and others that are outside the district that should be considered for preservation.
California planning law offers flexibility for jurisdictions to include optional elements in their general plans in addition to the mandatory elements. Government Code Section 65303 enables a county or city to adopt "any other elements or address any other subjects which, in the judgment of the legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city." At one time the California General Plan Guidelines specifically cited historical preservation elements as an optional element "for the identification, establishment and protection of sites and structures of architectural, historical, archeological or cultural significance". The historical element would be expected to include a program to develop actions to be taken to accomplish the policies set forth in the element.
An optional element, once adopted, carries the same legal weight as any of the seven mandatory elements and must be consistent with all other elements of the genera! plan.
Due to the abundance of heritage resources located in Dunsmuir and the interest of city residents in the preservation of these resources, the City's general plan includes an Historic Preservation Element. This element has been revised from the Historic Preservation Element that was included in the 1985 Genera! Plan.
7.2	BACKGROUND
Historic preservation policies and programs are tools for preserving the historic features of a community. They are also tools that support economic development and other objectives for enhancing a community in relation to the community's historic character. "Heritage tourism" is a component of economic development that can be used to attract visitors to a community based on the unique aspects of the locality's history, culture and landscape. In this context, historic preservation is a means to presetve historic features, attract visitors to the city, revitalize the downtown, incubate related small businesses and generate local jobs.
The City of Dunsmuir was established in the late 1880s as a railroad line was constructed up the canyon of the Sacramento River. The community was originally named "Pusher" because of the railroad engines that operated out of the city to help push trains up the canyon. In 1886, a man by the name of Alexander Dunsmuir promised to give the community a water fountain if it would name the town after his family. The town accepted his offer and changed its name to "Dunsmuir". The fountain is now located at the city park.
Along with being a vibrant railroad town at the turn of the century, the scenic surroundings and excellent water quality attracted many visitors to the area and resulted in development of local resorts such as Shasta Springs and Shasta Retreat.
Over the years Dunsmuir has survived numerous calamities that took a toll on the historic resources of the town. In 1902 an avalanche crashed down on the town. A large part of the town burned to the ground in 1903. In 1924, a fire on Sacramento Street destroyed two old churches and other

buildings. Other fires have destroyed old hotels. Flooding, including the "big flood" of 1974, has also taken a toll.
In spite of the loss of many old buildings over time, Dunsmuir still has many historic structures and is still rich with historic character and charm. The City has taken a number of significant steps to recognize and protect its historic resources. The Dunsmuir Historic Commercial District was listed in the National Register in 1982. This district is roughly bounded by Sacramento and Shasta Avenues and Spruce and Cedar Streets (on both sides). Refer to Figure 7-1 for an illustration of the Dunsmuir Historic Commercial District.
The City maintains Municipal Code Chapter 1 7.28, Historic Preservation, as part of the Dunsmuir Municipal Code. This chapter (most recently amended by Ordinance 517 in July 2004) includes the following statements concerning the purpose of its provisions:
It is found that the protection, enhancement, perpetual care and use of structures, districts and neighborhoods of historic, architectural and engineering significance, located within the city, are of cultural and aesthetic and economic benefit to the community'. It is further found that the economic, cultural and aesthetic standing of this city will be enhanced by respecting the heritage of the city.
Municipal Code Chapter 1 7.28 addresses provisions for Planning Commission involvement with the Historic District, designation of landmarks, review of projects affecting landmarks and structures within the Historic District, regulation of signs in the district, maintenance of historic structures, and other provisions. Chapter 1 7.28 also recognizes and defines a "buffer zone" around the historic district. The buffer zone includes properties extending 300 feet beyond the boundaries of the historic district. Changes to a structure within this buffer zone may require review by the Planning Commission "as if it were within the district".
Chapter 1 7.28 also establishes a "Historic Combining District" as an overlay zoning district. The purpose of this "H" Combining District is to "provide a means to preserve and enhance areas of historic, architectural and engineering significance located within the city. The combining district shall be used in general accord with the policies and principles of the General Plan, as specified in the historic preservation ordinance."
The Historic Combining District may be combined with any other zoning district in the City. For example, when combined with the Central Commercial (C-2) District, the affected property would be zoned C-2-H. Once designated as such, development and use of that property would be subject to the provisions of the Zoning Code for both the Central Commercial (C-2) District and the Historic (H) Combining District.
The 1985 General Plan included comments about the potential for recognizing the historic status of various sites in Dunsmuir. The following list was extracted from the 1 985 General Plan:
A. Historic District: Described in National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form.
8. Possible Additions:
1)	Dunsmuir City Ballpark Grandstand
2)	Hedge Creek Falls
3)	Methodist Church Sunday School

7.0 Historic Preservation
4)	Young Mortuary Building
5)	Qualifying residences
Map #2 in the 1985 General Plan noted that possible qualifying residences will likely be located in the downtown area of Dunsmuir, especially off of Cedar, Dunsmuir, Branstetter, Elinore and Wood Streets.
The 1985 General Plan also recognized several aspects of tourism that are related to historic preservation. The following notes are from the 1 985 General Plan:
1)	Tourism is the fastest growing industry in the state - second only to agriculture (which includes lumber) - and Dunsmuir is located on a major highway (1-5).
2)	Having a unique town to attract area visitors is also important due to the return of skiing on Mt. Shasta (as Truckee and other historic Sierra towns have proven).
3)	Restoration will improve the aesthetic and economic character of the downtown business district (as in Yreka).
4)	Repairing existing buildings is cheaper than new construction.
5)	An authentic Historic Railroad Town would also be a major attraction as a destination for regional residents within at least a 200-mile radius.
The 2006 update of the Dunsmuir General Plan is intended to continue the City's commitment to support preservation of its historic features.

Goals, Policies and Programs
GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
INTRODUCTION
The Housing Element of the General Plan is a comprehensive statement by the City of Dunsmuir of its current and future housing needs for all income levels and proposed actions to facilitate the provision of housing to meet those needs. The policies contained in this Element are an expression of the statewide housing priority to allow for the "attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every Californian,” as well as a reflection of the unique concerns of the community. The purpose of the Housing Element is to establish specific goals and policies relative to the provision of housing, and to adopt an action plan toward this end. In addition, the Element identifies and analyzes housing needs, resources and constraints to meeting those needs.
The City of Dunsmuir Housing Element is based on five strategic goals:
1} Provide for a variety of housing types and cost for all segments of the population;
2)	Ensure that the City’s development standards and/or processing requirements are not a constraint to the development of affordable housing;
3)	Ensure persons are provided a choice of housing locations within the community regardless of age, race, color, national origin, religion, gender, family status or disability;
4)	Ensure that the quality, safety and livability of housing in the City is continually maintained or upgraded, and that dilapidated units, which cannot be improved, are replaced;
5)	Pursue sustainable development and energy efficiency for new residential development and existing housing stock.
In accordance with state law, the Housing Element is to be consistent and compatible with other Genera! Plan elements. Additionally, the Housing Element is to provide clear policy and direction for making decisions pertaining to zoning, subdivision approval, housing allocations, and capital improvements. State law (Government code Sections 65580 through 65589} mandates the contents of the Housing Element. By law, the Housing Element must contain:
•	An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to meeting those needs;
•	A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relevant to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing; and
•	A program that sets forth a five-year schedule of actions that the local government is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the Housing Element.
The housing program must also identify adequate residential sites available for a variety of housing types for all income levels; assist in developing adequate housing to meet the needs of very low-, low-, and moderate-income households; address governmental constraints to housing
GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
State law requires that the Housing Element contain a statement of "the means by which consistency will be achieved with other general plan elements and community goals" (California Government Code, Section 65583[c][6][Bj). This requires an evaluation of two primary characteristics: (1) an identification of other General Plan goals, policies, and programs that could affect implementation of the Housing Element or that could be affected by the implementation of the Housing Element; and (2) an identification of actions to ensure consistency between the Housing Element and affected parts of other General Plan elements.
The remainder of the City’s General Plan is comprised of the following seven elements: (1) Land Use; (2) Open Space and Conservation; (3) Circulation; (5) Safety; (6) Noise; and (7) Historic Preservation. The Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan elements and is entirely consistent with the policies and proposals set forth by the General Plan. As portions of the General Plan are updated in the future, the Genera! Plan (including the Housing Element) will be reviewed to ensure internal consistency is maintained. This includes any future update of the Safety and Conservation elements consistent with Government Code Section 65302.
REVIEW OF PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
An important aspect of the Housing Element is an evaluation of programs included in the previously adopted Housing Element, The evaluation provides valuable information on the extent to which programs have been successful in achieving stated objectives and addressing local needs, and the extent to which these programs continue to be relevant in addressing current and future housing needs in the City of Dunsmuir. The evaluation also provides the basis for recommended modifications to programs and the establishment of new objectives in the Housing Element. Appendix A, Housing Programs Implementation Summary, contains an analysis of the City’s programs for the prior planning period.
2009-2014 GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
This section of the 2009 Housing Element presents the City of Dunsmuir's updated goals, policies, and programs relative to the development, improvement, and maintenance of housing in the City during the 2009-2014 planning period. These goals, policies and programs supersede the previous programs (i.e., those evaluated in Appendix A).
In general, housing goals express the desired future conditions for which specific actions are directed. The City's goals are ideals that have been determined by the citizens as desirable and deserving of community time and resources to obtain. Policy statements are more specific and have a shorter range. Programs are action statements that are more specific still and provide well-defined guidelines for decision-making and implementation.
Goal HE.l: Provide for a variety of housing types and cost for all segments of the population.
Policy HE. 1.1 : The City will encourage housing suitable to a variety of income levels and household sizes and types.
Program HE 1.1.1; As developers inquire locally about potential residential development projects, they will be advised of the need for affordable housing in the City, especially in the form of multifamily housing and innovative reuse of existing structures. At this initial
3
Responsibility: City Administrator and City Council Financing: General Fund Timing: Annually
Program HE.1.L6: Given the lack of vacant, developable land in the City that is suitable for multifamily housing, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow for residential use of properties in the Central Commercial (C-2) district without a use permit. However, in each case residential use will be restricted to upper stories with the ground floor reserved for commercial purposes.
Responsibility: Planning Commission and City Council Financing: General Fund Timing: February 2011
Policy HE.1.2: Continue to promote housing for persons with special needs.
Program HE.1.2.1: Amend the Zoning Ordinance as necessary to provide individuals with disabilities reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices and procedures that may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing. The City wilt also make information available about requesting reasonable accommodation with respect to zoning, land use, permit processing, fees or building codes.
Responsibility: Planning Commission and City Council Financing: General Fund Timing: February 2011
Program HE.1.2.2; Pursuant to SB 2, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to include separate definitions of “supportive housing", "transitional housing" and "emergency shelters" consistent with Sections 50675.14, 50675.2 and 50801 of the California Health and Safety Code. The City will also amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow transitional and supportive housing as a residential use subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone without undue special regulatory requirements. Further, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow emergency shelters by right (i.e., without a use permit and subject only to the same development and management standards that apply to other allowed uses) in the Central Commercial (C-2) zone.
Responsibility: Planning Commission and City Council Financing: General Fund Timing: February 2011
Program HE. 1.2.3: in order to facilitate housing for extremely low-income persons, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to clarify the definition of single-room occupancy units, as well as describe specific development standards for these units.
Responsibility: Planning Commission and City Council Financing: General Fund Timing: February 2011
5
Policy HE.1.3: Provide adequate sites to meet the City's share of regional housing needs.
Program HE.1.3.1: Coinciding with the annual General Plan Progress Report, the City will update and review the inventor/ of vacant residential land in the City and amend zoning and land use designations, as necessary, to ensure an adequate supply of vacant land to accommodate the City’s share of regional housing needs.
Responsibility: Planning Department, Planning Commission and City Council Financing: General Fund Timing: Annually
Program HE.1.3.2: The City will zone sites suitable, without physical and environmental constraints, and available to accommodate the City's unmet housing needs from the prior planning period. This will entail rezoning one of the candidate sites identified in Table B-30 to either R-3 or R-4 consistent with Government Code Sections 65583(a)(3) and
65583.2	(h) and (I) as needed to facilitate the development 32 affordable units. The sites to be to be rezoned must allow owner-occupied and rental multifamily uses by-right (i.e., without a use permit or other discretionary action) and provide for:
1.	A minimum of 16 units per site; and
2.	A minimum density of 16 units per acre; and
3.	At least 50 percent of the lower-income need must be accommodated on sites designated for residential use.
Responsibility: Planning Department, Planning Commission and City Council Financing: General Fund Timing; Prior to July 2010
Goal HE.2: Ensure that the City’s development standards and/or processing requirements are not a constraint to the development of affordable housing.
Policy HE.2.1: Remove constraints to the development and availability of housing for all segments of the population.
Program HE.2.1.1: Amend the Zoning Ordinance regarding the provisions of Section 65589.5(d) and (f) of the Government Code, noting that housing projects for extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income persons cannot be denied or conditioned resulting in making the project infeasible unless one of the findings of Section 65589(d) 1-6 can be made.
Responsibility: Planning Commission and City Council Financing: General Fund Timing: February 2011
Program HE.2.1.2: Adopt a density bonus ordinance consistent with the Government Code Section 65915, establishing procedures for bonuses should such be desirable for a project as a means to guarantee long-term affordable housing.

Policy HE.3.1: Prevent housing discrimination based on age, race, cofor, national origin, religion, gender, family status or disability.
Program HE.3.1.1: Continue to inform residents of their rights under fair housing law by posting and maintaining notices at City Hail, in the hallway outside of the Council Chambers, and at the Dunsmuir Branch Library regarding the availability of a fair housing information and referral contact at City Hall. The notice will include the name and phone number of the contact person (i.e., the City Administrator) and any other information deemed relevant by the City Council.
Responsibility: City Administrator Financing: General Fund Timing: Ongoing
Program HE.3.1.2: Refer known incidents of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing and lending practices to the Siskiyou County District Attorney and the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for action.
Responsibility: City Administrator Financing: General Fund Timing: Ongoing
Goal HE.4: Ensure that the qualify, safety and livability of housing in the City is continually maintained or upgraded, including measures to improve energy conservation, and that dilapidated units, which cannot be improved, are replaced.
Policy HE.4.1: Initiate all reasonable efforts to preserve, conserve and enhance the quality of existing dwelling units and residential neighborhoods to ensure full utilization of the City’s existing housing resources for as long as physically and economically feasible.
Program HE.4.1.1: With a goal of assisting eight households over the next fire years, the City will strive to preserve low- and moderate-income housing through implementation of the Housing Rehabilitation Program.
Responsibility: City Council Financing: Grant Funding Timing: 2009-2014
Program HE.4.1.2: Continue to require and support abatement of unsafe residential structures, giving property owners reasonable opportunities to correct deficiencies and offering incentives (such as financial assistance under the housing rehabilitation program) when available to support rehabilitation of unsafe structures.

Housing Programs Implementation Summary
APPENDIX A - HOUSING PROGRAMS IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
Table A-l provides a summary of the City’s progress with regard to implementing programs contained in the 2003-2008 Housing Element, the effectiveness of these programs, and whether the programs will be continued in the 2009-2014 Housing Element.
Table A-1
Implementation of 2003-2008 Housing Element Programs
Program	Progress/EfTectiveness	Appropriateness
Program Amend the Zoning Ordinance to explicitly include emergency shelters and transitional housing as part of the definition of group homes. Timing: 2005 Responsibility: City Council and Planning Director	Progress: Incomplete. There has been a lack of adequate resources available with which to update the Zoning Ordinance. Effectiveness: This program has not been effective due to a lack of implementation.	Modify: This program will be modified in the updated Element to require separate definitions of emergency shelters and transitional housing, as well cis allow emergency shelters by right in the C-2 district.
Program The City will evaluate its conditional use permit process to determine whether it unnecessarily constrains the development of housing. This evaluation will particularly analyze approval criteria such as “peace, morais, and comfort." The City will amend its Zoning Ordinance to address or remove any constraints found as part of the evaluation. Timing: 2005 Responsibility: City Council and Planning Director	Progress: Complete. It was determined that the City's conditional use permit process does not provide a constraint to the development of housing.

Program The City will monitor the supply of vacant lands to ensure there are always sufficient lands available for all types of housing opportunities. The monitoring would include an assessment of access, utility availability and topography. At the completion of the assessment, the City will then have a clear definition of potential housing yield based on these constraints. Depending on the results of such monitoring, further adjustments may be necessary to the Genera! Plan and Zoning Map.

Appendix B
Housing Needs Assessment
APPENDIX B - HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The Housing Needs Assessment provides a demographic profile of the City of Dunsmuir by anafyzing the following types of information: population trends, household income and poverty, special housing needs, housing characteristics, costs and conditions, constraints to development, and resources and opportunities.
The United States Census, which is completed every ten years, is an important source of information for the Housing Needs Assessment, it provides the most reliable and in-depth data for demographic characteristics of a locality. The California Department of Finance (DOF) is another source of valuable data that is more current than the Census. However, DOF does not provide the depth of information that can be found within the U.S. Census Bureau reports. Whenever possible, DOF data and other local sources were used in the Housing Needs Assessment in order to provide the most current profile of the community. The data presented in the Housing Needs Assessment will not only guide the development of housing goals and polices, but will also be integrated into the body of the Housing Element to present the current status of housing and housing-related issues in the City of Dunsmuir. Definitions of the various U.S. Census Bureau terms that are used throughout this document have been included in Appendix D, Glossary of Terms, for clarification.
The needs assessment is organized into three main sections. The first section focuses on demographic information, such as population trends, ethnicity, age, household composition, income, employment, housing characteristics, general housing needs by income, and housing needs for special segments of the population. This first section outlines the characteristics of the community and identifies those characteristics that may have significant impacts on housing needs in the community.
The second section identifies possible governmental and non-governmental constraints to housing development in Dunsmuir. The City has planning, zoning, and building standards that guide and affect residential development patterns and influence housing availability and affordability. There are also environmental and housing market conditions that affect the location, availability, affordability, and type of housing that is constructed. The “nongovernmental1' influences include such factors as: the availability and cost of financing, land and materials for building homes; natural conditions that affect the cost of preparing and developing land for housing; and the business decisions of individuals and organizations in home building, finance, real estate, and rental housing that impact housing cost and availability.
The third section identifies the resources and opportunities for affordable housing in the City, which includes an inventory of adequate sites for affordable housing, potential funding resources for housing programs, and a description of the current housing programs that are available to provide affordable housing to the residents of Dunsmuir.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
Population and Household Characteristics
The City of Dunsmuir is a small town with a 2009 population of only 1 ,825. The City’s population decreased by approximately 9.7 percent between 1990 and 2000 and, based on estimates by DOF, further decreased by approximately 5.1 percent between 2000 and 2009. The City’s population is expected to hold relatively steady or decrease slightly for the duration of the

REGIONAL CONTEXT
The City of Dunsmuir is located at the south end of Siskiyou County, approximately 40 miies south of the City of Yreka, the county seat, and 45 miles north of the City of Redding in Shasta County. The City straddles Interstate Highway 5 in a north-to-south direction, and both the Sacramento River and the Union Pacific Railroad run through the town. The City was established in the late 1880s when a rail line was built through the Upper Sacramento River canyon. In the 1950s, Dunsmuir was the largest town in Siskiyou County with a population of over 5,000 people. However, the conversion to diesel trains dramatically reduced the rail workforce in Dunsmuir by approximately 50 percent, and the City's population fell considerably to less than 2,000 people. The population has fluctuated over the years, but has generally continued to decline. The modernization and decline of both the rail and timber industry and lack of replacement jobs has been the principal causes for the fall of the population over the last two decades. The steep topography of the Sacramento River Canyon, coupled with the physical constraints of developing near Interstate 5 and the railroad, further limits the opportunities for the development of new residential subdivisions in the City, and contributes to the suppression of population growth.
POPULATION TRENDS
Population Growth
The population of the City of Dunsmuir in 2009 is estimated by the Department of Finance to be 1,825. The population decreased from 2,129 in 1990 to 1,923 in 2000, or by 9.7 percent. DOF estimates that the City’s population further declined by 5.1 percent, or by 98 persons, between 2000 and 2009. Although negative growth is unusual for the State of California as a whole, it is fairly common for many communities in rural Siskiyou County where a loss of forestry-related jobs over the past few decades has driven the population elsewhere in search of employment. Table B-1 shows population growth rates for communities in Siskiyou County from 1990 to 2009.

Race/Ethnicity Characteristics
Table B-4 illustrates population growth in the City by racial and ethnic category. Race and ethnicity may affect housing needs due to differing housing preferences and requirements associated with the household characteristics of each group. Although the City is slowly becoming more diverse, the City continues to host a large percentage of white residents. For example, approximately 84.2 percent of all residents in the City identified themselves as white at the time of the 2000 Census, while the second largest group, Hispanic or Latinos, comprised only 9.9 percent of the population. The largest population growth has been in the African American population, which grew by 18 persons between 1990 and 2000.

HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
A household is any group of people living together in a residence, whether related or unrelated. A survey of household characteristics is useful to determine household size trends, income, overcrowding or under-utilization of housing, and the number of special needs households such as large families and female-headed households.
According to the U.S. Census, there were 856 households in the City in 2000. Approximately 53.2 percent of the households were owner-occupied, while the remaining 46.8 percent were renter-occupied.

Household Income
Table B-7 lists the income distributions for households in the City of Dunsmuir in 1990 and 2000. It also shows the median household income of the City, which grew by approximately 2.9 percent from $22,535 to $23,191 during this period. The numbers in Table B-7 suggest that the proportion of extremely fow-income households has decreased while the proportion of households earning more than the median income has increased.

Poverty
The State of California publishes annual income limits for each county that are used to determine eligibility for assisted housing programs within that county. Further, the California Health and Safety Code requires that limits established by the State for the low-, very-low, and extremely-low income categories wiii be the same as those in the equivalent levels established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for its Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program. It is important to note that the 2000 median household income reported in Table B-7 is not the same as the median family income established by the State in 2009 and reported in Table B-10.

Table B-11 shows the poverty rates for various age groups, as well as for single-parent households, in the City. The poverty rate is the percentage of people in a given group that live below the poverty ievel out of the total population. The City’s overall poverty rate is approximately 19.3 percent, with 3.3 percent of persons 65 years of age and older living below the poverty level. (Although the percent of elderly living in poverty [3.3%] is the same as the percent of elderly out of the total population living in poverty [3.3%], these percentages are based on separate data and should not be confused.)
The poverty rate is substantially higher for individuals in female-headed single-parent households than it is for individuals in male-headed single-parent households. The "percent of total in poverty” illustrates the proportion of each subpopulation out of the total living below poverty level. This column indicates that approximately 11.8 percent of all households with children under the age of 18 that are living in poverty are headed by single-parent males, while approximately 51.0 percent of these households are headed by single-parent females.

SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSEHOLDS
Certain groups encounter greater difficulty finding sound, affordable housing due to their special needs and/or circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one’s employment and income, family characteristics, disability and/or age. A focus of the Housing Element is to ensure that ali persons in the City, regardless of circumstance, have the opportunity to find decent and affordable housing.
State Housing Element law identifies the following "special needs" groups: seniors, persons with disabilities, female-headed households, large households, homeless persons, and farmworkers. This section provides a discussion of housing needs for each particular group.
Senior Population
The limited incomes of many elderly people make if difficult for them to find affordable housing. Further, many seniors also have physical disabilities and/or dependence needs that limit their selection of housing. According to the 2000 Census, 374 persons in the City of Dunsmuir are 65 years and older. These 374 persons account for approximately 12.4 percent of the total population of the City; however, as shown in Table B-14, the majority of seniors own their homes (65.5 percent).

Senior Households as a Percentage of All Households	38.7%	30.8%

B-ll
Persons with disabilities typically have special housing needs because of their fixed or limited incomes, the lack of accessible and affordable housing that meets their physical and/or developmental capabilities, and the higher health costs associated with their disabilities. According to the 2000 Census, 1,082 Dunsmuir residents, or approximately 56.3 percent of the population, have some type of disability, Of these persons, 252 are age 65 years or older,
Living arrangements for disabled persons depend on the severity of the disability. Many persons live independently with other family members. To maintain independent living, disabled persons may need special housing design features, income support, and in-home supportive services for persons with medical conditions.
Single-Parent and Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households, and those headed by single females in particular, experience the full range of housing problems. These problems include: affordability, since the individuals are often on public assistance; overcrowding, because the individuals often cannot afford units large enough to accommodate their families; insufficient housing choices; and sometimes, discrimination. Also, single-parent households with small children may need to pay for childcare, which further strains limited incomes. The City recognizes these problems and has included policies and programs in this document to address affordability, overcrowding, and discrimination for all segments of the population.
Table B-l7 illustrates the number of households that are headed by single parents. Single-parent households comprise approximately 12.3 percent of all households in the City, and of this group, female-headed households comprise approximately 62.2 percent and male-headed households represent 37.8 percent. Further, the U.S. Census Bureau indicates that poverty affects
37,1	percent of the femaie-headed single-parent households in the City and 16.2 percent of the male-headed single-parent households.

Total Single-Parent Households	107	100%	12.3%
Source: 2000 U.S. Census, summary file 3
Large Families
A large family is one with five or more family members. Large families are considered a special needs group because they need iarger homes, but don't necessarily earn enough to afford the premium price of a larger home. Those homes are often a luxury out of the range of affordability for lower income families. Thus, a large family may struggle to find suitable affordable housing. The number of large families in the City is shown by tenure in Table B-18. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of large renter-occupied households increased by approximately 9.1 percent, while the number of large owner-occupied households decreased by approximately 20.7 percent.
B-l 3
Transitional Shelters
Transitional shelters are often required for housing individuals or families after their immediate need for emergency shelter has been satisfied, but they arc not yet self-reliant. Transitiona! housing programs are often combined with a variety of social services intended to provide job training and self-reliance. Transitional shelters are typically single-family residences, detached homes or apartment houses. Sometimes motels and hotels can serve in this capacity if they are equipped with kitchens,
Temporary Shelters
Temporary shelters are needed to address a variety of situations in which individuals and/or families find themselves homeless. While there is a portion of the homeless population that is voluntarily homeless, these individuals still often require nighttime or poor-weather shelters. Teenage runaways require temporary shelter, counseling and other social services. Evicted individuals and/or families often need short-term housing until they can find another residence. Seasonal workers, including migrant farmworkers, need short-term low cost housing for various durations throughout the year.
Single-room occupancy (SRO) units, which are often converted hotels and motels, are one of the most appropriate types of temporary housing for extremely low-income persons. However, the City's Zoning Ordinance does not specifically define single-room occupancy units, nor does it allow similar uses (e.g., rooming and boardinghouses) in any district. Therefore, in order to facilitate the development of SROs and increase housing options for extremely low-income persons, the City will amend its Zoning Ordinance to include the definition of single-room occupancy units, as well as describe specific development standards for these units. (See Program HE.1,2.3.)
Homeless Population
Homeless persons in need of emergency shelter have rarely been an issue in Dunsmuir. The Siskiyou County Sherriff's Office, which provides law enforcement for the City, reports that the City lacks a permanent homeless population, and that fair weather transients are the only homeless persons they encounter. According to the Sheriff's Office, approximately 10 transients may pass through the City over the course of a month during the warmer months of May through September. These transients typically stay for a day or two at most and then continue on their way. The Sheriff’s Department notes that they have yet to observe homeless persons in the City during the winter months.
Natural emergencies that could result in temporary homelessness are fairly uncommon in this area. Should such an emergency occur (e.g., blizzard, flooding, etc.), there is ample space in churches, school gymnasiums, and community facilities to temporarily accommodate displaced individuals and families. The City of Dunsmuir does not have a homeless shelter, but homeless shelters are located in the City of Yreka approximately 46 to the north and in the City of Redding approximately 54 miles to the south. At present these facilities appear to provide adequate housing for the region’s homeless population.
Given the lack of a permanent homeless population, no emergency shelter has been developed in the City. Still, in order to comply with state law and facilitate the development of shelters should one be proposed, the City will amend its Zoning Ordinance to allow them by right in the Centra! Commercial (C-2) district. (See Program HE. 1.2.2.)

persons identified in the Census were involved in either the fishing industry or forestry-related work. Consequently, there is no demonstrated need for seasonal or transient farmworker housing in Dunsmuir.
HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
Housing Composition
The composition of housing in the City is mostly single-family. Table B-20 displays the estimated number of each type of housing unit for 2004, 2006 and 2008 as reported by the State Department of Finance. Over this period, the number of single-family units increased by 0.5 percent (six units) with no increase in multifamily housing.

Housing Conditions
Housing Element law requires an estimate of substandard housing in the community. Determining the percentage of units buift prior to 1970 can provide a rough estimate of rehabilitation or replacement needs. Table B-21 indicates that 1,018 units in the City were constructed prior to 1970. Therefore, based upon age alone, it would appear that approximately 86.6 percent of the units in the City may require rehabilitation or replacement depending on the level of maintenance these units have had. This estimate is considered fairiy accurate considering the results of the City's most recent housing conditions survey, which occurred in 2005. Of the 852 units reviewed during that survey, 27.6 percent (235 units) were found to be in "sound" condition and 65.5 percent (558 units) were classified as requiring varying degrees of rehabilitation. The remaining 6.9 percent, or 59 units, were classified as “dilapidated" and possibly in need of replacement. If is worth noting, however, that the survey did not include mobile home parks and was performed as a "windshield survey.” The inciusion of mobile home parks and a closer inspection of surveyed units would likely result in an increase in the number of units requiring rehabilitation or replacement.

percent while one-bedroom units decreased by approximately 3.0 percent, two-bedroom units decreased by approximately 6.9 percent, three-bedroom units decreased by approximately 1J percent, and five-bedroom units decreased by approximately 47.4 percent. At the same time, the number of four-bedroom units increased by approximately 25.3 percent, which offset the loss of three- and five-bedroom units appropriate for larger families.

Household size by tenure is shown in Table B-25. in 1990 and 2000, the majority of owner-occupied households were inhabited by two residents while the majority of renter-occupied households were inhabited by one resident. Further, between the years 1990 and 2000, large family households fi.e., those with five or more persons) decreased by approximately 36.1 percent among owner-occupied units and increased by approximately 33.3 percent among renter-occupied units.

qualifying income for the average sales price of a two-bedroom home would require an approximate income of $37,758, which based upon 2000 Census data, is in the above moderate income category. Of course, this qualifying annua! income also assumes that the borrowers have no other debt such as a student loans or car payments.
Recent listings indicate a lack of homes priced at an affordable level for households in the extremely low-, very low-, low- and moderate-income groups. The households in these categories make up approximately 62.2 percent of ail households in the City,

At the time of the 2000 Census, the median gross rent in the City of Dunsmuir was $476. Using the HUD affordability standard of rent plus utilities being equal to or less than 30 percent of gross income, the 2000 median rent would be affordable to households earning approximately $19,040 per year. However, given that almost ten years have passed since the 2000 Census, a review of HUD’s current fair market rents for Siskiyou County, as well as affordable rents based upon State income limits, is worthwhile. HUD has established the 2009 fair market rent for a two bedroom unit in Siskiyou County to be $746 and $1,062 for a three bedroom unit. Table B-29 shows the approximate affordable rent for a family of four in each income group. These figures are based on the assumption that a household cannot spend more than 30 percent of its income on housing costs without becoming cost-burdened.
B-21
The Department of Housing and Urban Development's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategies (CHAS) database is used to measure housing affordability and excessive shelter costs, According to CHAS, there are approximately 82 owner-occupied lower-income households and 151 renter-occupied lower-income households (233 total) in the City that are paying 30 percent or more of their income on housing costs. This is the equivalent of approximately 61.8 percent of the lower-income households in the City. Of these 233 lower-income households overpaying, approximately 12 of the owner-occupied households and 84 of the renter-occupied households qualify as extremely low-income.
HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Governmental and Non-Governmental Constraints
Various interrelated factors may constrain the ability of the private and public sectors to provide adequate housing that meets the needs of ail economic segments of the community. These constraints can be divided into two categories: governmental and non-governmental. Governmental constraints consist of land use controls, development standards, processing fees, development impact fees, code enforcement, site improvement costs, development permit and approval processing, and provision for a variety of housing. Non-governmental constraints include land availability, land cost, construction costs, and availability of financing.
Governmental Constraints
Land Use Controls
The City of Dunsmuir General Plan establishes policies that guide all new development, including residential land uses. These polices, aiong with zoning regulations, control the amount and distribution of land allocated for different land uses in the City. Table B-31 shows the residential iand use designations established by the General Plan.
Table B-31
Residential Land Use Designations
Designation	Maximum Units per Acre	Notes
Low Density Residential (LDR)	6 units/acre	Single-family residential dwellings.
Medium Density Residential (MDR)	12 units/acre	Single-family residential dwellings and duplexes.
High Density Residential (HDR)	40 units/acre	Single-family residential dwellings, duplexes, triplexes, apartments, elder housing, group homes, etc.

Residential Development Standards in Residential Zones
Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the General Plan. The Zoning Ordinance also serves to preserve the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods. Table B-32 shows the residential zone districts and permitted densities.
B-23
owners within 300 feet of the project. There are no design standards, architectural review or other criteria applied except normal setbacks, lot coverage, density and parking requirements. The Planning Commission primarily considers potential environmental impacts, as well as public improvements that may be necessary to support the project (e.g., the extension of sewer and water lines and drainage improvements). In deciding whether to grant a use permit, the Planning Commission must make a finding that establishment, maintenance or operation of the use or building applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be materially detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed use or be materially detrimental to property or improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the City.
Although typical, the finding is rather broad and does not provide specific guidance to an applicant as to what conditions must be met to receive a use permit. This lack of specificity might create a potential constraint to residential uses requiring a use permit. However, the Planning Commission can designate conditions of approval as necessary to ensure that the use will meet the required finding. It is important to note that the City does not apply the use permit process to disallow residential uses. Rather, the City seeks to provide a process whereby residential uses that are not allowed by right can be facilitated in a manner that will result in projects that are compatible with surrounding uses. The entire process from submittal to public hearing and project approval is typically about six to eight weeks. The process is the same for ail uses requiring a use permit. Therefore, the process does not unduly constrain the development of residential uses subject to a use permit.
On- and Off-Site Improvements
in order to maintain the quality of its neighborhoods and safeguard the health and safety of the community, the City requires curbs, gutters, and sidewalks in all new developments, in addition, developers must provide those facilities necessary to serve the development, including roads, sewer lines, drainage systems, water lines, fire hydrants and street lights. While all development-related improvements add to the cost of housing, the City's standards are similar to other communities in the region and do not constrain the development of affordable housing.
Among the required on- and off-site improvements, roadways typically have the greatest impact on the cost of housing. Further, it is local streets that are the most common street improvements in new subdivisions. However, depending upon the size of the subdivision, improvements to collectors and arterials may also be necessary. The following standards, which are included in Title 16 of the Dunsmuir Municipal Code, are the basic minimums necessary to protect public health and safety:
•	Minor Subdivision Hillside Streets:
Right-of-way: 44-48 feet Pavement width: 30 feet
•	Residential Streets:
Right-of-way: 50-56 feet Pavement width: 36 feet
•	Collectors:
Right-of-way: 56-64 feet Pavement width: 36-40 feet

Second Dwelling Units
"Second unit" means an attached or a detached residential dwelling unit which provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons. It shall include permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel as the singlefamily dwelling is situated.
Assembly Bill (AB) 1866 {Chapter 1062, Statutes of 2002), also known as the "second unit law”, amended the California Government Code to facilitate the development of second units. This amendment now requires localities to allow second units ministerially without discretionary review or hearings. To be considered a ministerial review, the process used to approve second units must "apply predictable, objective, fixed, quantifiable and clear standards”. Applications for second units should not be subject to onerous conditions of approval or public hearing process or public comment.
The second unit law established maximum standards for second units on lots zoned for residential use that contain existing single-family dwellings. No other standards can be applied to the approval of second units than those listed in Section 65852.2(b) of the Government Code, except the City may require that the primary structure be owner-occupied. The City may apply the following standards:
B-27
order to eliminate any potential for confusion. As such, the City will update its definition of family to ensure clients of group homes are included. (See Program HE.2.1.4.)
Supportive Housing
Supportive housing is defined by Section 50675.14 of the Health and Safety Code as housing with linked on-site or off-site services with no limit on the length of stay that is occupied by a target population as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 53260 (s.e., low-income person with mental disabilities, AIDS, substance abuse or chronic health conditions, or persons whose disabilities originated before the age of 18). Services that are linked to supportive housing usually focus on retaining housing, living and working in the community, and/or health improvement. Although the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not explicitly define supportive housing, it does provide a definition of “group home” as discussed above. Therefore, in order to facilitate the development of supportive housing, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to specifically define supportive housing types and to consider them a residential use. (See Program HE. 1.2,2.)
Emergency Shelters and Transitional Housing
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801) defines an emergency shelter as “housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or households may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay."
New legislation (Senate Bill 2 (Cedillo, 2007)} requires jurisdictions to identify a zone where emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted use without first obtaining a conditional use permit or other discretionary approval. Further, the zone(s) identified must have land available to accommodate an emergency shelter. While the City's Housing Needs Assessment indicates few homeless persons in the City and little need for a shelter, the City conducted a staff level review of its zoning districts and vacant land in order to comply with State law and determined that the Central Commercial (C-2) district would be the most appropriate for the siting of emergency shelters because there would more likeiy be public transit and other services available (e.g., coin operated laundries, groceries, etc.). While there is limited vacant land in the C-2 with which to develop a homeless shelter (0.44-acre between two parcels), there are numerous underutilized commercial structures that could easily be repurposed to accommodate a shelter. (See Program HE.1.2.2.)
SB 2 further requires that transitional housing be considered a residential use subject only to the same restrictions that apply to similar housing types in the same zone. Transitional housing is defined in Section 50675.2 of the Health and Safety Code as rental housing for stays of at least six months, but where the units are recirculated to another program recipient after a set period.
It may be designated for a homeless individual or family transitioning to permanent housing. This housing can take many structural forms such as group housing and multifamily units and may include supportive services to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in support of independent living. Although the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not currently provide a definition of transitional housing or identify zones in which this type of use is permitted, similar to the discussion of supportive housing above, the City allows transitional housing under the umbrella of “group care homes”. However, in an effort to clarify the Zoning Ordinance and facilitate “transitional housing", the City will amend the Ordinance to include a definition consistent with Section 50675.2 of the Health and Safety Code and describe development standards for this housing type. (See Program HE.l .2.2.)

Including the cost of building permits, which are roughly $3,072 per unit for a 1,200-square foot single-family or muitifamiiy dwelling, development fees average $10,745 for a typical singlefamily dwelling and $6,972 per similarly sized multifamily unit. Depending on housing unit size and type, City and school district fees amount to between four and ten percent of the total cost of each new housing unit. While these costs wili likely be passed on to the ultimate product consumer, thus impacting housing prices, these fees are on par with other cities in the region, are deemed necessary to maintain the quality of life desired by City residents, and do not constrain the development of affordable housing.
Permit Processing Times
The time involved in processing development applications can become a constraint to affordable housing development. However, because Dunsmuir is a small community that receives few applications and almost no complicated applications, the processing of a residential application occurs expeditiously. In Dunsmuir, most development applications for single-family and multifamily developments take approximately two to four weeks to process as long as no discretionary approvals are needed. If an applicant proposes a development that requires discretionary review, such as one that requires a use permit, the processing time can extend to two months regardless of if it’s a single-family or multifamily project. Table B-36 lists the typical review times for each type of permit or approval process in the City. These review periods do not present constraints to development as some review is needed to ensure the maintenance of health and safety standards. Further, the City encourages developers to submit

Construction and Labor Costs
Factors that affect the cost of building a house include the type of construction, materials, site conditions, finishing details, amenities, and structural configuration. An Internet source of construction cost data (www.building-cost.net), provided by the Craftsman Book Company estimates the per square foot cost of a single-story four-cornered home in the City to be approximately $172 per square foot. This cost estimate is based on a 1,200 square foot house of good-quality construction including a two-car garage, central heating and air conditioning. The total construction costs excluding land costs are estimated at $205,977 for a spec house in a housing tract and $306,784 for a custom home. If labor or material costs increased substantially, the cost of construction in the City could rise to a level that impacts the price of new construction and rehabilitation.
Availability of Financing
The cost of borrowing money to finance the construction of housing or to purchase a house affects the amount of affordabiy priced housing in the City. Fluctuating interest rates can eliminate many potential homebuyers from the housing market or render a housing project that could have been developed at lower interest rates infeasible. When interest rates decline, sales increase, The reverse has been true when interest rates increase. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic growth in alternative mortgage products, including graduated mortgages and variable rate mortgages. These types of loans ailow homeowners to fake advantage of lower initial interest rates and to qualify for larger home loans. However, variable rate mortgages are not ideal for low- and moderate- income households that live on tight budgets. Variable rate mortgages may allow lower income households to enter info homeownership, but there is a definite risk of monthly housing costs rising above the financial means of that household. Therefore, the fixed interest rate mortgage remains the preferred type of loan, especially during periods of low, stable interest rates. Table B-38 illustrates interest rates as of February 2010. The table presents both the interest rate and annual percentage rate (APR) for different types of home loans. The interest rate is the percentage of an amount of money which is paid for its use for a specified time and the APR is the yearly percentage rate that expresses the total finance charge on a loan over its entire term. The APR includes the interest rate, fees, points, and mortgage insurance, and is therefore a more complete measure of a loan's cost than the interest rate alone. However, the loan's interest rate, not its APR, is used to calculate the monthly principal and interest payment.

Siskiyou County has no local public housing authority. As such, HCD receives an allocation of Housing Choice Voucher rent assistance funds from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and contracts with Great Northern Corporation (a local nonprofit organization) to administer the Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program at the county level. The voucher program provides a voucher to recipients to use to heip pay their rent for any rental unit that accepts the voucher. The recipients pay part of the rent based on 30 percent of their income and the Section 8 program pays the remaining amount.
Great Northern Corporation administers a total of 209 vouchers throughout Siskiyou County with 37 in the City of Dunsmuir. An additional 302 applicants are on the Housing Choice Voucher waiting list.
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
Pursuant to the State Government Code Section 65584, the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) has developed a Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) Plan for Siskiyou County. The RHNA Plan identifies a need for 720 new residential units in all of Siskiyou County (i.e., including the unincorporated areas) over a 7.5-year period (January b 2007 to June 30, 2014). The need for 720 units is shared and distributed amongst each of the communities in the County, with each community's share determined by its proportion of the County's overall household population. Thus, the City of Dunsmuir's share of regional housing needs is 30 units, or four units per year over a 7.5 year period, in an attempt to provide housing for all income groups in the City, these 30 units are further divided amongst the various income groups identified and defined in Table B-39.
Table B-39
Regional Housing Needs, 2007-2014

Total	30	100%	21	12
Source Siskiyou County Final RHNA, HCD, May 2008
Notes: Approximately Half of the state allocation for very low-income units is to serve the needs of the extremely low-income.
As indicated above, 21 units have been added to the City's housing stock during the current RHNA period thus far. These units consist of eight motel cottages that were converted to residential units, an outbuilding that was converted to a single-family residence, and 12 newly constructed single-family dwellings. This has allowed the City to accomplish a fair amount toward its housing goal within the first three years of the RHNA period. However, in order to determine which segments of the population have been served by the addition of this housing, an analysis of the affordability of these units is required.

inaccessible. There are few notable exceptions, principally with regard to a couple of large properties designated for low density residential development. However, these large parcels typically lack the infrastructure necessary for them to be developed.
Staff reviewed the properties identified in Table EMO on a lot-by-lot basis in order to determine maximum allowable densities and realistic buildout capacities. Where residential development potential has been indentified on commercial lots, realistic buildout capacities are based on the likelihood of these lots developing with residential uses. This is typically due to adjacent residential development within those commercial districts. Where constraints to development were identified, these constraints were taken into consideration and are reflected in realistic buildout capacities that are less than the maximum allowable densities. While staff may have underestimated the development potential of some properties, assessments were based on recent development trends in the City, characteristics unique to the site (e.g., size, shape, slope, access, etc.), and the likelihood of access and/or infrastructure being developed to accommodate development in the near term. However, estimates of buildout capacity are not intended to limit development of these properties in any manner. The analysis was conducted with the sole purpose of determining whether the City could accommodate its share of regional housing needs with existing vacant residential land, or if the City would need to rezone properties in order to facilitate the development of housing.
Affordable housing is permitted in a variety of residential zone districts. However, most affordable projects will occur in the R-3, R-4, C-l, and C-2 zones since they permit higher densities and fit projects that are supported by government assistance, The smallest vacant parcel noted in Table EMO that conforms to City development standards and is appropriate for muitifamily development is of sufficient size (0.20 acre) to easily accommodate a triplex with 1,200-square foot units and a two car garage each. As noted above, there are a total of 0.68 acres of R-3, and 1.1 acres of C-2 zoned lands with the combined potential to result in 29 units.
Public sewer and water service is readily available within 100 feet of most of the vacant parcels identified on Table EMO. Where sewer and water services are located more than 100 feet away, this has been noted. However, the distance to infrastructure only becomes a constraint to the development of larger vacant parcels (i.e., those greater than one-acre in size) because sewer and water lines, if not located within 100 feet, are typically located just a little bit further beyond.
The wastewater treatment plant was designed to serve a much larger population than currently present and, as a result, has adequate excess capacity (average dry weather flow of 0,16 million gallons per day) to serve projected growth in the City through the current planning period and beyond. The City's water system was similarly designed to serve a much larger population than currently present and has adequate excess capacity (maximum day demand of 0.55 million gallons per day) to accommodate projected growth in the City through the current planning period and beyond. As such, the City’s basic infrastructure is more than adequate to handle projected growth.

energy consumption. These measures include low flow plumbing fixtures, efficient heating and cooling opportunities, dual pane windows, and adequate insulation and weather stripping, incorporating new technology within residential developments offers developers a chance to design projects that allow for maximum energy conservation opportunities. Although energy regulations establish a uniform standard of energy efficiency, they do not ensure that ail available conservation features are incorporated into building design. Additional measures may further reduce heating, cooling, and lighting loads and overall energy consumption. While it is not feasible that all possible conservation features be included in every development, there are often a number of economically feasible measures that may result in savings in excess of the minimum required by Title 24.
Constructing new homes with energy-conserving features, in addition to retrofitting existing structures, will result in a reduction in monthly utility costs. There are many ways to determine how energy efficient an existing building is and, if needed, what improvements can be made. Many modern building design methods are used to reduce residential energy consumption and are based on proven techniques. These methods can be categorized in three ways:
1.	Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and keeps natural heat out during the summer. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating demands. Proven building techniques in this category include:
•	Location of windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to minimize solar gain in the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter;
•	Use of “thermal mass", earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and files that absorb heat during the day and release heat at night;
•	Use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat exchange between the interior of a home and the exterior;
•	Location of openings and the use of ventilating devices that take advantage of natural air flow;
•	Use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window openings during the summer but allow solar gain during the winter; and
•	Zone heating and cooling systems, which reduce heating and cooling in the unused areas of a home.
2.	Building orientation that uses natural forces to maintain a comfortable interior temperature. Examples include:
•	North-south orientation of the long axis of a dwelling;
•	Minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces; and
•	Location of dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening breezes.
3.	Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques include:
•	Use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home;
•	Use of natural or artificial flowing water; and
•	Use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
In addition to these naturally-based techniques, modern methods include:

Affordable Housing Funding Resources
APPENDIX C - FUNDING RESOURCES
The following funding programs may be able to assist the City in meeting its affordable housing goals:
Table C-1 Funding Resources
Funding Program	Description	Guidelines	Funds Available Per Applicant
Rental Programs			
Governor's Homeless Initiative	Interagency funds (HCD, CAIHFA, DMH) for supportive housing for persons with severe mental illness who are chronically homeless.	Eligible Project Sponsors	The maximum loan per project is $7,000,000. The maximum MHP loan amount is a function of the number of restricted units in a project, their size, location, affordability level, whether the project is receiving nine percent tax credits, and the number and type of units restricted to the Target Population. For projects not receiving nine percent units, the per unit limits are the same as for other MHP NOFAs, except that the base amount for Target Population units is $60,000 instead of $30,000. For projects receiving nine percent credits, the per-unit limits are as the same for other MHP NOFAs (with a $30,000 base amount), but the total maximum loan amount will be calculated by applying these limits to Target Population Units only. Tables specific to this NOFA showing the per-unit loan limits and targeted income limits and rents will be available on the BCD’s website.
		Sponsors and borrowing entities may be organized on a for-profit or not-for-profit basis. Any individual, public agency or private entity capable of entering into a contract is eligible to apply, provided that they or their principals have successfully developed at least one affordable housing project. Sponsors of projects where at least 70 percent of the units consist of Target Population Units or Special Needs Population units are exempt from the requirement for previous development experience under limited conditions. See Section 7303 (d). Sponsors must also demonstrate a minimum of 24 months experience in the ownership or operation of at least one Supportive Housing or Special Needs Population project with five or more units, and provide the commitment of County Mental Health Department funds described in Section D. See Section 7343. Sponsors must have site control in the name of the Sponsor or an entity controlled by the sponsor as defined in Uniform Multifamily Regulations (UMR) Section 8303.

Muitifamily Housing Program Homeless Youth	Housing with supportive services for homeless youth	Eliqible Project Sponsors	The maximum loan per project is $5,000,000. The maximum loan amount per Homeless Youth Unit is a function of unit size, location, and affordability level. Per Unit Max: In Northern California, $65,000 for units in projects not receiving 9 percent fax credits, and $50,000 for units in projects receiving 9 percent fax credits.
		Any Individual, public agency, or private entity capable of entering into a contract is eligible to apply. Eliqible Uses of Funds	
		MHP funds will be provided as permanent financing only, and may be used to take out construction loans used to cover normal project development costs. Eliqible Projects Projects must qualify as rental housing developments, as defined in UMR Section 8301, and meet the requirements of Sections 7302 and 7342. For example, projects must contain five or more dwelling units. Applicants may apply for funding for: (1) projects containing Homeless Youth Units only or (2) projects containing Homeless Youth Units and other units (mixed projects). Under this NOFA, maximum loan amounts will be based on the number of Homeless Youth Units, and 9 percent tax credit projects are eligible. Households eligible to occupy assisted units must include a “homeless youth,’’ which is defined in Government Code Section 11139.3(e)(2)

Appendix D Glossary of Terms
APPENDIX D - GLOSSARY OF TERMS
The foliowing definitions are for commonly used terms in a Housing Element:
Above Moderate-Income: Above moderate-income households are defined as households with incomes over 120 percent of the county median.
Accessible Units: Indicates certain units or all units in the property are wheelchair accessible or can be made wheelchair accessible. Accessible units also may Include those that are accessible to people with sensory impairments or can be made accessible for people with sensory impairments.
Affordability: Annua! cost of housing includes mortgage, principle and interest payments as amortized over 25 years with a 25 percent down payment or gross rent that does not exceed 30 percent of gross annual household income or 30 percent of gross annual income devoted to rental housing, including utilities are defined as ''affordable".
Affordability Covenant: A property title agreement that places resale or rental restrictions on a housing unit; also known as a deed restriction,
Affordable Housing; "Affordable Housing" refers to the relationship between the price of housing in a region (either sale price or rent) and household income. Affordable housing is that which is affordable to households of very low, low and moderate incomes. For housing to be affordable, shelter costs must not exceed 30 percent of the gross annual income of the household.
Assisted Housing: Assisted housing refers to a unit that rents or sells for less than the prevailing market rate due to governmental monetary intervention or contribution. The terms "assisted" and "subsidized" are often used inferchangeabiy.
At-Risk Housing: Applies to existing subsidized affordable rental housing units, especially federally subsidized developments, that are threatened with conversion to market rents because of termination of use restrictions, due to expiration or non-renewal of subsidy arrangements.
Below Market Rate (BMR) Unit: A BMR unit is a housing unit that sells or rents for fess than the going market rate. It is typically used in reference to housing units that are directly or indirectly subsidized or have other restrictions in order to make them affordable to very low, low or moderate-income households.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): The State CDBG program was established by the federal Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC 5301, ef seq.). The primary federal objective of the CDBG program is the development of viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. "Persons of low and moderate income" or the "targeted income group" (TIG) are defined as families, households, and individuals whose incomes do not exceed 80 percent of the county median income, with adjustments for family or household size,
D-l
Disability: A long-lasting physical, mental, or emotional condition. This condition can make it difficult for a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being able to go outside the home alone or to work at a job or business.
Downpayment Assistance: The most popular loans for these programs are with the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). FHA allows 100 percent gift funds for your down payment and some allowable closing costs. The gift can be from any relative or can be collected through charitable organizations like Neighborhood Gold / The Buyer Fund. Another popular tactic, which can be used in a broader range of loan programs, is to borrow from a 401K. A withdrawal can be made without a penalty and pay it back over a specified period.
Development Impact Fees: A fee or charge imposed on developers to pay for a jurisdiction’s costs of providing services to new development.
Development Right: The right granted to a land owner or other authorized party to improve a property. Such right is usually expressed in terms of a use and intensity allowed under existing zoning regulation.
Dwelling Unit: Any residential structure, whether or not attached to real property, including condominium and cooperative units and mobile or manufactured homes. It includes both one-to-four-family and multifamily structures. Vacation or second homes and rental properties are aiso included.
Elderly Units: Specific units in a development are restricted to residents over a certain age (as young as 55 years and over). Persons with disabilities may share certain developments with the elderly.
Element: A division or chapter of the General Plan, Master Plan or Comprehensive Plan.
Emergency Shelter: A facility designed to provide free temporary housing on a night-by-night basis to homeless families and individuals.
Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG): A grant program administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided on a formula basis to large entitlement jurisdictions.
Extremely Low-Income Limit: The upper limit for the extremely low-income category, set at 30 percent of the HUD area median family income. This is not an official program eligibility income limit, except when associated with a specific family size (e.g., "single person", "family of two", "family of three", etc.).
Fair Market Rent (FMR): Fair Market Rents are freely set rental rates defined by HUD as the median gross rents charged for available standard units in a county or Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA), Fair Market Rents are used for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program and other HUD programs and are published annually by HUD.
Farm Labor Housing (Farm Worker): Units for migrant farm workers that can be available for transitional housing for the homeless when not occupied by migrant farm workers.
D-3
in 1990, the race question preceded the Hispanic origin question, Second, there was an instruction preceding the Hispanic origin question in 2000 indicating that respondents should answer both the Hispanic origin and the race questions. This instruction was added to give emphasis to the distinct concepts of the Hispanic origin and race questions and to emphasize the need for both pieces of information.
Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME): HOME provides formula grants to States and localities that communities use—often in partnership with local nonprofit groups—to fund a wide range of activities that build, buy, and/or rehabiiitafe affordable housing for rent or homeownership or provide direct rental assistance to low-income people.
Homeless Person: An individual living outside or in a building not meant for human habitation, or which they have no legal right to occupy, in an emergency shelter, or in a temporary housing program which may include a transitional and supportive housing program if habitation time limits exist.
