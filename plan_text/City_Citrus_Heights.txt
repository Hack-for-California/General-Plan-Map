3.1        INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this section is to identify current transportation conditions within the City of Citrus Heights. This
information will be used to assess existing needs for all transportation system modes and to provide a context for
potential mobility goals and policies, especially those related to new issues such as complete streets and climate
change.
3.2        REGULATORY SETTING
STATE
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) provides for the mobility of people, goods, services, and
information. Its mission is to work in partnership with others to provide the people of California with a safe,
efficient, and effective intermodal transportation system by planning, developing, maintaining, and managing the
interregional transportation system and assisting and guiding delivery of local and regional transportation
services. Caltrans provides administrative support for transportation programming decisions made by the
California Transportation Commission and Caltrans for state funding programs. The State Transportation
Improvement Program (STIP) is a multi-year capital improvement program that sets priorities and funds
transportation projects envisioned in long-range transportation plans.
REGIONAL/LOCAL
SACRAMENTO AREA COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS
The Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) is an association of local governments in the six-county
Sacramento region. Its members include the counties of Sacramento, El Dorado, Placer, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba as
well as 22 cities. SACOG provides transportation planning and funding for the region, and serves as a forum for
the study and resolution of regional issues. In addition to preparing the region’s long-range transportation plan,
SACOG assists in planning for transit, bicycle networks, clean air, and airport land uses. SACOG also maintains a
regional model that is used for developing long-range travel forecasts.
METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION PLAN FOR 2035
The Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP) for 2035 (SACOG 2008) is a federally mandated, long-range,
fiscally constrained transportation plan for the six-county area that includes El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento,
Sutter, Yolo, and Yuba counties. Most of this area is designated a federal non-attainment area for ozone,
indicating that the transportation system is required to meet stringent air quality emissions budgets to reduce

pollutant levels that contribute to ozone formation. To receive federal funding, transportation projects nominated
by cities, counties, and agencies must be consistent with the MTP. Consistency is measured based on whether the
project was contained in the plan and its associated computer modeling of transportation and air quality impacts.
In addition, any regionally significant transportation project planned for a city or county must be included in the
MTP because of its potential effects on travel demand and air pollution.
SACRAMENTO REGIONAL BLUEPRINT
The Sacramento Regional Blueprint, also known as the Blueprint Preferred Scenario, is part of SACOG’s MTP
for 2035. The Blueprint Preferred Scenario serves as a framework to guide local government in growth and
transportation planning through 2050. It outlines a way for the region to grow through the year 2050 in a manner
that promotes compact, mixed-use development and more transit choices as an alternative to low-density
development.
2009/12 METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
The 2009/12 Metropolitan Transportation Improvement Program (SACOG 2008) is a list of transportation
projects and programs that receive federal funds to be paid for and implemented over the next 3 years. The list of
transportation projects that receive federal funds is subject to a federally required action, or is regionally
significant. SACOG submits this document to Caltrans and amends the program on a quarterly cycle. The
Metropolitan Transportation Improvement Program (MTIP) and its amendments are subject to air quality
conformity analysis under federal regulations, which limit the use of federal funds for regionally significant,
capacity-increasing roadway projects.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
The Citrus Heights Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is a five-year plan which identifies capital projects and
equipment purchases, provides a planning schedule and identifies financing options. The CIP allocates existing
funds and anticipated revenues to rehabilitate, restore, improve and add to the City’s infrastructure, including
transportation, drainage, facilities, grant-funded projects, the innovation fund program and general purpose
expenditures. The document, prepared by the City Manager’s Office and the General Services Department based
on submissions from City departments, is reviewed by the Planning Commission, and then is submitted to the
City Council for adoption, along with the City’s annual budget. The five-year plan does not appropriate funds, but
rather functions as a budgeting and planning tool, supporting the actual appropriations that are made through
adoption of the budget.

CITY OF CITRUS HEIGHTS BIKEWAY MASTER PLAN
The City’s 2009 Bikeway Master Plan provides recommendations for implementing a comprehensive and
coordinated bikeway system in the City to improve the quality of life for all residents and visitors.
3.3        Existing Roadway System
MAJOR ROADWAYS
The City of Citrus Heights is served by a series of east-west and north-south arterials and collector streets. Major
east-west arterials include Madison Avenue, Greenback Lane, and Antelope Road. Major north-south arterials
include Sunrise Boulevard, Fair Oaks Boulevard, Auburn Boulevard, San Juan Avenue, Dewey Drive, and Sylvan
Road. Major collector streets include Old Auburn Road, Oak Avenue, Van Maren Lane, Mariposa Avenue, and
Twin Oaks Avenue. Figure 3-1 displays the location of these roadways.
Table 3-1 summarizes the existing characteristics of each roadway within the entire right-of way including
number of travel lanes, shoulder widths, and the presence of bicycle and/or pedestrian facilities. Access control
for each roadway is also listed, which is defined as high, moderate, or low depending on the number of driveways,
frequency of stops (traffic signals), and prevailing travel speeds. High access control facilities typically have no
driveways and speeds of 45–55 miles per hour (mph). Moderate access control facilities typically have limited
driveways and speeds of 35–45 mph. Low access control facilities typically have frequent driveways and speeds
of 35–45 mph.
As shown, most roadways within the planning area are classified as moderate access control facilities. High
access control facilities include segments of Greenback Lane and Madison Avenue, while low access control
facilities include segments of Auburn Boulevard, Sunrise Boulevard, Old Auburn Road, and San Juan Avenue.
Most of the two-lane collector streets, such as Oak Avenue, Van Maren Lane, Twin Oaks Avenue, and Mariposa
Avenue, are also low access control facilities.
DAILY TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND OPERATIONS
Figure 3-1 displays average weekday daily traffic volumes on 29 major roadway segments within the planning
area. Traffic counts were conducted at each study roadway segment location in October 2009, except the segment
of Sunrise Boulevard between Old Auburn Road and Oak Avenue, which was conducted during the first week of
December 2009. Segments of Greenback Lane, Madison Avenue, Antelope Road, and Sunrise Boulevard
currently carry the greatest levels of traffic (over 40,000 vehicles per day). Auburn Boulevard, San Juan Avenue,
Sylvan Road, Fair Oaks Boulevard, and Old Auburn Road carry between 15,000 and 30,000 vehicles per day.
Existing traffic volumes on the study roadway segments are generally lower than those collected for the General
Plan in 1998 (an overall average of approximately 8% lower Citywide). The greatest reductions in traffic volume

                                       Access control is defined as Low, Moderate, or High depending on the number of driveways, frequency of stops, and prevailing travel speeds (refer to previous page for more detailed

counts are on Sunrise Boulevard (approximately 30% lower between Greenback Lane and Old Auburn Road) and
Greenback Lane (approximately 16% lower between the west City limits and Dewey Drive). The overall lower
traffic volumes are likely a function of the current economic recession and related unemployment rate and are
consistent with general traffic trends in the greater Sacramento area.
Figure 3-1 also illustrates the existing vehicle Level of Service (LOS) on each roadway based on daily traffic
volume capacity thresholds. LOS is a term that describes the operating performance of a facility from a driver’s
perspective and is reported on a scale from A to F. LOS A represents driving conditions that are not impeded by
other traffic and represents low levels of roadway capacity utilization. On the other end of the spectrum, LOS F
represents heavy or full utilization of roadway capacity and can have operations where traffic speeds are
substantially reduced from free-flow conditions. Daily volume thresholds are used to identify the potential need to
expand roadways based on the City’s LOS threshold. Once the threshold is exceeded, the City will determine
whether roadway expansions should be considered. The decision to expand roadway capacity should also consider
the perspective of other users such as bicyclists and pedestrians and objectives related to environmental
protection. Policy 29.1 in the City’s first General Plan established an LOS D threshold, which would not result in
full utilization of roadway capacity and could result in adverse effects on bicyclists and pedestrians. Policy 29.1 in
the proposed General Plan update establishes a Complete Streets policy with an LOS E threshold. Exceptions to
the LOS E threshold are allowed for certain roadway segments. New trips added by proposed projects to exempt
roadways must be mitigated, but exempt roadways or intersections cannot be widened to add capacity. Table 3-2
summarizes the capacity thresholds for each access control type.

The remainder of the studied roadway segments operate at LOS D or better.
MAJOR INTERSECTIONS
PEAK HOUR TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND OPERATIONS
The traffic analysis for intersection locations in the planning area is based on weekday peak hour conditions to
account for the hour of the day that experiences the greatest levels of traffic. Generally, the PM peak hour
(between 4:00 – 6:00 PM) has greater traffic volumes than the morning peak hour (between 7:00 – 9:00 AM),
which was verified by reviewing the daily traffic counts conducted on roadway segments. Therefore, the PM peak
hour was considered the governing peak period as a basis for the intersection analysis. Figures 3-2A and 3-2B
display PM peak hour traffic volumes at 20 major intersections within the planning area, including the ramp
terminal intersections at the I-80/Antelope Road interchange. Traffic counts were conducted at each study
intersection in October 2009.
Figures 3-2A and 3-2B also display the existing lane configurations and traffic control devices at each
intersection. Each intersection is currently signalized. Many other intersections in the City are also controlled by
traffic signals as shown in Figure 3-2C. As of 2010, Citrus Heights has 62 traffic signals, including 2 fire station
signals, 3 pedestrian signals, and 4 flasher/beacons. Four traffic signals are located along the City of Citrus
Heights/Sacramento County border along Madison Avenue, but are maintained by Sacramento County (three of
these County-maintained signals include remote Closed Captioned Television (CCTV) cameras. Figure 3-2C also
shows select roadway segments where traffic signals are operated in a coordinated fashion. The coordinated
operation is part of the City’s intelligent transportation system (ITS) architecture, which is intended to help the
City manage transportation network operations. Specific segments under coordinated signal control include
segments of Madison Avenue, Sunrise Boulevard (from Madison Avenue to Arcadia Drive), and the entire

Peak hour intersection operations were evaluated by computing the vehicle LOS at each study intersection. LOS
at intersections is also based on a driver’s perspective and is measured based on the delay experienced at the
intersection. The study intersections were analyzed using the methodology contained in the Highway Capacity
Manual (Transportation Research Board 2000). This methodology computes the average control delay on an
intersection-wide basis for signalized locations and compares the results to the thresholds shown in Table 3-4 to
determine the LOS.

The following five intersections operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour:
►    Madison Avenue/San Juan Avenue
►    Greenback Lane /Sunrise Boulevard
►    Greenback Lane /Fair Oaks Boulevard
►    Auburn Boulevard/Antelope Road
►    Sunrise Boulevard/Old Auburn Road
The remaining studied intersections operate at LOS D or better during the PM peak hour.
ACCIDENT HISTORY
The most recent 3-year accident history of the majority of study intersections was obtained from the City of Citrus
Heights Police Department. Accident data for the I-80/Antelope Road eastbound and westbound ramp terminal
intersections was obtained from the California Highway Patrol’s Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System
(SWITRS). Figure 3-4 and Table 3-6 identify the total number of accidents involving vehicles, bicyclists, and
pedestrians at each study intersection during this 3-year period. 1
In addition, the average rate of accidents per million vehicles (per MV) entering each study intersection was
calculated. According to 2008 Highway Safety Improvement Guidelines (Caltrans 2008), signalized intersections
located in California suburban areas have an average accident rate of 0.58 accidents per MV entering the
intersection. Five study intersections have accident rates that are higher than the statewide average accident rate
(at least 20 percent higher), which are:
►    Greenback Lane/Auburn Boulevard (0.94 accidents per MV – approximately 21 accidents per year)
►    Greenback Lane/San Juan Avenue/Sylvan Road (0.76 accidents per MV – approximately 16 accidents

                                    Note: Based on accident data collected from October 2006 to October 2009

►    Auburn Boulevard/Sylvan Road/Old Auburn Road (0.78 accidents per MV – approximately 13 accidents
     per year)
A review of individual accident reports indicates that most accidents involved rear-end, sideswipe, or broadside
collisions within the intersection or on the Greenback Lane approaches. Many of these accidents are attributable
to stop-and-go traffic conditions on Greenback Lane, which may decline with the October 2009 installation of a
new coordinated signal system on Greenback Lane that is intended to improve traffic flow stability.
OTHER TRANSPORTATION ISSUES
TRUCK ROUTES
There are no posted truck routes on any of the major roadways within the planning area. However, trucks most
frequently use Sunrise Boulevard, Greenback Lane, Madison Avenue, Antelope Road, and Auburn Boulevard.
EMERGENCY SERVICE ROUTES
Fire stations are located within the City of Citrus Heights on Greenback Lane east of Auburn Boulevard,
Greenback Lane east of Sylvan Road, Oak Avenue east of Fair Oaks Boulevard, and Auburn Boulevard north of
Antelope Road. Mercy San Juan Hospital is located west of Dewey Drive between Greenback Lane and Madison
Avenue. The police station is located at City Hall (Fountain Square Drive) between Greenback Lane and Stock
Ranch Road. Given the locations of the police station, fire stations, and hospital, emergency service vehicles most
frequently use Sunrise Boulevard, Greenback Lane, Madison Avenue, Dewey Drive, Oak Avenue, and Auburn
Boulevard.
NEIGHBORHOOD TRAFFIC ISSUES
The City of Citrus Heights adopted a Neighborhood Traffic Management Program (NTMP) in 2001 to provide
relief from traffic-related effects, such as speeding and other vehicle code violations, traffic volumes, noise, and
pedestrian/bicycle conflicts. The program has since been expanded to recognize the importance of a complete
streets philosophy and to implement a comprehensive neighborhood area-wide evaluation approach.
Neighborhoods are studied based on traffic safety, accessibility and walkability issues and opportunities.
The primary means of interactive communication with residents is through the local Neighborhood Associations,
and residents are encouraged to participate in the Association representing their neighborhood area.
The City’s comprehensive traffic safety, accessibility, and walkability program has two components: (1) ongoing
traffic safety, accessibility and walkability, and Education, Enforcement, Education, Encouragement and
Evaluation (5 Es); and (2) neighborhood-wide improvement planning, including engineering studies,
improvement plans, construction, and program implementation. The ongoing program provides a process for

individual complaints/requests to be regularly addressed by the City’s Traffic Committee, consisting of
Engineering, Police, and Fire department staff. Neighborhood-wide improvement planning is longer-term and
more formal, incorporating data from the City’s service request system and the Traffic Committee into an
interactive staff and community-based evaluation and planning process. This comprehensive study process is
typically supported by consultant resources. Improvement plans generated from this process are programmed into
the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for implementation. The Neighborhood-wide process is conducted
periodically (typically bi-annually or less frequently) to allow for plans to be developed and implemented in
subsequent years.
3.4      EXISTING TRANSIT SYSTEM
TRANSIT ROUTES

Avenue and Louis Lane (near the Auburn Boulevard/Whyte Avenue intersection) just beyond the north City
limits. The Arcadia Drive transit center provides connections to other RT routes, while the Auburn Boulevard
transit center connects with Roseville Transit and Placer County Transit.
Major roadways in the planning area are relatively well-served by transit. Consideration should be given for more
enhanced bus stops on key routes such as Greenback Lane, Sunrise Boulevard, Sylvan Road, Auburn Boulevard,
and Antelope Road. Enhanced bus stops would include bus turnouts, bus shelters, shade trees, route maps and
appropriate signs to attract and promote both transit and pedestrian trips. Each route is described below and the
existing transit system is illustrated on Figure 3-5.
Route 1 begins at the transit center on Arcadia Drive at Greenback Lane and continues west, along Greenback
Lane and Auburn Boulevard to the Watt/I-80 LRT station and to Luce Avenue and Palm Street. Route 1 operates
Monday through Friday on approximately 15-minute headways. For Saturday, Sunday, and holiday service, Route
1 operates at 1-hour and 30-minute headways.

3.5        EXISTING BICYCLE/PEDESTRIAN SYSTEM
BICYCLE SYSTEM
The City provides both on-street and off-street bicycle facilities that are generally categorized as Class I, Class II,
or Class III facilities, as illustrated below. Existing and proposed bicycle facilities within the City are illustrated
on Figure 3-6.
Class I bike paths are provided in Rusch Park, Tempo Park and Van Maren Park (Stock Ranch). A few major
roadways within the City contain Class II bicycle lanes (although some currently lack appropriate signage).
Various gaps in continuous bicycle lanes have been identified on several major arterials within the City’s Bicycle
Master Plan completed in January 2009. Van Maren Lane and Old Auburn Road in particular have relatively short
middle segments without Class II bike lanes that would connect to existing Class II facilities on each end. As
shown in Figure 3-6, gaps in continuous Class II bicycle lanes exist on the following major roadways:

►    Twin Oaks Avenue – between Auburn Boulevard and Garry Oaks Drive
►    Fair Oaks Boulevard – between Old Auburn Road and Madison Avenue
►    Old Auburn Boulevard – between Auburn Boulevard and Sunrise Boulevard
Some roadways, such as Mariposa Avenue and Birdcage Street, would provide logical bikeway connections but
lack existing bicycle facilities along the length of the entire roadway, and are planned for future Class II bike
lanes.
Figure 3-6 also illustrates the following:
►    Lack of Class III Bike Routes on residential collector streets in various neighborhoods to provide connections
     to existing or proposed Class II facilities
General Plan Background Report
City of Citrus Heights                                     3-25                                                 Mobility

►   Limited connections between existing Class I and Class II facilities (both existing and proposed).
The City should also consider reviewing proposed Class II bike lanes on the 6-lane segments of Greenback Lane
and Madison Avenue in consideration of a Complete Streets concept, since the speed differential between
motorists and bicyclists is large on 6-lane arterials, indicating a need for separate, rather than shared rights-of-
way.
Multi-modal connections in the City of Citrus Heights are especially important due to barriers to continuous
bicycle travel such as the lack of existing continuous bikeway facilities and sidewalks. Transit centers on Arcadia
Drive at Greenback Lane (Sunrise Mall Transit Center) and on Orlando Avenue and Louis Lane (next to Auburn
Boulevard at Whyte Avenue) just beyond the north City limits provide connections to other RT routes and
Roseville Transit and Placer County Transit services. Bicyclists often rely on transit service to transfer them to
destinations when barriers to continuous travel are present. Bicycle racks are provided on RT buses to
accommodate bicyclists.
PEDESTRIAN SYSTEM
Pedestrian facilities in the planning area consist of paths, sidewalks, and pedestrian crossings. Existing sidewalks
and gaps in the pedestrian system are illustrated on Figure 3-7. Key gaps are identified below.
►   Sunrise Boulevard on the west side between Oak Avenue and Greenback Lane
►   Fair Oaks Boulevard on the west side between Woodmore Oaks Drive and Greenback Lane
►   Old Auburn Road on both sides between Auburn Boulevard and the east City limit
►   Van Maren Lane on both sides between Kittery Avenue and Navion Drive
►   Antelope Road on both sides between Poplar Avenue and Old Auburn Boulevard
►   Twin Oaks Drive on both sides between Auburn Boulevard and Garry Oaks Drive
Full sidewalks (continuous on both sides of the street) exist on most major arterials such as Auburn Boulevard
and segments of Sunrise Boulevard, Greenback Lane, Dewey Drive, Van Maren Lane, Fair Oaks Boulevard, and
Madison Avenue. In other areas, many minor residential streets have been developed without sidewalks, primarily
in older neighborhoods generally located within the central portion of Citrus Heights. Crosswalks are provided at
most signalized intersections, at intersections on collector streets, and at intersections adjacent to schools.

This section identifies existing deficiencies in the roadway, transit, and pedestrian/bicycle systems. Table 3-7
summarizes the existing deficiencies based, in part, on the peak hour level of service and rate of accidents at

intersections, daily volume-to-capacity ratios on roadways, and unmet pedestrian and bicycle needs. In addition,
consideration of Complete Streets was included in the table and describes the tradeoffs between the current
General Plan policies and alternative policies that consider all users/modes of the roadway. In general,
maintaining the current LOS standards for roadways and intersections (which focus on serving vehicular traffic),
may result in roadway improvements that have a negative effect on other modes. In particular, road widening to
maximize automobile use will compete with right-of-way needs to provide bus turnouts, parking, sidewalks, and
bike facilities.

10.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter describes the possible hazards potentially affecting public safety in Citrus Heights, including seismic
and geologic hazards, hazardous materials, aircraft and helicopter hazards, flooding, and the City’s emergency
operations plans for dealing with potential hazards.
10.2 SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARD REGULATORY SETTING
FEDERAL
National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program
The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) seeks to mitigate earthquake losses through both
basic and directed research and implementation activities in the fields of earthquake science and engineering.
The NEHRP is the Federal Government’s coordinated approach to addressing earthquake risks. Congress
established the program in 1977 (Public Law 95-124) as a long-term, nationwide program to reduce the risks to
life and property in the United States resulting from earthquakes. The NEHRP is managed as a collaborative
effort among FEMA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Science Foundation, and
the United States Geological Survey (FEMA 2009).
The four goals of the NEHRP are to:
►    Develop effective practices and policies for earthquake loss-reduction and accelerate their implementation.
►    Improve techniques to reduce seismic vulnerability of facilities and systems.
►    Improve seismic hazards identification and risk-assessment methods and their use.
►    Improve the understanding of earthquakes and their effects.
STATE
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act
The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act requires the delineation of zones along active faults in
California. The purpose of the Alquist-Priolo Act is to regulate development on or near active fault traces to
reduce the hazards associated with fault rupture and to prohibit the location of most structures for human
occupancy across these traces. Citrus Heights does not contain a designated Alquist-Priolo Fault Rupture Zone.

Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act was developed to protect the public from the effects of strong groundshaking,
liquefaction, landslides, or other ground failure, and from other hazards caused by earthquakes. This act requires
the State Geologist to delineate various seismic hazard zones and requires cities, counties, and other local
permitting agencies to regulate certain development projects within these zones. Before a development permit is
granted for a site within a seismic hazard zone, a geotechnical investigation of the site must be conducted and
appropriate mitigation measures incorporated into the project design.
California Building Code
The California Building Code regulates all new construction in the City. The building code includes specific
measures to ensure new buildings comply. The City’s Building Division is responsible for the enforcement of the
Building Code.
REGIONAL/LOCAL
Hazard Mitigation Plan
On May 11, 2005, the City adopted the Sacramento County Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan (MHMP). The County
coordinated the effort necessary to develop the countywide MHMP pursuant to the requirements of the Disaster
Mitigation Act of 2000 (PL 106-390).
Hazard mitigation planning is the process through which natural hazards that threaten communities are identified,
likely effects of those hazards are determined, mitigation goals are set, and appropriate strategies that would
lessen the effects are determined, prioritized, and implemented. Hazard mitigation planning is required for state
and local governments to maintain their eligibility for certain federal disaster assistance and hazard mitigation
funding programs.
With the adoption of the plan, the City committed to:
►    Pursuing the implementation of the high priority, low/no-cost Recommended Actions contained in the
     MHMP,
►    Keeping the concept of mitigation in the forefront of community decision-making by identifying
     recommendations of the MHMP when other community goals, plans and activities overlap, influence, or
     directly affect increased community vulnerability to disasters, and
                                                                                           General Plan Background Report

►    Maintaining a vigilant monitoring of multi-objective cost-share opportunities to assist the participating
     communities in implementing the Recommended Actions of the MHMP for which current funding or support
     exists.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
TOPOGRAPHY
The topography of the Citrus Heights area is characterized by flat terrain with small hills in some locations.
Cripple Creek and Arcade Creek flow through the project area. The majority of the planning area has been
developed with residential and commercial uses. Slopes within the planning area range from zero percent to
15 percent with the majority of the steeper slopes located in the southeastern portion of Citrus Heights. Elevations
range from 120 feet above mean sea level near the southwestern edge of Citrus Heights to 200 feet above mean
sea level near the southeastern portion of the city.
GEOLOGY
Citrus Heights is located in the northern portion of Sacramento County, south of the Roseville corporate boundary
and north of Carmichael and Fair Oaks. In this area, the predominantly granitic and metamorphic rocks at high
elevations of the Sierra Nevada Mountains transition into the low foothills, terraces and alluvial filled valleys of
the Central Valley geomorphic province. The general geology is composed of Cenozic Era (up to 65 million years
old) sedimentary rocks, volcanic mudflow deposits, and young sediments comprising the uppermost 4,000 feet of
Central Valley fill.
Citrus Heights is located in the Great Valley geomorphic province, which is bound by the California Coast
Ranges on the west and the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the east. Erosion of the Coast Ranges and the Sierra
Nevada Mountains has created the sediments deposited into the Great Valley. In addition, the flows of the
Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River have drained and further shaped the Valley. The Great Valley is
divided into various geomorphic subunits characterized by Holocene deposits, including the low-lying Delta lands
that extend along Sacramento County’s western boundary. This region was previously covered with tidal marshes
and sloughs. Currently, this area has been drained and numerous islands have been created by the construction of
the levee system.
Citrus Heights is located within the Delta geomorphic subunit, a Holocene floodplain containing peat deposits
(Jennings 1985).

Sacramento County, including Citrus Heights (see Figure 10-1). The planning area is underlain by numerous soil
types that have various properties (see Table 10-1); however, the predominant soil types are the Xerarents-
Fiddyment, Fiddyment fine sandy loam, and Fiddyment loam series. The majority of soils in the planning area
have slight to moderate erosion potential and moderate shrink-swell potential. Shrink-swell refers to the soil’s
ability to expand when wet and to contract when dry.

Shrinking and swelling of soil can damage roads, dams, building foundations, and other structures. High rated
shrink/swell soil areas are located in the central portion of Citrus Heights, southeast of the Union Pacific Railroad
tracks and north of Interstate 80, and in the southeastern portion of the City just north of Madison Avenue.
Erosion is a natural geologic process where landforms are worn down or reshaped over time by natural factors
such as wind and water. The Citrus Heights area has low to moderate erosion ratings. In general, erosion occurs
where there are steep slopes and the soil is continually exposed to wind and rain.

SEISMICITY AND SEISMIC HAZARDS
Regional Setting
The Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada, like most of California, are seismically active regions, although they
have lower earthquake risk than many other areas of the state. The severity of seismic events is typically
described using magnitude or intensity.) Magnitude is a measure of the strain energy released at the source of the
earthquake, and there are several different magnitude scales that measure the release of seismic energy in different
ways. The Moment Magnitude scale is the most commonly-used magnitude scale in the scientific community,
although the Richter Magnitude scale is more commonly known among lay persons.
Unlike magnitude, intensity is the qualitative measurement based on effects on natural features, structures, and
human life. Intensity is most often described using the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, which measures
the perception of an earthquake on a scale ranging from a low of I (not felt) to a high of XII (total destruction).
There are no known faults or Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones within the planning area. The primary site
hazard associated with seismic activity would involve minor groundshaking from distant faults.

Although no active faults are located in the immediate vicinity of Citrus Heights, several large, active and
potentially active faults are located within the surrounding region. These faults include the Dunnigan Hills Fault
and other unnamed faults on the west side of the Sacramento Valley, and faults associated with the Foothills Fault
System along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. However, the probability that these faults would
significantly affect Citrus Heights is considered to be small (Stickney 1998). Ground shaking felt in Citrus
Heights is more likely to be the result of seismic activity along coastal faults (Stickney 1998).
Major faults located within 60 miles of Citrus Heights are listed in Table 10-2. The closest known active fault
mapped by the California Division of Mines and Geology is the Foothills Fault Zone which is located
approximately 15 miles northeast of Citrus Heights. Other active or potentially active faults that may be a hazard
to the area include Green Valley-Concord, Hayward, San Andreas, and Calaveras.
Inactive Faults
Three local faults lie within approximately 20 miles of Citrus Heights, all of which are considered inactive (no
activity in the Holocene period of the last 10,000 years). These include the Volcano Hill Fault, just east of
Roseville, the Linda Creek Fault (which has uncertain existence and activity status) extending southeasterly along
a portion of Linda Creek in the southern portion of Roseville and into Sacramento County, and a third unnamed
fault. The unnamed fault is a west-east oriented fault between Rocklin and Folsom Reservoir. Portions of this

fault are concealed, and may be connected to the Bear Mountain Fault Zone. In 1908, an earthquake estimated to
have exceeded 4.0 on the Richter Scale occurred on an unnamed fault in the southwestern portion of Placer
County, probably centered between Folsom, Auburn, Placerville and Roseville (BMI 1997). No significant
seismic event has been recorded in the vicinity since that time.
Secondary Hazards
Active faults can result in a variety of secondary hazards including groundshaking, liquefaction and settlement.
Groundshaking refers to the motion that occurs during the shifting of a fault. There have been no recent fault
movements in Sacramento County. However, this region has experienced groundshaking from the movements of
faults located east and west of the County.
Settlement refers to the compaction of soils due to seismic activity. Settlement of soil can range from a few inches
to several feet. As an example, landfills frequently undergo settlement as a result of the decomposition of
material.
Citrus Heights is located in a low severity zone assuming maximum earthquake intensity. In addition, all
structures are designed for Seismic Zone 3, in accordance with provisions of the California Building Code.

Land Subsidence
Land subsidence is the loss of surface elevation due to removal of subsurface support. No known occurrences of
subsidence have occurred in Citrus Heights.
Liquefaction
Liquefaction is the loss of soil strength due to seismic activity in association with water saturated soils.
Liquefaction leads to a “quick sand” type condition for structures built in areas of poorly consolidated water
saturated sediments or artificial fill.
Landslides
No landslides or landslide deposits have been mapped within the planning area. No evidence of slope instability
such as landslide scars or mudflow features are observed in the planning area. Overall potential for slope
instability in the planning area is considered low.
Dam Failure and Inundation Hazards
Dam failure inundation is defined as the flooding that occurs as the result of structural failure of a dam. Dam
failure may be caused by seismic activity itself or seismic activity may result in inundation caused by a
seismically- induced wave which overtops the dam without also causing dam failure known as a seiche. Dams
may also be at risk due to potential acts of terrorism.
The planning area may potentially be affected in the unlikely event of a dam or dike failure at Folsom Lake. The
Folsom Dam and Reservoir is located on the American River, about 20 miles upstream of the City of Sacramento,
four miles east of Citrus Heights. Completed in 1956 by the Corps of Engineers, Folsom Dam is owned and
operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). The reservoir has a storage capacity of 1 million acre-ft at
gross pool. The reservoir includes about 4.5 miles of man-made dike with a crest elevation of 480.5 ft above sea
level. Folsom Lake Dam infrastructure includes Folsom Dam, Folsom Right Wing, Dikes 4-8, and Mormon Island
(USBR 1999).
In 1997, the USBR analyzed the potential effects of the Folsom Dam/Other Dam Infrastructure failure on the
Sacramento region. Based on the results of the analysis, the City may be at risk if portions of the
Dam/Infrastructure were to fail. The analysis indicates that if Folsom Dam itself were to fail, no portion of Citrus
Heights would be inundated by the resulting flood. However, if Dike 5 were to fail, the northeastern corner of the
city as well as the portion of the city parallel to Interstate 80, southwest to the city limits may become inundated
up to 8.2-feet within approximately five-hours of breaching. Furthermore if the Folsom Right Wing were to fail, a
portion of the floodwaters would follow the Cripple Creek channel resulting in inundation depths of up to 6.5-
feet.

10.3 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS REGULATORY SETTING
FEDERAL
Solid Waste Disposal Act/Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
The Solid Waste Disposal Act prohibits the disposal of nonhazardous liquids in hazardous waste landfills and
prohibits bulk or non-containerized hazardous liquid wastes from disposal in any landfill. New technological
standards were established by these laws for new landfills and surface impoundments.
House Resolution 2194
House Resolution (HR) 2194 requires federal facilities to comply with the (federal) Solid Waste Disposal Act.
This act allows states to issue civil and administrative orders and/or collect fines and penalties if a federal agency
violates hazardous waste laws. In addition, the law authorizes states to take criminal enforcement action against
an employee, officer, or agent of a federal facility for violating hazardous waste laws.
Underground Storage Tanks
In 1984, Congress amended the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to require registration of most
underground tanks and ban the installation of unprotected tanks. These amendments set federal technical
standards for all tanks, coordinate federal and state regulatory efforts, and provide for federal inspection and
enforcement. The law also established financial responsibility requirements for tank owners and operators to
cover costs of taking corrective action and to compensate third parties for injury and property damage caused by
leaking tanks.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund)
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 authorizes
the federal government to respond to spills and other releases (or threatened releases) of hazardous substances, as
well as to leaking hazardous waste dumps. A primary focus of the law is to identify and rehabilitate abandoned
hazardous waste sites. The law authorized the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to identify responsible
parties for the contamination of hazardous sites and allows the EPA to compel the parties to clean up the site.
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 amended CERCLA to accelerate the
cleanup, and to resolve questions of jurisdiction that arose through the CERCLA process.

Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act
Title II of SARA requires local emergency planning to cope with chemical emergencies and ensures that
responsible officials are provided with relevant information from local businesses about their activities involving
hazardous chemicals. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires companies to
provide information to local regulatory agencies, and provides for the protection of trade secrets.
Under Section 301, each state creates a State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), designates emergency
planning districts, and establishes local emergency planning committees (LEPCs). Committees are required to
work with facilities handling extremely hazardous substances to develop response procedures, evacuation plans,
and training programs.
Toxic Substances Control Act
The Toxic Substances Control Act authorizes EPA to screen existing and new chemicals used in manufacturing
and commerce to identify potentially dangerous products or uses that should be subject to federal control.
Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act
The Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act requires EPA to set standards for responding to the presence of
asbestos in schools. Standards are set at levels adequate to protect public health and the environment, and
appropriate response actions are identified that depend on the physical condition of asbestos. School District
representatives are required to inspect for asbestos-containing material and to develop and implement a plan to
manage any such material.
STATE
Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act
Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, was enacted as a ballot initiative in
November 1986. The Proposition was intended by its authors to protect California citizens and the State’s
drinking water sources from chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm, and to
inform residents about exposures to such chemicals. Proposition 65 requires the Governor to publish, at least
annually, a list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.
Toxic Release Contingency Plan
The Toxic Release Contingency Plan (California Government Code Section 8574.16) requires that regional and
local planning agencies incorporate within their planning the State’s effort to respond to emergency toxic releases,
and ensure the effective and efficient use of regional and local resources in the areas of traffic and crowd control,
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report

firefighting, hazardous materials response and cleanup, radio and communications control, and provision of
emergency medical services.
Hazardous Materials Release Response and Inventory Program
The Hazardous Materials Release Response and Inventory Program (California Health and Safety Code Sections
25500-25520) establishes business and area plans for the handling and release of hazardous materials. Basic
information on the location, type, quantity, and the health risks of hazardous materials handled, used, stored, or
disposed of in the state, which could be accidentally released into the environment, is tracked by the local
Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) within each region for the use and awareness of hazardous materials
responders, firefighters, emergency care providers, regulatory agencies and other interested persons.
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration Hazardous Substances Emergency
Response Training
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Hazardous Substances Emergency
Response Training is required for all workers involved with the handling, disposal or emergency response to
hazardous materials (Title 8, Sec 5192). Various training levels are required depending on organizational level
and responsibility level.
REGIONAL/LOCAL
Certified Unified Program Agency
The Environmental Compliance Division of the Sacramento County Environmental Management Department
(EMD) has been designated by the California EPA as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) for the City
of Citrus Heights. As CUPA, the Environmental Compliance Division is responsible for:
►    Underground Storage of hazardous substances
►    Hazardous Materials Business Plan requirements
►    Hazardous Waste Generator requirements

(See Table 10-3).
The EMD is responsible for the inventory, monitoring, and regulation of hazardous sites in the City of Citrus
Heights. Based on the June 2009 EMD inventory, approximately 22 parcels have some level of toxic materials
onsite (See Table 10-3). The majority of these sites are affected by petroleum (i.e., gas, oil, or diesel) spills and/or
leaks. Some sites have been remediated, some are monitored, and others require remediation.

Since the eight airports within the region are located outside the city limits, the City has little control over the
operations of the airports. Flight paths from these airports often cross over the City, however, most flight
operations are at high elevations posing minimal safety hazards.

10.5 FLOODING
FLOODING REGULATORY SETTING
FEDERAL
Federal Emergency Management Agency
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administers the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
to provide subsidized flood insurance to communities that comply with FEMA regulations that limit development
in floodplains. FEMA also issues Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) that identify which land areas are subject
to flooding. These maps provide flood information and identify flood hazard zones in the community. The design
standard for flood protection covered by the FIRMs is established by FEMA, with the minimum level of flood
protection for new development determined to be the 1-in-100 annual exceedance probability (AEP) (i.e., the 100-
year flood event). As developments are proposed and constructed FEMA is also responsible for issuing revisions
to FIRMs, such as Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR) and Letters of Map Revision (LOMR) through
the local agencies that work with the NFIP.
Executive Order 11988
Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) addresses floodplain issues related to public safety,
conservation, and economics. It generally requires federal agencies constructing, permitting, or funding a project
in a floodplain to do the following:
►    avoid incompatible floodplain development,
►    be consistent with the standards and criteria of the NFIP, and
                                                                                         General Plan Background Report

►    restore and preserve natural and beneficial floodplain values.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is responsible for issuing permits for the placement of fill or
discharge of material into waters of the United States. These permits are required under Sections 401 and 404 of
the Clean Water Act. Water supply projects that involve in-stream construction, such as dams or other types of
diversion structures, trigger the need for these permits and related environmental reviews by USACE. USACE
also is responsible for flood control planning and assisting State and local agencies with the design and funding of
local flood control projects.
STATE
California Department of Water Resources
The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) is responsible for preparation of the California Water
Plan, management of the State Water Project (SWP), regulation of dams, provision of flood protection, and other
functions related to surface water and groundwater resources. These other functions include helping water
agencies prepare their Urban Water Management Plans (UWMPs).
Central Valley Flood Protection Plan
The Central Valley Flood Protection Plan (CVFPP) is a part of the Central Valley Flood Management Planning
(CVFMP) Program that is intended to be a sustainable, integrated flood management plan for the Central Valley.
The CVFPP will describe existing flood risks in the Central Valley and recommend actions to remove the risks of
future flooding, lessen the consequences in the event that a flooding event occurs, and provide recommendations
for improvements to the State and federal flood protection systems. DWR is in the process of preparing the
CVFPP, and is required to adopt it by January 1, 2012, with regular updates to the plan occurring every five years.
Assembly Bill 162
Assembly Bill (AB) 162 was signed into law by Governor Schwarzenegger in October 2007 and requires each
city and county located within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Drainage District to submit draft safety elements of
their general plans and amendments to their safety elements to the Central Valley Flood Protection Board
(CVFPB) for review and comment. This requirement went into effect on January 1, 2009.

Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency
The Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (SAFCA) is a Joint Powers Agency formed in 1989 by the City of
Sacramento, County of Sacramento, Sutter County, the American River Flood Control District, and Reclamation

District 1000. SAFCA is tasked with addressing deficiencies in flood control in the Sacramento area. SAFCA
leads flood control improvement projects to provide a minimum of 100-year level flood protection immediately
with the intention of eventually achieving 200-year level protection.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
Flooding is defined as an overflowing of normally dry land, often after heavy rain. When the capacities of streams
and storm drainage facilities are exceeded, flooding often occurs. Arcade and Cripple Creeks have relatively small
hydrologic capacity and can be quickly overwhelmed during severe storm runoff events resulting in the
overflowing of stream channel banks and the temporary inundation of floodplains and connected low lying areas.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maintains flood maps (flood insurance rate maps
[FIRMs]) on which the 100-year floodplain of significant drainages are identified. The 100-year floodplain is
used to identify unacceptable safety hazards and indicates the geographic area having a one percent chance of
being flooded in any given year. Citrus Heights (Sacramento County) FIRM panels 80, 85, 90, 95, and 105
(Community # 060262) identify the 100-year floodplains for the streams in the planning area (FEMA 1998).
Approximate boundaries of flood hazard areas (100-year floodplains) for the Citrus Heights area are shown on
Figure 10-2.
Development (structures, bridges, fill) within the 100-year floodplain is evaluated to ensure consistency with the
restrictions of the Zoning Code. Development within a floodplain could increase the flood hazard to adjacent
properties by raising upstream floodplain elevations and/or increasing downstream flow and water velocities. A
raised upstream floodplain can occur with downstream displacement of flood storage, which occurs when a
floodplain is filled. Such floodplain disturbance can result in a constriction in the natural flow of water which
increases the speed of water traveling downstream. The Citrus Heights Zoning Code prohibits new construction
within the 100-year floodplain except for fences. The Zoning Code also includes minimum creek setbacks for
development adjacent to creeks. For existing properties that are entirely in the floodplain and comply with the
City’s Drainage and Development Policy, development may occur, provided that each structure is designed to
have the habitable finished floor elevation a minimum of two feet above the 100-year floodplain.
The City Engineering Division maintains a citywide list of past chronic flooding within the City. This list includes
flood complaints registered with the Engineering Department using data from the past several years. Figure 10-
1depicts the FEMA 100 year floodplain as well as known ponding and street flooding locations in the City.

FLOOD CONTROL/MANAGEMENT
The City of Citrus Heights is provided flood control and management services from the Sacramento County
Water Agency (SCWA). The SCWA, through its efforts at managing the flood control system under its
jurisdiction, has created three Zones, which the City is covered under. These Zones include Zone 11, Zone 12, and
Zone 13.
Zone 11 is a drainage fee zone formed to provide funding for the construction of drainage facilities in Sacramento
County. Fees are collected through Zone 11 from new development. Zone 12, now a separate utility, provides
storm drain maintenance and improvements for Sacramento County, such as channel clearing and servicing
pumping plants. Zone 13, an assessment district, provides funding for flood control and water supply planning,
groundwater studies, and FEMA programs. Zone 13 collects fees from benefiting parties.
In 2010 the City will no longer contract with Sacramento County for the operations and maintenance of drainage
facilities. The City will contract with private contractors to provide these services.
10.6 EMERGENCY OPERATIONS
The Sacramento County Emergency Operations Plan addresses the County’s planned response to extraordinary
emergency situations associated with natural disasters, technological incidents and national security emergencies
in or affecting Sacramento County, including acts of terrorism. This plan does not apply to normal day-to-day
emergencies or the established departmental procedures used to cope with such emergencies. Rather, this plan
focuses on operational concepts relative to large-scale disasters which can pose major threats to life, property and
the environment requiring unusual emergency responses.
Emergencies that Sacramento County and Citrus Heights may face include:
NATURAL HAZARDS
►    Severe Weather
►    Flood
►    Earthquake
►    Wildland fire
►    Drought
►    Freeze

CITY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER
The City recently completed construction of a new 29,173 square foot Community Center. A major component of
this new state of the art facility is the ability to provide the Citrus Heights community with an emergency
operations/evacuation center (EOC) in case of an actual emergency event. The actual evacuation center is over
11,000 square feet and the emergency operations center is over 1,000 square feet. These two areas, along with
some additional components within the building, will be able to function as a fully equipped emergency
operations command center as well as a shelter in case of emergency, natural disaster or other event of
unprecedented status.
The building is outfitted with an emergency power backup generator to provide the necessary electricity to
maintain two-thirds of the building. The 900-gallon diesel tank will run for 72 hours without interruption before
requiring refueling. The main hall, the EOC Command rooms, the kitchen, and restrooms are all set up for
emergency power. The building feeds directly into the Citrus Heights Police Department which also has an
emergency backup power supply and is linked into the 911 Dispatch center for the City. The EOC is wireless and
equipped to handle additional emergency phone lines as well as multiple computers and equipment at a moment’s
notice.
CITY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN
The City is currently in the process of finalizing the Citrus Heights Emergency Operations Plan. This plan will
guide the City in the event of an emergency within the City Limits. The City envisions adopting the plan in the
fall of 2010.

11.1 INTRODUCTION
This background report creates a foundation for updating the goals, policies, and programs of the noise section of
the Community Health Chapter of the City of Citrus Heights General Plan. The Community Health Chapter
provides a basis for comprehensive local policies to control and abate environmental noise and to protect the
residents of Citrus Heights from excessive noise exposure.
Unregulated noise can cause stress and strain on the general well-being of the City’s residents. With proper
planning, mitigation, and cooperation, unwanted noise can be managed to preserve the overall well-being of
people within the City.
The City’s responsibility is to “analyze and quantify” noise levels and the extent of noise exposure through actual
measurement and/or modeling. To do this, technical data relating to mobile and point sources must be collected,
synthesized, and mapped. These data are used to develop a set of noise control policies and programs that
minimizes incompatible land use and serves as a basis for land use decisions. The element must include
implementation measures and possible solutions to existing and foreseeable noise problems. Furthermore, the
policies and standards must be sufficient to serve as a guideline for compliance with control requirements for
sound transmission and directly correlate to the land use, circulation, and housing elements.
The noise section of the Community Health Chapter is used to guide decisions concerning land use and the
location of new roads and transit facilities since these are common sources of excessive noise levels. Noise levels
from existing land uses, including commercial and light industrial activities, must be closely analyzed to ensure
compatibility.
11.2 REGULATORY SETTING
Various private and public agencies have established noise guidelines and standards to protect people from
potential hearing damage and other adverse physiological and social effects associated with noise. The following
federal, state, and local regulations discussed below are applicable to the proposed project regarding noise and
vibration standards.
FEDERAL
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Office of Noise Abatement and Control was originally
established to coordinate federal noise control activities. After its inception, EPA’s Office of Noise Abatement
and Control issued the Federal Noise Control Act of 1972, establishing programs and guidelines to identify and
address the effects of noise on public health, welfare, and the environment. In 1981, EPA administrators
determined that subjective issues such as noise would be better addressed at lower levels of government.
General Plan Background Report
City of Citrus Heights                                    11-1                                                  Noise

Consequently, in 1982 responsibilities for regulating noise control policies were transferred to state and local
governments. However, noise control guidelines and regulations contained in EPA rulings in prior years remain in
place by designated federal agencies, allowing more individualized control for specific issues by designated
federal, state, and local government agencies.
STATE
The State of California has adopted noise standards in areas of regulation not preempted by the federal
government. State standards regulate noise levels of motor vehicles, sound transmission through buildings,
occupational noise control, and noise insulation.
Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, also known as the California Building Standards Code, establishes
building standards applicable to all occupancies throughout the state. The code provides acoustical regulations for
both exterior-to-interior sound insulation as well as sound isolation between adjacent spaces of various occupied
units. Title 24 regulations state that interior noise levels generated by exterior noise sources shall not exceed
45 dB Ldn, with windows closed, in any habitable room for general residential uses.
Though not adopted by law, the State of California General Plan Guidelines 2003, published by the California
Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR), provides guidance for the compatibility of projects within
areas of specific noise exposure. Table 11-1 presents acceptable and unacceptable community noise exposure
limits for various land use categories. These guidelines also present adjustment factors that may be used to arrive
at noise acceptability standards that reflect the noise control goals of the community, the particular community’s
sensitivity to noise, and the community’s assessment of the relative importance of noise pollution.
REGIONAL/LOCAL
CITRUS HEIGHTS GENERAL PLAN
The City of Citrus Heights General Plan Noise Element establishes acceptable noise levels for proposed
development projects (Table 11-2). If it appears that a proposed project may exceed the limits established in
Table 11-2, an acoustical analysis is required to identify potential noise levels and attenuation measures.
The General Plan also requires that new residential development projects be designed and constructed to meet
acceptable exterior noise level standards, as follows:

AIRPORT NOISE REGULATIONS
Airports that are either public or serve a scheduled airline are required to have a comprehensive land use plan
(CLUP) prepared by the airport land use commission (ALUC). The purpose of ALUC is to:
►    Protect public health, safety, and welfare through the adoption of land use standards that minimize the
     public’s exposure to safety hazards and excessive levels of noise.
►    Prevent the encroachment of incompatible land uses around public-use airports, thereby preserving the utility
     of these airports into the future.

The adoption and implementation of a CLUP embodies the land use compatibility guidelines for height, noise,
and safety. The Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) is the ALUC for Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo,
and Yuba Counties.
11.3 ACOUSTIC FUNDAMENTALS
Acoustics is the scientific study that evaluates perception, propagation, absorption, and reflection of sound waves.
Sound is a mechanical form of radiant energy, transmitted by a pressure wave through a solid, liquid, or gaseous
medium. Sound that is loud, disagreeable, unexpected, or unwanted is generally defined as noise; consequently,
the perception of sound is subjective in nature, and can vary substantially from person to person. Common sources
of environmental noise and noise levels are presented in Figure 11-1.
A sound wave is initiated in a medium by a vibrating object (e.g., vocal chords, the string of a guitar, the
diaphragm of a radio speaker). The wave consists of minute variations in pressure, oscillating above and below
the ambient atmospheric pressure. The number of pressure variation cycles occurring per second is referred to as
the frequency of the sound wave and is expressed in hertz (Hz), which is equivalent to one complete cycle per
second.
Directly measuring sound pressure fluctuations would require the use of a very large and cumbersome range of
numbers. To avoid this, and have a more useable numbering system, the decibel (dB) scale was introduced.
A sound level expressed in decibels is the logarithmic ratio of two like pressure quantities, with one pressure
quantity being a reference sound pressure. For sound pressure in air, the standard reference quantity is generally
considered to be 20 micropascals, which directly corresponds to the threshold of human hearing. The use of the
decibel is a convenient way to handle the million-fold range of sound pressures to which the human ear is
sensitive. A decibel is logarithmic; it does not follow normal algebraic methods and cannot be directly added.
For example, a 65 dB source of sound, such as a truck, when joined by another 65 dB source results in a sound
amplitude of 68 dB, not 130 dB (i.e., doubling the source strength increases the sound pressure by 3 dB). A sound
level increase of 10 dB corresponds to 10 times the acoustical energy, and an increase of 20 dB equates to a
100 fold increase in acoustical energy.
The loudness of sound perceived by the human ear depends primarily on the overall sound pressure level and
frequency content of the sound source. The human ear is not equally sensitive to loudness at all frequencies in the
audible spectrum. To better relate overall sound levels and loudness to human perception, frequency-dependent
weighting networks were developed. The standard weighting networks are identified as A through E. There is a
strong correlation between the way humans perceive sound and A-weighted sound levels (dBA). For this reason
the dBA can be used to predict community response to noise from the environment, including noise from

transportation and stationary sources. Sound levels expressed as dB in this section are A-weighted sound levels,
unless noted otherwise.
Noise can be generated by a number of sources, including mobile sources (transportation noise sources) such as
automobiles, trucks, and airplanes and stationary sources (non-transportation noise sources) such as construction
sites, machinery, and commercial and industrial operations. As acoustic energy spreads through the atmosphere
from the source to the receiver, noise levels attenuate (decrease) depending on ground absorption characteristics,
atmospheric conditions, and the presence of physical barriers (e.g., walls, building façades, berms). Noise
generated from mobile sources generally attenuate at a rate of 4.5 dB per doubling of distance. Stationary noise
sources spread with more spherical dispersion patterns that attenuate at a rate of 6 to 7.5 dB per doubling of
distance.
Atmospheric conditions such as wind speed, turbulence, temperature gradients, and humidity may additionally
alter the propagation of noise and affect levels at a receiver. Furthermore, the presence of a large object
(e.g., barrier, topographic features, and intervening building façades) between the source and the receptor can
provide significant attenuation of noise levels at the receiver. The amount of noise level reduction or “shielding”
provided by a barrier primarily depends on the size of the barrier, the location of the barrier in relation to the
source and receivers, and the frequency spectra of the noise. Natural barriers such as berms, hills, or dense woods,
and human-made features such as buildings and walls may be used as noise barriers.
NOISE DESCRIPTORS
The intensity of environmental noise fluctuates over time, and several different descriptors of time-averaged noise
levels are used. The selection of a proper noise descriptor for a specific source depends on the spatial and
temporal distribution, duration, and fluctuation of both the noise source and the environment. The noise
descriptors most often used to describe environmental noise are defined below.
Lmax (Maximum Noise Level): The highest A/B/C weighted integrated noise level occurring during a specific
period of time.
Lmin (Minimum Noise Level): The lowest A/B/C weighted integrated noise level during a specific period of time.
Peak: The highest weighted or unweighted instantaneous peak-to-peak value occurring during a measurement
period.
Ln (Statistical Descriptor): The noise level exceeded n% of a specific period of time, generally accepted as an
hourly statistic. An L10 would be the noise level exceeded during 10% of the measurement period.
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report

Leq (Equivalent Noise Level): The energy mean (average) noise level. The steady-state sound level that, in a
specified period of time, contains the same acoustical energy as a varying sound level over the same time period.
Ldn (Day-Night Noise Level): The 24-hour Leq with a 10-dB “penalty” applied during nighttime noise-sensitive
hours, 10 p.m. through 7 a.m. The Ldn attempts to account for the fact that noise during this specific period of time
is a potential source of disturbance with respect to normal sleeping hours.
CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level): Similar to the Ldn described above, but with an additional 5-dB
“penalty” for the noise-sensitive hours between 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., which are typically reserved for relaxation,
conversation, reading, and other similar activities. If the same 24-hour noise data are used, the CNEL is typically
0.5 dB higher than the Ldn.
SEL (Sound Exposure Level): The cumulative exposure to sound energy over a stated period of time.
EFFECTS OF NOISE ON HUMANS
Excessive and chronic exposure to elevated noise levels can result in auditory and non-auditory effects on
humans. Auditory effects of noise on people are those related to temporary or permanent hearing loss caused by
loud noises. Non-auditory effects of exposure to elevated noise levels are those related to behavioral and
physiological effects. The non-auditory behavioral effects of noise on humans are associated primarily with the
subjective effects of annoyance, nuisance, and dissatisfaction, which lead to interference with activities such as
communications, sleep, and learning. The non-auditory physiological health effects of noise on humans have been
the subject of considerable research attempting to discover correlations between exposure to elevated noise levels
and health problems, such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The mass of research infers that noise-
related health issues are predominantly the result of behavioral stressors and not a direct noise-induced response.
The extent to which noise contributes to non-auditory health effects remains a subject of considerable research,
with no definitive conclusions.
The degree to which noise results in annoyance and interference is highly subjective and may be influenced by
several non-acoustic factors. The number and effect of these non-acoustic environmental and physical factors vary
depending on individual characteristics of the noise environment such as sensitivity, level of activity, location,
time of day, and length of exposure. One key aspect in the prediction of human response to new noise
environments is the individual level of adaptation to an existing noise environment. The greater the change in the
noise levels that are attributed to a new noise source, relative to the environment an individual has become
accustomed to, the less tolerable the new noise source will be.
With respect to how humans perceive and react to changes in noise levels, a 1dB increase is imperceptible, a 3 dB
increase is barely perceptible, a 6 dB increase is clearly noticeable, and a 10-dB increase is subjectively perceived

as approximately twice as loud (Egan 1988). These subjective reactions to changes in noise levels was developed
on the basis of test subjects’ reactions to changes in the levels of steady-state pure tones or broad-band noise and
to changes in levels of a given noise source. It is probably most applicable to noise levels in the range of 50 to 70
dB, as this is the usual range of voice and interior noise levels. For these reasons, a noise level increase of 3 dB or
more is typically considered substantial in terms of the degradation of the existing noise environment.
VIBRATION
Vibration is the periodic oscillation of a medium or object with respect to a given reference point. Sources of
vibration include natural phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, sea waves, landslides) and those
introduced by human activity (e.g., explosions, machinery, traffic, trains, construction equipment). Vibration
sources may be continuous, (e.g., operating factory machinery or transient in nature, explosions). Vibration levels
can be depicted in terms of amplitude and frequency, relative to displacement, velocity, or acceleration.
Vibration amplitudes are commonly expressed in peak particle velocity (PPV) or root-mean-square (RMS)
vibration velocity. PPV is defined as the maximum instantaneous positive or negative peak of a vibration signal.
PPV is typically used in the monitoring of transient and impact vibration and has been found to correlate well to
the stresses experienced by buildings (Federal Transit Administration [FTA] 2006: 7-1 – 7-8, California
Department of Transportation [Caltrans] 2004: 5-7). PPV and RMS vibration velocity are normally described in
inches per second (in/sec).
Although PPV is appropriate for evaluating the potential for building damage, it is not always suitable for
evaluating human response. The response of the human body to vibration relates well to average vibration
amplitude; therefore, vibration effects on humans are evaluated in terms of RMS vibration velocity. Similar to
airborne sound, vibration velocity can be expressed in decibel notation as vibration decibels (VdB). The
logarithmic nature of the decibel serves to compress the broad range of numbers required to describe vibration.
Typical outdoor sources of perceptible groundborne vibration include construction equipment, steel-wheeled
trains, and traffic on rough roads. Although the effects of vibration may be imperceptible at low levels, effects
may result in detectable vibrations and slight damage to nearby structures at moderate and high levels,
respectively. At the highest levels of vibration, damage to structures is primarily architectural (e.g., loosening and
cracking of plaster or stucco coatings) and rarely results in damage to structural components. The range of
vibration that is relevant to this analysis occurs from approximately 50 VdB, which is the typical background
vibration-velocity level, to 100 VdB, which is the general threshold where minor damage can occur in fragile
buildings (FTA 2006:8-1 – 8-8).

ROADWAY TRAFFIC SOURCE NOISE
Traffic noise is the dominant noise source in the City and is influenced by Interstate 80 (I-80) and major roads
such as Greenback Lane, Sunrise Boulevard, Antelope Road, Auburn/Old Auburn, San Juan Avenue, and Sylvan
Road. Existing vehicle traffic noise levels in the planning area were modeled using the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (FHWA-RD-77-108) and traffic data provided
by the project traffic consultant. The FHWA model is based on CALVENO reference noise factors for
automobiles, medium trucks, and heavy trucks, with consideration given to vehicle volume, speed, roadway
configuration, distance to the receptor, and ground attenuation factors.
Table 11-3 summarizes the modeled traffic noise levels, provides noise levels at 100 feet from the centerline of
each major roadway within the planning area, and lists distances from the roadway centerlines to the 60 dB,
65 dB, and 70 dB Ldn traffic noise contours. Figure 11-2 shows the traffic noise contours for roadways within the
City. These traffic noise modeling results are based on existing average daily traffic (ADT) volumes. As shown in
Table 11-3, the location of the 60 dB Ldn contour ranges from 30 to 1,603 feet from the centerline of the modeled
roadways. The extent to which existing land uses in the planning area are affected by existing traffic noise
depends on their respective proximity to the roadways and their individual sensitivity to noise.
NOISE WALLS AND BARRIERS
Roadway noise is significantly influenced by intervening noise walls and barriers. Noise walls, constructed of
heavy dense material can attenuate roadway noise to varying degrees of efficiency dependent upon noise wall
location and design. In the simplest terms, an effective noise barrier must break line-of-sight between the noise
source (roadway) and noise receiver (residence). If line-of-sight is broken, the intervening noise wall can provide
a fair amount of attenuation, on the order typically ranging from 5 to 15 dB. Noise walls in the Citrus Heights
range from approximately 6 feet to 10 feet in height. All are of masonry construction; those of short length likely
provide limited acoustical benefit only to those residences situated immediately behind the wall.
Noise barriers, including earthen berms, intervening structures (homes or office buildings), raised or depressed
topography can provide substantial attenuation. Again, the degree to which these line-of-sight breaking barriers
may attenuate noise largely depends on barrier orientation and design.
RAILROAD TRAFFIC SOURCE NOISE
A railroad switching yard is located near the northwest portion of the City adjacent to Roseville Road. An
intervening open space of loose soil and grasses lies between the switching yard and Roseville Road. Switching
yard activities are audible only when there is not continuous vehicle traffic along Roseville Road. Roseville Road
traffic noise is the dominant noise source in this portion of the City.

AIRCRAFT FLYOVER NOISE
Two airports are located in the vicinity of the City of Citrus Heights. McClellan Park is located approximately
4 miles west of the City’s western boundary and Sacramento Mather Air Base is located approximately 7 miles to
the south of the City’s southern boundary. McClellan Park is a converted air force base that now serves industrial,
manufacturing and office uses with hotel accommodations, parks and other facilities on site. McClellan Park
maintains an active airfield on the premises and the 60 dB CNEL noise contour is located approximately 3.5 miles
from the nearest City boundary (Sacramento County Airport System 2005). Sacramento Mather Airport is a
converted air force base that now serves warehouse, air cargo sorting facilities, hangar space, and office uses.
Mather Airport maintains an active airfield on the premises and the 60 dB CNEL noise contour is located
approximately 5 miles from the nearest City boundary (Sacramento County Department of Airports 2003).
STATIONARY SOURCE NOISE
No large stationary sources of noise exist in the Citrus Heights area. The City does include commercial corridors
and some areas of light industrial uses. The Sunrise Mall and Market at Birdcage are located at the intersection of
Sunrise Boulevard and Greenback Lane. There are also large box stores (Sam’s Club and Ross Dress for Less)
located at the intersection of Greenback Lane and San Juan Avenue and a Wal-Mart Supercenter/Costco located
south of Auburn Boulevard west of Sylvan Road. Several smaller commercial centers are located along most main
roads in Citrus Heights. Noise sources associated with these uses include rooftop heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning units, parking lot movements and loading dock activities. A small pocket of light industrial uses are
located along Auburn Boulevard south of Greenback Lane.
COMMUNITY NOISE SURVEY
In Citrus Heights, the primary noise source is vehicle traffic. Ambient noise levels in the area are influenced by
traffic on I-80 and major roads such as Greenback Lane, Sunrise Boulevard, Antelope Road, Auburn/Old Auburn,
San Juan Avenue, and Sylvan Road. A community noise survey was conducted to document existing ambient
noise within noise-sensitive communities. Noise-sensitive receptors were defined as residential land uses,
churches, theaters, and schools.
A community noise survey was conducted on November 11 through November 19, 2009, to document the
existing noise environment at noise-sensitive receptors within the City and existing noise sources. The dominant
noise source identified during the ambient noise survey was traffic from the local area roadway network.
Measurements of noise levels were taken in accordance with ANSI standards at 10 locations using a Larson Davis
Laboratories (LDL) Model 820 precision integrating sound-level meter. Continuous 24-hour, long-term
monitoring of noise levels was conducted at six locations within the City using an LDL Model 820 sound-level
meter. The sound-level meters were calibrated before and after use with an LDL Model CAL200 acoustical
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report

calibrator to ensure that the measurements would be accurate. The equipment used meets all pertinent
specifications of the ANSI for Type 1 sound-level meters (ANSI S1.4-1983[R2006]).
Community noise survey locations are shown in Figure 11-2. The Leq, Lmax, L10, L50, and L90 values were taken at
each short-term ambient noise measurement location presented in Table 11-4. During the survey, average daytime
ambient noise levels ranged from 51.6 dB to 72.0 dB Leq, with maximum noise levels that ranged from 62.5 dB to
82.4 dB Lmax.

NOISE-SENSITIVE LAND USES
Noise-sensitive land uses are generally considered to include those uses where noise exposure could result in
health-related risks to individuals, as well as places where quiet is an essential element of their intended purpose.
Residential dwellings are of primary concern given the potential for increased and prolonged exposure of
individuals to both interior and exterior noise levels. Additional land uses such as parks, historic sites, cemeteries,
and recreation areas are also considered sensitive to exterior noise levels. Schools, places of worship, hotels,
libraries, nursing homes, retirement residences, and other places, where low interior noise levels are essential, are
also considered noise-sensitive land uses. The majority of noise sensitive land uses within the planning area are
residential. There are 34 learning centers including high schools, a middle school, elementary schools, and private
schools with the planning area. There are approximately 40 places of worship and two cemeteries one cemetery
within the planning area.

   (As adopted and certified in 2000, updated for the 2002–2007, 2006–2013, and 2013 - 2021 planning period)
2.1        INTRODUCTION
This chapter provides information relative to the population and housing characteristics of the City of Citrus
Heights. State Law requires all California communities to prepare a “Housing Element”. This law also outlines
specific types of analyses and processes that must be followed in the development of the plan. The data and
analysis contained in this section coupled with the goals, polices and action steps of the General Plan comprise the
City of Citrus Heights’ Housing Element.
Until 2008, the state required that localities update the housing goals and programs of their general plans to reflect
changes in the locality every five years. The City of Citrus Heights adopted its first General Plan on November
15, 2000, including the city’s housing goals and programs. The city updated the Housing Element in 2002 for the
2002–2007 planning cycle and in 2008 for the 2008-2013 cycle. The City also implemented a focused General
Plan Update in 2011, however, the Housing portion of the General Plan was not updated.
In 2008, the state adopted Senate Bill SB375, which is intended to achieve consistency between land use patterns
and transportation funding. SB375 has extended the duration of housing elements from 5-year to 8-years in order
to align them with Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) adoption. The city is now getting “on-cycle” with the
state housing plan eight year calendar by updating the Element for the 2013–2021 state housing planning period.
The updated plan reflects the new housing needs projected by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments
(SACOG), the available population and housing data from the 2010 U.S. decennial census, and current state and
local projections. The update of the housing element also evaluates the City’s goals, policies, and programs with
regard to their ability to meet the housing needs of all segments of the community. Changes are made as
appropriate given the background information presented, and in light of the effectiveness of the policies and
programs.
2.2        USE OF RELEVANT AND CURRENT DATA
To properly understand housing, a complete review and analysis of the community’s population characteristics
and housing stock must be performed. An attempt has been made to use the most current socio-economic and
building data available in this Section. The primary sources of data for the 2013 General Plan were the U.S.
Decennial Census, State Department of Finance, Claritas, DataQuick, and the City Building Department. Claritas
and DataQuick are nationally recognized demographic data providers.
General Plan Background Report
City of Citrus Heights                                     2-1                                   Population and Housing

To update the plan, additional sources were consulted including the Sacramento Area Council of Governments
(SACOG), RealFacts, the California Association of Realtors, the Sacramento Association of Realtors, and other
sources as noted.
2.3       CONSISTENCY BETWEEN GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
Consistency among the Chapters of the General Plan is required by State law. The goals, policies, and policy
actions contained within the housing section should be interpreted and implemented consistent with the goals and
policies of the rest of the General Plan. The City’s General Plan is a “stand-alone” integrated policy document,
and a separate background volume with chapters related to each element of the General Plan elements, opposed to
segregating elements into individual chapters, which aids in ensuring consistency. To make certain that the
contents of the 2013-2021 housing section maintain consistency, a consistency analysis of the entire document
was conducted.
The City will strive to ensure consistency between the housing section and other General Plan sections so that
new policies remain consistent with all other policies. Currently, the housing section does not propose significant
changes to any other section of the General Plan. Nevertheless, if it becomes evident that over time changes to
any element are needed for internal consistency, such changes will be proposed for consideration by the Planning
Commission and City Council.
2.4       PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Citrus Heights adopted its first General Plan, including the Housing Element, in 2000. To update the General Plan
for the 2002–2007, 2006–2013, and 2013-2021 housing planning periods, the City consulted local housing
advocates, developers of affordable housing, local service providers, neighborhood associations, and the
community at large. The City requested they identify elements of the housing section, and the City’s housing
goals that would require updating as the result of significant changes in the locality. The City has taken
extraordinary efforts to involve the public in the update. The City held a public meeting to receive input from the
public and housing advocates on the previous version of the Housing Element, and a Public meeting to review the
Draft updates and answer questions prior to holding a Planning Commission meeting. Public hearings will be
conducted before the City Planning Commission and City Council. The notices for these meetings and hearings
will be published in a local newspaper, , prominently posted at City Hall, on the City web site, and at other public
facilities. These notices will be printed in a manner to optimize public participation. The updated Background
Report and General Plan documents will be circulated to various service providers, non-profit organizations and
housing advocates throughout the area and available on the City Website and at City Hall for review. The City
also provided information to REACH, the Neighborhood Associations, and created an
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report

“e-notifier” to allow interested parties to receive email updates as the project progressed or new information
became available.
2.5        BACKGROUND AND HISTORY
In 2008, the City of Citrus Heights updated its General Plan Housing Element. The 2008 plan was certified to
comply with State housing law on January 6, 2009 by the California State Department of Housing and
Community Development.
2.6        CURRENT UPDATE
The City has reviewed the Goals and Policies of the existing Housing Element, any demographic or economic
changes since 2008, and revised the background report based on these changes. The City met with stakeholders
and housing advocates to review these changes as well as evaluate the progress of the 2008 Housing Element in
2013.
The City met with housing advocates and members of the public and concerns included:
►    This portion will be updated based on the Public Input received.
2.7        STATE MANDATE
In August 2012, City staff met with State of California Housing and Community Development Department
(HCD) staff to discuss the expectations the department has for the City’s 2013 revision. City and HCD staff
agreed that the element has performed successfully since the last update and that a full revision is not necessary.
State law mandates that the City evaluate its general plan housing goals, objectives, programs, and activities to
include comment on:
►    the “effectiveness of the element,” meaning a review of their results;
►    the “progress in implementation,” meaning an analysis of the actual versus planned achievements; and
►    the “appropriateness of the goals, objectives, and policies,” meaning how they might be altered to reflect
     lessons learned in their implementation or changing conditions in the City.
2.8        FACTORS FOR DEVELOPING HOUSING STRATEGIES
The City of Citrus Heights Consolidated Plan for 2010 to 2014 has set forth an Affordable Housing Plan that
includes a list of factors for developing housing priorities and a set of appropriate strategies. This update presents
General Plan Background Report
City of Citrus Heights                                     2-3                                     Population and Housing

information contained in that plan and includes discussion that confirms these conditions or identifies conditions
that have changed, and revises priorities and strategies where appropriate.
Factors on Developing Housing Strategies:
►    The 2010 – 2014 Consolidated Plan outlines the need to enhance the quality and safety of existing housing
     stock through the City’s housing repair program and other strategies. This Housing Element update confirms
     the need.
►    It is anticipated that most low-income households would benefit from assistance with down-payment and
     closing costs. It is often difficult for low income families to save sufficient funds for a down-payment and
     cover everyday living costs at the same time. This Housing Element update confirms the need.
►    Less than 3% of the City’s current housing stock was constructed in the last 10 years. This update confirms
     the City’s built out nature.
►    About 23% of renters and 25% of owners pay more than 30% of their income for shelter (rent or house
     payment plus utilities).
►    Two percent of all owner households and ten percent of all renter households in the City are considered
     overcrowded (more than 1.01 persons per room).
►    Funding for new affordable housing construction at both the state and federal level has been severely
     curtailed.
►    There are some neighborhoods in decline (such as Sayonara Drive) which would benefit from public facility
     improvement and housing rehabilitation funds.
►    It is estimated that median home prices have fallen 50% from the peak in 2005, which has substantially
     increased affordability, particularly coupled with record low interest rates, however extremely low-income
     and low-income residents continue to struggle with finding affordable housing.
►    In 2009, when the Consolidated Plan was prepared, the City was experiencing an extremely high rate of
     foreclosures and bank-owned homes. While the City is experiencing fewer foreclosures currently, there still
     are many bank-owned homes in the housing market.
2.9       HOUSING RESOURCES
The City has the following continuing programs that support the City’s housing goals and objectives:
                                                                                             General Plan Background Report
Population and Housing                                      2-4                                         City of Citrus Heights

►    Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement funds received annually through the
     federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): Typically a portion of these funds are set
     aside annually for the City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program. This program assists low-income and very-
     low-income households with health and safety repairs. Activities under this program include:
     •     Owner-occupied Housing Rehabilitation Loans=: low and no interest loans of up to $60,000 made to
           owner-occupant households for essential home repairs.
     •     Mobile Home Repair Loans: low and no interest loans of up to $10,000 made to mobile home and
           manufactured home owner-occupant households for essential home repairs.
     •     Accessibility Grants: grants up to $5,000 to households with a permanently disabled member to adapt
           owner-occupied or rental housing for the mobility and safety needs of the disabled. (Note: this grant may
           be combined with other programs and is predominantly utilized by the City’s senior population.)
►    HOME funds received through the Sacramento HOME Consortium: The City is a member of the
     Sacramento HOME Consortium with the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency. Through this
     agreement, the City receives a “fair share” of federal HOME (Housing Investment Partnership Program)
     funds that are allocated to Sacramento County as an urban county. These funds are directed to be used for
     first-time home buyer assistance in the City of Citrus Heights.
►    CDBG Entitlement funds received annually through HUD and City General Revenue Funds for fair
     housing services: The Citrus Heights Fair Housing Program seeks to educate and inform residents of the
     regional resources available to them in regard to housing, disability and employment discrimination services.
     The City primarily does this through its fair housing fliers, the Web site www.chfairhousing.net and its free
     educational forums for tenants, landlords and those who have been victim to predatory or discriminatory
     lending tactics. The City contracts with Sacramento Self Help Housing to provide mediation and counseling
     for those with a landlord tenant dispute.
►    Code Enforcement Program: Citrus Heights is dedicated toward neighborhood preservation through
     housing, nuisance, and zoning code enforcement with the goal of reducing blight; preserving the housing
     stock; and ensuring a safe, healthy, and decent place to live. The City continues to expand this program and
     has established several initiatives:
     •     itinerant vending ordinance
     •     abandoned vehicle abatement

    •    public education campaigns (major automotive repair, junk and rubbish)
    •    administrative hearings to resolve stubborn cases
    •    “team” enforcement with police, public works, planning, animal control, youth conservation corps, the
         parks district, and the fire district.
    •    weed abatement authority
    •    cost recovery through liens against real property
    •    the removal of illegal postings using community volunteers
    •    the masking of graffiti by providing free paint
    •    property “receivership” for nuisance properties
►   Low Income Housing Mitigation Fee: Citrus Heights assesses fees on non-residential building permits for
    the purposes of providing low-income housing. These fees have been used to rehabilitate 44 low-income
    housing units.
►   Housing Resource Guides: The City has developed several resource guides to help the community in
    accessing housing programs. These include guides to affordable rental housing and tenant assistance
    programs; home ownership and home buyer assistance; and senior and disabled housing and assistance/
    advocacy programs.
►   Other housing programs include: CAL HOME, Mortgage Credit Certificate, California Housing Finance
    Agency, Veterans Administration loans, CalPERS, and the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of
    America. The City supports the activities of the many lenders within the City that assist households from all
    economic segments to become homebuyers.
►   Housing Trust Fund: The City received $1 million from the State to address affordable housing needs,
    matching the City’s contribution of $1.2 million allocated from Housing Mitigation and Redevelopment
    funds. These funds were used to pay for the modernization of 44 affordable housing units owned by the
    Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency.
►   City Housing staff: The City’s Housing staff are available to citizens who wish to personally discuss their
    housing needs. Staff offers guidance and referral when appropriate, and maintains a library of publications
                                                                                        General Plan Background Report

     and information sheets that are available free of charge to the public. These include publications from Fannie
     Mae and HUD.
►    Partnerships: The City has identified strategic partnerships, both formal and informal, as key to meeting the
     City’s housing goals. These include working with the local HUD Community Builder, the Sacramento Home
     Loan Counseling Center, the Sacramento Rental Housing Association, the Sacramento Housing Alliance, the
     County Department of Human Assistance, Sacramento Steps Forward, Sacramento Self Help Housing and the
     Sacramento (County) Housing and Redevelopment Agency.
►    Maintenance of Housing Stock: The City Housing Stock Fee is used to support city inspections which are
     used to ensure the proper maintenance of the City’s aging housing stock.
2.10 EVALUATION OF THE CITY’S HOUSING GOALS, OBJECTIVES,
     POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS IN THE 2011 GENERAL PLAN (HOUSING
     ELEMENT PORTION UPDATED IN 2008)
PREVIOUS ELEMENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
The 2008 Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) Regional Housing Needs Plan determined that the
City’s fair share of housing need was a total of 223 units for a variety of income levels (78 Very Low, 20 Low, 10
Moderate, and 154 Above Moderate). According to building permit records, the City had a net production of 52
units during the 2008-2013 Planning Cycle.
The City did not meet the goals and objectives of the 2008–2013 Housing Element for total housing units or for
affordable housing units. However, the City made significant progress toward its housing goals by utilizing a
number of housing programs to help with some of the issues facing the community.
Although the actual production fell short of production goals, much of the effort in the 2008–2013 cycle is viewed
as an overwhelming success toward meeting the needs of the community and the implementation of housing
programs that help achieve the goals of the Housing Element.
REVIEW AND ANALYZE
State Law, Government Code Section 65588 requires each local government preparing a Housing Element to
review and analyze the following:
►    Appropriateness of housing goal, objective, and policies in contributing to the attainment of the state
     housing goal.
General Plan Background Report
City of Citrus Heights                                    2-7                                    Population and Housing

►   The effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the communities housing goals and objectives.
►   The progress of the City in implementation of its Housing Element.
The 2008 Housing Element contained five Goals, 21 Policies, and 71 Policy Actions designed to carry out the
overall goals of increasing homeownership, preserving the existing housing supply and assuring its continuing
quality, optimizing remaining development opportunities, and ensuring that adequate housing is available to all
residents including those with special needs.
The Goal, Policy, and Action Review Table, below, reviews and analyzes each of the Goals, Policies, and Actions
from the 2008 Housing Element. In addition to the Housing Element, the table reviews the City’s Goals, Policies,
and Actions related to Energy Conservation Opportunities. The table also provides modifications or additional
programs and justifies the necessity of the change or addition to the Housing Element or Energy Conservation
portion of the General Plan based on the required analysis.
The table includes the following information:
►   Goal/Policy/Action Number

2.11 HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
To effectively determine the present and future housing needs of the City of Citrus Heights, demographic and
socio-economic variables such as population, employment, households, household income, and housing stock
characteristics must be analyzed. The following data are taken from the U. S. Census, the State Department of
Finance, Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG), City documents, Claritas, DataQuick and other
conventional data sources.
To update the needs assessment, additional sources were consulted including the Sacramento Area Council of
Governments (SACOG), RealFacts, DataQuick, the California Association of Realtors, the Sacramento
Association of Realtors, and other sources as noted.
2.12 POPULATION TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS
The Sacramento region consists of six neighboring counties: Sacramento, El Dorado, Placer, Sutter, Yolo and
Yuba. Sacramento County, as the urban center of the region, contains two-thirds of the region’s population with
the majority concentrated in the City of Sacramento (33%) (see Tables 2-1 and 2-2). Sacramento County has
seven incorporated cities: Citrus Heights, Elk Grove, Folsom, Isleton, Galt, Rancho Cordova, and Sacramento.
The City of Sacramento, with over four hundred thousand persons, represents one-third of the County’s
population. Four other incorporated cities (Citrus Heights, Elk Grove, Rancho Cordova and Folsom) have
populations of over 60,000 persons each. The remaining two (Galt and Isleton) are small cities in the rural
southern portion of the County. Within the region, the cities of West Sacramento (Yolo County) and Roseville
(Placer County) are also significant population centers contiguous with the urbanized areas of Sacramento
County.

previously unincorporated areas of the County. As outlying areas have become increasing urbanized, local
citizens have incorporated the cities of Citrus Heights, Elk Grove, and Rancho Cordova. In Yolo County,
immediately adjacent to the downtown core of the City of Sacramento, West Sacramento incorporated by
assembling several small adjacent towns.
Between the years 1980 and 2010, the six county region grew by over one-million persons representing a 93%
increase in population. Numerically, the majority of this growth (57% of the total increase in persons) occurred in
Sacramento County, with the largest increase (over 190 thousand persons) in the City of Sacramento. In terms of
proportional growth, Placer and El Dorado counties have grown 2–3 times faster than other counties in the last
30 years. The cities of Elk Grove, Roseville, and Folsom have doubled, tripled, and quadrupled respectively over
the same period. Meanwhile, Citrus Heights has experienced a modest growth rate of 30.5% in thirty years
(1.02% per year), reflecting the City’s limited new growth areas.

work has recently increased, due to population growth, increased traffic and increasing demands on the
Sacramento County transportation network.

worked outside of the county. A very small portion, 0.1% or 49 employees, worked outside of the State.

(16.5%).
2.17 HOUSEHOLD FORMATION AND SIZE
The change in the number of households in a city is one of the prime determinants of the demand for housing.
Households can form even in periods of static population growth as adult children leave home, through divorce,
and with the aging of the population.

PERSONS PER HOUSEHOLD
Persons per household is an important indicator of the relationship between population growth and household
formation. For example, if the persons per household is decreasing, then households are forming at a faster rate
than population growth. Conversely, if population is growing faster than households, then the persons per
household would be increasing.

Persons Per Household                                                                                        Figure 2-4
Between 1970 and 1990, persons per household dramatically declined for the City of Citrus Heights and
Sacramento County. Specifically, the City of Citrus Heights dropped from 3.50 persons per household in 1970 to
2.59 persons per household in 1980, while Sacramento County decreased from 3.08 to 2.58 persons per
household. The decrease in persons per household indicates that household formation or occupied housing units
increased at a faster pace than the population between 1970 and 1980.
In the last twenty years, the trend towards smaller households has slowed; county-wide household size has even
begun to increase. While the City once had households larger than the County as a whole by nearly one-half
person, the City was identical to the County in 1990, and currently has slightly smaller households.
NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS
In the ten year period between 1970 and 1980, both the County and the City were experiencing a tremendous
growth in household formation, but Citrus Heights grew at a rate over 110 percentage points higher than the
County. To draw the comparison further, the number of households in the County increased at an average annual
rate of 4.7% during these ten years, while the number of Citrus Heights households increased an average of 16.2%
per year, a rate nearly three times greater. In the 1980’s, the City’s rate closely matched that of the County.
During the 1990’s, the City’s rate dropped to a ten-year average of less than one percent, while the County
continued to grow at 1.5% per year.

HOUSEHOLD SIZE DISTRIBUTION
Along with the persons-per-household figures, household size helps determine the size of housing units needed
within a jurisdiction. In the City of Citrus Heights, ‘‘small’’ households with one or two persons represented
60.7% of all households in 2010, much more than the ‘‘large’’ households with five or more persons. Small
households were the fastest growing household size between 1980 and 2010, increasing from 50.8% in 1980 to
60.9% in 1990.
In 2010, over half of the households in Citrus Heights are either one or two person households, which is not much
change relative to previous years. Although the large numbers of smaller households would be appropriately
accommodated in either one or two bedroom units, the City will need a variety of bedroom types as the numbers
of households increase

2.18 HOUSEHOLD TENURE
Housing tenure (whether a housing unit is occupied by an owner or a renter) can be effected by many factors
including: housing cost, housing type, housing availability, job availability, and consumer preference. Over time,
the tenure of housing units in the City of Citrus Heights has become more similar to that of Sacramento County.
For example, 68% of Citrus Heights’ occupied housing units were occupied by owners in 1980, while 60% were
occupied by owners in Sacramento County overall , a difference of 8%. By 1990, the City had a level of owner-
occupancy that was equal to the County overall. This trend has continued to the present.
(Note: The US Decennial Census enumerates housing tenure only for occupied housing units, vacant housing
units are not enumerated. Owner-occupied housing units and renter-occupied housing units sum to the total
occupied housing units, not total housing units.)

2.19 HOUSEHOLD INCOME CHARACTERISTICS
According to the Census, the City of Citrus Heights median household income is higher than the City of
Sacramento. However, some other suburban areas are higher in median income. For example, nearby Fair Oaks
CDP had a median income of $70,518, compared to $52,466 for the City of Citrus Heights. Additionally, Placer
County, Folsom, Orangevale, Carmichael, and Roseville had median household incomes higher than Citrus
Heights. On the other hand, North Highlands had a median income less than the City of Citrus Heights.
Between 2000 and 2010 the median household income in the City of Citrus Heights increased from $43,859 to
$52,466. At the same time, the median household income in Sacramento County increased from $43,816 to
$54,459.
The proportion of households in Citrus Heights with incomes less than $20,000 have been decreasing since 1980,
while the proportion of households with incomes greater than $50,000 have been increasing. For example,
households with incomes less than $15,000 decreased from 9.9% in 2000 to 8.5% in 2010. On the other hand,
households with incomes between $50,000 and $74,999 decreased slightly from 22.8% to 22.1% in the ten years
between 2000 and 2010.
Approximately 50.4 percent of the households have incomes between $50,000 and $99,999, which is a large
increase since 2000 and potentially reflects the creation of two income households in Citrus Heights. In addition,
nearly nine percent of the households have incomes less than $15,000 and most likely these households have
relatively limited housing choices.

The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimates Area Median Incomes (AMI). In turn,
these AMI are utilized in many housing programs, such as CDBG, HOME and LIHTC. In addition to estimated
annual income, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has established standard income
groups. They are defined as: (1) Extremely Low Income which are households earning less than 30% of the AMI
(2) Very Low Income which are households earning between 30% and 50% of the AMI; (3) Low Income for
households earning between 50% and 80% of the AMI; (4) Moderate Income are households earning between
80% and 120% of the AMI, and; (5) Above Moderate Income are households earning over 120% of the AMI.
Generally, these figures are used to determine household eligibility for Federal, State, and local programs.
Based on the 2010 HUD Area Median Income (AMI) and household income tables, it is estimated that 18.1% of
all households in Citrus Heights are Extremely Low Income, 26.6% of all households in Citrus Heights are Very
Low income. An additional 22.8% are Low income and 17.9% have incomes between 80 and 120% of AMI
which categorizes them as Moderate income. The remaining 14.5% of the households in Citrus Heights are
classified as having Above Moderate income.

EXTREMELY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS
In 2010, approximately 6,008 City residents were considered to be in the Extremely Low Income (ELI) category
(earning less than 30% of the Area Median Income, or less than $22,850). Seventy-three units is the projected
housing need for Extremely Low Income residents for the planning period. Extremely Low Income residents
housing needs are generally served through a variety of programs geared towards lower income housing.

Overpayment continues to be a problem facing ELI residents in the City. Over 83% of ELI residents are faced
with a housing problem. Extremely Low Income residents that rent their homes appear to be impacted by
overpayment more than ELI residents that own their homes.
The availability of Transitional Housing and Single Room Occupancy (SRO) housing generally serves the needs
of these residents and assists in preventing overpayment. Currently, the City allows Transitional Housing
(Residential Care in the Zoning Code) in most residential zoning districts by right, and with a Use Permit for
larger care facilities (more than 6 clients). Recently, the City teamed with the Citrus Heights Domestic Violence
Intervention Center to provide transitional housing for victims of domestic violence.
The City has actively pursued SRO partnerships to develop this housing type, however, thus far has been unable
to establish a partnership. The City will continue to seek out partnership opportunities to develop this type of
affordable housing. Development of SRO’s is permitted in the GC zoning district with a Use Permit. The City
will continue to promote the need for housing for ELI residents and promote the development of SRO housing to
meet this need. The City’s material will include additional information promoting the use of Transitional and
Supportive Housing. The City is currently developing promotional material to encourage this type of housing and
to inform non-profits, developers, and the public of the opportunities for this need and housing that may serve this
need. In addition, the City is currently in the process of establishing a Housing Roundtable to bring financial
institutions, developers, and non-profits to the table on an annual basis to keep those groups informed and updated
on the changing needs of the City including the ELI group.
Currently, the eight rent-restricted affordable housing developments in the City provide a total of 858 units that
are restricted to tenants earning less than 80 percent of the median income.
2.20 REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
This section of the Housing Element sets forth the City of Citrus Heights regional housing needs, as determined
by Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) methods. It also identifies the needs of special
population groups in the community (i.e., the elderly, disabled, large families, single parent households, farm
laborers, homeless, etc.).
2.21 REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS PLAN
The development of the Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) is part of the Sacramento Area Council of
Governments’ (SACOG) role to assist the planning efforts of local jurisdictions. The RHNP determines the
region’s projected housing needs over an eightyear period that coincides with the state mandated eight year local
housing plan revision cycle (revisions due in the Sacramento region in 2013). The most recent RHNP (covering
the period 2013-2021) was adopted in September 2012.
General Plan Background Report

The major goal of the RHNP is to assure a fair distribution of housing among cities and counties, so that every
community provides an opportunity for a mix of housing types affordable to all economic segments. Under state
law every city and county in the region has an obligation to meet the housing needs of the entire region. Every
city and county must plan for its “fair share” of the region’s housing need. (Government Code, Section
65833(a)(1))
2.22 BASIC CONSTRUCTION NEEDS, 2013-2021
The core of the RHNP is a series of tables that indicate the housing unit needs for each jurisdiction by household
income group. These units are considered the “basic new construction needs” to be considered when drafting
individual city and county housing plans. The basic new construction needs are not building requirements, but
goals for each community to be accommodated through appropriate planning policies and land use regulations.
The allocated targets are intended to ensure that adequate sites are appropriately zoned and made available to
meet the anticipated housing demand during the planning period for all income groups of the community.
Actual local housing needs and housing production may exceed the basic new construction need as determined in
the RHNP. It should be noted that SACOG has estimated the minimum regional need for housing, not the
maximum amount of housing to be built in a community.
The RHNP’s basic construction needs are derived from projected housing needs for the region based on
forecasted population growth, as well as various factors affecting the supply of housing, including vacancy and
unit loss. The City of Citrus Heights basic construction need for 2013 to 2021 is 696 total housing units: 146 units
for very low income households,102 units for low income households, 130 units for moderate income households
and 318 units for above moderate income households. The eight year basic construction needs represent an
average production of 87 units per year.
(Please note: Income groupings are based on the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) definitions of very low income, low income, and moderate income. HUD defines income groups by
brackets of percentage of the Area Median Family Income (AMFI). The AMFI used in the Sacramento region is
based on the annual HUD estimate of median family income for the Sacramento Partial Metropolitan Statistical
Area (PMSA) as defined by the US Census Bureau.)

2.23 NEED FOR REPLACEMENT HOUSING
According to Building Permit Records, there have been 33 residential demolitions between 2008 and 2013, an
average of 6 housing units per year that need replacement. The City has leveraged a variety of funding sources in
support of Policy 27.1F – “Continue to implement strategies to redevelop Sayonara Drive (Sunrise to Lialana)”.
The City has purchased and demolished dilapidated rental units on Sayonara and developed a Sayonara Drive
Replacement Housing Plan. The Replacement Housing Plan project outlines the need to replace either 35 units or
70 bedrooms, all of which will house very-low, and low-income households. The plan currently calls for
ownership housing, but this may change depending on funding availability. This replacement housing project was
put on hold due to the elimination of Redevelopment; however the City plans to explore project funding options
in the coming year.

2.24 EXISTING HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS AND CONDITIONS
The City of Citrus Heights has approximately two-thirds of its housing units in single family structures. One-fifth
of the units are in structures with five or more units/structure. There are also small but significant numbers of
units in 2–4 unit structures (9%) and mobile homes (5%). Over the last twenty years, this mix of housing appears
to have stabilized in the City. As the City approaches build-out, it is closer to the planned mix of housing types
shown in Section 8 (Inventory of Land Suitable for Residential Development).

AGE OF HOUSING STOCK
Thirty-six percent of the Citrus Heights housing stock was built in one decade (1970 to 1979). Another 22.7%
was built between 1980 and 1989, which results in a median age of nearly 30 years.
Owner occupied housing units have out-paced multi-family development in every decade, except in the 1980s.
Approximately 5,559 rental occupied housing units were built between 1980 and 1989, compared to 3,957 owner
                                                                                            General Plan Background Report

the mid-2000s, with only eighteen multi-family units constructed between 2008 and 2013.

2.25 HISTORIC RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION TRENDS
According to the City of Citrus Heights Building Department, building permits were finaled for a total of 473 new
dwelling units since 2002. During that same period, 81 housing units were demolished for a net gain of 392 units.
This equals an average of approximately 36 new units a year for this 10 year period.
Of the new units built in the City from 2002–2012, 84% were standard single family units. Between 2002 and
2012, most of the new residential development occurred in two subdivisions, Ryland Homes in Stock Ranch (96
units) which was constructed primarily in 2004 and Camden Place (63 units) primarily constructed between 2008
and 2012.

In addition to recent construction, the City of Citrus Heights has granted approvals for 329 additional housing
units to be built in the coming years
The units are divided into 169 single family units and 160 condominiums. Each of the Pending Projects includes a
proposed/approved density as well as a default density. Due to political uncertainty, the City is concerned that if
some of these pending projects expire, a subsequent replacement project may not be able to achieve the same
densities previously approved. As such, City staff has reviewed pending projects on a case by case basis to
determine realistic densities, should a replacement project be required and assigned a default density for all
pending projects. Based on Staff review, the default densities would allow construction of at least 283 units. See
Appendix A – Vacant , Pending and Underutilized Land Inventory. The following is a summary of current
residential development projects as approved or proposed (as of January 2013):

2.26 OVERCROWDED HOUSING UNITS
Overcrowding is defined by HUD as any housing unit in which more than one person per room is in residence.
While the City’s population has increased continually, average household size decreased between 1990 and 2000.
More recently average household size has increased from 2.52 in 2000 to 2.69 in 2010 persons per household. The
increase in household size is largely attributed to the downturn in the economy between the mid-2000’s and the
present.
Although the City’s relatively small family households, in 2010 there were 910 households in the city that had
more than 1.01 persons per room. This is considered to be over-crowded. Of the City’s over-crowded households,
104 experienced severe overcrowding, defined as more than 1.50 persons per room.
                                                                                         General Plan Background Report

Overcrowding can be linked to the supply of affordable and adequate housing. Families that are unable to afford
larger units are often forced by necessity to rent units that are too small to meet their needs. The table below
shows that the level of overcrowding is higher among renter households.
One of the accepted federal definitions of “substandard” housing is housing units without complete plumbing
facilities. In 2010, none of the housing stock lacked complete plumbing facilities in Citrus Heights and only 0.5%
in Sacramento County.

2.27 CONDITION OF THE HOUSING STOCK
Over 88 percent of the homes in the City of Citrus Heights were constructed prior to 1989. Thirty-six percent of
these homes were constructed in the 1970s. The majority of these homes were constructed as tract homes
associated with the building boom of that decade. The majority of these homes were built quickly with
inconsistent construction quality. Many of these homes are now experiencing failing roofs and HVAC systems.
In addition, 861 homes were built prior to 1939, and may be dilapidated. Most of these homes utilize electronic
wiring and plumbing that can pose potential risk and is insufficient.
The City has established a housing repair program designed to assist homeowners with essential repairs. To be
eligible, the home must be owner-occupied (except for access grants) and the family must qualify as “low-
income.” The loan and grant program offers low- and no-interest financing with generous terms. The city’s

program has no application fee and all costs may be financed. 180 homes have participated in the program since
1999.
Based on the information above, it is evident that much of the City’s aging housing stock is of an age and
condition where substantial rehabilitation is required. As such, the City should continue to provide funding to
provide essential repair assistance to homeowners.
2.28 VACANCY RATES
The vacancy rate is an indicator of the relationship between housing supply and demand in the City of Citrus
Heights. For example, if the demand for housing is greater than the available supply, then the vacancy rate is
probably low, and the price of housing will most likely increase or remain stable. Also, HUD considers an overall
vacancy rate of five percent as adequate to provide choice and mobility for a community’s residents.
The US Census reports an overall vacancy rate of 6.8% of housing units in 2010. This is a 2.7% decrease from
2000. This level of vacancy is largely associated with the downturn in the economy and high number of bank
owned or foreclosed homes. Owner occupied units have increased to a 2.7% vacancy rate.
The current annual vacancy rate for apartments is are 5.6%. Over the last four years (2008–2012), the annual
vacancy rate has decreased 1.5%.
Meanwhile, rental rates have remained flat or even decreased. Average rents for all unit types and sizes peaked in
2008 at $864/month, fell to a low of $817/month in 2010 and have only risen 1.3% in the last two years from
$817/month to $828/month. (Real Facts, 2012)

2.29 SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
Within the overall housing needs assessments, there are segments of the population that require special
consideration. These are generally people who are low income and have less access to housing choices. These
special housing needs groups include the elderly, disabled, single-parent heads of households, large families, farm
workers, homeless and first-time homebuyers.
ELDERLY
The 2010 Census reports the City Population of citizens aged 65 and over is 11,014 or 13% of the City’s total.
Approximately 20% of these seniors are “Frail Elderly”. Frail is defined here as needing at least some assistance
to maintain an independent lifestyle. Seniors with mobility or self-care limitations who consequently may have
special housing needs are included in this population. Similarly, the Sacramento City/County Housing Task Force
report estimated that 20–40% of the elderly population is frail.
Much of the senior population faces financial difficulties in the form of a limited income after retirement. In
addition to financial difficulties, seniors face transportation difficulties, with one-third of persons over 75 unable
to use public transit. Compounding this problem, one-third of all seniors live alone and therefore may not have
access to any sort of transportation assistance. To quantify this population, the 2000 Census statistics for persons
65 years and older (civilian, non-institutionalized) who have a mobility or self-care limitation is used. For the
General Plan Background Report
City of Citrus Heights                                         2-63                                  Population and Housing

City, the Census identified 2,979 seniors with an inability to go outside the home or self-care limitation or roughly
27% of the non-institutionalized senior population.
The vast majority of the senior population desires to live as independent a lifestyle as possible. Housing and
assistance programs for seniors should put priority on independent living, attempting first to maintain these
persons in their own homes.
High rates of home-ownership prevail among the elderly population. However, as the elderly become unable to
care for their own home and provide their own transportation, they usually will move to an independent living
apartment complex. In 2000, 27.1% of the senior households were renters in Citrus Heights.
Six apartment complexes in Citrus Heights are restricted to senior citizens, or persons age 62 years or older. The
vacancy rate for senior units is only 3.6%. Of the six complexes in the City, one, Vintage Oaks, has rents targeting
50 to 60% of the Area Median Income, per the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. In addition, Normandy
Park with 116 units provides housing to a mix of incomes at 50, 60 and 80 percent of AMI.

There are additional senior facilities that provide congregate care, assisted living, skilled nursing, and Alzheimer’s
services. According to the Department of Social Services, there are 786 elderly residential care or assisted living
beds in the City throughout 74 facilities. Major residential care facilities include: Gardens at Citrus Heights
(56 beds), Merrill Gardens (99 beds), and Sun Oak Villa (78 beds). According to the Office of Statewide Health
Planning and Development, there are 148 beds licensed for long-term care in Manor Care of Citrus Heights and
an expansion of 14 beds was approved by the City in 2007 for a total of 162 beds. In addition seven of the ten
mobile home parks are restricted specifically for senior citizens. The mobile home stock in the city continues to
make affordable housing available, specifically to seniors. In 2005, the average rent for mobile home park space
was $394 per month.
The City has made substantial efforts in addressing senior housing needs. The senior population is projected to
continue to grow and this segment of the population will continue to need special assistance. In addition to senior
housing needs, there are many low-income seniors who need other types of assistance and supportive services.
                                                                                                        General Plan Background Report

The City provides zero interest housing repair loans and accessibility grants through its housing repair program.
The City also grants more than $100,000 annually to Meals on Wheels (administered by the Asian Community
Center) to provide meals to hundreds of seniors. As part of the construction of the Citrus Heights Community
Center in 2008, the City opened a senior center with a computer room, game area, television viewing area and
patio. Citrus Heights seniors frequently use this space to socialize with their neighbors. In October 2012, the
City partnered with Sacramento Regional Transit District (RT) to begin operation of a dial-a-ride shuttle that
offers curb-to-curb service for residents including trips to local hospitals. The shuttle has space for two
wheelchairs. . The City continually revaluates access to resources, such as transportation, meals and activities to
ensure the best care for its senior population.
DISABLED PERSONS
According to the 2010 Census, 8,057 persons or 16% of persons 5 years of age or older in the City of Citrus
Heights has a disability. The Census Bureau defines disability as a long-lasting physical, mental, or emotional
condition. This condition can make it difficult for a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs,
dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being able to go
outside the home alone or to work at a job or business. Of that, 6,804 persons or 39% of persons 65 years and
over have a disability.

The housing needs of physically disabled persons are not currently addressed in full and efforts to do so must
include housing production programs, efforts to make sure unnecessary impediments to handicap housing are
eliminated and supportive services, including possible special funding from the City. The social or medical
services of the handicapped population should be carefully assessed within the City. In addition, the City should
make efforts to determine the adequacy of its public facilities from an accessibility standpoint, particularly along
major streets and sidewalks.
The City has a very aggressive program aimed at eliminating barriers for handicapped persons. This includes
public facility accommodations and alterations, and removing transportation barriers. The City regularly allocates

Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding to city-wide accessibility projects, which provide
improvements such as curb ramps, sidewalks, crosswalks and pedestrian push buttons.
The City also provides accessibility grants through its housing rehabilitation program that assists disabled owner-
occupants and renters. This program provides grants for modifications and minor improvements to improve the
accessibility and safety of the homes of disabled persons. The City also adopted the Reasonable Accommodations
Ordinance to allow streamlined processing of Zoning Code Amendments or exception to accommodate disabled
persons in the housing of their choice.
MENTALLY DISABLED
According to the 2007 American Community Survey, approximately 5,513 persons in the City of Citrus Heights
above the age of 5 have a Mental Disability of some kind.
DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED
The term “developmental disability” describes a number of conditions which permanently restrict an individual’s
development. State and federal governments differ in definition. California identifies developmental disability as
a diagnosis originating before age 18, of one or more of the following conditions: mental retardation, epilepsy,
cerebral palsy, and autism. Federal statutes apply a non-categorical, utilitarian designation: a severe chronic
disability caused by physical or mental impairment that is evident before age 22.
In the past, persons with developmental disabilities have been perceived as dependent and in need of long term
institutional and congregate care and treatment. In recent times, the idea of large state-sponsored institutions for
the care of developmentally disabled persons has changed to smaller community based programs such as group
homes and sheltered workshops. California, as well as other states, is taking a more aggressive approach to the
developmentally disabled by advancing the concept of self-determination for the developmentally disabled and
their families. This gives the persons involved the choice of determining how an individual budget will be spent
on housing, personal needs, employment, etc. The housing choices are varied, ranging from living with a family
member, to independent living, to institutional type facilities.
According to the California Department of Development Services, a large proportion of developmentally disabled
persons live at home with family, 72.1%, in the State of California. Alta California Regional Center assists
persons with developmental disabilities, including infants at risk and their families who live in their 10 county
service area. According to Alta, a total of 675 Citrus Heights residents are considered developmentally disabled,
with the largest age group being 23-54.

According to the Department of Social Services there are 73 beds at 13 adult residential facilities in Citrus
Heights. Adult residential facilities provide 24 hour non-medical care for adults 18 through 59 who are unable to
provide their own daily needs. Adults may be physically handicapped, developmentally disabled and/or mentally
disordered. In addition, there is a capacity for 60 persons in adult day care, located in Access to the Community
through Education, Integration & Training (ACE-IT II) which primarily serves adults ages 18+ with
developmental or physical disabilities.
Although California encourages the needs of mentally and developmentally disabled persons to be met through
family environments, there are still a large number in the community requiring housing and other services for the
developmentally disabled. The Citrus Heights area is the home of 9 group homes serving various elderly, frail,
and disadvantaged populations. The City allows group homes of 6 or fewer persons to reside in any residential
zone “by right” and without any staff or policy level review. Residential Care Facilities are dwellings that provide
24-hour non-medical care of unrelated persons for persons who are handicap and in the need of personal services
and assistance. Residential Care Facilities for six or fewer clients are allowed by right in all residential zoning
districts. The City does not impose additional zoning, building code, or permitting procedures other than those
allowed by state law. Although a Use Permit is required for residential care facilities with 7 or more persons, the
majority of these facilities are under six persons in size and accommodate the need in the City.
The City does not restrict occupancy of unrelated individuals in group homes and does not define family or
enforce a definition in its Zoning Ordinance. The City permits housing for special needs groups including for
residents with disabilities, without regard to distances between such uses or the number of uses in any part of the
City. The permit procedures for a group home are identical to a single family home on an existing vacant parcel.
No public hearing or input is required, solely a building permit for the construction of the structure.
In November 2006, the City adopted an updated Zoning Code, which included Chapter 106.66, Reasonable
Accommodation. The Chapter establishes a procedure for reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities
to seek equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and
Housing Act in the application of the Zoning Ordinance. Any person with a disability or their representative may
request reasonable accommodation and the Community and Economic Development Director may approve the
request. A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards,

and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing related facilities that would remove the
regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice.
The 2008 update of the housing portion of the General Plan included a new Policy Action 26.2.F which promotes
the concept of Universal Housing. This concept involves the design of new homes and remodels to accommodate
or the ability to be converted to easily accommodate persons with disabilities in the home. Zero-step entrances,
reinforced bathroom grab bars, and wheelchair accessible first floors are all concepts typically employed in
Universal Housing.
SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN
The 2010 Census counted 4,348 female-headed single parent households in the City of Citrus Heights. Single
parent households with children have special needs, especially when considering the rate of poverty. In 2010,
11.7% of all family households were in poverty, and 23.1% of female-headed families were in poverty. (US
Census) Special needs include child care, related support services, access to transportation and education, and
affordable housing. This special needs group can be assisted by the affordable housing strategies for the City of
Citrus Heights and Sacramento County, but can be further assisted with supplemental services on-site or near
employment.
According to the Department of Social Services, there is a capacity for 1,902 children throughout 40 infant
centers, school age child day care or day care centers. Specifically, there is a capacity for 272 children in infant
centers (24 - hour non-medical care and supervision), 226 children in school age child day care (older than five
years and in the first grade) and 1,364 children in day care centers (older than two years and less than first grade).
In 2011, the City constructed the Citrus Heights Children and Youth Center, which is located on Sayonara Drive
administered by Campus Life. The Center is a free after school center that will provide more than 100 low
income children with tutoring services and educational games. A high proportion of these children come from
Hispanic single parent households.

LARGE FAMILIES
A large family is defined as a household consisting of five or more persons. The 2010 Census indicated that 6.4%
of owner occupied households in Citrus Heights have five or more members, which is equal to 2000. Thirteen
percent of the renter households have five or more persons, a significant increase from 6.5% in 2000.

Generally, a five or more person household can be adequately accommodated by a three or more bedroom
housing unit, but smaller household sizes will chose to occupy larger homes and impact the availability of larger
bedroom sizes. There appears to be ample larger bedroom sizes in Citrus Heights. For example, only 6.4% of the
owner households and 13% of the renter households were large families, while 20.3% of the ownership units were
four or more bedrooms. On the other hand, there appears to be a deficit of larger rental units (only 3.3% are 4 or
more bedroom) and most likely larger rental families occupy two or three bedroom rental units.
Large renter families that are low income often have a problem obtaining adequate housing due to low vacancy
rates for large multi-family housing, and the usually high rents for larger units. Most higher income, large families
are homeowners or can afford to rent larger units, so the large family renter households is considered the special
needs group with the higher priority of concern. The following is a current estimate of unmet need for low
income, large household renters in the City of Citrus Heights:

In 2010, there were 490 rental occupied housing units that were four bedrooms or larger and this number has
decreased from 759over the last ten years, largely attributed to the crash of the housing market in the mid-200’s.
The affordability of those larger rental units is uncertain, so the City will continue to address the concerns of large
rental families through general affordable housing and first-time homebuyer assistance ownership strategies.
FARM WORKERS
According to the Employment Development Department, total farm employment in the Sacramento MSA is
expected to increase from 8,900 workers in 2000 to 9,200 workers in 2012.
Given the built-out nature of the City, there are scarce number of acres in farm production and subsequently a
negligible need for farm worker housing. The housing needs of farm worker populations can be addressed through
general affordable housing strategies.

HOMELESS
There are generally two types of homeless persons: the “permanent homeless” who are the transient and most
visible homeless population; and the “temporary homeless” who are homeless usually due to eviction and may
stay with friends, family, or in a shelter or motel until they can find a more permanent residence.

Over the past 20 years, dramatic increases and demographic changes have occurred in the homeless population.
Today’s homeless include families with children, employable individuals who are unemployed, the mentally ill,
the elderly, the disabled, and substance abusers. As the County’s and City’s homeless become more
heterogeneous, their needs become more complex and the responsibility to address these growing needs becomes
critical.
The Department of Human Assistance maintains a count of persons who identify with the City of Citrus Heights
during calendar year 2011. Current estimates support a homeless population originating in Citrus Heights as
80 persons. The City accepts this figure as its “fair share.” Based on the current (2011) shelter population, with an
assumed level of Citrus Heights originating homeless persons at 5.5% of total homeless persons, there are 540
homeless persons in shelters from the City per week.

The highest priority needs for the homeless population according to the County Department of Human Assistance
and local housing-for-the-homeless providers are transitional and permanent housing with supportive services for
subgroups among the homeless population. For homeless individuals, this includes transitional and permanent
housing with supportive services for chronic substance abusers, persons with serious mental health problems,
dually-diagnosed persons, victims of domestic violence, those suffering from HIV/AIDS and persons with
physical disabilities. For homeless families, resources need to focus on those people with serious mental health
problems, those suffering from HIV/AIDS and persons with physical disabilities.
The Sacramento Countywide Homeless Street Count 2011report included an analysis of homeless persons in the
County and their needs. Indeed the homeless population is a highly mobile population, so the portrait represents a
snap shot in time. The following tables are provided by Sacramento Steps Forward.

HOMELESS SERVICES AND FACILITIES
The City has several homeless resources available. The Sunrise Christian Food Ministry on San Juan Boulevard
serves approximately 200–250 homeless persons through several programs. They operate a “food closet” that is
open Monday through Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. and also offer assistance with medical prescriptions
and transit passes. The Holy Family Catholic Church located on Old Auburn Road, operates a kitchen for the
homeless and needy. The kitchen is open for Wednesday dinners and generally serves 200–225 people each week.
. The Department of Human Assistance (DHA) of Sacramento County is the primary service provider to the
homeless. Primarily, the focus of assistance to homeless families is to provide temporary housing. DHA’s
services for these newly homeless families include providing motel vouchers for up to seven nights for evicted
families and/or assisting with the security deposits and first and last month’s rent.

Several County agencies including the County Department of Human Assistance and the Sacramento Housing
and Redevelopment Agency have homeless programs.
Generally, services for the homeless are provided on a county or regional basis. As a result, the information for
homeless facilities and shelters in the Sacramento county area is collected and reported for the county as a whole.
In Citrus Heights, families who have been evicted will be provided with a motel voucher for up to seven nights
through the Department of Human Assistance. In addition, the temporarily homeless family may be eligible to
receive assistance with their rental deposit and first and last month’s rent when they locate housing.

The City does not currently contain emergency shelters and the motel voucher program is impacted, which
implies an unmet need for homeless services in the area. The City is addressing the needs of homeless persons in
the City through coordination with other jurisdictions, providing available resources, permitting the development
of shelter, and implementation plans meeting shelter needs. The City’s updated zoning code allows for emergency
shelters to be located in numerous locations throughout the City by right.

The City’s main form of support for homeless services is through an annual contribution of the City’s CDBG
award to the County’ Continuum of Care. The County has primarily used the City’s funds to support the Winter
Overflow Shelter, though the City funds lessen the County’s costs of operating the shelter, making funds available
to the other Continuum services. These services include but are not limited to housing assistance (placement,
deposit, readiness), mental health and substance abuse services, employment services (job coaching, clothing,
etc.), life skills training, and public assistance.

FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYER NEEDS
Another aspect of housing need, is the need to assist low income entry level homebuyers. These households could
be caught between increasing rents and the difficulty of saving money for a down payment, while preferring an
opportunity to own a home and accumulate equity.
The current (June 2012) median sales prices for a single family home within the City is $157,157.
Currently, a family in Citrus Heights earning the annual median income of $60,880 can afford a home priced at
$255,000. (This assumes an interest rate of 4%, 3% closing costs, 3.5% down, and a 30-35% payment to income
ratio.) Thus, at current median prices, a family at median income can afford to buy a home in the City. The City’s
first-time homebuyer program offers up to $55,000 in assistance to eligible low-income families. Coupled with
public agency loans, this assistance makes it possible for many low-income families to qualify to buy a home.
As shown in Table 2-40 and Figure 2-11, the level of assistance provided by the City can affect the ability of a
family to afford a home. The example shown assumes a substantial buyer’s contribution. The first-time buyer
assistance program can also help families who lack significant savings to buy a home below the median sales
price.
Figure 2-11 illustrates relative affordability of homes in the current housing market. , The First-Time Home Buyer
Assistance program can assist very low income families in lowering the required loan levels to levels that can
afford homes in the region. 98% of all homes sold in the region were sold for under $280,000 in 2012 ensuring
availability of housing for all income levels, with or without City assistance.

FOR SALE UNITS
The residential real estate market in the Sacramento region saw a tremendous rate of price appreciation between
2002 and 2006. In 2006 the housing market began a rapid decline associated with the global economy. By 2012,
prices fell as much as 50% from the peak in 2005/2006. Currently prices have leveled out and are remaining
relatively flat.

PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CITRUS HEIGHTS
As part of the Housing Element Update, the City is required to demonstrate that there is adequate land available to
accommodate various levels of affordability. Although the State has established a density of 30 units per acre as
the default density for accommodating low and very low income housing, the default density does not
accommodated for local conditions or other market factors. Rather than rely on the default density, the City
prepared an analysis that evaluated the production of affordable housing in Citrus Heights.
The analysis determined that housing affordability is determined by a variety of factors that vary both on an
intraregional and interregional basis. Affordability is largely impacted by local conditions within individual
                                                                                                         General Plan Background Report

communities. These “Affordability Factors” vary greatly across the state and can dramatically impact the ability
to produce affordable housing.
These affordability factors include: Financial Feasibility, Market Demand, Development Experience, Existing
Housing Stock, Corridors and Transit Accessibility, Affordable Housing Incentives, and Programmatic Efforts.
Recognizing that conditions that lead to affordability are not universal, the State allows jurisdictions to perform an
analysis based on local conditions and affordability factors as an alternative to the default densities. In 2012, the
City studied these affordability factors and the impact they have on affordable housing production in Citrus
Heights. This analysis “Producing Affordable Housing in Citrus Heights – An alternative to the default density” is
attached as Appendix B.
Whereas urban areas or coastal communities may require densities of at least 30 units per acre, suburban or rural
communities can often provide affordable housing at much lower densities based on the local conditions and
affordability factors discussed above. The City has conducted the required analysis and determined that zoning
allowing 20 units per acre is adequate to support affordable housing in Citrus Heights.
The City’s analysis of local affordability factors determined that affordable housing can be produced in Citrus
Heights at densities of 20 units per acre. Although all affordability factors impact the City’s ability to produce
affordable housing, several key factors or a combination of these factors ensure that the City can continue to
produce affordable housing at lower densities:
1.         Land values in the City are at historic lows
2.         Recent market rate development is affordable to lower incomes at densities under 20 units per acre
3.         Increased density has not resulted in increased affordability
4.         The City’s supply of existing housing is affordable at market rates
5.         The City’s development fees are amongst the lowest in the region
6.         Infrastructure is readily available due to the built out nature of the community
7.         The majority of the City, particularly along its corridors, is affordable even when factoring in
transportation costs
8.         The availability of incentives for affordable housing has proven successful in Citrus Heights
9.         The City has adopted policies that support affordable housing

Based on the local conditions (affordability factors), the City is capable of producing affordable housing at
densities 20 units per acre. This factor is considered throughout the City’s Housing Element Update, including the
assumptions and calculations within the City’s adequate sites and land inventory.
OVERPAYMENT
Generally, overpayment considers the total shelter cost for a household compared to their ability to pay.
Overpayment is an important measure of the affordability within the City of Citrus Heights. Specifically,
“overpayment” is defined as monthly shelter costs in excess of 30% of a rental household’s or 35% of an
ownership household’s income. As defined by the US Census Bureau, “shelter cost” is the monthly owner costs
(mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts to purchase or similar debts on the property and taxes, insurance on the
property and utilities) or the gross rent (contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities).
According to the 2010Census, 48.2% of renter-occupied households were in overpayment situations in 2010,
while 38.7% of owner-occupied households were overpaying for shelter in the City of Citrus Heights. In
Sacramento County in 2010, 38.6% of households were overpaying for shelter; 45.3% of renter occupied
households were overpaying, while 20.2% of owner-occupied households were overpaying for shelter.
Overpayment is a significant problem for lower income households (i.e., with income less than 80% of AMI).
Based on the 2010 Census, 13,164 of the lower income households in the city are overpaying for shelter.
Subsequently, 54% of the lower income renter households are overpaying for shelter, while only 46% of the lower
income owner households are overpaying for shelter.

The Housing Element Law in California (Govt. Code Sect. 65583) requires all jurisdictions to include a study of
all low income housing units which may at some future time be lost to the affordable inventory by the expiration
of some type of affordability restrictions. The analysis and study is to cover a ten year period, and be divided into
two five year periods, coinciding with the Housing Element which is 2002–2006 and 2007–2011 in the City of
Citrus Heights.
There are three general cases that can result in the conversion of affordable units:
1. PREPAYMENT OF HUD MORTGAGES SECTION 221(D)(3), SECTION 202 AND SECTION 236 –
     A Section 221 (d)(3) is a privately owned project with HUD providing either below market interest rate loans
     or market rate loans with a subsidy to the tenants. In a Section 236 complex, HUD provides assistance to the
     owner to reduce the costs for tenants by paying most of the interest on a market rate mortgage. Additional

    rental subsidy may be provided to the tenant. In a Section 202, HUD provides a direct loan to non-profit
    organizations for project development and rent subsidy for low-income tenants. All Section 202 handicapped
    units (Section 202 H.C.) are designed for physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, and chronically
    mentally ill residents.
2. OPT-OUTS AND EXPIRATIONS OF PROJECT BASED SECTION 8 CONTRACTS – In a Section 8 new
    construction or substantial rehabilitation, HUD provides a subsidy to the owner for the difference between
    tenant’s ability to pay and the contract rent. Usually, the likelihood of opt-outs increase as the market rents
    exceed the contract rents.
3. OTHER – Expiration of the low income use period of various financing sources, such as Low Income
    Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), bond financing, density bonuses, CHFA, CDBG, and HOME funds and
    Redevelopment funds.
2.32 INVENTORY OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING UNITS
The following inventory includes all publicly assisted/rent restricted apartment complexes in the City of Citrus
Heights. A total of 858 public assisted units were ascertained in the City in 2013. All the properties were found to
target Very Low to Low income households. Most of the properties were found to assist general households or
families, and two properties were found to assist senior households. One complex, John Adams Manor, aids the
developmentally disabled.

A variety of affordable housing programs comprise the Citrus Heights affordable housing stock. Two complexes
were found to be utilizing county multi-family bonds and five were identified as Low Income Housing Tax Credit
(LIHTC) properties. Greenback Manor was placed in service July 31, 2000 after the expiration of a HUD Section
236 contract. Approximately half of the tenants are using preservation vouchers from SHRA, as of May 2000. All
but one of the affordable properties are “at-risk” through the expiration of affordability terms, while the remaining
John Adams Manor is “at-risk” through the expiration of a Section 8 contract.

During the preparation of the 2008 Housing Element update, two properties were considered “at-risk,” The first
property at-risk of losing affordable housing units are the 27 units of the 50 unit John Adams Manor. In addition,
the Fairways II bond matured in 2012. After the qualified project period, the project owner may terminate the
regulatory agreement if: the bond has matured, or the bond is pre-paid and retired. The owner may also continue
under the regulatory agreement and renew the bond. The Fairways II bond matured and the owner did not elect to
have the bond renewed. This resulted in a loss of 27 units for the City.
The non-profit owners of President John Adams Manor (Eskaton) renewed the affordability of the units with
HUD upon expiration in 2008. The regulatory agreement was renewed for a period of 40 years and 27 affordable
units were preserved. After the completion of the 2008 Housing Element update, the City approved the issuance
of tax-exempt multi-family housing revenue bonds by the California Statewide Communities Development
Authority (“CSCDA”) for the purpose of allowing Capital Valley Investments (“CVI”) to finance the acquisition
and rehabilitation of a multi-family residential housing facility to be named Arborelle Apartments. The project
acquired and rehabilitated Sundance Apartments, a 179-unit multi-family housing complex located at 8007
Sunrise Boulevard. The 179-units in the Project consist of 57 one-bedroom units and 120 two-bedroom units, and
2 units set aside for property management. The project rent restricted 100% of the units with 6 one-bedroom units

and 12 two-bedroom units set aside for very low-income tenants earning 50% or less of the Area Median Income,
and 51 one-bedroom units and 108 two-bedroom units set aside for low-income tenants earning 60% or less of the
Area Median Income. Arborelle is now subject to a regulatory agreement and available to low and very low
incomes through 2062.
Since the preparation of the 2008 Housing Element update the City also approved the issuance of multifamily
housing bonds by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) Financing Authority in order for USA
Properties Fund to acquire and rehabilitate Vintage Oaks Senior Apartments. The project acquired and
rehabilitated Vintage Oaks Apartments, a 241-unit senior housing complex located at 7340 Stock Ranch Road.
The 241-units in the Project consist of 192 one-bedroom units and 48 two-bedroom units, and 1 unit set aside for
property management. The project rent restricted 100% of the units with 120 one-bedroom units set aside for very
low-income tenants earning 50% or less of the Area Median Income, and 72 one-bedroom units and 48 two-
bedroom units set aside for low-income tenants earning 60% or less of the Area Median Income. With the new
financing a new regulatory agreement was recorded and the affordability restriction was renewed for a term of 55
years, effectively extending the term of affordability for an additional 15 years.
While the City lost affordable housing rental units with the maturation of Fairways II bonds, there was a net
increase in available affordable housing available to Citrus Heights residents with the acquisition and
rehabilitation of both Arborelle Apartments and Vintage Oaks Senior Apartments. In addition, no “at-risk” units
have been identified as expiring within the next ten years.

2.33 COST ANALYSIS
To provide a cost analysis of at-risk units, the following must be considered: 1) acquisition/rehabilitation (sale to
an agency or individual willing to continue and maintain the affordability restrictions 2) replacement (new
construction) and 3) providing rental subsidies.
     1. Acquisition/Rehabilitation – The primary factors being used in the analysis of cost to rehabilitate low
           income housing are: acquisition, rehabilitation and financing/other costs. Actual acquisition costs would
           depend on several variables such as condition, size, location, existing financing and availability of
           financing (governmental and market). Historically, rehabilitation has ranged from 25% to 30% less than
           new construction. The following are estimated per unit rehabilitation costs for the City of Citrus Heights,
           according to private developers.
                                                            Table 2-51:

     2. Replacement – Replacement means new construction of a complex with the same number of units, on a
           similar site, with similar amenities as the one removed from the affordable housing stock. Costs estimates
           were prepared by using local information and data as much as possible. Input was solicited from the
           City’s Building Department and private developers. The construction of new housing can vary greatly
           depending on factors such as location, density, unit sizes, construction materials and on-site and off-site
           improvements. Replacement cost includes construction, land, associated fees, design, syndication,
           overhead and administrative costs. The following table describes replacement costs for a typical garden
           style apartment in the City of Citrus Heights.

    3. Providing Rental Subsidies – Generally, there are two types of affordable housing: subsidized and rent-
         restricted. Subsidized units usually qualify tenants with incomes less than 50% of the Area Median
         Income (AMI) and subsequently the tenants pay 30% of their adjusted gross income for monthly rent.
         Restricted rents are usually mitigated rents set according to the AMI or the HUD Fair Market Rent
         (FMR). Most of the City’s affordable housing would be classified as rent-restricted one and two bedroom
         units. In order to preserve converting affordable housing units, the city would generally need to provide
         the difference between the market rents and the restricted-rents. The following is a per unit rental subsidy
         cost estimate utilizing average market rents and average restricted-rents.

PRESERVATION OF RESOURCES
Efforts by the City to retain low income housing must be able to draw upon two basic types of preservation
resources: organizational and financial. First, qualified, non-profit entities need to be made aware of the future
possibilities of units becoming ‘‘at risk.’’ Groups with whom the City has an on-going association are the logical
entities for future participation. See the Appendix B for a list of non-profits that have the capacity to manage and
acquire affordable housing developments.
                                                                                                    General Plan Background Report
Population and Housing                                       2-90                                                City of Citrus Heights

The City aggressively monitors the availability of new housing resources and program funds. In 2003, the City
was successful in obtaining a $1 million grant from the State to assist in capitalizing a Housing Trust Fund. The
City has also received over $1 million in State grants (Cal HOME and HOME Consortium funding) to provide
down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers. The City has also been the recipient of federal funding (EDI)
to assist in the redevelopment of Sayonara Drive which is the City’s most hard-pressed low income area.
In the future the City will pursue housing resources consistent with the priorities outlined in the City’s Housing
Element and Consolidated Plan. Of particular priority is a commitment to pursue funds for the City’s Housing
Trust Fund, First-Time Homebuyer Program, the Sayonara neighborhood and other pockets of low income and
the City’s ten mobile home communities. As a mature suburb, the reinvestment in an aging housing stock grows
more important over time. The City has expended several million dollars to fund housing rehabilitation loans in
recent years. This will continue to be a priority need and the City will direct both internal resources (Housing
Trust funds) as well as State and Federal funding resources in addressing these needs.
The following is a list of additional financial resources that might become a part of the City’s overall financial
plan to deal with retaining affordable units. The number and availability of programs to assist cities and counties
in increasing and improving their affordable housing stock is significantly limited. Future funding for new
projects is unpredictable especially considering the elimination of Redevelopment funding..
All the following programs are restricted by requirements. Some require matching funds, some have precise
monitoring and reporting conditions, and none are sufficient - in themselves - to produce or preserve a significant
amount of housing.
The following programs are federal, state, local and private housing programs that will be valuable resources in
preserving “at-risk” housing.
1. HOME Program: The HOME Program was created under Title II of the Cranston-Gonzales National
     Affordable Housing Act enacted on November 28, 1990. Eligible activities include acquisition, rehabilitation,
     construction, and rental assistance which can be used for preservation activities. The City has joined with the
     County through a consortium agreement. Due to recent significant funding cuts, City’s annual share of
     HOME funds is $150,000 per year, whereas in 2008 it was $300,000 annually.
2. Public Housing Authority (PHA) – The local PHA is Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency
     (SHRA). SHRA manages many housing and community development activities including: Conventional
     Housing or Low Rent Public Housing and Section 8 Certificate and Voucher Program. The Conventional
     Housing Program is housing developments that are managed and maintained by SHRA. The Section 8
     Certificate Program is a tenant-based rental subsidy administered by the agency. Qualified families are
General Plan Background Report
City of Citrus Heights                                    2-91                                     Population and Housing

    selected and certified from a waiting list. The qualified family can utilize the Certificate at any “decent, safe
    and sanitary housing.” The tenant’s portion of the rent is based on 30% of the adjusted family gross income.
    SHRA subsidizes the difference between the tenant’s portion and the rent. However, the actual rent is
    restricted by Fair Market Rents (FMR), as determined by HUD. The Section 8 Voucher Program is basically
    the same as the Certificate Program, except the tenant’s housing choice is not restricted by the Fair Market
    Rents.
    SHRA manages 163 conventional housing units and approximately 400 Section 8 certificates or vouchers in
    Citrus Heights.
3. HUD – Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds – The City of Citrus Heights is an entitlement
    city through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Grants are awarded annually for
    general activities (including housing) and infrastructure. The City of Citrus Heights could utilize CDBG funds
    for acquisition of “at-risk” properties and housing rehabilitation activities. Proceeds from those activities
    could be deposited into a revolving loan fund established from low interest loans for rehabilitation and could
    be a resource for housing and preservation activities. HUD offers various programs that can be utilized by the
    City, non-profit or for-profit agencies for the preservation of low income units, such as Section 202 and
    Section 108 (loan guarantee). The City receives approximately $570,000 a year in CDBG funds.
4. Low Income Housing Fund – Citrus Heights adopted an impact fee based on square footage of non-residential
    building permits. The impact fees are accumulated in an account to be used for low income housing. As
    development has slowed in recent years, it is anticipated this fund will receive little to no commercial
    mitigation fees in the coming years.
5. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) – Federal law requires that Banks, Savings and Loans, Thrifts, and their
    affiliated mortgaging subsidiaries, annually evaluate the credit needs for public projects in communities
    where they operate. Part of the City’s efforts in developing preservation programs, should be meeting with
    local lenders to discuss future housing needs which may be within the guidelines of the Community
    Reinvestment Act. Although an unpredictable resource, it is important to establish a working relationship for
    future problem solving.
6. Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC) – The LIHTC Program provides for federal and state tax
    credits for private developers and investors who agree to set aside all or an established percentage of their
    rental units for low income households for no less than 30 years. Projects generally have affordability terms
    of 30 or 55 years. Tax credits can be utilized on rehabilitation project and/or acquisition of “at-risk” units.
                                                                                           General Plan Background Report
Population and Housing                                    2-92                                        City of Citrus Heights

     Developers and investors must apply for an allocation of tax credits from the California Tax Credit Allocation
     Committee (CTCAC). Tax credits are awarded on a competitive basis at varying times. Compliance is
     monitored according to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules and regulations.
7. California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) – CHFA offers permanent financing for acquisition and
     rehabilitation to for-profit, non-profit and public agency developers, seeking to preserve “at-risk” units.
     Additionally, CHFA offers low interest predevelopment loans to non-profit sponsors in the
     Acquisition/Rehabilitation Program.
8. Affordable Housing Programs (AHP) – The AHP is facilitated by the Federal Home Loan Bank System
     which offers direct subsidies on interest rates for affordable housing. Local service is provided by the San
     Francisco Federal Home Loan Bank District. Interest rate subsidies under the AHP must be used to finance
     the purchase, construction, and/or rehabilitation of rental housing. At least 20% of the units are to be occupied
     by Very Low (less than 50% of AMI) households for the useful life of the housing or the mortgage term.
9. Acquisition and Rehabilitation (a component of the Multi-family Housing Program) is conducted through the
     California Department of Housing and Community Development for acquisition and rehabilitation of existing
     affordable rental housing. Priority is given to projects currently subject to regulatory restrictions that may be
     terminated. Assistance is in the form of low interest construction and permanent loans. Local government
     agencies, private nonprofit and for-profit organizations are eligible applicants.
2.34 GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
The ability of the private and public sectors to provide adequate housing and meet the needs of all economic
segments of the community can be constrained by various interrelated factors. Generally, these factors have been
divided into two categories: non-governmental constraints and governmental constraints. Non-governmental
constraints consist of land availability/environmental constraints, vacancy rates, cost of land, cost of construction
and the availability of financing. Governmental constraints consist of land use controls, building codes, fees and
enforcement, service and facility costs, planning application fees, development permit and approval processing
and local fair share efforts. In addition, providing adequate zoning opportunities for a variety of housing types
ensures development of housing to serve the various segments of the community. Energy efficiency encouraged
by the City aids in the reduction of month to month housing costs increasing the affordability of housing.
2.35 ZONING FOR A VARIETY OF HOUSING TYPES
The City’s Zoning Code provides for a variety of housing types throughout the City. Limited availability of land
for certain land uses may reduce the potential to develop a variety of housing types, however, the City has an
assortment of land available for these various housing types.

MULTI-FAMILY RENTAL HOUSING
Citrus Heights currently has a large supply of multi-family rental housing available. Currently, 10,549 units
(32%) of the multi-family units in the city are rentals. The Zoning Ordinance allows duplexes on properties zoned
RD-5 or higher and multi-unit dwellings are permitted on RD-10 and RD15-30 zoned parcels by right. In
addition, multi-family housing is permitted in LC, SC, and GC commercial zoning designations.
EMERGENCY SHELTERS
Currently, the Domestic Violence Intervention Center (DVIC) is located within the City of Citrus Heights. This
shelter provides emergency and transitional housing for victims of domestic violence. In 2010, in light of SB2, the
City updated its Emergency Shelter requirements. Emergency Shelters are permitted by right with specific
development standards in the GC zone which is found throughout the city. Emergency Shelters are not permitted
immediately adjacent to any RD-1 through RD-7 zoned property, within 300 feet of another Shelter,or within
1,000 feet of an elementary school, middle school, high school, public library, or public park.
Emergency shelters are also required to be located within one-half mile of a transit stop (located throughout the
City) or provide evidence that transit access will be available between the facility and other transit. Emergency
shelters are limited to a maximum of 75 beds by right, however, in the event of a disaster or with a City Council
approved Use Permit, an emergency shelter may exceed 100 beds.
Specific design features are required for emergency shelters including the following:
1. A Courtyard or other in-site area for outdoor client congregation, so that clients waiting for services are not
    required to use the public sidewalk for queuing.
2. Telephones for use by clients.
3. On-site personnel during hours of operation when clients are present. The manager’s area shall be located
    near the entry to the facility.
4. Adequate interior and exterior lighting.
5. Secure areas for personal property.
6. Other facilities as recommended by the Police Department prior to Zoning Clearance Approval.
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report
Population and Housing                                    2-94                                       City of Citrus Heights

TRANSITIONAL AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING
Transitional and Supportive Housing are both considered residential uses by the Zoning Code. Residential Care
Facilities for six or fewer clients are permitted by right in all residential zones. Facilities that provide transitional
or supportive housing for 7–20 clients require a use permit in all residential zones (not permitted in Mobile Home
or Open Space Zoning) and facilities serving 21 or more clients are allowed in RD10–RD30 Zoning with a Use
Permit. In 2010, the Cityupdated its zoning code to include an explicit definition of Transitional and Supportive
Housing. The definitions include language that clarifies these uses shall be treated as residential care facilities and
the relevant development standards should apply. Transitional and Supportive Housing are subject to the same
development standards as single dwelling units and generally require Building Permit review to ensure
conformance. Typical Plan Review time frames for first plan check range between 10 and 15 business days.
SINGLE-ROOM OCCUPANCY
Single-room occupancy projects are permitted with a Use Permit in the GC zone which is found throughout the
city.
HOUSING FOR AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYEES
Current estimates indicate that there 7,600 farm activities employees in the Sacramento PMSA. Given the built
out nature of the City, there are scarce numbers of acres in farm production (if any) and subsequently a negligible
need for farm worker housing. The needs of farm workers are addressed through the general affordable housing
strategies in the Housing Element.
FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING AND MOBILE HOMES
Factory-built and Mobile homes are currently permitted in all residential zoning designations throughout the City.
Currently, 5.3 percent of the households in the City are in mobile or factory built homes. The majority of these
homes are located within the ten mobile home parks located within the City. Factory built and Mobile Homes are
subject to the development standards of the applicable residential zoning district. The City will conduct annual
assessment with the Mobile Home park owners and residents to evaluate the potential for partnerships for
improvements and ownership opportunities in the City’s mobile home parks.
SECONDARY DWELLING UNITS
Secondary dwelling units are permitted by right in all residential zoning districts except MH and O. Secondary
units are required to meet the development standards outlined in the Zoning Ordinance. Over twenty secondary
dwelling units have been constructed since 2003.

MIXED USE PROJECTS
Mixed use projects are permitted in the LC, SC, GC, and AC zones. Since the 2006 update of the Zoning Code,
one project, Antelope Commons, a mixed-use office/residential project, has been approved . The City adopted the
Boulevard Plan in 2005 including development standards that encourage mixed use development along the
corridor. The City has invested over $16-million in public improvements along Auburn Boulevard to encourage
private investment and redevelopment of this older commercial area. The City also developed the Antelope
Crossing Transformation Plan which includes guidelines that are supportive of mixed use and residential units
within an existing commercial center. Live/work and Work/live units are permitted with a MUP in the BP, LC,
and with a Use Permit in the SC and GC zones.
2.36 NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
According to the California Government Code, a housing element shall contain “An analysis of potential and
actual non-governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all
income levels, including the availability of financing, the cost of land, and the cost of construction.” These and
other non-governmental constraints are discussed below.
LAND AVAILABILITY/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
In 1997, the City of Citrus Heights was the largest incorporation in California history. The City incorporated
approximately 14.2 square miles (9,088 acres) of which 95% was developed. Currently, the city is practically land
locked by the City of Roseville and the communities of Orangevale, Fair Oaks, Carmichael, Foothill Farms and
North Highlands.
According to the vacant land survey, there are approximately 81 acres of residential vacant land in the City of
Citrus Heights. Despite the apparent lack of available land, there are a variety of housing choices.
Although the City of Citrus Heights is mostly built-out, natural and biological resources remain scattered
throughout the city boundaries. Generally, the cities biological resources can be found in the Cripple Creek and
Arcade Creek areas in the form of foothill riparian woodland and interior live oak woodland corridors. These
corridors are a small portion of the cities total land and pose a negligible constraint on housing in the City.
VACANCY RATES
The minimum desirable vacancy rate from a consumer’s perspective is considered to be between five and eight
percent. Generally, when the vacancy rate falls below this level, prospective renters and buyers may experience
increasing costs.
                                                                                           General Plan Background Report
Population and Housing                                     2-96                                       City of Citrus Heights

The overall housing unit vacancy rate for the City of Citrus Heights was 3% in 2012. This is a 3.3% decrease
from 2007. This level of vacancy indicates a high level of demand for housing that is met by current supply.
Owner occupied units have held a steady 1% vacancy rate. Renter-occupied units have gone from 7.9% in 2009to
3.6% in 2012, continuing a trend toward a “balanced market”.
Over the last seven years (2005–2012) annual apartment vacancy rates have remained between 3.6 and 7.9%.
Despite lower vacancy rates, rents have remained flat. Average rents for all unit types and sizes have decreased
4.2% in the last four years, from $864.00/month to $828.00/month; and less than 1% over the last year from $824
in 2011. (Real Facts, 2012)

COST OF LAND
The cost of raw, developable land has a direct impact on the cost of a new home and is, therefore, a potential non-
governmental constraint. The higher the raw land costs, the higher the price of a new home. Normally, developers
will seek to obtain city approvals for the largest number of lots obtainable on a given parcel of raw land. This
allows the developer to spread the costs for off-site improvements (i.e., streets, water lines, etc.) over the
maximum number of lots.
According to Sacramento County a check of February 2012 listings on Loopnet.com revealed that vacant low
density and medium zoned property within the County as being listed at between $19,000 and $36,000 per acre.
Loopnet’s February 2012 listings included a variety of vacant multifamily zoned land (15-20 du/ac), ranging in
size from 0.46 acre to 5.5 acres, with asking prices between $102,000 and $174,240 per acre. These price points
are representative of the region’s significant downturn in the residential real estate market. A comparison of
asking prices during the prior planning period indicates multifamily zoned land was in the $380,000 to $1.3
million per acre range (Sacramento Housing Element 2008-2013, pg 7-51).Current land values (September 2012)
in Citrus Heights are difficult to determine due to the current state of the housing market and current economic
downturn. Assigning a value to land is difficult or impossible in today’s market due to the volatility of the
housing market. Numerous variables in the housing market and historically low interest rates makes it nearly
impossible to determine land values in the State.
The land area in the City of Citrus Heights is over 98% built out. Available vacant residential land will become
more scarce over time, especially, considering the lack of annexation opportunities. Most likely, the cost of vacant
land will eventually increase in the City of Citrus Heights. However, as a general rule, if the land cost component
in the City of Citrus Heights remains within 35%, then the availability of land should not pose a significant
constraint on the development of housing for all income groups.
UTILITY CAPACITY AND CONSTRAINTS
The affordability of development can be impacted by the availability and capacity of utilities in the City. Due to
the built out nature of the City, virtually all the land is served with a variety of utilities:
ELECTRIC
The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District (SMUD) provides electricity in the City. Generally electricity service
is available, however, in some cases electricity is required to be undergrounded or extended to provide for the
development. SMUD has no irregular capacity issues in the area.
                                                                                                General Plan Background Report
Population and Housing                                       2-98                                          City of Citrus Heights

SEWER
The City is served by the Sacramento Area Sewer District (Formally CSD-1). A minimal number of parcels are
served by onsite septic. All new development is required to remove any existing septic systems and connect to the
sewage system. Recently the Sewer District has started construction on a multi-million dollar sewer interceptor
project to ensure the capacity of the system will last well into the future.
DRAINAGE
An extensive drainage system serves to collect rainwater throughout the City. The system utilizes a combination
of human-made drainage features and natural creeks to distribute surface water runoff. Each new development in
the City is required to evaluate potential drainage issues and, if required, install drainage facilities. The Vacant
Land and Pending Project inventory considered drainage impacts and constraints on development.
WATER
Three water purveyors provide water throughout the City: Citrus Heights Water District, California American
Water, and the Sacramento Suburban Water District. These water agencies have historically provided sufficient
water supply and indicate the water supply is sufficient for build-out conditions. They continue to develop
additional groundwater supplies to provide backup water in the advent of a drought or infrastructure failure.
Generally, new developments are required to abandon existing wells and tie into the water system dependent on
the water purveyor and site conditions.
COST OF CONSTRUCTION
The costs of labor and materials have a direct impact on the cost of housing and are the main component of
housing cost. The cost of residential construction can vary greatly depending upon the quality of material and size
of the home being constructed. The following table compares construction costs from 1990 to 2012 and shows
current trends in the cost of construction in the other regions of California, excluding San Francisco and Los
Angeles.

AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING
One of the significant components to overall housing cost is the financing. After decades of slight fluctuations in
the prevailing rate, the 1980’s saw a rise in interest rates which peaked at approximately 18.8% in 1982. As the
decade closed and the economy weakened, the prevailing interest rate was around ten percent. The decade of the
1990’s has seen interest rates drop dramatically, fluctuating between six and eight percent. Through the mid-
2000’s the rates on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage have varied between 6.25 and 7.0%. Since 2007, interest rates
were gradually reduced to record lows, typically under 4%, but as low as 3.25% . Shortly after the collapse of the
housing market, loans were quite difficult to qualify for, however, since 2009, changes in the mortgage industry
and availability of low interest rates have dramatically improved the ability to qualify for financing.
As discussed in the housing affordability section of the community profile, housing prices have dropped over 50%
from the 2005 peak. Recently, median sales prices have stabilized and remain relatively flat at$169,900. As Table
2-57 shows, the current median sales price, combined with record low interest rates have enabled the area median
income family to afford median priced homes in Citrus Heights. As interest rates rise, affordable loan amounts
decrease, down payment increases, and the maximum purchase price decreases. If interest rates climb extensively,
and home prices increase dramatically, households may find themselves priced out of the market.

2.37 GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
The purpose of this section is to analyze constraints on housing development through local governmental actions,
such as land use controls, permit procedures and fees. In addition, any efforts to mitigate governmental constraints
are presented in this section.
LAND USE CONTROLS
The zoning code is the major guide for policies in residential development. These policies establish and control
the distribution of residential land in the City of Citrus Heights. The City of Citrus Heights Zoning Code was
comprehensively updated in November 2006. The residential land use zones and their respective maximum
densities are shown in the following table.

Constraint on housing development is influenced by the amount of land designated for residential use and the
density and lot sizes at which development is permitted. According to the vacant land survey, 81 acres of vacant
land, 53 acres of pending development and 247 acres of underutilized land is designated in various zones and lot
sizes.

In addition to zoning and minimum lot sizes, Citrus Heights further controls land use through residential
development standards. Generally, single family, duplexes, and mobile homes have the same maximum height of
30 feet and minimum setbacks of 15-20 feet in the front yard and 20–25 feet in the rear yard. Each unit in the
City requires a minimum of 2 parking spaces and most developments include a personal safety standard for door
and window security. Multiple family structures are allowed three stories or 50 feet in height, but must be setback
from single family residences 25–100 feet depending on the height of the structure. Multiple family buildings,
roofed areas and parking facilities may not cover more than 60% of the site and each building should have a
minimum of 10–30 feet on each face of the building depending on the height.
The above residential development standards are not considered a significant constraint on the development of
housing in the City. For example, multi-family units are allowed a height of three stories and maximum site
coverage of 60%. In addition, multi-family sites may size up to 25% of parking spaces for compact spaces. These
standards provide flexibility that will allow a developer to maximize a parcel of land.
Within the residential development standards are architectural standards. These architectural standards are
considered a minimum constraint on development and provide a significant long term benefit to the citizens and
the community as a whole.
Also within the residential development standards are standards for condominium conversions and single room
occupancy residential facilities. Emergency shelter standards are provided within Zoning Code.
PERMIT PROCESS
The City works closely with the community and developers to ensure the approval process is expedited so as not
to put any unnecessary timing constraints on development. Typically, staff offers applicants a presubmittal
conference and has the ability to review any potential project issues at the bi-weekly interdepartmental meetings.
The interdepartmental meetings allow discussion of potential project components with the various departments
including Public Works, Building, Planning, Fire and Citrus Heights Water District. This affords the City the
ability to provide the applicant feedback regarding a potential project prior to a formal application and fee being
submitted.
The Zoning Code stipulates the various types of residential uses permitted by right, permitted with a Minor Use
Permit or Permitted with a Use permit. Permitted uses are allowed without discretionary review, in designated
areas as long as the project complies with the requisite development standards. Minor Use permits are approved
by the Community and Economic Development Director, and Use Permits are approved by the Planning
Commission unless appealed. Projects may be appealed to the Planning Commission and generally get priority
scheduling and the fee for the appeal is $250. Typical findings for permits ensure the project is consistent with

the Zoning Code, consistent with the General Plan, the project site is suitable for development, and the project
addresses general health and safety concerns.
Complicated or larger projects may require multiple discretionary permits. Typically, projects that require
multiple discretionary permits are processed concurrently. For example, if a mixed use development is proposed,
a tentative subdivision map, a use permit, and a design review permit are required and will be heard by the
Planning Commission concurrently. Generally, once a formal application has been submitted, staff will route the
project to the various stakeholders, including the Neighborhood Associations for comments. Comments from all
the stakeholders are due back to the Planning Department within 14 days. Once comments are received,
timeframes for processing vary dependent on the completeness of the application. Table 2-61 depicts the typical
processing timeframes experienced for project hearing and a decision to be made. Once staff has determined the
project has been deemed complete, Staff prepares an environmental document (a majority of smaller projects
receive a categorical exemption, larger projects typically require a Mitigated Negative Declaration) and a Staff
Report. Most projects are heard solely by the Planning Commission except in the event of a General Plan
Amendment, Rezone, or an appeal.

SECOND DWELLING UNITS
On July 1, 2003 the Zoning Code complied with Government Code section 65852.2, and in November 2006 the
City adopted an updated Zoning Code, which included an updated section about Second Dwelling units. This
section provides guidelines for applicants considering adding a second dwelling unit to their property, including
provisions to ensure compliance with the development standards of the Zoning Code. In accordance with State
law, these projects are approved at Staff level and the design and development standards are evaluated
concurrently with the building permit.
Between July 1, 2003 and June 2012, 21 secondary dwelling units have been constructed. Although second units
are not produced in high volumes, they serve an important role in affordable housing and housing for changing
family needs. In 2012, the City conducted a second unit survey to determine various statistics about the second
                                                                                               General Plan Background Report

units that have been constructed in Citrus Heights. The Survey demonstrated that the majority of the second units
are either rented at affordable levels or provide a source of housing for a relative or family member at no cost,
resulting in an important source of affordable housing. There has been a continual demand for these units and , it
does not appear that the Second Dwelling Unit section of the Zoning Code constrains the development of these
units. Criteria for second units include:
►    Maximum Height Limit of 20 feet
►    Floor Area shall not exceed 60% of the primary dwelling unit or 1,200 square feet, whichever is less
►    Limited to two bedrooms maximum
►    Storage Area or Garage up to 400 square feet maximum, not included in the floor area calculations
►    One off-street parking space required
RESIDENTIAL DESIGN GUIDELINES
The November 2006 adoption of the Zoning Code included Residential Design Guidelines which includes
specific design objectives that serve as standards to evaluate Design Review Permits. The guidelines include
standards for both multi-family and single family development including encouraging quality finish materials,
deemphasizing garages, integrating open space, encouraging façade and roof articulation, promoting balconies,
porches and patios, and designing residences to an appropriate scale.
Staff works early in the process with potential developers or architects to ensure they understand the guidelines as
they develop their designs for residential development. While there are no cost provisions in the guidelines, the
intent is to inform applicants early in the process, what is expected for development in Citrus Heights. As
previously mentioned, Design Review typically occurs concurrently with other development applications and
therefore is subject to the timeframe required for the relative entitlement.
CODE ENFORCEMENT
The City of Citrus Heights conducts a Code Enforcement Program, which addresses concerns of housing stock
preservation and blight. The code enforcement program was created to address housing and blight issues where
the safety of residents, neighbors or the general public may be affected by substandard and unsanitary conditions
on a property. Some violations include: surfacing sewage, lack of running water, unsafe electrical wiring or other
utility connections, roof leaks, infestations of mice, cockroaches or other disease carrying pests and the
accumulation of household garbage.
The City receives requests or complaints and then contacts the property owner by mail to advise them of the
alleged violations and give them an opportunity to correct the situation. If owners fail to comply in a reasonable

time, inspections are made and fees are levied. Through cooperation with owners, minimal effects on tenants and
property owners is realized.
ON- AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS
The City of Citrus Heights requires developers to provide a full complement of on-site and off-site improvements
including streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, drainage, water, sewer, electric and communications utilities. Along
exterior unimproved roadways, developers are required to construct one-half of the street, including curbs,
sidewalks and drainage. Further traffic mitigation may also be required depending on the scope of the
development.
Street improvement standards often impact housing costs due to the high costs of materials and construction costs
associated with the improvements. The City continues to utilize the Sacramento County Improvement Standards
for all new streets and street widening found throughout the City. Street widths range from 40-feet for minor
residential to 130-feet for a special thoroughfare (See Table 2-63).

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES
Developers of new residential projects pay several types of development impact fees to offset the indirect costs of
the project. Currently, the City of Citrus Heights imposes three fees. The first is a Road & Transit fee, which
averages $1,434 per unit depending on which district the development is in. The districts are based on the distance
of the development from interstate highways. The second is a drainage fee. The fee schedule is complicated and
depends on the density of the development. The development impact fees for a 2,000 square foot single-family
home totals approximately $22,160. The City charges Park Impact fees which are used to finance park and
recreation facilities.

 A number of public services are provided to Citrus Heights residents by utility or service districts rather than the
   City. Sacramento Metropolitan Fire provides fire protection and sewage treatment services; the Citrus Heights
Water District, California Suburban Water District and California American Water District provide water service;
the San Juan Unified School District provides educational services and the fees are determined individually by
each of these groups.
It should be noted that the previous table is not a complete list of developer impact fees. Fees can vary widely
within cities and counties depending on the financial arrangements that regional governments have with

developers for certain subdivisions or planning areas. Also, the fees listed above are for new single family
construction. Fees are generally lower per unit for new multi-family construction. In May 2008 the City adopted a
Development Fee deferral policy that allows the Development Fees to be postponed until Certificate of
Occupancy, subject to approval from the Community and Economic Development Director. The objective is to
eliminate upfront costs to allow projects to move forward in the process.
PLANNING APPLICATION FEES
A brief survey shows that the planning application fees charged by the City of Citrus Heights are vary when
compared to other nearby cities .. For example, Citrus Heights imposed a fee of $11,133 for a rezone, while
Rocklin and Sacramento County imposed $11,434and $26,341, respectively. The City of Roseville, in most
cases, charges a “full cost” to applicants. The full cost is based on an hourly estimate of the staff requirement to
review the application or the scope of work. Reportedly, the full cost is usually reasonable in comparison to the
City of Sacramento.
The City of Citrus Heights completed a review of all planning application fees and updated the current schedule
in 2006.
CUMULATIVE FEES
New Development is generally tasked with payment of fees from three areas: any onsite improvements,
development fees, and Planning Application Fees. Cumulative fees vary dramatically depending on the type of
project and the site. Public Improvements required are generally the most costly portion for new development and
are the portion of the cumulative fees that are the most difficult to predict.
To offset the upfront cost associated with these fees, the City has a policy on parcel maps. This policy allows
some public improvements to be deferred on a case by case basis. City policy also permits deferral of
development fees until after issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy in certain cases. For projects that provide
affordable housing, the City has deferred fees or secured alternative funding sources to encourage affordable
housing on a case by case basis.
In addition, the City has a supply of sewer credits it can apply toward development, on a case by case basis, which
helps reduce the fees associated with sewer connections.

FAIR HOUSING
The City actively promotes the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the California
Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) and regional non-profits to any resident with a question
related to fair housing. In addition, the City distributes information through the City’s website and has brochures
and handbooks available at City Hall, Library, and provides direct mailings upon request. The City also partners
with regional non-profits to provide trainings to both tenants and landlords on renter’s rights and responsible
rental practices. Most importantly the City’s Neighborhood Associations are provided information regarding fair
housing and distribute brochures to residents that participate in these meetings or residents they see are in need.
DEVELOPMENT PERMIT AND APPROVAL PROCESSING
The processing time required to obtain approval of development permits is often cited as a contributing factor to
the high cost of housing. For some proposed development projects, additional time is needed to complete the
environmental review process before an approval can be granted. Unnecessary delays add to the cost of
construction by increasing land holding costs and interest payments.

Applications for special permits, such as variances and conditional use permits, are made in writing to the
Community and Economic Development Department and include: a map with neighboring property lines, a list of
neighboring property owners, an indication of the applicants interests, legal description, proposed use, statement
of proposed hazardous materials handling, environmental information form, site plan, and any other information
that the Director may require. The following actions require public hearings: Use Permits, Major Variances,
appeals of actions on conditional use permits and variances and revocation hearings for use permits, Design
Review Permits, and Subdivision Maps. A notice is provided to neighboring properties ten days prior to the
hearing. The public hearing body issues a decision within 30 days of the conclusion of the hearing. In general,
permits can be processed in three to six months. Special permits undergo expedited processing in Citrus Heights
and therefore do not cause any unnecessary delays or increases in the cost of housing.
Review of some residential development plans includes the following:

New Subdivision Design review for completeness is completed within thirty calendar days. An approval of
determination is based on General Plan consistency, character of adjacent land uses, adequate size and shape of
lot, zoning compliance and conformance to design standards. An approved Design Review plan is in effect for
two years and one year extensions are available. In general, a development plan review takes 45 days with a staff
development review and 90 days when involving the Planning Commission. Extraordinary Neighborhood Review
and involvement as well as the infill nature of development in the City often require longer approval periods.
Various development review activities (such as general plan amendments, zone changes, and specific plans)
require the preparation of an environmental impact report (EIR) before a project can be approved. The need to
prepare an EIR can substantially lengthen the development review process, often taking up to one year to obtain
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report

project approval. However, the preparation of an EIR is not considered to disproportionately affect the marginal
cost of a residential project in the City of Citrus Heights.
In sum, the amount of time required to process development review activities is not currently considered a
significant constraint to the development of housing. However, the costs associated with development review can
change and steps should be taken to monitor the efficiency of the review process.
2.38 OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
Energy-related housing costs can directly impact the affordability of housing in Northern California; therefore
energy conservation is an important portion of the Citrus Heights General Plan. In 2011, the City performed a
focused General Plan Update that included a sustainability focus including the adoption of a Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Plan (GGRP). The City’s General Plan has established a goal of reducing the City’s GHG emissions by
10-15% below 1990 levels by 2020. Energy consumption from existing residential and commercial properties
accounts for 41% of the City’s GHG emissions (second, only to transportation).
Because the City is 98% built out, energy efficiency in existing developed properties is a key to achieving the
City’s GHG emission goals. As a result the GGRP includes 47 measures and action items to reduce energy
consumption. Together these measures will result in a reduction of 43,857 CO2e annually (equivalent to the
annual energy demand of 3,445 homes).
Rather than require or mandate energy efficiency (which can lead to lower housing affordability), the City has
approached energy efficiency within the community by leading by example. The GGRP’s measures are voluntary,
however the City has been proactive in providing outreach and educational efforts related to energy efficiency.
In general, the City enforces the State building code standards which contain mandatory energy efficiency
requirements (Title 24) for new development. Homebuilders are required to comply with these standards while
the City is responsible for enforcing the Title 24 standards. In addition to the State requirements the City has
several policies and programs which encourage energy conservation:
►    Encourage energy conservation and efficiency in building design, lighting, orientation and construction.
►    The Design Guidelines in the Zoning Ordinance encourage energy efficient design.
►    Explore use of grant funds and programs with SMUD and non-profit agencies to establish programs for home
     weatherization and solar retrofit.

►    The City joined SMUD’s solar partnership program that will assist residents installing money-saving,
     renewable energy solar systems. This partnership program waives permit fees, reduces application review
     time, as well offers prompt post-inspections of solar energy systems.
►    In cooperation with SMUD, PG&E, the California Energy Commission, and other public utilities, subject all
     municipal buildings to an energy audit and perform practical energy conservation alterations on municipal
     buildings. Such alterations may include modifying automatic heating and cooling systems, lighting, and
     installation of natural ventilation and solar hot water systems.
     •   In 2001 and 2004, the City conducted two audits through SMUD and reviewed their findings and
         suggestions for energy efficiency.
     •   Any and all equipment that has needed to be replaced has been replaced with as efficient a unit or system
         as cost would allow.
     •   Major changes to existing buildings have and will be worked into future campus overhaul projects.
►    Consider ordinances that would require energy audits, solar access, insulation, solar retrofit, and solar water
     heating.
►    The City constructed the first LEED Gold Certified building in Citrus Heights, the Citrus Heights Community
     Center. The Citrus Heights Community Center is a gathering place for the community that also leads by
     example by utilizing energy efficient design and providing solar power for the building.
►    The City has amended its Zoning Code to encourage energy conserving design. The City intends on updating
     the Zoning Ordinance as technology and energy efficiency change.
►    Promote comprehensive tree planting and maintenance program in order to reduce ambient air temperature on
     hot sunny days, and require that all tree plantings and outdoor lighting be integrated.
The City of Citrus Heights General Plan encourages development of mixed use project along the City’s corridors
and the Zoning Ordinance allows development of residential units in commercial zones. Encouraging mixed uses
allows an emphasis on pedestrian design and allows citizens to live close to their jobs resulting in a reduction of
the reliance on motorized vehicles, which will also result in reduced energy consumption.
The City of Citrus Heights is approximately 98 percent built out. The development that occurs in the City is
considered infill development. According to the Urban Land Institute publication Growing Cooler, “Developing
infill housing within a more urban core has been shown to reduce the primary energy consumption an average of
20 percent per household over newer sprawl developments.”

2.39 INVENTORY OF LAND SUITABLE FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
State law requires “An inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
having potential for redevelopment,…” This inventory must identify adequate sites which will be made available
relative to appropriate zoning and development standards and with public services and facilities needed to
facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of housing types for households of all income levels.
Citrus Heights has a variety of residential lands that result in unique neighborhoods and varying densities. At
build-out, a majority of residential lands will be low density residential. At the same time, approximately one-fifth
of the residential lands are designated very low with density ranges from one to four units per acre. Another
21.4% of the lands will be medium density residential, up to 20 units per acre and two percent of the lands will be
high density, up to 30 units per acre.

2.40 LAND INVENTORY
In preparation for the 2012 Housing Element update, all vacant residentially zoned parcels within the City, all
residential projects in the pipeline, and underutilized commercially zoned parcels within the Auburn Boulevard
Planning Area and Antelope Crossing Planning were inventoried. The 2013 land inventory found a total of 81
acres of vacant residential available land, 53.3acres of land currently in the pipeline, and 247.6 acres of
underutilized land currently available for residential development.

VACANT LAND
In the fall of 2012, the City researched the GIS map database to find all available land for residential
development. Approximately seventy-eight acres of vacant land are available in residentially zoned parcels, 4.9
acres of which is land zoned RD-20 or above as shown on Table 2-67a. The zoning ordinance allows for
residential development to occur in commercially zoned properties, however, the land inventory does not account
for commercially zoned land except for areas targeting mixed-use or residential development - Auburn Boulevard
and Antelope Crossing – See Underutilized Land, below.
The City currently has a total of 78.4 acres of vacant land available for residential development within the City’s
current limits. The vacant land is scattered throughout the City and no vacant land was found zoned for mobile
home parks.
If all available land was developed to the maximum permissible density, the City could produce an additional
548 units. History has shown that lots tend to be developed at approximately 50% of the maximum permissible
density. The calculation of the units that can be produced from available land has been adjusted accordingly. The
adjusted total, or the total expected units to be developed on vacant land is 173.
A total of 37.1 acres of vacant land were identified in the very low density residential areas throughout 35 lots,
resulting in an average lot size just over one acre. Also, the 31 lots in low density residential average
approximately one acre and the average size of the remaining 10 medium density parcels is 0.49 acres.
A minimal amount of vacant land (4.98 acres) is available in medium and high density zoned areas (RD-20, SPA).
At the expected density of development, this land can produce 25 units.
The City allows the residential housing in commercial zones at densities of up to 20 units per acre. This allows for
higher density developments, which typically are lower cost and serve lower income households.
UNDERUTILIZED LAND
The City has a substantial supply of underutilized land in all land use designations scattered throughout the City
Limits. Underutilized land - defined as land that is not vacant and has some development potential, is available for
land development. The Inventory identifies underutilized land in both residential zones (usually has some sort of
residential structure or residential accessory structure) and commercial zones within the Auburn Boulevard
Special Planning Area and the Antelope Crossing Planning Area. Although residential development is permitted
in all commercial areas throughout the City, the City expects residential development is most likely to occur in the
Auburn Boulevard and Antelope Crossing areas as the City has invested in Public Improvements and regulatory
changes to encourage this type of development in these areas.
                                                                                           General Plan Background Report

The City currently has a total of 248 acres of underutilized land available for residential development within the
City’s current limits including 158 acres of which is within the Auburn Boulevard (112 acres) and Antelope
Crossing (46 acres) as shown on Table 2-67b. The remaining 90 acres of the underutilized land is zoned
residential.
The Underutilized inventory involved a case by case review of all residentially zoned properties to determine
realistic capacity of each parcel. The Auburn Boulevard Plan and the Antelope Crossing Transformation Plan
included detailed buildout scenario analysis resulting in build out yields for each plan. The Underutilized
inventory included a conservative estimate derived from the planning area build out scenarios to determine the
likely number of units to be produced within the Housing Element planning period. Based on the underutilized
inventory, 396 units can be accommodated on underutilized land throughout the City.

PENDING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
2000 through 2007 saw a boom of residential development projects throughout the Region and State. Although
the peak of this building boom was in 2005, numerous development projects were approved in the City from 2006
                                                                                                           General Plan Background Report
Population and Housing                                              2-118                                              City of Citrus Heights
through 2007. Several legislative bills have extended the life of these pending projects, so some projects that were
approved in 2006 or 2007 are still pending projects.
Over 53 acres of residential development has been approved or is in the process of being reviewed, and are
considered pipeline projects. These pipeline projects result in 329 new residential units of various densities, or
283 units based on the default density.
The Vacant, Pending, and Underutilized Land Inventory includes the pipeline projects the City has reviewed. The
default density for these pending projects includes a total of 283 units, 140 of which are located on property zoned
RD-20 or higher as shown on Table 2-67c.
The City has several properties in the Vacant and Pending and Underutilized Inventory located within the RD-20
zoning district, 160 (140 Default) of which are part of Fountain Place, a 12.8± acre multi-family development
located on Stock Ranch Road (Pending Project DD). Fountain Place can provide 160 (140 Default) units of RD-
20 zoned land which would accommodate nearly half of the requirement of Low and Very Low income housing
for the planning period. Although this project is entitled, the project applicant has decided to not exercise his right
to purchase the property.
In addition to Fountain Place, a 3.87 acre parcel located on Sunrise Blvd (Underutilized ParcelA) is zoned RD-30
which also serves to accommodate 93 units of Low to Very Low income, thus, combined with Fountain Place,
these parcels provide nearly 95 percent of the RHNA allocation. Several other smaller parcels zoned RD-20 or
higher exist which may provide additional opportunities to provide affordable housing, however, it is unknown if
size constraints will limit the density of the housing on the smaller parcels.
Although it is possible for the City to absorb a substantial portion of its RHNA allocation of 696 units, with its
pending projects, the City has conducted additional review for Pending Projects. The City is concerned that some
of the pending projects may never materialize or the project approval may expire prior to construction being
started. Due to political uncertainty, the City is concerned that if some of these pending projects expire, a
subsequent replacement project may not be able to achieve the same densities previously approved. As such, City
staff has reviewed pending projects on a case by case basis to determine potential densities, should a replacement
project be required, and assigned a default density for all pending projects.
SUMMARY OF VACANT AND UNDERUTILIZED LAND AND PENDING PROJECTS
The City of Citrus Height’s fair share of regional housing needs is 696 housing units for the 2013-2021 planning
period, which is achievable given the suitable vacant and underutilized acreage and pipeline projects. Based on
the Inventory, the City can potentially accommodate 173 units on vacant land and 396 on underutilized land. In
addition, 19 residential projects are in the pipeline producing at least 283 units. Combining vacant and

underutilized land and pending projects, the City can accommodate 852 units, thereby exceeding the RHNA
allocation by approximately 156 units as shown on Table 2-67d. The RHNA also requires the City to
accommodate 146 Very Low and 102 Low income qualifying units. The City’s Producing Affordable Housing in
Citrus Heights – An alternative to the “Default Density” (Appendix A) analyzed the production of affordable
housing in Citrus Heights and determined that a density equal to or higher than RD-20 units can result in
affordable housing for Low and Very Low income. The Citrus Heights Vacant Pending and Underutilized
Inventory identifies potential for 453 units on vacant, pending, or underutilized RD-20 land or higher exceeding
the RHNA allotment for Low and Very Low.

OTHER CONSTRAINTS
Without knowing the actual housing assistance programs that will be available and/or the levels of funding, it is
not possible to predict what the actual split of potential units will be between the various income categories.
However, these sites can be developed with a range of housing types to meet the needs of all economic segments
of the community consistent with the housing need estimates and quantified objectives contained in this Section.
Due to the built-out characteristic of the City, adequate public services and facilities are either available at all
potential housing sites or improvements would be minimal.
Although the City of Citrus Heights is mostly built-out, natural and biological resources remain scattered within
the City’s boundaries. Generally, the City’s biological resources can be found in the Cripple Creek and Arcade
Creek riparian areas. These corridors have been designated with flood and natural stream overlay zones adopted
to preserve environmental resources and to protect other public interests, such as safety. The flood and natural
stream overlay zones are cumulatively considered a minor constraint on housing.
Citrus Heights allows for a variety of housing types in the zoning. For example, mobile homes are allowed in the
RD 1–7 zoning categories or the very low and low density residential General Plan designations. Accessory
dwelling units are also allowed by conditional use permit in RD 1–7 zones. In addition, other residential units are
                                                                                           General Plan Background Report

permitted in a variety of zones, such as: condominiums are allowed by development plan review in RD 1–30,
single room occupancy (SROs) are conditionally permitted in RD 10–30 and townhouse or cluster developments
are permitted in RD 10–30 with development plan review. Emergency Shelters are permitted in the general
commercial zone, based on development standards and locations requirements; otherwise, a use permit must be
approved by the City Council. Social rehabilitation centers are conditionally permitted in RD 1–30, business and
professional office, limited commercial and general commercial zones.

2.41 QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
To attain the State housing goal, the City established the number of housing units that can be built in the 2013-
2021 planning period by income group and housing unit type (i.e., construction, rehabilitation, conservation/
preservation). According to the City’s records, planned activities and recent market trends, Citrus Heights expects
to achieve 894 housing units that will be constructed, rehabilitated or conserved. For approxi over 300 of the 894
units, the City will order and facilitate major repairs over the next eight years. The vast majority of units
conserved are projected to serve Very Low and Low income groups.
To meet the City’s quantified objectives, the City has taken several steps to ensure that affordable housing will be
developed. The City has a Housing and Grants division with a dedicated staff person, the Development Specialist.
The duties of this staff person include managing the City’s federal housing and community development funds,
undertaking the primary workload of planning for affordable housing, developing and implementing City housing
programs, and serving as a resource for developers, residents, and City staff with regards to housing.

Note:
* City building records indicate approximately 40 remodel/additions are performed per year.
The City has also begun creating partnerships with local housing advocates and developers of affordable housing.
The City’s Development Specialist will meet personally with those wishing to develop affordable housing, and
guide developers through the development process with the City. The City Council will consider fee waivers and
deferrals for affordable housing, and permits the conversion of some commercial properties into high density
residential use and the development of mixed uses in transitionally zoned areas.
The City participates in the County-wide Emergency Housing Committee which has developed a 10-Year Plan to
deal with homelessness and other forms of special housing needs. This Committee develops an annual and long-
range strategic plan to combat homelessness and provide supportive services to dependent housing subgroups.

                                    4 NATURAL RESOURCES
4.1        INTRODUCTION
This chapter provides information regarding natural resources located within the City of Citrus Heights, based on
review of existing documentation from the City of Citrus Heights, Sacramento County and other surrounding
communities, as well as consultations with City and Sacramento County staff and field surveys.
4.2        WATER RESOURCES AND WATER QUALITY
Water resources are an important segment of the natural resources found within Citrus Heights. The quality of
water found in the City not only affects Citrus Heights but also users downstream, including the American River,
the Sacramento River, the Delta and ultimately the Pacific Ocean. The federal, state, and local governments all
have regulations to protect our water resources and water quality.
REGULATORY SETTING
FEDERAL
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is responsible for development and conservation of most water resources in the
western United States. The original purpose of the Bureau has changed from the reclamation of arid and semiarid
lands in the west, to current agency functions ranging from providing water supplies through the Central Valley
Project (CVP); generating hydroelectric power; providing irrigation water for agriculture; improving water
quality, flood control, and river navigation; providing river regulation and control and fish and wildlife
enhancement; offering water-based recreation opportunities; and conducting research on a variety of water-related
topics.
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), in cooperation
with other federal and state agencies, enforce the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) by evaluating the
potential for impacts on candidate, threatened, and endangered fish and wildlife resources.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is responsible for reviewing the placement of fill or discharge of
material into waters of the United States and issuing permits for fill into waters of the United States. Any project
that involves in-stream construction, such as dams or other types of diversion structures, triggers the need for

these permits and related environmental reviews by USACE. USACE also is responsible for flood control
planning and assisting state and local agencies with the design and funding of local flood control projects.
U.S. Geological Survey
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Use Information Program is responsible for compiling and
disseminating the nation’s water-use data. USGS works in cooperation with federal, state, and local
environmental agencies to collect water-use information at the local level.
Federal Clean Water Act of 1972
The Clean Water Act establishes the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into waters of the
United States and setting water quality standards for all contaminants in surface waters. Water quality standards
are designed to protect the public health or welfare, enhance the quality of water and serve the purposes of the
Clean Water Act. Thus, water quality standards must contain:
►   Designation of beneficial uses of water, and
►   Establishment of water quality criteria to protect those designated uses.
EPA’s Office of Water is responsible for implementing the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act
(described below). The Office provides guidance, specifies scientific methods and data collection requirements,
performs oversight, and facilitates communication among the federal, State, and local agencies that manage water
quality.
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
In 1972, the Clean Water Act was amended to provide that the discharge of pollutants to waters of the United
States from any point source is unlawful unless the discharge is in compliance with a National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. In California, the State Water Resources Control Board
(SWRCB) and Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCBs) are authorized to implement this program.
NPDES permits cover industrial and municipal discharges, discharges from storm sewer systems in larger cities,
storm water associated with numerous kinds of industrial activity, runoff from construction sites disturbing more
than one acre of soil, mining operations, and animal feedlots and agricultural facilities above certain thresholds.
Stormwater discharges from both large and small construction sites are now subject to NPDES requirements.
Large construction sites are those that involve one or more acres of soil disturbance. The SWRCB has issued an
NPDES General Permit for Discharges of Storm Water Associated with Construction Activity (General
Construction Permit) under the Clean Water Act. The permit requires the preparation of a Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) for proposed construction activities of greater than one acre in size. A SWPPP is an
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report
Natural Resources                                         4-2                                        City of Citrus Heights

operational plan that identifies and describes the Best Management Practices (BMPs) to be implemented at the
construction site to control pollution of stormwater runoff. Since 2008, small construction sites (those involving
disturbance of less than one acre of soil) have also required an NPDES permit as part of Phase II of EPA’s
NPDES Storm Water Program. Phase II is intended to further reduce adverse effects on water quality and aquatic
habitat by instituting the use of BMPs on previously unregulated sources of stormwater discharges that have the
greatest likelihood of causing continued environmental degradation (EPA 2000).
The Phase II requirements also impose new obligations on municipal separate stormwater systems (MS4s). Small
MS4s (i.e., those located in an incorporated city or a county of less than 100,000 people) that are located within
urbanized areas as defined by the U.S. Census must now be covered by a NPDES permit.
In the City of Citrus Heights, storm water discharge through the City's municipal storm drain system is managed
through a joint NPDES Permit with the County of Sacramento and the cities of Sacramento, Folsom, Rancho
Cordova, Elk Grove and Galt. The joint NPDES permit regulates all wet and dry weather runoff discharge in the
County, including the City of Citrus Heights. The joint permit requires implementation of a storm water
management program including the use of BMPs.
Wastewater discharges from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are also required to have an NPDES permit.
WWTPs are typically required to obtain individual permits from the RWQCB. The permits include findings,
discharge prohibitions, effluent limitations, provisions and self-monitoring requirements. The findings of the
NPDES permit process provide information about treatment plant design and operations, beneficial uses to be
protected, and applicable standards.
Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974
The Safe Drinking Water Act was originally passed by Congress in 1974 to protect public health by regulating the
quality of public drinking water. The law was amended in 1986 and 1996 and requires many actions to protect
drinking water and its sources, which are rivers, lakes, reservoirs, springs, and groundwater wells. The Safe
Drinking Water Act authorizes EPA to set national health-based standards for drinking water to protect against
pollutants. EPA, states, and local agencies then work together to make sure that these standards are met
(EPA 1999).
Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act
Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires states to develop lists of water bodies (or segments of water
bodies) that will not attain water quality standards after implementation of minimum required levels of treatment
by point source dischargers (e.g., municipalities and industries). Section 303(d) requires states to develop a total
maximum daily load (TMDL) for each of the listed pollutants and water bodies. A TMDL is the amount of

loading that the water body can receive and still meet water quality standards. The TMDL must include an
allocation of allowable loadings to point and nonpoint sources, with consideration of background loadings and a
margin of safety. NPDES permit limitations for listed pollutants must be consistent with the load allocation
prescribed in the TMDL.
The most recently approved (2002) Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list for California identifies various
waterways that are water quality impaired for a number of constituents. On July 25, 2003, EPA gave final
approval to California’s 2002 Section 303(d) List of Water Quality Limited Segments.
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act establishes a requirement to obtain a permit before conducting any activity
that involves any discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands. This
permit is issued by the USACE.
Section 401 Water Quality Certification
Section 401 of the Clean Water Act states that any person applying for a federal permit or license that may result
in the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States must obtain a state certification that the activity
complies with all applicable water quality standards, limitations, and restrictions. This certification is
administered in California by the SWRCB, via the RWQCBs. No license or permit may be granted by a federal
agency until certification required by Section 401 has been granted. Further, no license or permit may be issued if
certification has been denied. Section 401 water quality certifications are typically required in order to obtain a
Clean Water Act Section 404 permit from USACE.
National Toxics Rule and California Toxics Rule
In 1992, EPA promulgated the National Toxics Rule under the Clean Water Act to establish numeric criteria for
priority toxic pollutants for California. The National Toxics Rule established water quality standards for
42 pollutants not covered under California’s statewide water quality regulations at that time. As a result of the
court-ordered revocation of California’s statewide Basin Plans in September 1994, EPA initiated efforts to
promulgate additional federal water quality standards for California. In May 2000, EPA issued the California
Toxics Rule, which includes all the priority pollutants for which EPA has issued numeric criteria not included in
the National Toxics Rule.

STATE
California Department of Water Resources
The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) is responsible for preparation of the California Water
Plan, management of the State Water Project (SWP) 1, protection and restoration of the Sacramento–San Joaquin
River Delta (Delta), regulation of dams, provision of flood protection, and other functions related to surface water
and groundwater resources. These other functions include helping water agencies prepare their Urban Water
Management Plans (UWMPs) and reviewing such plans to ensure that they comply with the related Urban Water
Management Planning Act.
State Water Resources Control Board
In 1967, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) was created to administer state water rights and
water quality functions. The SWRCB and its nine RWQCBs administer water rights and enforce pollution control
standards throughout the state. The SWRCB is responsible for granting of water right permits and licenses
through an appropriation process following public hearings and appropriate environmental review by applicants
and responsible agencies. In granting water right permits and licenses, the SWRCB must consider all beneficial
uses, including water for downstream human and environmental needs. In addition to granting the water right
permits needed to operate new water supply projects, the SWRCB also issues water quality–related certifications
to developers of water projects under Section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act.
Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board
The Central Valley RWQCB is responsible for the preparation and implementation of basin water quality plans
consistent with the federal Clean Water Act. Enforcement of these plans ensures that local water quality is
protected. RWQCBs may become involved in water supply programs as a responsible agency with respect to
project effects on downstream beneficial uses. Citrus Heights is within the jurisdiction of the Central Valley
RWQCB.
California Department of Fish and Game
The California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is a responsible agency with respect to the review of water
right applications and also is responsible for issuing lake and streambed alteration permits for new water supply
projects, as appropriate. DFG works in coordination with federal and state agencies to mitigate the impacts of
projects on fish and wildlife resources, and is responsible for enforcing the California Endangered Species Act.
DFG often helps establish instream flows (minimum releases below a dam or diversion structure) to maintain

of a project.
Porter Cologne Water Quality Control Act of 1969
The Porter Cologne Water Quality Control Act, otherwise known as the California Water Code, is California’s
statutory authority for the protection of water quality. Under the Porter Cologne Act, the state must adopt water
quality policies, plans, and objectives that protect the state’s waters for the use and enjoyment of the people. The
Porter Cologne Act sets forth the obligations of the SWRCB and RWQCBs pertaining to the adoption of Basin
Plans and establishment of water quality objectives. It also authorizes the SWRCB and RWQCBs to issue and
enforce permits containing waste discharge requirements. Basin Plans establish beneficial uses, water quality
objectives, and implementation programs for each of the nine regions in California. Unlike the federal Clean
Water Act, which regulates only surface water, the Porter Cologne Act regulates both surface water and
groundwater.
Senate Bill 7
In 2009, California lawmakers passed, and the Governor subsequently signed, a package of four water policy bills
and a $11.14 billion bond bill devoted to water resources and conservation. These bills, termed the “2009 Water
Package,” provide for new management of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, set aggressive water conservation
targets, establish a Statewide groundwater monitoring program, and dedicate funds for increased enforcement of
illegal water diversions. A key component of the 2009 Water Package is Senate Bill (SB) 7, which expands water
conservation requirements for urban and agricultural water suppliers throughout California. The intent of these
requirements is to help the State meet its goal for reducing per capita water use by 20% in 2020. With limited
exceptions, starting in 2016, eligibility for State water grants and loans will be conditioned on meeting the
requirements of SB 7. An urban retail water supplier will not be eligible for a water grant or loan awarded or
administered by the State unless the supplier has met water use and conservation targets.
REGIONAL/LOCAL
Sacramento Stormwater Quality Partnership
Sacramento area public agencies, including the County of Sacramento and the Cities of Sacramento, Citrus
Heights, Elk Grove, Folsom, Galt, and Rancho Cordova, have joined together to form the Sacramento Stormwater
Quality Partnership (SSQP). The agencies work together to implement the conditions of the Sacramento
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System NPDES Stormwater Permit. In addition to implementation of the permit
requirements, the goals of the SSQP are to:

►    require developing projects to include pollution controls that will continue to operate after construction is
     complete.
The SSQP coordinates and cost-shares various major elements of its activities, including monitoring, target
pollutant reduction, special studies, regional public outreach, and program evaluation. The partnership members
also coordinate and cost-share selected construction/new development and commercial/industrial activities. The
County and City of Sacramento generally conduct and manage the joint work and are reimbursed by the other
members according to a cost-share Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
EXISTING CONDITIONS
SURFACE WATER HYDROLOGY
The City of Citrus Heights is situated within several drainage basins, including Arcade and Cripple Creeks and
their associated tributaries (Figure 4-1). In addition to these two main drainages, entire reaches of Brooktree,
Mariposa, and San Juan creeks, and a small portion of Coyle Creek are also located within the city. All streams
generally flow to the west, ultimately draining into Arcade Creek. Outside of Citrus Heights, Arcade Creek flows
west past American River College and through Del Paso Park, draining into the Natomas Main Drainage Canal
and ultimately into the Sacramento River.

Headwaters of Arcade and Cripple Creeks originate in Sacramento County, draining the southwest portion of
Orangevale. Both streams maintain perennial flows, except in their upper reaches. Similarly, many of the named
and unnamed tributaries also maintain perennial flows, although historically these streams were seasonal, flowing
under the influence of precipitation. As such, a significant portion of perennial flow in drainages of Arcade and
Cripple Creeks is comprised of urban runoff, with existing dry season summer flows likely greater than historic
dry season summer flows.
For the most part, the streams in Citrus Heights are unaltered (i.e., they have not been straightened and/or
concrete lined), and maintain a riparian corridor.2 Cripple Creek and associated named and unnamed tributaries
drain the northern half of Citrus Heights, while Arcade Creek and associated named and unnamed tributaries drain
the southern half of Citrus Heights, and portions of unincorporated Sacramento County.
GROUNDWATER HYDROLOGY
Groundwater occurs in the “saturation zone” which is an area below ground that accumulates water. Water from
precipitation, irrigation, and stream flows enters the ground from the surface and trickles down to the saturation
zone. The rate of groundwater recharge (i.e., water flowing into the saturation zone) depends upon a variety of
geologic and hydrologic factors. Groundwater is a primary source of water supply for domestic, municipal, and
agricultural uses throughout Sacramento County; as a result excess removal (also known as “overdraft”) of this
resource has been documented. 3 Overdraft is a concern in three areas of Sacramento County: Rio Linda-Elverta,
Elk Grove-Laguna and Galt. The Citrus Heights area is not currently experiencing groundwater overdraft.
Citrus Heights is located on the Fair Oaks Geologic Formation (DWR 1978). This geologic formation is
comprised of relatively thick deposits of silt and clay with thinner deposits of sand and gravel. The Fair Oaks
Formation can yield moderate to high quantities of water, primarily dependent upon whether fine grained or
coarse material is present (DWR 1978). Wells to depths greater than 300 feet may encounter the underlying
Mehrten Formation, with water yields roughly equivalent to the Fair Oaks Formation. Groundwater in the vicinity
of Citrus Heights generally flows to the west and ranges in depth from approximately 80 feet above mean sea
level (msl) in the east to 20 feet below msl in the west (County of Sacramento 1996).
SURFACE WATER QUALITY
Surface water quality is predominantly influenced by surrounding land uses. A portion of summer dry season
perennial flow in those streams that carry water year round is comprised of urban runoff. Urban runoff includes
surface drainage from residential and commercial land uses, including landscape irrigation, driveway and parking

lot cleaning, swimming pool draining, and other similar activities. In addition to this dry season urban runoff,
storm water discharge to the creek system conveys precipitation from areas of soil saturation or impermeable
surfaces to low-lying collection areas and creeks. Storm water flow in an urban area often includes contaminants
collected from surrounding land uses. Both urban dry-season runoff and storm water discharge influence surface
water quality.
WATERWAYS CURRENTLY IMPACTED
Arcade Creek has been identified as not meeting water quality standards for copper (low priority), chlorpyrifos, or
diazinon (common insecticide) as set forth in the Clean Water Act and has been included in the California 1998
Section 303(d) list maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 2002). In 2004, the Regional
Water Quality Control Board, Central Valley Region, prepared a TMDL report analyzing six creeks in the region,
including Arcade Creek. The TMDL calculates the maximum amount of a pollutant allowed to enter a waterbody
so that the waterbody will meet and continue to meet water quality standards for that particular pollutant and
allocates that load to point sources, (Wasteload Allocation or WLA), and nonpoint sources (Load Allocation or
LA), which include both anthropogenic and natural sources of the pollutant.
Pesticides containing the active ingredients diazinon and chlorpyrifos are the most heavily used pesticides in
Sacramento County (Russick 2001). These pesticides are primarily used by residential homeowners, pest control
operators (PCOs) in the urban environment, and farmers/growers in the agricultural environment to control insect
infestations in and around structures, on landscaping, and in crop fields (RWQCB 2004). The most common
reported use of diazinon and chlorpyrifos in Sacramento County is for urban structural pest control. The second
most common use is for agriculture, and the third most common use is on urban landscaping (CDPR PUR
1993-2000).
The TMDL Report for the pesticides Diazinon & Chlorpyrifos in Arcade Creek, Elder Creek, Elk Grove Creek,
Morrison Creek, Chicken Ranch Slough, and Strong Ranch Slough includes specific measures to reduce the
amount of diazinon and chlorpyrifos entering the watershed. The TMDL Report indicates that the largest
contributor of diazinon and chlorpyrifos is urban runoff. The reduction measures are implemented through the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program.
STORM WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT
Currently (2008) the City of Citrus Heights annual storm water management budget is approximately $3.1
million. Appropriation of this budget to specific improvements and management projects is a joint effort on the
part of the City of Citrus Heights and the County of Sacramento, where the monies originate. In 2010, Citrus
Heights will take over the management of Stormwater Utility Funds generated within the city. The City

GROUNDWATER QUALITY
Groundwater quality in Citrus Heights has not been comprehensively documented. The City is not included in any
known regional plume of gross groundwater contamination. Thus, groundwater quality is considered to be good in
the Citrus Heights area.
4.3        BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
This section provides a general discussion regarding the biological resources present within the Citrus Heights
City limits. Biological resources include biotic habitats (vegetative communities and corresponding wildlife
habitat), as well as the associated flora and fauna.
Citrus Heights is primarily an urban setting which consists of a variety of residential, commercial and industrial
uses. Topography is relatively flat terrain with small hills rolling to the north. Cripple Creek and Arcade Creek are
the main waterways which flow through the City (see Figure 4-1). In addition to these two main drainages, entire
reaches of Brooktree, Mariposa, and San Juan Creeks, and a small portion of Coyle Creek flow within the city.
REGULATORY SETTING
FEDERAL
Federal Endangered Species Act
The USFWS has jurisdiction over projects that may result in take of a species listed as threatened or endangered
under the federal ESA. Under the ESA (Title 16 of U.S. Code, Section 153 et seq. [16 USC 153 et seq.]), the
definition of “take” is to “harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to
engage in any such conduct.” USFWS has also interpreted the definition of “harm” to include significant habitat
modification that could result in take. If implementation of a project is likely to result in take of a federally-listed
species, then the project applicant must either obtain an incidental-take permit under ESA Section 10(a) or
complete a federal interagency consultation process under ESA Section 7 before the take occurs. An incidental-
take permit typically requires various types of mitigation to compensate for or minimize the take.
Migratory Bird Treaty Act
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 USC 703–711) prohibits the killing, possessing, or trading of migratory birds
except in accordance with regulations prescribed by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior. Most native bird species
fall under the jurisdiction of this act.

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1252–1376) requires a project applicant to obtain a permit before
engaging in any activity that involves any discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States,
including wetlands. Waters of the United States include navigable waters of the United States, interstate waters,
all other waters where the use or degradation or destruction of the waters could affect interstate or foreign
commerce, tributaries to any of these waters, and wetlands that meet any of these criteria or that are adjacent to
any of these waters or their tributaries.
Under Section 404, the USACE regulates and issues permits for activities that involve the discharge of dredged or
fill materials into waters of the United States. Fills of less than one-half acre of nontidal waters of the United
States for residential, commercial, or institutional development projects can generally be authorized under
USACE’s nationwide permit (NWP) program, provided that the project satisfies the terms and conditions of the
particular NWP. Fills that do not qualify for a NWP require a letter of permission or an individual permit.
State
California Endangered Species Act
The California Endangered Species Act (CESA) (California Fish and Game Code Section 2050 et seq.) is the state
policy to conserve, protect, restore, and enhance endangered or threatened species and their habitats. CESA
mandates that state agencies should not approve projects that would jeopardize the continued existence of
endangered or threatened species if reasonable and prudent alternatives are available that would avoid jeopardy.
Definitions of endangered and threatened species in the CESA parallel those defined in the ESA. Take
authorizations from California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) are required for any unavoidable impact on
state-listed species resulting from proposed projects.
Native Plant Protection Act
California’s Native Plant Protection Act (Fish and Game Code Sections 1900–1913) requires all state agencies to
establish criteria for determining whether a species, subspecies, or variety of native plant is endangered or rare.
Provisions of this act prohibit the taking of listed plants from the wild and require that DFG be notified at least 10
days in advance about any change in land use that would adversely affect listed plants. This requirement allows
DFG to salvage listed plant species that would otherwise be destroyed.
Lake and Streambed Alteration
DFG, through provisions included in Sections 1600–1603 of the California Fish and Game Code, is empowered to
issue streambed alteration agreements for projects that would “divert or obstruct the natural flow of, or
substantially change or use any material from the bed, channel, or bank of, any river, stream, or lake, or deposit or
                                                                                            General Plan Background Report

dispose of debris, waste, or other material containing crumbled, flaked, or ground pavement where it may pass
into any river, stream, or lake” (Fish and Game Code Section 1602[a]). Streams and rivers are defined by the
presence of a channel bed, banks, and intermittent flow. DFG jurisdiction can also be based on the existence of
riparian habitat and may include wetland areas that do not meet USACE criteria for soils and/or hydrology
(e.g., where riparian woodland canopy extends beyond the banks of a stream away from frequently saturated
soils).
Protection of Bird Nests and Raptors
The California Fish and Game Code (Section 3503) states that it is unlawful to take, possess, or needlessly
destroy the nest or eggs of any bird. The Code specifically mentions that it is unlawful to take, possess, or destroy
any raptors (i.e., hawks, owls, eagles, and falcons), including their nests or eggs. Examples of code violations
include destruction of active nests resulting from removal of vegetation in which the nests are located. Violation
of Section 3503.5 could also include failure of active raptor nests resulting from disturbance of nesting pairs by
nearby project construction.
REGIONAL/LOCAL
TREE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION ORDINANCE
Chapter 106.39 of the Citrus Heights Zoning Code provides regulations for the protection, preservation, and
maintenance of protected trees in the City. The ordinance protects native oak trees, oak woodlands, trees of
historic or cultural significance, groves and stands of mature trees, and mature trees associated with development
proposals.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
BIOTIC HABITATS
Four distinct biotic habitats are present within Citrus Heights. The names of these habitat types were described
using A Guide to Wildlife Habitats of California (Mayer & Laudenslayer 1988). Biotic habitats provide cover,
food, and water necessary to meet the biological requirements of one or more individuals of an animal species.
Each biotic habitat identified within the City is described below.
Urban
A distinguishing characteristic of urban habitats is the mixture of native and introduced plant species. Exotic and
ornamental plant species may provide valuable habitat elements such as cover for nesting and roosting, as well as
food sources such as nuts and berries. Urban habitats within Citrus Heights include ornamental landscaping and
lawns associated with street medians, homes, and commercial buildings.

Annual Grassland
Open space and vacant lots within developed areas of Citrus Heights support small pockets of annual grassland
habitat. This habitat type is most prevalent within drier areas of the floodplains of Arcade Creek, Cripple Creek,
and their associated tributaries. Due to prior human disturbance, most of the plant species that comprise annual
grasslands within Citrus Heights are non-native.
Interior Live Oak Woodland
Small pockets of Interior Live Oak woodland habitat occur within Citrus Heights in undeveloped upland areas,
above the mean high-water line, along Arcade Creek, Cripple Creek and their associated drainages. The dominant
plant species associated with this habitat is interior live oak (Quercus wislizenii), with valley oak (Quercus
lobata) and blue oak (Quercus douglasii) occurring as common associates.
Valley Foothill Riparian
Valley foothill riparian woodlands are complex habitats associated with perennial and intermittent creeks and
streams. Riparian woodlands generally have closed canopies dominated by broad-leaved, winter deciduous trees.
The composition of species in riparian woodlands is highly variable and depends on geographic location,
elevation, substrate, and amount of flow in a watercourse. Riparian woodland is a widespread habitat type
scattered throughout the Central Valley, though it has been estimated that nearly 95 percent of riparian woodlands
have been eliminated in California (Mayer & Laudenslayer 1988). Within the City, small pockets of valley
foothill riparian habitat occur along Arcade and Cripple creeks, as well as their tributary streams Brooktree Creek,
Coyle Creek, San Juan Creek, and Mariposa Creek.
In addition to providing high value wildlife habitat, riparian woodlands provide local movement corridors
between fragmented habitat patches. Due to the value and scarcity of riparian woodlands, on both a state and
regional level, they are considered a sensitive habitat by CDFG. Remnant valley foothill riparian woodland
corridors along Arcade Creek, Cripple Creek, and other smaller waterways are important biotic resources
associated with Citrus Heights.
SPECIAL-STATUS SPECIES
Plant and animal species may occur within or in the vicinity of Citrus Heights that are accorded “special-status”
because of their recognized rarity or vulnerability to various causes of habitat loss or population decline. Some of
these receive specific protection defined in federal or state endangered species legislation. Others have been
designated as “sensitive” on the basis of adopted policies and expertise of state resource agencies or organizations
with acknowledged expertise, or policies adopted by local governmental agencies such as counties, cities, and
                                                                                           General Plan Background Report

special districts to meet local conservation objectives. These species are referred to collectively as “special-status
species”. The various categories encompassed by the term, and the legal status of each, are summarized below.
Plants
Based on record searches conducted using the CDFG’s Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) and the California
Native Plant Society’s (CNPS) electronic floristic inventory for the Citrus Heights Quadrangle, the only special-
status species records for the Citrus Heights area were three occurrences of Sanford’s arrowhead (Sagittaria
sanfordii), a Federal Species of Concern and CNPS List 1B.2 species, and two occurrences of stinkbell
(Fritillaria agrestis), which is a CNPS List 4.2 species.
Sanford’s arrowhead is found in freshwater marshes and in slow-moving ditches and streams and stinkbells are
found in non-native grasslands or grassy openings on clay soils (Skinner & Pavlik 1994). All three of the
Sanford’s arrowhead occurrences were located within Citrus Heights. These occurrences were: an unnamed
drainage to Cripple Creek, located between Oak Avenue and Old Auburn Road; an unnamed drainage located
along the northwestern boundary of City on the east side of Roseville Road; and an unnamed channel located
along the northwestern boundary of City at the Roseville Road / Whyte Avenue intersection, just south of the
Placer/Sacramento County line (CNDDB 1998). Both of the stinkbell occurrences were located outside, but
within two miles of the City.
Fish and Wildlife
Based on a CNDDB record search for the Citrus Heights USGS Quadrangle, the only special-status animal
species with a known occurrence in Citrus Heights is white-tailed kite (CNDDB 1998, Sacramento County 1995).
White-tailed kite is designated as a California Fully Protected species by the CDFG. The recorded occurrence was
a nesting pair from Woodbridge Park, on the east side of Linda Creek, approximately 0.5 mile southeast of Old
Auburn Road and the Linda Creek Court subdivision.
Elderberry shrubs, which provide habitat for the federally threatened valley elderberry longhorn beetle
(Desmocerus californicus dimorphous), occur along both Arcade and Cripple Creeks. However, there are no
known occurrences of valley elderberry longhorn beetle within the City. Elderberry shrubs located on the Stock
Ranch development were inspected in 1992 and shrubs in the northeastern portion of the city near Old Auburn
Road were inspected in 2007, but no sign of valley elderberry longhorn beetle was observed (Sacramento County
1992, Padre 2007). No special-status fish species are known to occur within Citrus Heights waterways.
Northern Pacific Pond Turtles are a California Species of Special Concern found throughout the region. A
recorded occurrence of a Northern Pacific Pond Turtle was found in the northeastern portion of the city near Old
Auburn Road near the Cripple Creek drainage (Padre 2007).

WETLANDS
Wetlands are ecologically productive habitats that support a rich variety of both plant and animal life. The
importance and sensitivity of wetlands has increased as a result of their importance as recharge areas and filters
for water supplies, while widespread filling and destruction to enable urban and agricultural development has
resulted in their decline.
Wetlands within Citrus Heights
Due to the intensity of urban development within Citrus Heights, wetland features are primarily limited to
perennial and intermittent streams and drainages. These include both Cripple Creek and Arcade Creek, in addition
to Brooktree Creek, Coyle Creek, San Juan Creek, and Mariposa Creek. All of these wetland features would be
would be subject to USACE jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The USACE has jurisdiction
over that portion of each channel defined by ordinary high water marks on opposing channel banks. Ordinary high
water marks can be identified by shelving, scour lines, drift lines, and exposed roots (Environmental Laboratory,
1987). The CDFG also has jurisdiction over these waterways under the State Fish and Game Code Sections 1600-
1607.

5.1        INTRODUCTION
Air pollution can affect public health, harm the natural and built environment, damage crops, and change the
earth's climate. Air pollution has localized, regional, and global effects. Some air quality problems are beyond the
direct control of the City or beyond the scope of a General Plan. However, the location of stationary sources of air
pollution, such as industrial facilities, relative to houses, schools, and other sensitive land uses, is an important
consideration in land use planning. There are also very important indirect air quality consequences of land use
planning. Development that is not integrated with schools, parks, employment, shopping, and public transit
encourages reliance on the automobile, a major source of pollution. This report frames the existing air quality
regulatory environment and conditions in the City of Citrus Heights and surrounding region.
5.2        REGULATORY SETTING
Air quality within the Sacramento Valley Air Basin (SVAB), in which Citrus Heights is located, is regulated by
such agencies as the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD), California Air
Resources Board (ARB), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Each of these agencies develops
rules, regulations, policies, and/or goals to attain the goals or directives imposed through legislation. Although the
EPA regulations may not be superseded, both state and local regulations may be more stringent.
CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS
FEDERAL
At the Federal level, EPA has been charged with implementing national air quality programs. EPA’s air quality
mandates are drawn primarily from the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA), which was enacted in 1970. The most
recent major amendments made by Congress were in 1990.
The CAA required EPA to establish primary and secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS),
which are health-based standards set at levels designed to protect the public health and welfare, respectively. The
CAA also required each state to prepare an air quality control plan referred to as a State Implementation Plan
(SIP), which is the State’s plan to achieve the NAAQS by a specified date. The Federal Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) added requirements for states with nonattainment areas to revise their SIPs to
incorporate additional control measures to reduce air pollution. The SIP is modified periodically to reflect the
latest emissions inventories, planning documents, and rules and regulations of the air basins as reported by their
jurisdictional agencies. EPA has responsibility for reviewing all state SIPs to determine conformity with the
mandates of the CAAA and determine whether implementation will achieve air quality goals. Failure to submit an

approvable SIP or to implement the plan within the mandated timeframe may result in sanctions to transportation
funding and stationary air pollution sources in the air basin. General plan land use and population growth
projections are often relied upon in SIP development.
STATE
ARB is the agency responsible for coordination and oversight of state and local air pollution control programs in
California and for implementing the California Clean Air Act (CCAA). The CCAA, which was adopted in 1988,
required ARB to establish California Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS). CAAQS are designed to protect
the health and welfare of sensitive groups of people (e.g., children, elderly, and people with respiratory
conditions). The CCAA requires that all local air districts in the state endeavor to achieve and maintain the
CAAQS by the earliest practical date. The CCAA specifies that local air districts should focus particular attention
on reducing the emissions from transportation and areawide emission sources, and provides districts with the
authority to regulate such indirect emission sources.
Other ARB responsibilities include overseeing compliance with California and federal laws by local air districts,
approving local air quality plans, submitting SIPs to EPA, monitoring air quality, determining and updating area
designations and maps, and setting emissions standards for new mobile sources, consumer products, small utility
engines, off-road vehicles, and fuels.
ARB and local air pollution control districts are currently developing plans for meeting new national air quality
standards for ozone and PM2.5. California’s adopted 2007 State Strategy was submitted to EPA as a revision to the
SIP in November 2007 (ARB 2009a).
REGIONAL/LOCAL
Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District
SMAQMD attains and maintains air quality conditions in Sacramento County through a comprehensive program
of planning, regulation, enforcement, technical innovation, and promotion of the understanding of air quality
issues. The clean-air strategy of SMAQMD includes the preparation of plans for the attainment of ambient air-
quality standards, adoption and enforcement of rules and regulations concerning sources of air pollution, and
issuance of permits for stationary sources of air pollution. SMAQMD also inspects stationary sources of air
pollution and responds to citizen complaints, monitors ambient air quality and meteorological conditions, and
implements programs and regulations required by the CAA, CAAA, and the CCAA.
The present version of SMAQMD’s Guide to Air Quality Assessment (SMAQMD 2004) was released in July
2004. The Guide to Air Quality Assessment is an advisory document that provides lead agencies, consultants, and
project applicant(s) with uniform procedures for addressing air quality in environmental documents. SMAQMD is
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report
Air Quality                                               5-2                                        City of Citrus Heights

currently developing a new version of its guide, which is expected to be approved by the SMAQMD’s Board of
Directors in early 2010. A draft of the new version is presently available for public review (SMAQMD 2009).
Both the present version and the draft new version of the guide contain the following applicable components:
►    criteria and thresholds for determining whether a project may have a significant adverse air quality impact;
►    specific procedures and modeling protocols for quantifying and analyzing air quality impacts;
►    methods available to mitigate air quality impacts; and
►    information for use in air quality assessments and environmental impact reports (EIRs) that will be updated
     more frequently such as air quality data, regulatory setting, climate, and topography.
As mentioned above, SMAQMD adopts rules and regulations. All projects are subject to SMAQMD rules and
regulations in effect at the time of construction. Specific rules applicable to the General Plan update may include,
but are not limited to, the following:
►    Rule 201: General Permit Requirements. Any project that includes the use of equipment capable of
     releasing emissions to the atmosphere may require permit(s) from SMAQMD before equipment operation.
     The applicant, developer, or operator of a project that includes an emergency generator, boiler, or heater
     should contact SMAQMD early to determine whether a permit is required, and to begin the permit application
     process. Portable construction equipment (e.g., generators, compressors, pile drivers, lighting equipment) with
     an internal combustion engine over 50 horsepower (hp) are required to have a SMAQMD permit or ARB
     portable equipment registration.
►    Rule 403: Fugitive Dust. The developer or contractor is required to control dust emissions from earthmoving
     activities or any other construction activity to prevent airborne dust from leaving the project site.
►    Rule 417: Wood Burning Appliances. The developer or contractor is prohibited from installing any new,
     permanently installed, indoor or outdoor, uncontrolled fireplaces in new or existing developments.
►    Rule 442: Architectural Coatings. The developer or contractor is required to use coatings that comply with
     the volatile organic compound (VOC) content limits specified in the rule.
►    Rule 902: Asbestos. The developer or contractor is required to notify SMAQMD of any regulated renovation
     or demolition activity. Rule 902 contains specific requirements for surveying, notification, removal, and
     disposal of asbestos-containing material.

Air Quality Plans
SMAQMD, in coordination with the air quality management districts and air pollution control districts of El
Dorado, Placer, Solano, Sutter, and Yolo Counties, prepared and submitted the 1994 Air Quality Attainment Plan
(AQAP) in compliance with the requirements set forth in the CCAA, which specifically addressed the
nonattainment status for ozone and, to a lesser extent, CO and PM10.
Sacramento County is also part of the Sacramento Federal Ozone Nonattainment Area (SFNA), which also
comprises all of Yolo County and portions of El Dorado, Placer, and Solano Counties. As a nonattainment area,
the region is also required to submit rate-of-progress milestone evaluations in accordance with the CAAA. The
Sacramento region was classified by EPA on June 15, 2004, as a “serious” nonattainment area for the national 8-
hour ozone standard with an attainment deadline of June 15, 2013. Emission reductions needed to achieve the air
quality standard were identified based on air quality modeling. An evaluation of proposed new control measures
and associated reactive organic gases (ROG) and oxides of nitrogen (NOX) emission reductions concluded that no
set of feasible controls was available to provide the needed emission reductions before the attainment deadline
year. Given the magnitude of the shortfall in emission reductions and the schedule for implementing new control
measures, the earliest possible attainment demonstration year for the Sacramento region is determined to be the
“severe” area deadline of 2019.
TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS
Toxic air contaminants (TACs) (also called hazardous air pollutants [HAPs] in federal terms) are not considered
criteria air pollutants and, thus, are not specifically addressed through the setting of ambient air quality standards.
Instead, EPA and ARB regulate TACs and HAPs, respectively, through statutes and regulations that generally
require the use of the maximum or best available control technology (MACT and BACT) to limit emissions.
These, in conjunction with additional rules set forth by SMAQMD, establish the regulatory framework for TACs
(see discussion under “State and Local Toxic Air Contaminant Programs” below).
FEDERAL
EPA has programs for identifying and regulating HAPs. Title III of the CAAA directed EPA to promulgate
national emissions standards for HAPs (NESHAP). The NESHAP for major sources of HAPs may differ from
those for area sources. Major sources are defined as stationary sources with potential to emit more than 10 tons
per year (tpy) of any HAP or more than 25 tpy of any combination of HAPs; all other sources are considered area
sources.
The CAAA called on EPA to promulgate emissions standards in two phases. In the first phase (1992–2000), EPA
developed technology-based emissions standards designed to reduce emissions as much as feasible. These
                                                                                           General Plan Background Report
Air Quality                                                 5-4                                       City of Citrus Heights

standards are generally referred to as requiring MACT. For area sources, the standards may be different, based on
generally available control technology. In the second phase, EPA promulgated health risk–based emissions
standards were deemed necessary to address risks remaining after implementation of the technology-based
NESHAP standards.
The CAAA also required EPA to promulgate vehicle or fuel standards containing reasonable requirements that
control toxic emissions of, at a minimum, benzene and formaldehyde. Performance criteria were established to
limit mobile-source emissions of benzene, formaldehyde, and 1,3-butadiene. In addition, Section 219 of the
CAAA required the use of reformulated gasoline in selected areas with the most severe ozone nonattainment
conditions to further reduce mobile-source emissions.
STATE AND REGIONAL/LOCAL
TACs in California are regulated primarily through the Tanner Air Toxics Act (Assembly Bill [AB] 1807
[Chapter 1047, Statutes of 1983]) and the Air Toxics Hot Spots Information and Assessment Act (AB 2588
[Chapter 1252, Statutes of 1987]). AB 1807 sets forth a formal procedure for ARB to designate substances as
TACs. Research, public participation, and scientific peer review must occur before ARB can designate a
substance as a TAC. To date, ARB has identified more than 21 TACs and adopted EPA’s list of HAPs as TACs.
Most recently, particulate matter emissions from diesel exhaust (diesel PM) was added to the ARB list of TACs.
After a TAC is identified, ARB then adopts an airborne toxics control measure (ATCM) for sources that emit that
particular TAC. If there is a safe threshold for a substance for which there is no toxic effect, the control measure
must reduce exposure below that threshold. If there is no safe threshold, the measure must incorporate BACT to
minimize emissions; for example, the ATCM limits truck idling to 5 minutes (Title 13, Section 2485 of the
California Code of Regulations).
The Air Toxics Hot Spots Information and Assessment Act requires that existing facilities that emit toxic
substances above a specified level prepare an inventory of toxic emissions, prepare a risk assessment if emissions
are significant, notify the public of significant risk levels, and prepare and implement risk reduction measures.
ARB has adopted control measures for diesel PM and more stringent emissions standards for various on-road
mobile sources of emissions, including transit buses and off-road diesel equipment (e.g., tractors, generators).
In February 2000, ARB adopted a new rule for public-transit bus fleets and emissions standards for new urban
buses. These new rules and standards include all the following elements:
►    more stringent emission standards for some new urban bus engines, beginning with 2002 model year engines;
►    zero-emission bus demonstration and purchase requirements applicable to transit agencies; and

►    reporting requirements, under which transit agencies must demonstrate compliance with the public-transit bus
     fleet rule.
Recent and future milestones include the low-sulfur diesel fuel requirement and tighter emissions standards for
heavy-duty diesel trucks (2007) and off-road diesel equipment (2011) nationwide. Over time, replacing older
vehicles will result in a vehicle fleet that produces substantially lower levels of TACs than under current
conditions. Mobile-source emissions of TACs (e.g., benzene, 1,3-butadiene, diesel PM) have been reduced
significantly over the last decade and will be reduced further in California through a progression of regulatory
measures (e.g., Low Emission Vehicle/Clean Fuels and Phase II reformulated gasoline regulations) and control
technologies. With implementation of ARB’s Risk Reduction Plan, it is expected that diesel PM concentrations
will be reduced by 75% in 2010 and 85% in 2020 from the estimated year-2000 level. Adopted regulations are
also expected to continue to reduce formaldehyde emissions from cars and light-duty trucks. As emissions are
reduced, it is expected that risks associated with exposure to the emissions will also be reduced.
In addition, the Air Quality and Land Use Handbook: A Community Health Perspective, published by ARB,
provides guidance on land use compatibility with sources of TACs (ARB 2005). The handbook is not a law or
adopted policy, but rather offers advisory recommendations for the siting of sensitive receptors near uses
associated with TACs, such as freeways and high-traffic roads, commercial distribution centers, rail yards, ports,
refineries, dry cleaners, gasoline stations, and industrial facilities, to help keep children and other sensitive
populations out of harm’s way.
ODORS
REGIONAL/LOCAL
SMAQMD adopted a nuisance rule that addresses odor exposure. Rule 402 states that no person shall discharge
from any source whatsoever such quantities of air contaminants or other material that cause injury, detriment,
nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of persons, or to the public, or that endanger the comfort,
repose, health, or safety of any such persons, or the public, or that cause to have a natural tendency to cause injury
or damage to business or property. The provisions of Rule 402 do not apply to odors emanating from agricultural
operations necessary for the growing of crops or raising of fowl or animals.
SMAQMD recommends that odor impacts be addressed in a qualitative manner. Such an analysis shall determine
whether the project would result in excessive nuisance odors, as defined under the California Code of Regulations
and Section 41700 of the California Health and Safety Code, and thus would constitute a public nuisance related
to air quality.
                                                                                             General Plan Background Report
Air Quality                                                 5-6                                         City of Citrus Heights

Two situations increase the potential for odor problems. The first occurs when a new odor source is located near
existing sensitive receptors. The second occurs when new sensitive receptors are developed near existing sources
of odors. In the first situation, SMAQMD recommends operational changes, add-on controls, process changes, or
buffer zones where feasible to address odor complaints. In the second situation, the potential conflict is
considered significant if the planning area is at least as close as any other site that has already experienced
significant odor problems related to the odor source. For projects being developed near a source of odors where
there is no nearby development that may have filed complaints, and for odor sources being developed near
existing sensitive receptors, SMAQMD recommends that the determination of potential conflict be based on the
distance and frequency at which odor complaints from the public have occurred in the vicinity of a similar
facility.
5.3        EXISTING CONDITIONS
TOPOGRAPHY, CLIMATE, AND METEOROLOGY
The SVAB is relatively flat, bordered by mountains to the east, west, and north. Air flows into the SVAB through
the Carquinez Strait, the only breach in the western mountain barrier, and moves across the Sacramento–San
Joaquin River Delta, bringing with it pollutants from the heavily populated San Francisco Bay Area. The climate
is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. Periods of dense and persistent low-level fog that
are most prevalent between storms are characteristic of SVAB winter weather. From May to October, the region’s
intense heat and sunlight lead to high ozone concentrations. Summer inversions are strong and frequent, but are
less troublesome than those that occur in the fall. Autumn inversions, formed by warm air subsiding in a region of
high pressure, have accompanying light winds that do not provide adequate dispersion of air pollutants.
Most precipitation in the area results from air masses that move in from the Pacific Ocean during the winter
months. These storms usually move from the west or northwest. More than half the total annual precipitation falls
during the winter rainy season (November–February); the average winter temperature is a moderate 49°F. During
the summer, daily temperatures range from 50°F to more than 100°F. The inland location and surrounding
mountains shelter the area from much of the ocean breezes that keep the coastal regions moderate in temperature.
Regional flow patterns affect air quality patterns by moving pollutants downwind of sources. Localized
meteorological conditions, such as moderate winds, disperse pollutants and reduce pollutant concentrations. An
inversion layer develops when a layer of warm air traps cooler air close to the ground. Such temperature
inversions hamper dispersion by creating a ceiling over the area and trapping air pollutants near the ground.
During summer mornings and afternoons, these inversions are present over the Citrus Heights planning area.
During summer’s longer daylight hours, plentiful sunshine provides the energy needed to fuel photochemical
reactions between ROG and NOX, which forms ozone.
General Plan Background Report
City of Citrus Heights                                      5-7                                                Air Quality

In the winter, temperature inversions dominate during the night and early morning hours but frequently dissipate
by afternoon. The greatest pollution problems during this time of year are from carbon monoxide (CO) and NOX.
High CO concentrations occur on winter days with strong surface inversions and light winds. CO transport is
extremely limited.
The local meteorology of the planning area is represented by measurements recorded at the Folsom Dam station.
The normal annual precipitation, which occurs primarily from November through March, is approximately 24
inches (National Atmospheric Oceanic Administration 1992). January temperatures range from an average
minimum of 38°F to an average maximum of 54°F. July temperatures range from an average minimum of 60°F to
an average maximum of 94°F (National Atmospheric Oceanic Administration 1992). The predominant wind
direction and speed is from the south-southwest at approximately 10 mph (ARB 1994).
CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS
ARB and EPA currently focus on the following air pollutants as indicators of ambient air quality: ozone,
particulate matter (PM), CO, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and lead. Because these are the most
prevalent air pollutants known to be deleterious to human health and extensive health-effects criteria documents
are available, they are commonly referred to as “criteria air pollutants.” Sources and health effects associated with
each of the criteria air pollutants are summarized below in Table 5-1.

OZONE
Ozone is a photochemical oxidant, a substance whose oxygen combines chemically with another substance in the
presence of sunlight, and the primary component of smog. Ozone is not directly emitted into the air but is formed
through complex chemical reactions between precursor emissions of ROG and NOX in the presence of sunlight.
ROG are volatile organic compounds that are photochemically reactive. ROG emissions result primarily from
incomplete combustion and the evaporation of chemical solvents and fuels. NOX are a group of gaseous
compounds of nitrogen and oxygen that results from the combustion of fuels.
A highly reactive molecule, ozone readily combines with many different components of the atmosphere.
Consequently, high levels of ozone tend to exist only while high ROG and NOX levels are present to sustain the
ozone formation process. After the precursors have been depleted, ozone levels rapidly decline. Because these
reactions occur on a regional scale, ozone is a regional pollutant.
Ozone located in the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) acts in a beneficial manner by shielding the earth from
harmful ultraviolet radiation that is emitted by the sun. However, ozone located in the lower atmosphere
(troposphere) is a major health and environmental concern. Meteorology and terrain play a major role in ozone
formation. Generally, low wind speeds or stagnant air coupled with warm temperatures and clear skies provide
the optimum conditions for ozone formation. As a result, summer is generally the peak ozone season. Because of
the reaction time involved, peak ozone concentrations often occur far downwind of the precursor emissions. In
general, ozone concentrations over or near urban and rural areas reflect an interplay of emissions of ozone
precursors, transport, meteorology, and atmospheric chemistry (Godish 2004).
The adverse health effects associated with exposure to ozone pertain primarily to the respiratory system. Scientific
evidence indicates that ambient levels of ozone affect not only sensitive receptors, such as asthmatics and
children, but healthy adults. Exposure to ambient levels of ozone ranging from 0.10 part per million (ppm) to
0.40 ppm for 1–2 hours has been found to substantially alter lung functions by increasing respiratory rates and
pulmonary resistance, decreasing tidal volumes (the amount of air inhaled and exhaled), and impairing respiratory
mechanics. Ambient levels of ozone above 0.12 ppm are linked to such symptoms as throat dryness, chest
tightness, headache, and nausea. In addition to these adverse health effects, evidence exists relating ozone
exposure to an increase in the permeability of respiratory epithelia; such increased permeability leads to an
increased response of the respiratory system to challenges and a decrease in the immune system’s ability to
defend against infection (Godish 2004).
In 1997, EPA promulgated a new 8-hour standard in recognition of impacts resulting from daylong exposure. On
April 15, 2004, EPA designated areas of the country that exceed the 8-hour standard ozone standard as

nonattainment. The designations were in place as of February 2009. These designations have triggered new
planning requirements for the 8-hour standard.
Trends
On-road motor vehicles and other mobile sources are by far the largest contributors to NOX emissions. According
to the 2008 emissions inventory for Sacramento County, approximately 58% of NOX emissions in Sacramento
County are generated by on-road motor vehicles (ARB 2009b). More stringent mobile source emission standards
and cleaner burning fuels have largely contributed to the decline in NOX emissions. ROG emissions have been
decreasing for the last 30 years because of more stringent motor vehicle standards and new rules for control of
ROG from various industrial coating and solvent operations (ARB 2009b). Even so, the ozone problem in the
SVAB ranks among the most severe in the state. Peak ozone values in the SVAB have not declined as quickly
over the last several years as they have in other urban areas. The peak 8-hour indicator remained fairly constant
from 1987 to 1990. Since 1990, the peak 8-hour indicator has decreased slightly, and the overall decline for the
20-year period is almost 13%. Looking at the number of days above the state and national standards, the trend is
much more variable. However, the number of 8-hour exceedance days has declined by more than 50% since 1988
(ARB 2009b).
RESPIRABLE AND FINE PARTICULATE MATTER
Respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 micrometers or less is referred to as PM10. PM10
consists of particulate matter emitted directly into the air, such as fugitive dust, soot, and smoke from mobile and
stationary sources; construction operations; fires and natural windblown dust; and particulate matter formed in the
atmosphere by condensation and/or transformation of SO2 and ROG (EPA 2009a). Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
is a subgroup of PM10, consisting of smaller particles that have an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometers or
less (ARB 2009b).
The adverse health effects associated with PM10 depend on the specific composition of the particulate matter.
For example, health effects may be associated with metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and other
toxic substances adsorbed onto fine particulate matter (referred to as the “piggybacking effect”) or with fine dust
particles of silica or asbestos. Generally, effects may result from both short-term and long-term exposure to
elevated concentrations of PM10 and may include breathing and respiratory symptoms, aggravation of existing
respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, alterations to the immune system, carcinogenesis, and premature death
(EPA 2008a). PM2.5 poses an increased health risk because the particles can deposit deep in the lungs and may
contain substances that are particularly harmful to human health.

Trends
Direct emissions of both PM10 and PM2.5 increased in the SVAB between 1975 and 2005 and are projected to
increase through 2020. These emissions are dominated by area wide sources, primarily because of development.
Direct emissions of PM from mobile and stationary sources have remained relatively steady (ARB 2009b).
CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS INVENTORY AND SOURCES
The SMAQMD estimates emissions of criteria air pollutants from approximately nine hundred source categories.
The estimates are based on SMAQMD permit information for stationary sources (e.g., manufacturing industries,
dry-cleaning operations), plus more generalized estimates for area sources (e.g., space heating, landscaping
activities, use of consumer products) and mobile sources (e.g., trains, planes, as well as on-road and off-road
motor vehicles). Mobile sources compose most of the ozone precursor emissions in Sacramento County, while
area sources are the largest contributor of PM emissions (ARB 2009c).
S tationary S ourc es
Major stationary sources of air pollutant emissions within Sacramento County include industrial processes, fuel
combustion from electric utilities and other processes, waste disposal, surface coating and cleaning, petroleum
production, and other sources. Local air districts issue permits to various types of stationary sources, which must
demonstrate implementation of BACT. A search of the ARB Facility Search database and the EPA Envirofacts
database revealed that no major stationary sources of criteria air pollutants or toxics is located in Citrus Heights.
Several small dry cleaning facilities located throughout the community are identified as minor stationary sources
of air pollutant emissions.
Areawide Sources
Areawide sources of emissions in Citrus Heights include consumer products, application of architectural coatings,
residential fuel combustion, construction and demolition, road dust, fugitive dust, landscaping, fires, and other
miscellaneous sources.
Mobile Sources
On-road and other mobile sources are the largest contributors of ozone precursor emissions within Citrus Heights.
On-road sources consist of passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, and motorcycles, while off-road vehicles and other
mobile sources comprise heavy-duty equipment, boats, aircraft, trains, recreational vehicles, and farm equipment.
A major roadway in the vicinity of Citrus Heights includes Interstate 80, which handles a maximum of
approximately 198,000-224,000 vehicles per day (Caltrans 2008).

The J. R. Davis Railyard is located approximately 1.5 miles to the northwest of the planning area. The Railyard is
a large source of NOX, diesel particulate matter (DPM), and CO2 emissions. Depending on wind speed and
direction, and the proximity of sensitive receptors, the Railyard could result in exposures to DPM. Emissions of
several criteria pollutants and toxics (DPM) for the Railyard for the year 2008 are shown in Table 5-2.

MONITORING STATION DATA AND ATTAINMENT AREA DESIGNATIONS
Criteria air pollutant concentrations are measured at several monitoring stations in the SVAB. The North
Highlands-Blackfoot Way station is the closest monitoring station to the planning area with recent data for ozone,
NO2, and PM10. When data was not available at the North Highlands station, air pollutant monitoring data was
obtained from the Del Paso Manor station in Sacramento, which is next closest monitoring station to the planning
area. In general, the ambient air quality measurements from these monitoring stations are representative of the air
quality in the vicinity of Citrus Heights. Table 5-3 summarizes the air quality data from the most recent 3 years
for these two monitoring stations.

Both ARB and EPA use this type of monitoring data to designate the attainment status with respect to the CAAQS
and NAAQS, respectively, for criteria air pollutants. The purpose of these designations is to identify those areas
with air quality problems and thereby initiate planning efforts for improvement. The three basic designation
categories are “nonattainment,” “attainment,” and “unclassified.” The “unclassified” designation is used in an area
that cannot be classified on the basis of available information as meeting or not meeting the standards.
TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS
TACs or HAPs are defined as air pollutants that may cause or contribute to an increase in mortality or in serious
illness, or that may pose a hazard to human health. TACs are usually present in minute quantities in the ambient
air; however, their high toxicity or health risk may pose a threat to public health even at low concentrations. In
general, for those TACs that may cause cancer, there is no concentration that does not present some risk. In other
words, there is no threshold level below which adverse health impacts may not be expected to occur. This
contrasts with the criteria air pollutants for which acceptable levels of exposure can be determined and for which
the ambient standards have been established (Table 5-4).
According to the California Almanac of Emissions and Air Quality 2008 Edition (ARB 2009b), the majority of
the estimated health risk from TACs can be attributed to relatively few compounds, the most important being PM
from diesel-fueled engines (diesel PM). Diesel PM differs from other TACs in that it is not a single substance, but
rather a complex mixture of hundreds of substances. Although diesel PM is emitted by diesel-fueled internal
combustion engines, the composition of the emissions varies depending on engine type, operating conditions, fuel
composition, and lubricating oil, and whether an emission control system is present. Unlike the other TACs, no
ambient monitoring data are available for diesel PM because no routine measurement method currently exists.
However, ARB has made preliminary concentration estimates based on a PM exposure method. This method uses
the ARB emissions inventory’s PM10 database, ambient PM10 monitoring data, and the results from several studies
on chemical speciation to estimate concentrations of diesel PM. In addition to diesel PM, benzene, 1, 3-butadiene,
acetaldehyde, carbon tetrachloride, hexavalent chromium, para-dichlorobenzene, formaldehyde, methylene
chloride, and perchloroethylene are the TACs for which data are available that pose the greatest existing ambient
risk in California.
Diesel PM poses the greatest health risk among these 10 TACs mentioned. Based on receptor modeling
techniques, ARB estimated its health risk to be 360 excess cancer cases per million people in the SVAB. Since
1990 the health risk associated with diesel PM has been reduced by 52%. Overall, levels of most TACs, except
for para-dichlorobenzene and formaldehyde, have gone down since 1990 (ARB 2009b).
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report

Sources of TACs located throughout the planning area could include, but are not limited to, large volume
roadways, gasoline dispensing stations, dry cleaners, auto body painting establishments, and crematoriums.
The nearby J. R. Davis Rail Yard is also a potential source of TACs, in particular, DPM.
SENSITIVE LAND USES
Sensitive land uses or sensitive receptors are people or facilities that generally house people (e.g., schools,
hospitals, residences) that may experience adverse effects from unhealthful concentrations of air pollutants. There
are numerous types of these receptors throughout Citrus Heights.

ODORS
Typically odors are regarded as an annoyance rather than a health hazard. However, manifestations of a person’s
reaction to foul odors can range from psychological (e.g., irritation, anger, or anxiety) to physiological (e.g.,
circulatory and respiratory effects, nausea, vomiting, and headache).
With respect to odors, the human nose is the sole sensing device. The ability to detect odors varies considerably
among the population and overall is quite subjective. Some individuals have the ability to smell minute quantities
of specific substances; others may not have the same sensitivity but may have sensitivities to odors of other
substances. There are no major sources of odor in Citrus Heights. Minor sources of odors in the planning area
could include, but are not limited to, restaurants with charbroilers and construction sites (diesel exhaust and
asphalt paving).

                                          6 CLIMATE CHANGE
6.1        INTRODUCTION
The following chapter provides a summary of applicable climate change regulations; a discussion of existing
climate conditions, climate change science, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sources in California and the
City of Citrus Heights; and a description of potential effects of climate change on the City (i.e., adaptation).
6.2        REGULATORY SETTING
This section includes a summary of climate change-related legislation that is applicable to California and Citrus
Heights. This framework identifies portions of GHG emissions sectors that will be regulated by legislation, and
portions that will be under the purview of local government entities, such as the City. This section also provides
the basis for the state-wide GHG reduction targets, as mandated in Assembly Bill (AB) 32.
FEDERAL
SUPREME COURT RULING
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency responsible for implementing the Federal
Clean Air Act (CAA). The Supreme Court of the United States ruled on April 2, 2007 that carbon dioxide (CO2)
is an air pollutant as defined under the CAA, and that EPA has the authority to regulate emissions of GHGs.
EPA ACTIONS
In response to the mounting issue of climate change, EPA has taken the following actions to regulate, monitor,
and potentially reduce GHG emissions.
Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule
On September 22, 2009, EPA issued a final rule for mandatory reporting of GHGs from large GHG emissions
sources in the United States. In general, this national reporting requirement will provide EPA with accurate and
timely GHG emissions data from facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 per year. This publically
available data will allow the reporters to track their own emissions, compare them to similar facilities, and aid in
identifying cost effective opportunities to reduce emissions in the future. Reporting is at the facility level, except
that certain suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gases along with vehicle and engine manufacturers
will report at the corporate level. An estimated 85% of the total U.S. GHG emissions, from approximately 10,000
facilities, are covered by this final rule.

Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under the Clean Air Act
On December 7, 2009, EPA adopted its Proposed Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for
Greenhouse Gases under the CAA (Endangerment Finding). The Endangerment Finding is based on Section
202(a) of the CAA, which states that the Administrator (of EPA) should regulate and develop standards for
“emission[s] of air pollution from any class of classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which
in [its] judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public
health or welfare.” The rule addresses Section 202(a) in two distinct findings. The first addresses whether or not
the concentrations of the six key GHGs (i.e., CO2, methane [CH4], nitrous oxide [N2O], hydrofluorocarbons
[HFCs], perfluorocarbons [PFCs], and sulfur hexafluoride [SF6]) in the atmosphere threaten the public health and
welfare of current and future generations. The second addresses whether or not the combined emissions of GHGs
from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and
therefore the threat of climate change.
The Administrator found that atmospheric concentrations of GHGs endanger the public health and welfare within
the meaning of Section 202(a) of the CAA. The Administrator also found that GHG emissions from new motor
vehicles and motor vehicle engines are contributing to air pollution, which is endangering public health and
welfare.
STATE
Because every nation emits GHGs and therefore makes an incremental cumulative contribution to global climate
change, cooperation on a global scale will be required to reduce the rate of GHG emissions to a level that can help
to slow or stop the increase in average global temperatures and associated changes in climatic conditions. Several
state-wide initiatives that are relevant to land use planning are discussed below; however, this does not represent a
complete list of climate change-related legislation in California. Other relevant legislation not specifically
described in this section addresses renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, emissions from motor
vehicles, and carbon intensity of fuels, among others.
EXECUTIVE ORDER S-3-05
Executive Order S-3-05, which was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger in 2005, proclaims that California is
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It declares that increased temperatures could reduce the Sierra’s
snowpack, further exacerbate California’s air quality problems, and potentially cause a rise in sea levels. To
combat those concerns, the Executive Order established total greenhouse gas emission targets. Specifically,
emissions are to be reduced to the 2000 level by 2010, the 1990 level by 2020, and to 80% below the 1990 level

ASSEMBLY BILL 32, THE CALIFORNIA GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT OF 2006
In September 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions
Act of 2006. AB 32 establishes regulatory, reporting, and market mechanisms to achieve quantifiable reductions
in GHG emissions and a cap on statewide GHG emissions. AB 32 requires that statewide GHG emissions be
reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. This reduction will be accomplished through an enforceable statewide cap on
GHG emissions that will be phased in starting in 2012. To effectively implement the cap, AB 32 directs ARB to
develop and implement regulations to reduce statewide GHG emissions from stationary sources.
AB 32 Climate Change Scoping Plan
In December 2008, ARB adopted its Climate Change Scoping Plan, which contains the main strategies California
will implement to achieve reduction of approximately 169 million metric tons (MMT) of carbon dioxide
equivalent (CO2e), or approximately 30% from the state’s projected 2020 emission level of 596 MMT of CO2e
under a business-as-usual scenario (this is a reduction of 42 MMT CO2e, or almost 10%, from 2002–2004 average
emissions). The Scoping Plan also includes ARB-recommended GHG reductions for each emissions sector of the
state’s GHG inventory. The Scoping Plan calls for the largest reductions in GHG emissions to be achieved by
implementing the following measures and standards:
►    improved emissions standards for light-duty vehicles (estimated reductions of 31.7 MMT CO2e),
►    the Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (15.0 MMT CO2e),
►    energy efficiency measures in buildings and appliances and the widespread development of combined heat
     and power systems (26.3 MMT CO2e), and
►    a renewable portfolio standard for electricity production (21.3 MMT CO2e).
ARB has not yet determined what amount of GHG reductions it recommends from local government operations;
however, the Scoping Plan does state that land use planning and urban growth decisions will play an important
role in the state’s GHG reductions because local governments have primary authority to plan, zone, approve, and
permit how land is developed to accommodate population growth and the changing needs of their jurisdictions.
(Meanwhile, ARB is also developing an additional protocol for communitywide emissions.) ARB further
acknowledges that decisions on how land is used will have large effects on the GHG emissions that will result
from the transportation, housing, industry, forestry, water, agriculture, electricity, and natural gas emission
sectors. The Scoping Plan states that the ultimate GHG reduction assignment to local government operations is to
be determined (ARB 2008). With regard to land use planning, the Scoping Plan expects approximately 5.0 MMT
CO2e will be achieved associated with implementation of SB 375, which is discussed further below.

SENATE BILL 97
Senate Bill (SB) 97, signed August 2007, acknowledges that climate change is a prominent environmental issue
that requires analysis under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). This bill directs the California
Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to prepare, develop, and transmit to the Resources Agency guidelines for
the feasible mitigation of GHG emissions or the effects of GHG emissions, as required by CEQA by July 1, 2009.
The California Natural Resources Agency is required to certify or adopt those guidelines by January 1, 2010. On
April 13, 2009, the California Office of Planning and Research submitted to the Secretary for Natural Resources
its proposed amendments to the state CEQA Guidelines for GHG emissions, as required by SB 97. These
proposed CEQA Guideline amendments provide guidance to public agencies regarding the analysis and
mitigation of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions in draft CEQA documents.
SENATE BILL 375
SB 375, signed in September 2008, aligns regional transportation planning efforts, regional GHG reduction
targets, and land use and housing allocation. SB 375 requires Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to
adopt a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) or Alternative Planning Strategy (APS), which will prescribe
land use allocation in that MPO’s Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). ARB, in consultation with MPOs, will
provide each affected region with reduction targets for GHGs emitted by passenger cars and light trucks in the
region for the years 2020 and 2035. These reduction targets will be updated every eight years, but can be updated
every four years if advancements in emissions technologies affect the reduction strategies to achieve the targets.
ARB is also charged with reviewing each MPO’s SCS or APS for consistency with its assigned targets. If MPOs
do not meet the GHG reduction targets, transportation projects would not be eligible for funding programmed
after January 1, 2012.
This bill also extends the minimum time period for the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RNHA) cycle from 5
years to 8 years for local governments located within an MPO that meets certain requirements. City or County
land use policies (including General Plans) are not required to be consistent with the RTP (and associated SCS or
APS). However, new provisions of CEQA would incentivize qualified projects that are consistent with an
approved SCS or APS, categorized as “transit priority projects.”

The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) is currently in the process of
updating its Air Quality CEQA Guidelines, which includes a chapter on program-level analysis of general plans
pursuant to CEQA (SMAQMD 2009). With respect to GHG emissions, SMAQMD recommends that a general
                                                                                        General Plan Background Report

6.3        EXISTING CONDITIONS
REGIONAL CLIMATE CHARACTERISTICS
Climate is the accumulation of daily and seasonal weather events over a long period of time, whereas weather is
defined as the condition of the atmosphere at any particular time and place (Ahrens 2003). The planning area is
located in a climatic zone characterized as dry-summer subtropical or Mediterranean (abbreviated Cs) on the
Köppen climate classification system. The Köppen system’s classifications are primarily based on annual and
monthly averages of temperature and precipitation.
The Sacramento Valley Air Basin (SVAB) is relatively flat, bordered by mountains to the east, west, and north.
The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. Periods of dense and persistent low-
level fog that are most prevalent between storms are characteristic of SVAB winter weather. The extreme summer
aridity of the Mediterranean climate is caused by sinking air of subtropical high pressure regions. In the case of
the SVAB, the ocean has less influence than in the coastal areas, giving the interior Mediterranean climate
(abbreviated Csa on the Köppen climate system) more seasonal temperature variation (Ahrens 2003).
Most precipitation in the area results from air masses that move in from the Pacific Ocean during the winter
months. These storms usually move from the west or northwest. More than half the total annual precipitation falls
during the winter rainy season (November–February); the average winter temperature is a moderate 49 degrees
Fahrenheit (°F). During the summer, daily temperatures range from 50°F to more than 100°F. The inland location
and surrounding mountains shelter the area from much of the ocean breezes that keep the coastal regions
moderate in temperature.
CLIMATE CHANGE – THE PHYSICAL SCIENTIFIC BASIS
THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT
Certain gases in the earth’s atmosphere, classified as GHGs, play a critical role in determining the earth’s surface
temperature. Solar radiation enters the earth’s atmosphere from space. A portion of the radiation is absorbed by
the earth’s surface, and a smaller portion of this radiation is reflected back toward space. This absorbed radiation
is then emitted from the earth as low-frequency infrared radiation. The frequencies at which bodies emit radiation
are proportional to temperature. The earth has a much lower temperature than the sun; therefore, the earth emits
lower frequency radiation. Most solar radiation passes through GHGs; however, infrared radiation is absorbed by
these gases. As a result, radiation that otherwise would have escaped back into space is instead “trapped,”
resulting in a warming of the atmosphere. This phenomenon, known as the greenhouse effect, is responsible for
General Plan Background Report

maintaining a habitable climate on Earth. Without the greenhouse effect, Earth would not be able to support life
as we know it.
Prominent GHGs contributing to the greenhouse effect are CO2, CH4, N2O, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons,
and sulfur hexafluoride. Human-caused emissions of these GHGs in excess of natural ambient concentrations are
responsible for intensifying the greenhouse effect and have led to a trend of unnatural warming of the earth’s
climate, known as global climate change or global warming. It is extremely unlikely that global climate change of
the past 50 years can be explained without the contribution from human activities (IPCC 2007).
CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change is a global environmental issue. GHGs are global pollutants, unlike criteria air pollutants and
toxic air contaminants (TACs), which are pollutants of regional and local concern. Whereas pollutants with
localized air quality effects have relatively short atmospheric lifetimes (about 1 day), GHGs have long
atmospheric lifetimes (1 year to several thousand years). GHGs persist in the atmosphere for long enough time
periods to be dispersed around the globe. Although the exact lifetime of any particular GHG molecule is
dependent on multiple variables and cannot be pinpointed, it is understood that more CO2 is emitted into the
atmosphere than is sequestered by ocean uptake, vegetation, and other forms of sequestration. Of the total annual
human-caused CO2 emissions, approximately 54% is sequestered through ocean uptake, uptake by northern
hemisphere forest regrowth, and other terrestrial sinks within a year, whereas the remaining 46% of human-
caused CO2 emissions remains stored in the atmosphere (Seinfeld and Pandis 1998).
Similarly, effects of GHGs are borne globally, as opposed to localized air quality effects of criteria air pollutants
and TACs. The quantity of GHGs that it takes to ultimately result in climate change is not precisely known;
suffice it to say, the quantity is enormous, and no single project alone would measurably contribute to a noticeable
incremental change in the global average temperature, or to global, local, or micro climate. From the standpoint of
CEQA, GHG impacts to global climate change are inherently cumulative.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION SOURCES
Land use decisions and development projects are not their own GHG emissions sectors. In other words, land use
development projects can generate GHG emissions from several sectors (e.g., transportation, electricity, and
waste) as described in more detail below. Therefore, land use decisions and development projects can affect the
generation of GHG emissions from multiple sectors that result from their implementation. Development projects
can result in direct or indirect GHG emissions that would occur on- or off-site. For example, electricity consumed
in structures within a project would indirectly cause GHGs to be emitted by a utility provider. The people who
reside in and the visitors to a development project would drive vehicles that generate off-site GHG emissions,
which are associated with the transportation sector. The following sections describe the major GHG emission
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report

sectors that can and cannot be affected by local government actions. In addition, a description of the existing state
of climate change science is provided for informational purposes.
Emissions of GHGs contributing to global climate change are attributable in large part to human activities
associated with the transportation, industrial/manufacturing, utility, residential, commercial and agricultural
sectors (ARB 2009). In California, the transportation sector is the largest emitter of GHGs, followed by electricity
generation (ARB 2009). Emissions of CO2 are byproducts of fossil fuel combustion. CH4, a highly potent GHG,
results from off-gassing (the release of chemicals from nonmetallic substances under ambient or greater pressure
conditions) is largely associated with agricultural practices and landfills. N2O is also largely attributable to
agricultural practices and soil management. CO2 sinks, or reservoirs, include vegetation and the ocean, which
absorb CO2 through sequestration and dissolution, respectively, two of the most common processes of CO2
sequestration.
California is the 12th to 16th largest emitter of CO2 in the world (CEC 2006a). California produced 484 million
gross metric tons of CO2e in 2004 (ARB 2009). CO2e is a measurement used to account for the fact that different
GHGs have different potential to retain infrared radiation in the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse
effect. This potential, known as the global warming potential (GWP) of a GHG, is dependent on the lifetime, or
persistence, of the gas molecule in the atmosphere. For example, as described in Appendix C, “Calculation
References,” of the General Reporting Protocol of the California Climate Action Registry (CCAR 2009), 1 ton of
CH4 has the same contribution to the greenhouse effect as approximately 21 tons of CO2. Therefore, CH4 is a
much more potent GHG than CO2. Expressing emissions in CO2e takes the contributions of all GHG emissions to
the greenhouse effect and converts them to a single unit equivalent to the effect that would occur if only CO2 were
being emitted.
Combustion of fossil fuel in the transportation sector was the single largest source of California’s GHG emissions
in 2004, accounting for 38% of total GHG emissions in the state (ARB 2009). This sector was followed by the
electric power sector (including both in-state and out-of-state sources) (19%) and the industrial sector (23%)
(ARB 2008). See Figure 6-1 below.

CITRUS HEIGHTS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INVENTORY
OVERVIEW
A GHG emissions inventory was conducted for each incorporated city in Sacramento County, including the City
of Citrus Heights, and the unincorporated area of Sacramento County (County) for the year 2005. The inventory
estimated that communitywide GHG emissions in Citrus Heights totaled approximately 578,134 metric tons of
CO2e in 2005. Citrus Heights contributed approximately 4.2% of the GHG emissions generated in Sacramento
County. On-road transportation emissions composed 42.8% of communitywide GHG emissions, followed by
27.7% from residential sources, and 10.8% from commercial/industrial sources (Sacramento County 2009).
The inventory includes communitywide (i.e., those emissions attributable to all sources in Citrus Heights) and
government-related operations (i.e., those emissions directly attributable to the City government operations). The
GHG emissions associated with government operations are a subset of the total community-wide emissions. There
is no available adopted or widely accepted methodology for evaluating GHG emissions from land use
development. In the case of the City’s inventory, GHG emissions associated with energy, transportation and waste
(i.e., solid waste and wastewater), were modeled using the Local Governments for Sustainability (founded as the
International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI)), Clean Air and Climate Protection (CACP)
                                                                                         General Plan Background Report

software, and other calculation methodologies that involved scaling of the statewide GHG emissions inventory
prepared by ARB.
COMMUNITY-WIDE INVENTORY
The purpose of the GHG emissions inventory is to assist policy makers and planners to identify the current
emission sources, the relative contribution from each source, and the overall magnitude of the City’s GHG
emissions. This aids in development of more specific and effective policies and emissions control strategies to
reduce GHG emissions consistent with State mandates (i.e., AB 32). The GHG emissions inventory is divided
into the following GHG emission sectors: residential, commercial/industrial, industrial specific, on-road mobile
sources, off-road mobile sources, waste, wastewater treatment, water-related, agriculture, and high GWP GHGs.
All GHG emissions were presented in units of MT CO2e/yr, which allows emissions of other GHGs such as CH4
and N2O to be normalized to a single unit of measure that accounts for GWP.
Table 6-1 and Figure 6-2 summarize the 2005 GHG emissions inventory.

CITRUS HEIGHTS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BASELINE
It is important to note that there is currently no agency-adopted or recommended protocol to follow for
preparation of community-wide GHG emissions inventories. Thus, this field of practice and available tools and
methods continue to evolve in the absence of standardized guidance. The City chose to refine certain aspects of
the 2005 GHG emissions inventory that could potentially influence the General Plan decision-making process and
development of the City’s GHG Reduction Program. Thus, the GHG data presented in this section represents the
emissions baseline for the City that will be relied upon during development of GHG-reduction policies and
programs.
Sectors of the 2005 emissions inventory that were refined included on-road and off-road mobile-related
emissions, wastewater treatment, and high GWP GHGs. Each is discussed in greater detail below and summarized
in Table 6-3 and Figure 6-4.
ON-ROAD MOBILE SOURCES
On-road mobile-source GHG emissions were calculated using a bottom-up method based on VMT data obtained
from Fehr & Peers Transportation Consultants, which used select zone assignment of SACOG’s current
SACMET regional travel demand forecasting (TDF) model to calculate VMT for the City of Citrus Heights under

existing conditions. Vehicle trips and associated VMT were categorized according to three types of trips:
Internal–Internal (I-I) trips, which begin and end in Citrus Heights; Internal–External (I-X) trips, which begin in
Citrus Heights and end outside Citrus Heights; and External–Internal (X-I) trips, which begin outside Citrus
Heights and end inside Citrus Heights.

I-I trips and 50 percent I-X and X-I trips to the City. This methodology is consistent with the recommendations of
the Regional Targets Advisory Committee, which is the body charged with making recommendations to ARB on
implementation of SB 375. On-road mobile-source GHG emissions were estimated using emission factors from
the ARB’s Mobile Source Emission Factor Model (EMFAC 2007) using VMT by speed bin.
The revised on-road mobile-source GHG emissions estimates account for locally (City)-generated VMT on state
highways (e.g., Interstate-80) and do not include emissions associated with trips that originate and terminate
outside of Citrus Heights. The original GHG emissions inventory did not distinguish between locally-generated or
pass-through VMT. In addition, the original inventory did not calculate emissions according to speed bin. Thus,
this refined calculation enables the City to more accurately identify the subset of mobile-source emissions that
General Plan polices can influence.
OFF-ROAD MOBILE SOURCES
Off-road mobile-source GHG emissions were calculated using a top-down method. ARB’s OFFROAD emissions
model contains factors for types of off-road motor vehicles such as boats, agricultural equipment, off-highway
vehicles, lawn and garden equipment, and rail. The OFFROAD model aggregates off-road emissions for all of
Sacramento County. Under the current inventory calculation, the total off-road GHG emissions for all of
Sacramento County were apportioned using the population of each jurisdiction (incorporated cities and
unincorporated areas). This approach to allocating off-road mobile-source GHG emissions is not necessarily
representative of the jurisdictions in which off-road emissions sources would exist. For example, under this
method, some portion of agricultural equipment-related GHG emissions would be allocated to Citrus Heights,
when most of this type of equipment would be located in the unincorporated area of the County. However, this
approach may be appropriate for lawn and garden equipment emissions.
The revised off-road mobile-source GHG estimates removed emissions that are not applicable to Citrus Heights
(e.g., use of agricultural equipment, boats, off-highway vehicles) from the countywide OFFROAD model, but
retained emissions associated with equipment that is likely used within the City (e.g., landscape and construction
equipment, air compressors, generators). These emissions were then apportioned by population to Citrus Heights.

WASTEWATER EMISSIONS
Domestic wastewater treatment emissions were calculated using a bottom-up calculation method for GHG
emissions generated by the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). The Sacramento
Regional WWTP service area includes the cities of Citrus Heights, Elk Grove, Folsom Rancho Cordova,
Sacramento, West Sacramento, and a portion of unincorporated Sacramento County. Wastewater is treated at the
plant using secondary treatment processes, which results in methane formation. Emission factors for methane
published by the IPCC for wastewater treatment and discharge were used, along with facility-specific information
on average annual flow and influent biological oxygen demand (BOD). The GHG emissions from the Sacramento
Regional WWTP were distributed on a per-capita basis for the entire Sacramento Regional County Sanitation
District service area, and then allocated to Citrus Heights based on the City’s population. This method more
accurately estimates GHG emissions from the wastewater treatment process specific to Citrus Heights.
HIGH GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL GREENHOUSE GASES
High GWP GHGs are associated with industrial processes, refrigerants, semi-conductor manufacturing, and
electrical transmission. According to the City’s inventory, there are no industrial-specific GHG emissions in
Citrus Heights, which would indicate that there are likely few, if any, high GWP GHG emissions in the City.
Thus, high GWP emissions were removed from the emissions baseline in Citrus Heights.

CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION – BASELINE CONDITIONS
FORESEEABLE INDICATORS AND CONSEQUENCES
Despite the level of action taken on the part of the world’s governments to reduce GHG emissions, the earth is
already committed to a certain level of climate change due to GHG emissions that have occurred over the last 150
years. Thus, a certain degree of climate change effects can be considered foreseeable and part of the baseline. The
City will want to plan for resilience in light of the foreseeable effects of climate change on California and
recognizes the need to adapt to a changing environmental baseline.
According to the IPCC, which was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United
Nations Environment Programme, global average temperature is expected to increase by 3–7°F by the end of the
century, depending on future GHG emission scenarios (IPCC 2007). Resource areas other than air quality and
global average temperature could be indirectly affected by the accumulation of GHG emissions. For example, an
increase in the global average temperature is expected to result in a decreased volume of precipitation falling as
snow in California and an overall reduction in snowpack in the Sierra Nevada. Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada
provides both water supply (runoff) and storage (within the snowpack before melting), which is a major source of
supply for the state (including the project site). According to the California Energy Commission (CEC 2006b), the
                                                                                           General Plan Background Report
Climate Change                                             6-14                                       City of Citrus Heights

snowpack portion of the water supply could potentially decline by 30–90% by the end of the 21st century. A
study cited in a report by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) projects that approximately 50%
of the statewide snowpack will be lost by the end of the century (Knowles and Cayan 2002). Although current
forecasts are uncertain, it is evident that this phenomenon could lead to significant challenges in securing an
adequate water supply for a growing population. An increase in precipitation falling as rain rather than snow also
could lead to increased potential for floods because water that would normally be held in the Sierra Nevada until
spring could flow into the Central Valley concurrently with winter storm events. This scenario would place more
pressure on California’s levee/flood control system (DWR 2006).
Another outcome of global climate change is sea level rise. Sea level rose approximately 7 inches during the last
century and it is predicted to rise an additional 7–22 inches by 2100, depending on the future levels of GHG
emissions (IPCC 2007). If this occurs, resultant effects could include increased coastal flooding, saltwater
intrusion (especially a concern in the low-lying Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, where pumps delivering
potable water could be threatened), and disruption of wetlands (CEC 2006b). As the existing climate throughout
California changes over time, the ranges of various plant and wildlife species could shift or be reduced, depending
on the favored temperature and moisture regimes of each species. In the worst cases, some species would become
extinct or be extirpated from the state if suitable conditions are no longer available.

7.1        INTRODUCTION
This chapter discusses the historical and cultural resources found within the planning area and describes the
regulations that affect cultural resources in Citrus Heights.
7.2        REGULATORY SETTING
FEDERAL
AMERICAN INDIAN RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT
The American Indian Religious Freedom Act recognizes that Native American religious practices, sacred sites,
and sacred objects have not been properly protected under other statutes. It establishes as national policy that
traditional practices and beliefs, sites (including right of access), and the use of sacred objects shall be protected
and preserved.
NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT AND NEPA
Most applicable federal regulations concerning cultural resources have been established to comply with the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. The NHPA established guidelines to “preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our
national heritage, and to maintain, wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and a variety of
individual choice.” The NHPA includes regulations specifically for federal land-holding agencies, but also
includes regulations (Section 106) which pertain to all projects that are funded, permitted, or approved by any
federal agency and which have the potential to affect cultural resources. All projects that are subject to NEPA are
also subject to compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA and the NEPA requirements concerning cultural
resources. Provisions of NHPA establish a National Register of Historic Places (The National Register)
maintained by the National Park Service, the Advisory Councils on Historic Preservation, State Historic
Preservation Offices, and grants-in-aid programs.
OTHER FEDERAL LEGISLATION
Historic preservation legislation was initiated by the Antiquities Act of 1966, which aimed to protect important
historic and archaeological sites. It established a system of permits for conducting archaeological studies on
federal land, as well as setting penalties for noncompliance. This permit process controls the disturbance of
archaeological sites on federal land. New permits are currently issued under the Archeological Resources
Protection Act (ARPA) of 1979. The purpose of ARPA is to enhance preservation and protection of

archaeological resources on public and Native American lands. The Historic Sites Act of 1935 declared that it is
national policy to “Preserve for public use historic sites, buildings, and objects of national significance.”
STATE
CALIFORNIA REGISTER OF HISTORIC RESOURCES
California State law also provides for the protection of cultural resources by requiring evaluations of the
significance of prehistoric and historic resources identified in California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
documents. Under CEQA, a cultural resource is considered an important historical resource if it meets any of the
criteria found in Section 15064.5(a) of the CEQA Guidelines. Criteria identified in the CEQA Guidelines are
similar to those described under the NHPA. The State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) maintains the
California Register of Historic Resources (CRHR). Historic properties listed, or formally designated for eligibility
to be listed, on the National Register are automatically listed on the CRHR. State Landmarks and Points of
Interest are also automatically listed. The CRHR can also include properties designated under local preservation
ordinances or identified through local historical resource surveys.
CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT
CEQA requires that lead agencies determine whether projects may have a significant effect on archaeological,
paleontological and historical resources. This determination applies to those resources which meet significance
criteria qualifying them as “unique,” “important,” listed on CRHR, or eligible for listing on the CRHR. If the
agency determines that a project may have a significant effect on a significant resource, the project is determined
to have a significant effect on the environment, and these effects must be addressed. If a cultural resource is found
not to be significant or unique under the qualifying criteria, it need not be considered further in the planning
process.
CEQA emphasizes avoidance of archaeological and historical resources as the preferred means of reducing
potential significant environmental effects resulting from projects. If avoidance is not feasible, an excavation
program or some other form of mitigation must be developed to mitigate the impacts. In order to adequately
address the level of potential impacts, and thereby design appropriate mitigation measures, the significance and
nature of the cultural resources must be determined. The following are steps typically taken to assess and mitigate
potential impacts to cultural resources for the purposes of CEQA:
►    Identify cultural resources,
►    Evaluate the significance of the cultural resources found,
►    Evaluate the effects of the project on cultural resources, and
                                                                                           General Plan Background Report
Historical and Cultural Resources                          7-2                                        City of Citrus Heights

►    Develop and implement measures to mitigate the effects of the project on cultural resources that would be
     significantly affected.
STATE LAWS PERTAINING TO HUMAN REMAINS
Section 7050.5 of the California Health and Safety Code requires that construction or excavation be stopped in the
vicinity of discovered human remains until the county coroner can determine whether the remains are those of a
Native American. If the remains are determined to be Native American, the coroner must contact the California
Native American Heritage Commission. CEQA Guidelines (Section 15064.5) specify the procedures to be
followed in case of the discovery of human remains on non-federal land. The disposition of Native American
burials falls within the jurisdiction of the Native American Heritage Commission.
REGIONAL/LOCAL
CITY OF CITRUS HEIGHTS MUNICIPAL CODE
Citrus Heights’s Municipal Code established a History and Cultural Arts Commission in 2002. The commission is
charged to assist in the preservation of the City’s historic resources and landmarks as well as the promotion of
cultural art activities and programs throughout the community. In addition, the code established the commission
with the duty of completing a comprehensive historic resources inventory and maintaining a historic register,
developing a historic preservation ordinance, designating historical landmarks, preserving and protecting the

7.3        HISTORY OF CITRUS HEIGHTS
Throughout most of the Spanish-Mexican period of the growth of California (1542–1848), settlement was limited
to a narrow coastal strip along El Camino Real, with only a few isolated frontier outposts of civilization. One of
these outposts was the vast estate of John Augustus Sutter, a German-Swiss immigrant, who was granted 11
square leagues of land in the Sacramento Valley under the condition that he settled 12 other families on the land.
One of these Mexican land sub-grants was the Rancho Del San Juan, an approximately 20,000 acre tract of rich
farm land originally granted in 1844. This sub-grant included present-day Citrus Heights.
The Treaty of Guadalupe Hildago of February 1848 officially ended the Mexican War (1846–1848) and
California was ceded to the United States. The discovery of gold and the rush of 1849 which followed saw the
population of the new territory increase from roughly 10,000 in 1848 to approximately 50,000 at the end of 1849.
In September of 1850, California pressed the United States government for admittance into the union and became
the 31st state. California’s Mexican land grant parcels were then divided up into a smaller American county-
township system, with Sacramento County being one of California’s original 27 counties. Townships were

established throughout the county, with present-day Citrus Heights becoming a part of Sacramento County’s
Central Township. There were no settlements, few inhabitants, and no roads in Central Township when it was
initially established.
Central Township’s isolation ended abruptly in 1850 when a new shortened road to Auburn knifed its way
diagonally through the Township following along present-day Auburn Boulevard to Sylvan Corners, where it
veered off in a northerly direction along today’s Old Auburn Road. From early spring to late fall, heavily loaded
freight wagons traversed this dusty road bound for Auburn, leading to a number of way stations along the route
for teamsters to stop for a good night’s sleep.
Early pioneer settlers in the Central Township established their ranches in the late 1850s along Old Auburn Road.
As a rule, each pioneer family settled on a quarter section (160 acres) of land, built a house and a barn, dug a well,
and set about clearing the land for farming. Because the land had to be cleared of native oak trees, many of the
early settlers earned their income selling cords of firewood to nearby Sacramento. Early farmers sold their wheat
crops to flouring mills, while hay and barley were grown mostly for use as food for their livestock.
A schoolhouse was built in 1862, spurred on by W. A. Thomas’ conviction that Citrus Heights housed enough
children to justify a school district. Mr. Thomas donated five acres of land on the northwest corner of Sylvan
Corners, and deemed it Sylvan School. Once completed, it became the educational, civic, social, and religious
center of the community. Community parties and church services were held in the small, one-room building, as
well as daily classes. In 1864, the County Board of Supervisors approved a petition by local farmers to provide an
access road from Old Auburn Road to the eastern part of the district, which has since been known as “Greenback
Lane.” In January 1863, ground was broken for the Central Pacific Railroad, and a year later the railroad passed
through the Central Township. The completion of the railroad through the area brought an influx of settlers and
increased exportation of agricultural crops by local farmers. Continued in-migration of settlers led to the need for
a second grammar school, the San Juan School, south of Winding Way.
Among the newcomers of the 1860s and 70s was Cornelius Donahue, who established a ranch near Citrus Heights
in 1863, then expanded it in 1872 to include the lands that now house Sunrise Mall and Birdcage Center. Peter
Van Maren, an early settler who was a leading agriculturalist in the region, maintained a vast estate of nearly
1,000 acres by 1875. In 1910, the quiet pastoral life of the rural Sylvan district underwent a marked change when
the real estate firm Trainor and Desmond bought up large tracts of idle land and subdivided them into 10-acre
lots. As a promotional ploy to attract buyers, the firm replaced the name Sylvan with the more “euphonious”
sounding name of Citrus Heights, and it has remained so.
Irrigation water, provided originally (1911) by the Citrus Heights Water Takers Association and distributed by the
North Fork Ditch Company, transformed the rural grain farms into the present active community. Further impetus

to the urbanization of Citrus Heights occurred in 1912 with the construction of the state highway system and
Highway 40, the predecessor to today’s Interstate 80. Highway 40 originated in San Francisco and followed a
northeasterly route toward Sacramento, and on along Auburn Road to Roseville. As early as 1914, the Golden
Eagle-Barker Stage line offered passenger bus service from Roseville to Sacramento, via Citrus Heights.
Adolph Van Maren, successor to his father Peter Van Maren, played a leading role in community development for
many years. He served on the San Juan School Board, and contributed to the development of the San Juan High
School in 1915. The present site of the Citrus Heights Community Club House on Sylvan Road is on land donated
by Van Maren, while the actual building is the old Sylvan School House, which was moved to the site after a new
school facility was built in 1927. The increase in both resident population and visitors traveling on the new state
highway led to increased business opportunities. William Cobb established a store and service station opposite the
school, and Mr. Alexandra established the Cripple Creek Service Station and Auto Camp further up on Auburn
Boulevard.
A volunteer fire-fighting group was organized in 1934, and later in 1935 the Citrus Heights Fire District, Inc. was
born. One of the most fondly remembered community activities was the annual “Road Days,” sponsored by the
Community Club. Began in 1924, almost all of the township’s 200 families came out to help patch holes in
country roads, clean drainage ditches, plant trees on school grounds, and lay sidewalks. Although the first small
library facility in Citrus Heights was run out of a private home with an inventory of 50 books in 1908, the
community built a new library building at the corner of Auburn Boulevard and Sylvan Road in 1930. The year
1932, during the Great Depression, saw the end of Citrus Heights’ attempts at fruit farming, as a winter freeze
destroyed most of the working orchards.
A substantial influx of newcomers following the end of World War II put a severe strain on Citrus Heights’
limited water supply. New subdivisions of 1, 2, and 5-acre lots were creating increasing needs for the provision of
public facilities to new families seeking a rural town. In 1947, Citrus Heights obtained its own post office. New
businesses continued to appear to accommodate the growing population, along Auburn Boulevard, Mariposa
Avenue, and Greenback Lane. The San Juan Unified School District saw phenomenal growth and completed the
decade with eight elementary schools and one high school. Around this time, Mrs. Eugene Desimone organized
the Citrus Heights Ladies in White as an emergency rescue unit of 50 members, each holding advanced first-aid
cards and required to respond 24 hours a day. The advent of professional ambulance service in 1983 led to the
group’s disbandment.
By 1960, the population of “rural” Citrus Heights had reached 22,600. Auburn Boulevard continued to serve as
the community’s “main street,” spurred by the construction of the Grand Oaks Plaza (1960), one of the first
enclosed malls in the country. Later, significant commercial development, including Sunrise Mall, Birdcage

Walk, Fountain Square, and Sunrise Village, shifted the commercial focus southward toward Greenback Lane.
During this time, the rocket motor manufacturing plant Aerojet General was booming; employing over 19,000
people at its peak during the early 1960’s, after which it saw a steady decline to under 4,000 in 1977. The plant
attracted new residents to Citrus Heights, developing a more professional and scientific demographic.
In 1970, ground was broken for the giant Sunrise Mall, spurring a great deal of new growth in the Sunrise
Boulevard-Greenback Lane area. By 1975, there were 101 shops, anchored by four department stores, employing
2,500 employees. Then in 1976, across Sunrise Boulevard from the Mall, rose Birdcage Walk, a collection of
shops and businesses laid out along a park-like walkway. The two shopping centers spurred the construction of
hundreds of businesses in the surrounding area. Sunrise Village, the third of the City’s “Big Three” retail centers,
began construction around 1976 as well. The Village, located at the intersection of Sunrise Boulevard and
Madison Avenue, added approximately 40,000 square feet of retail space in the 1980s. Radiating outward from
the Sunrise and Greenback commercial corridors were large office buildings and new apartment house complexes
and housing tracts, the bulk of which were built during the 1970s and 1980s.
In 1974, a Community Planning Advisory Council was formed to update the Community Plan and provide for
orderly growth of the area. The objective of the updated Community Plan was to provide a balance of land uses
which were “mutually compatible, functional, healthful, and aesthetically pleasing.” It was decided the solution to
achieving orderly and efficient development, circulation, and public facilities was incorporation, rather than
annexation into the City of Sacramento. That same year, voters affirmed their position with an overwhelming
defeat to consolidate with the capital city.
The incorporation movement experienced a number of defeats throughout the 1970s and 1980s, attributable
primarily to opposition by the County Board of Supervisors. During this time, the Citrus Heights Community
Council, an advisory body to the County Board, fought for increased land use controls and public services. The
community’s population was spiraling upward, and quickly developing the last of the area’s rural properties. The
County seemed unable to resolve growing problems resulting from increased urban growth, particularly the
number of County Deputy Sheriffs needed to combat the community’s car thefts, residential burglaries, and
vandalism. Finally, the voters approved the incorporation on November 5, 1996. On January 1, 1997, the
community of Citrus Heights became the City of Citrus Heights.
7.4        EXISTING CONDITIONS
PREHISTORIC RESOURCES
Before Euro-American people began to settle California in relatively large numbers during the mid-1800s, the
Sacramento region was inhabited by two Native American ethnic groups: the Plains Miwok and the Valley
                                                                                         General Plan Background Report

Nisenan (Maidu). The basic political unit within both the Plains Miwok and Valley Nisenan cultures was the
“triblet,” consisting of one primary and several satellite villages. Those peoples established village sites and
seasonal camps adjacent to rivers and various other wetlands, using the nearby riparian resources during hunting
and gathering activities.
A Historical and Archeological Resources Record Search conducted by the North Central Information Center
found a small prehistoric village or campsite along Cripple Creek which included a variety of stone artifacts (in
addition to some square nails from historic times).
Other sites have been found along Arcade Creek, containing small scatters of flake material chert-like in
character. The flake scatters appeared to be surface remains where tools were sharpened or manufactured to
support hunting activities. Evidence indicates that these sites were transient, although it also indicates that more
permanent villages were located in the vicinity.
An additional complex of sites inhabited by the indigenous people of the area is the Indian Stone Corral, located
just east of the city limits. This complex is thought by many archeologists to represent a major ceremonial site for
the Valley Nisenan people. Unique features as well as middens, artifacts and house pits typical of Valley Nisenan
sites have been recorded at the Indian Stone Corral.
The Historical and Archeological Resources Record Search conducted by the North Central Information Center
was simply a search of previously-recorded sites, typically analyzed through surface reconnaissance. As ground-
breaking occurs for new development projects, particularly near Arcade and Cripple Creeks, caution should be
used in identifying potential buried, subsurface historic or prehistoric remains.
HISTORIC RESOURCES
In December of 1998, a Historic and Archeological Resources Record Search was conducted by the North Central
Information Center at California State University, Sacramento. Previous historic and archeological investigations
were analyzed for resource sites located within the city limits. Archival information, historic journals and maps,
historical property listings, and Environmental Impact Reports were also used to gather information on historical
and cultural resources within the City.
In 2001, a limited cultural resources survey was performed in the immediate vicinity of Sylvan Corners. This
survey was conducted in conjunction with a road improvement project and was undertaken to fulfill federally
mandated NHPA Section 106 requirements.
In 2002, the City of Citrus Height hired a professional historical consultant to conduct a survey of known historic
sites. The consultant prepared DPR 523 Historical Resource Survey forms for these properties that provided

historical background, details architectural descriptions of the properties and evaluation of their significance and
potential for listing in the national and/or state historic registers.
In May, 2006, the City engaged Roland Nawi Associates: Preservation Consultants to prepare a Historical
Resources Survey. This survey discussed the general history of the development of the Citrus Heights area that
places its historic resources within the context of major events and changing patterns of socio-economic
development. The survey also identifies important themes and patterns in the City’s history and identifies the
resources that are directly associated with them. Finally, the survey included the DPR 523 forms for all notable
historic recourses. To support this survey, a field inspection was completed to determine if any significant
changes had taken place to the previously identified resources. In addition, a reconnaissance survey was
conducted to ascertain if there were resources which may have been previously overlooked. Several houses
associated with the Trainor and Desmond Citrus Heights tracts were newly identified and recorded on DRP 523
forms.
Unfortunately, most of the City’s historical resources no longer exist. As urbanization occurred throughout the
20th century, the majority of older structures were demolished to make room for new development. However,
there are a few noteworthy historical remnants. Each historical resource is described below, with its location
illustrated in Figure 7-1.
19TH CENTURY THEMED RESOURCES
14 Mile/Van Maren House
In 1851, the original 14 Mile House was constructed as a way station for teamsters hauling supplies to country
mining camps. These types of early roadhouses were most often two-story frame and clapboard buildings built
lengthwise to the road, with a long porch across the front. The men’s bar room was located just off the front
porch, and a large barn for teamster animals was usually located directly across the road. Adolph and Catherine
Van Maren later acquired the home, and renovated the exterior in 1920 as a wedding gift to son Guy Van Maren
and wife Iva. Their great-grandson now lives with his family in the home that was originally the old 14 Mile
House, at 6540 Auburn Boulevard. The historic survey evaluation of 2002 suggests that this may be the oldest
wood frame building in Sacramento County. The house is potentially eligible for listing in the California Register
of Historical Resources and in the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D for its potential to yield
information as an historic archeological site. The house itself has an information potential regarding early
construction in California. The area in the immediate vicinity of the house has potential for deposits associated
with the 1850’s road house.

Rusch Home
The old Rusch Home, located at 7301 Antelope Road in the northwest section of Rusch Park, belonged to Citrus
Heights pioneers Fred and Julia Rusch. The homesite dates back to 1885 when their grandparents, Fred and Julia
Volle, settled as cattle ranchers. The Rusch Home that stands today was built in 1914 after a fire destroyed the
original sod-roofed home. The new home was a single-story structure of wood lap siding, with a large covered
porch and a cedar shingle roof. In 1950, the land was donated to the community, leading to the eventual creation
of the Sunrise Recreation and Park District. The Rusch Home and its surrounding two-acre botanical garden,
along with the original 15-acre park donation, have become the core of today’s Rusch Park. The Rusch’s life-long
home is now listed with the State Office of Historic Preservation as a California Point of Historical Interest (SAC-
012).
Dekay/Sunrise Ranch Home
The Sunrise Ranch Home was originally constructed in 1868, when widow Jane Pitcher and her eight children
took up 650 acres east of Sylvan, near the Placer-Sacramento County line. Jane Pitcher named her property
“Sunrise Ranch,” after which today’s busy Sunrise Boulevard is named. According to the Historical Society, the
residence remains in use today by the Kniesel family. Although it is one of the oldest residential structures in the
area, the building has been substantially altered and is not eligible for listing in the California Register of
Historical Resources or the National Register of Historic Places due to a lack of historical integrity.
Sylvan School/Citrus Heights Community Club
The old Sylvan School was initially constructed in 1862 as a clapboard structure, painted white with green
shutters covering its eight windows. The interior consisted of a single classroom, and two small broom or hat
halls. In addition to creating an educational center for the community, the Sylvan School House also functioned as
a civic, social, and religious center; the School House held church services, dancing parties, and local voting
discussions. In the fall of 1927, the Citrus Heights Community Club led the community’s efforts to construct
expanded school facilities. The Old Sylvan School House was moved from Sylvan Corners to a half-acre site at
6921 Sylvan Road, donated by Adolph Van Maren. The historic old building, although modified, remains in use
today as a community meeting hall, the Citrus Heights Community Club House. The integrity of the building
makes the listing in the California Register questionable.
Sylvan Cemetery
Land for the Sylvan Cemetery was donated to the community in 1862 by early settler Daniel Lewis. The
Cemetery, located adjacent to the original Sylvan School site, first broke ground in 1864 for the body of James
Horton. The young settler was said to have gone to California to seek his fortune in gold, but poisoned himself
because of an eye ailment that was causing blindness. Since 1862, the Sylvan Cemetery has been enlarged many
                                                                                             General Plan Background Report

times and now encompasses 18 acres. Cemeteries must meet special requirement for eligibility for the National
Register. This would take require careful and detailed research in the cemetery record and other related resources.
20TH CENTURY THEMED RESOURCES
San Juan High School
San Juan School was the first secondary school established in Citrus Heights and the northeast part of Sacramento
County. Prior to its establishment, the nearest high school was located in Roseville, although that high school had
only been in existence for a few years prior to the construction of San Juan. The San Juan High School is eligible
under Criterion 1/A for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical
Resources as a key institution representing the growth and development of the area of Citrus Heights and as the
first high school in the northeast county.
Friends Church
The Friends Church was constructed in 1921. It was the first church built within the Sylvan district/Citrus
Heights. A small group of Friends settled in the newly established Trainor and Desmond tract. Asa Leonard, the
informal leader of this group, was the driving force behind the establishment of a church and the building of a
meeting house. The church was remodeled in 1938 and again in 1953. Even though the 1953 remodel retained a
large part of the 1921 church, it resulted in a very different appearance. Although the present appearance of the
building differs considerably from that of the original church, the remodel, accomplished more than fifty years
ago, is within the period in which the church was still in use by the Friends community and is eligible for listing
in the California Register of Historical Resources.
12 Mile House
The original 12 Mile House was also constructed in the 1800’s as a teamster way station. It was located on the
south bed of Cripple Creek near present-day DeVechi Road, where a low spot in the water course allowed wagons
to cross. However, in the 1920’s Auburn Road was expanded to accommodate increased traffic and the 12 Mile
House was rebuilt. The new 12 Mile House, located at the extreme south-west edge of the community on Auburn
Boulevard, was built originally as a bar and operated that way until 1998. The building today remains much as it
did in 1950 and is among one of the oldest commercial structures in Citrus Heights. Because alterations have not
significantly compromised its architectural integrity, the building retains its historical associations to the late
1940s and appears eligible for listing in the California Register of Historical Resources.

                       8 COMMUNITY SERVICES AND FACILITIES
8.1        INTRODUCTION
Citrus Heights is developed with a complicated network of public facilities and services. Each type of service has
a unique set of constraints and must adapt to growth and change differently. This chapter describes the provision
of public services in Citrus Heights provided by the City and several special districts for the following public
services: safety, parks and recreation, schools, water, wastewater collection and treatment, solid waste and
recycling, and storm drainage.
8.2        GOVERNMENT
Governmental services in the City of Citrus Heights consist of the City Manager’s Office and five major
departments: Human Resources/City Information, General Services Department, Community and Economic
Development, Finance and Police. Within any department, the City may either hire employees, or contract out for
the necessary services. Presently all employees within the five departments are City employees. In November
2009, the City had 198 full-time equivalent employees including sworn officers.
CITRUS HEIGHTS COMMUNITY FACILITIES
Governmental services take place at the Fountain Square Civic Center campus located at 6237 Fountain Square
Drive. Initially built as a commercial facility in the late 1970s, the campus is undergoing improvements to
preserve its integrity and aesthetics, as well as to accommodate growth of governmental services and department
and staff needs. The campus consists of the City Council Chambers, City Hall, Police Center, General Services
Building, Kroeger Hall and the most recent addition, the Community Center, a 29,000 square foot facility.
Figure 8-1 shows the community facilities in the City such as the post office, library and City Hall.
NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS AND RESIDENTS’ EMPOWERMENT ASSOCIATION OF
CITRUS HEIGHTS
The Residents’ Empowerment Association of Citrus Heights (REACH) is an umbrella organization that consists
of a board of directors and 11 member neighborhood associations. Its mission is to represent the interests of the
Citrus Heights community and its residents and encourages participation in neighborhood associations to enhance
the quality of life in the community. Each REACH member association appoints one representative from their
group to serve on the board. The REACH board then acts as a coordinating body for the 11 neighborhood groups.
The following areas represent the eleven neighborhood associations within the City:

8.3        PUBLIC SAFETY
POLICE AND FIRE REGULATORY SETTING
FEDERAL
Occupational Safety and Health Administration Staffing Policies
The Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) applies the confined space safety
regulations for work inside tanks and underground spaces to America’s firefighters. This requires in atmospheres
that are Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) that there be teams of two inside and two outside in
constant communication, with the outside pair equipped and ready to rescue the inside pair. This situation occurs
in building fires where the fire and smoke conditions are serious enough to require the wearing of self-contained
breathing apparatus (SCBA). This is commonly called the “2-in/2-out” policy. This policy requires that
firefighters enter serious building fires in teams of two, while two more firefighters are outside and immediately
ready to rescue them should trouble arise. While under OSHA policy one of the outside “two-out” personnel can
also be the incident commander (typically a chief officer) or fire apparatus operator, this person must be fully
suited-up in protective clothing, have a breathing apparatus donned except for the face piece, meet all physical
requirements to enter IDLH atmospheres and thus be ready to immediately help with the rescue of interior
firefighters in trouble.

National Fire Protection Agency Staffing Guidelines
The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard on Career Fire Service Deployment was issued in
2001. While advisory to local governments, as it starts to become locally adopted and used, it develops
momentum, forcing adoption by neighboring communities. NFPA 1710 calls for four-person fire crew staffing,
arriving on one or two apparatus as a “company.” The initial attack crew should arrive at the emergency within
four minutes travel time, 90 percent of the time, and the total effective response force (first alarm assignment)
shall arrive within eight minutes travel time, 90 percent of the time.
STATE
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration Standards
In accordance with California Code of Regulations Title 8 Sections 1270 “Fire Prevention” and 6773 “Fire
Protection and Fire Equipment,” the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) has
established minimum standards for fire suppression and emergency medical services. The standards include, but
are not limited to, guidelines on the handling of highly combustible materials, fire hose sizing requirements,
restrictions on the use of compressed air, access roads, and the testing, maintenance and use of all fire fighting
and emergency medical equipment.
Uniform Fire Code
The Uniform Fire Code (UFC) contains regulations relating to construction, maintenance, and use of buildings.
Topics addressed in the code include fire department access, fire hydrants, automatic sprinkler systems, fire alarm
systems, fire and explosion hazards safety, hazardous materials storage and use, provisions intended to protect
and assist fire responders, industrial processes, and many other general and specialized fire-safety requirements
for new and existing buildings and the surrounding premises. The UFC contains specialized technical regulations
related to fire and life safety.
California Building Code
State fire regulations are set forth in Sections 13000 et seq. of the California Health and Safety Code, which
includes regulations for building standards (as set forth in the California Building Code), fire protection and
notification systems, fire protection devices such as extinguishers, smoke alarms, high-rise building, childcare
facility standards, and fire suppression training.

REGIONAL/LOCAL
Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Master Plan
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (SMFD) Master Plan provides policy guidance, objectives, and
activities in an effort to improve emergency response to the district’s residents, use existing resources more
efficiently, and improve district facilities. As part of the master plan, a Fire Station Replacement Program was
recommended to actively address deficiencies with existing fire stations, including age and condition issues;
noncompliance with building codes, such as the ability to respond to emergencies following an earthquake; and
lack of apparatus rooms of sufficient size to store present-day emergency-response equipment. In addition, the
program would improve emergency response to the district’s residents while using existing SMFD resources more
efficiently.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
POLICE PROTECTION
Upon incorporation, the City partnered with the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD) to provide law
enforcement services by contract. However, costs for the contracted police service rose dramatically. In response,
the City Council, after an extensive public process, established in-house police services to be staffed by City
employees. After eight years of contracting out police services with the SCSD, the City established its own Police
Department in June 2006. The Citrus Heights Police Department (CHPD) includes a full service police station
located at the Fountain Square Civic Center campus.
Staffing and Services
The CHPD employs 86 sworn police officers and organizes its peace officers into two divisions, the Patrol
Division (65 officers) and the Investigative Services Division (21 officers). In addition, the CHPD consists of the
Support Services Division (20 staff) and an Administrative Unit (17 staff).
Patrol Services
The Patrol Services Division is led by one commander. The commander is supported by four lieutenants and nine
sergeants. The Patrol Services Division is responsible for community-oriented policing that promotes
neighborhood-based problem solving, at-risk youth intervention, and partnerships with businesses, community
programs, and customer service. In addition, the Patrol Services Division is responsible for traffic enforcement,
accident investigation, criminal investigation, service calls, the K-9 Unit and Bicycle Patrol.

Investigative Services
The Investigative Services Division is led by one commander who is supported by a division lieutenant and three
sergeants. The responsibility of the Investigative Services Division is to conduct follow-up investigations of all
reported felony offenses and certain misdemeanor offenses that occur in the City. The Division’s detectives
investigate crimes that have possible suspects or leads. The objectives of such investigations are the identification
and prosecution of those individuals responsible for the crime. In addition, Investigative Services is responsible
for the Administrative Training Unit, Court Ordered Registrants, Crime Scene Investigations (CSI) and Property
Unit, General Investigations, Special Investigations and Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT).
Support Services
Support Services, consisting of the Communications Center and the Records Unit and the Volunteer-Intern
Program is led by one manager. The Communication Center is equipped with state-of-the-art communication
equipment that operates on the county-wide communications system designed and maintained by the Sacramento
Regional Radio Communications System, which enables staff to easily communicate with surrounding agencies.
On a normal 24-hour day, the center will handle approximately 400 calls. Typically, calls coming into the center
include requests for information, medical emergencies, reports of illegal or suspicious activity, requests for an
officer to respond, and neighborhood quality of life concerns.
The Communication Center is staffed with eleven dispatchers and two call-takers who monitor five computer
screens, answer incoming 911, emergency, and non-emergency calls, provide information and advice to residents,
and enter calls for service. The dispatchers are responsible for prioritizing calls and workload, sending officers to
calls, maintaining an accurate status on each on-duty officer, entering wanted or stolen vehicles, missing persons
and guns into the nationwide database to provide information to other agencies, as well as documenting every
call, every status, and every request or entry. In addition, five senior dispatchers lead the activities of the
dispatchers. In addition to working side-by-side with the dispatchers in handling calls, dispatching officers and
managing officer requests, they are also responsible for the operations, maintenance, and training in the Center.
The dispatchers and senior dispatchers are overseen by two communications supervisors who are responsible for
the overall operation of the Communications Center.
The Records Unit is supervised by one records services supervisor and staffed by eight records assistants. The
Records Unit provides the following services:
►    file crime reports with the District Attorney’s Office
►    process parking and traffic citations
►    fingerprint with ink and Live Scan
►    process criminal and collision reports

►    manage arrest warrants
►    bill false alarms
►    release police reports
The Volunteer-Intern Program provides a value-added level of support to state, county, and local law enforcement
agencies. While all agencies are designed and staffed to provide appropriate policing and law enforcement
services to the community, volunteers/interns allow law enforcement agencies and officers to focus on policing
and enforcement by taking on these additional duties, for example:
►    participating in community meetings to learn about citizen concerns;
►    assisting with special events;
►    following up with victims of certain types of crime and provide them with referrals to other agencies;
►    participating in citizen patrol programs;
►    providing an array of clerical, data, and document support to department staff; and
►    supporting law use of technology, particularly law enforcement-relevant software applications.
Figure 8-3 identifies neighborhood policing and planning area boundaries.
The CHPD also draws on the resources of the larger Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department. Should the CHPD
need additional officers or equipment (e.g., helicopters), the Sheriff’s Department responds and is reimbursed
accordingly.
Calls for Service Analysis
One indicator of police performance commonly used by communities is the average time it takes a department to
respond to calls for service. The CHPD has opted to use a “differential” response system. Each call for service is
prioritized according to the amount of damage that can occur. For example, calls involving weapons and bodily
harm are responded to immediately, while calls involving barking dogs and other such nuisances are delayed until
all emergency calls have been handled. The CHPD also emphasizes the importance of effectively solving the
problem once the officer has responded.
An analysis of 2008 CHPD response times concluded that approximately 94 percent of emergency calls were
responded to within 10 minutes, from the time the call was dispatched to the moment the officers arrived on
location. Ninety-nine percent of emergency calls and 93 percent of non-emergency calls were addressed within
15 minutes. Industry standards indicate average response to calls for service between five and ten minutes from
the time an officer is dispatched.

Crime Reports
In both 2007 and 2008, the CHPD totaled approximately 8,328 Part 1 crimes (indexed crimes). The distribution of
such crimes was similar in 2007 and 2008. Over 50 percent of the City’s Part 1 crimes occurred in Larceny-Theft
for both years. The Homicide category remains relatively low. Robbery, Aggravated Assault, Rape, Motor
Vehicle Theft and Arson decreased during the reported period. Table 8-1 illustrates the distribution of such
crimes.

FIRE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES
Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District
On December 1, 2000, the Sacramento County Fire District and the American River Fire District formed the
SMFD. The SMFD serves nearly 640,000 residents over a 417-square-mile area of Sacramento and Placer
counties including the City of Citrus Heights, as shown in Figure 8-4. Historically, the SMFD represents
16 former fire agencies, some of which were founded more than six decades ago. Today, Metro Fire is the
seventh-largest fire district in California with 42 strategically located fire stations.
The City of Citrus Heights, at approximately 14 square miles, constitutes nearly 3 percent of the District’s land
area. As noted above, the estimated 2009 service population for the SMFD was approximately 640,000 people, of
which, the City’s 2009 population which is estimated at 87,017, constituting approximately 13.5 percent. The
density of urban development in Citrus Heights, as opposed to more rural County areas, results in a larger percent
of population residing in a smaller proportion of the SMFD service area.
Operations
Approximately 750 uniformed and support personnel work out of 41 fire stations, two (2) of which are volunteer
staffed stations, to provide fire, rescue, and medical services to the District’s population. SMFD personnel provide
emergency services, including structure, grassland, and fuel fire suppression, paramedic/medical services,
ambulance transport, heavy rescue/vehicle extrication, water rescue (both land- and water-based) and cliff-
side/vertical rescue. Minimum staffing levels necessary to provide these emergency services include: 3-person
Engine crews, 4-person Ladder Truck crews, and 2-person Medic units.
The SMFD maintains an extensive collection of fire protection apparatus. The District’s fire protection apparatus
consists of 37 Engines which maintain Advanced Life Support (ALS) capabilities as well as Medic Units that are
staffed 24-hours a day. Equipment is frequently moved among the various fire stations within the District to best
protect the population. The SMFD also maintains Automatic Coverage Agreements (mutual aid) with the other
fire agencies in Sacramento County, so that in case of a major disaster, the District can draw on resources from all
90 stations within the County.
OSHA mandates that all fire crews maintain a “two-in, two-out” standard. This means that if two fire fighters are
entering a burning structure for rescue or suppression purposes, two fire fighters must also be outside of the
structure prepared to perform rescue operations. The SMFD staffs a 3-person Engine crews, but will meet the
OSHA requirement by immediately dispatching an additional company on appropriate calls.

Dispatching services are provided to the District by the Sacramento Regional Fire/Emergency Medical Services
Communications Center. Formed through a joint-powers agreement by the majority of fire agencies in
Sacramento County, this computerized center provides state-of-the-art dispatch for fire, rescue, and medical
emergencies throughout the County The center also handles dispatch for the Statewide mutual aid system
(through the Office of Emergency Services) for this region.
Divisions
The SMFD’s Training Division provides on-going education and recruit training using a fixed, four-story drill
tower, two large drill grounds, four classrooms, a tractor-drawn portable drill tower, and a state-of-the-art satellite
receiving station and audio-visual studio. Because over 50 percent of the District’s responses are for medical
emergencies, SMFD personnel also receive extensive Emergency Medical Services (EMS) training. All SMFD
fire crews are trained and equipped as first responders to provide basic life support services prior to the arrival of
an ambulance.
SMFD’s Fire Prevention Division coordinates fire investigations, public education, and fire prevention activities
throughout the various communities served. The Division’s fire prevention activities include enforcing arson laws
and the City-adopted Uniform Fire Code, identifying and eliminating fire hazards, reviewing land and building
uses for fire protection needs, and inspecting plans and buildings under construction. Public education activities
focus on educating the public concerning the installation and maintenance of smoke detectors, identifying and
correcting fire hazards, designing home escape plans, reporting emergencies, and preventing injuries.
The Fleet Maintenance Division maintains the District’s large fleet of over 100 vehicles, with various mechanics
and technicians. They operate out of a central maintenance facility, which includes automotive, and apparatus
service and repair facilities, a fabrication and body shop, a parts storage facility, and a machine shop.
Citrus Heights Fire Stations
The SMFD maintains 41 fire stations and one air operations station throughout its 417-square-mile area, four of
which are located within the planning area – Stations 21, 23, 27, and 28 - as shown in Figure 8-4. In addition,
Station 25 lies on the western boundary of the City, and also provides fire, rescue, and medical aid to Citrus
Heights residents. The District’s policy to maintain seamless coverage occasionally results in emergency crew
response to the City from other available stations within the County. Conversely, crews stationed within Citrus
Heights may also be dispatched to respond to emergencies in outlying communities.
Fire stations located within the planning area maintain high levels of emergency service. All urban and suburban
areas within the District, including Citrus Heights, have a Fire Insurance (ISO) rating of three (3). All of the

As with police services, one commonly used measure of emergency service performance is the time it takes crews
to respond to a call. NFPA 1710 recommends that an effective response force (First Alarm) arrive within 8
minutes travel time. When this is added to 1 minute for dispatch and 2 minutes for crew turnout time, the
performance measure becomes 11 minutes from the time of fire dispatch receiving the call to the third unit being
on-scene. The SMFD maintains a standard of emergency call response within 6 minutes for 90 percent of
emergency calls. An analysis of District-wide response times for fire and EMS incidents conducted in FY
2007/2008 revealed an average response time of approximately five minutes for first apparatus on scene 51.4
percent of the time and seven minutes and 45 seconds for first apparatus on scene 90.7 percent of the time.
The emergency calls that Engine crews from Citrus Heights stations are dispatched to constituted approximately
17,769 responses in 2008. Approximately 70 percent of Citrus Heights responses were for medical aid, while
approximately 13 percent were for fire response.
Regional Mutual Aid Plan
The California Office of Emergency Services’ mutual aid plan for Region IV consists of the following counties:
Nevada, Placer, Yolo, Sacramento, El Dorado, Alpine, Amador, San Joaquin, Calaveras, Tuolumne, and
Stanislaus. The Region IV Multi-Casualty Incident Plan develops standard multiple casualty procedures so that
jurisdictions can work together effectively in the case of a fire, explosion, chemical spill, or natural disaster that
becomes a multiple casualty incident.
The purpose of the Region IV Multi-Casualty Incident Plan is to standardize emergency response procedures
through the use of consistent response organization responsibilities, mobilization of resources, communications
and documentation, patient dispersal and tracking, and regional hospital capabilities. The plan is designed to

allow each agency to utilize the multiple casualty procedures both to enhance day-to-day medical response
operations, and as a method to ensure that agencies efficiently share resources and communicate rapidly during
multi-casualty incidents.
8.4      PARKS AND RECREATION
PARKS AND RECREATION REGULATORY SETTING
STATE
Public Park Preservation Act
The primary state authority for protecting and preserving parkland is the State Public Park Preservation Act.
Under the Public Resources Code, cities and counties may not acquire any real property that is in use as a public
park for any non-park use unless compensation or land, or both, are provided to replace the parkland acquired.
This provides no net loss of parkland and facilities.
Quimby Act
The Quimby Act (California Government Code Section 66477) states that “the legislative body of a city or county
may, by ordinance, require the dedication of land or impose a requirement of the payment of fees in lieu thereof,
or a combination of both, for park or recreational purposes as a condition to the approval of a tentative or parcel
map”. It should be noted that the Quimby Act only applies to the acquisition of new parkland and does not apply
to the physical development of new park facilities or associated operations and maintenance costs. The Quimby
Act effectively preserves open space needed to develop parkland and recreational facilities; however, the actual
development of parks and other recreational facilities is subject to discretionary approval and is evaluated on a
case-by-case basis with new residential development.
REGIONAL/LOCAL
Sacramento County General Plan
The existing Sacramento County General Plan was adopted in December of 1993. The General Plan contains park
and recreation related policies, discussed in the Open Space Element, applicable to the unincorporated portions of
the Planning Area. Policy OS-9 states that the County shall seek a standard for regional parks of 20 acres per
1,000 persons. While there are a variety of policies relating to open space (i.e., wetlands, riparian corridors,
woodland, and floodlands), other than Policy OS-9, there are no other policies relating to parkland/population
ratios in the General Plan.

Sunrise Recreation and Park District Master Plan
The Sunrise Recreation and Park District (SRPD) has prepared the Sunrise Recreation and Park District Master
Plan, which outlines the District’s projected needs for a period of ten years and strategies for fulfilling those
needs. The current Master Plan’s planning horizon is through 2010. The primary focus of the Master Plan is to
guide the planning and management of park facilities and recreation programs throughout the communities served
by the District for the next ten years.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
SUNRISE RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT
In June of 1950, in response to a 15-acre park site donation by Fred and Julia Rusch, the Citrus Heights
Recreation and Park District was created as a dependent district, with the County Board of Supervisors serving as
the District Board. In 1971, the District consolidated with other local park districts, expanded its boundaries to
serve the residents of Citrus Heights, Foothill Farms and Orangevale, and changed its name to the Sunrise
Recreation and Park District. The District then deleted the Orangevale portion in 1983, and annexed the Antelope
community in 1986. SRPD currently serves approximately 142,000 residents within an estimated 27 square mile
area in Citrus Heights, Carmichael, Foothill Farms, and Antelope. The entire planning area is within the SPRD
boundaries, and constitutes approximately 60 percent of the District’s service population.
Park Sites and Facilities
The SRPD is responsible for providing recreation and park resources to the residents of Citrus Heights, Antelope
and Foothill Farms. The SRPD provides a wide variety of park facilities and recreation programs that complement
other community resources and programs to provide a diverse and accessible selection of recreational
opportunities for District residents.
The SRPD currently administers 38 parks and open space (undeveloped) sites in the planning area, including one
nine-hole golf course and an historic home, totaling approximately 406 acres. SRPD parks range in size from
0.22 of an acre to 48.6 acres. Figure 8-5 illustrates the location of each park facility in the City including open
space (located on Greenback Lane) owned and maintained by the City, while Table 8-6 contains a more detailed
description of the park sites and facilities located within Citrus Heights.
Approximately 268 acres of SRPD parkland exist within the city limits, 207 acres of which are developed. State
law mandates park improvement and acquisition dedications from new developers based on standards of three to
five acres per 1,000 residents. The City’s 2009 population was estimated to be 87,321, which results in an existing
park standard of 2.35 acres per 1,000 residents. However, if the SRPD were to make park facility improvements

on the 61 acres of undeveloped parkland in the City, Citrus Height’s existing park standard would rise to about
three acres per 1,000 residents.

School sites also play an important role in providing neighborhood recreation opportunities. Although the primary
goal of school sites is to provide for the educational and recreational needs of the students, after-school use of the
facilities can be considered a supplemental resource to the District parks. Table 8-7 includes a list of recreational
facilities available at each school site within Citrus Heights. Approximately 40 to 50 percent of typical school site
acreage provides recreation space. Consequently, the 20 elementary schools in the SRPD provide an average of
four acres of open space each, the three middle schools provide approximately seven acres each, and the two high
schools almost 16 acres each. The SRPD and local school districts have historically enjoyed good working
relationships and have cooperated on a number of joint-use, mutually beneficial projects in the past.
In addition to “providing clean, safe, well-designed parks and facilities,” the SRPD’s mission statement includes
“offering a variety of affordable leisure and learning opportunities to individuals of all ages and abilities.” The
SRPD provides programs in art, crafts, dance, gymnastics, karate, tennis, basketball, swim, lifeguard training,
aerobics, dog obedience, cooking, self-defense, CPR, preschool, and senior adult social programs.

OTHER OPEN SPACE RESOURCES
Along with many park facilities and recreation programs, the District also oversees a system of County-
designated natural streams, trails, and other open space resources. The District contains a portion of the County
bikeway system that connects with the American River Parkway, and the SRPD Master Plan supports the
expansion of these bikeways to link District park sites. The SRPD Master Plan also identifies environmental
mitigation measures regarding native oak tree preservation and management, and protection of natural streams,
tributaries and associated riparian wetlands. County-designated streams within SRPD that are to be preserved and
enhanced include Arcade Creek, San Juan Creek, Brooktree Creek, Coyle Creek and Cripple Creek. However,
past encroachment by development has threatened the future possibility of an integrated creekside trail network.
PARK DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
The SRPD Master Plan recommends park planning standards for neighborhood and community parks, based on
National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) standards and the 1993 Sacramento County General Plan
policies and principles for park development:
Neighborhood parks should be at least seven to eight acres in size, and should be located adjacent to elementary
school sites where possible. In general, there should be two to 2.5 acres of parkland per 1,000 persons devoted to
neighborhood park facilities. Each should be near the center of the neighborhood and within ½ to one mile
walking distance of the population it is to serve. Each neighborhood park should ultimately serve 2,000 to 3,500
persons.
Community parks ideally should be 40 to 60 acres in size. As with neighborhood parks, community parks should
be located adjacent to middle or high schools whenever possible. As a standard, one to two acres of parkland per
1,000 persons should be devoted to community park use. In addition to being located near an arterial or collector
street, a community park should be accessible by public transportation. In general, the park should serve 20,000 to
30,000 persons, and be located within a distance of one to two miles of the population it serves.
A majority of the developed parks in Citrus Heights fall within the 8 to 16-acre range, and are located within or
adjacent to residential neighborhoods. With approximately 88 acres of neighborhood parks in this range, the City
offers only one acre of neighborhood park space per 1,000 residents. Two additional neighborhood parks, at
approximately 3.5-acres each, do not fulfill the District’s neighborhood park standards. The City’s three
community parks, C-Bar-C, Crosswoods and Rusch, total approximately 101-acres. These park facilities fulfill
SRPD park planning standards by providing Citrus Heights residents with 1.2 acres of community park space per
1,000 population.

SCHOOL REGULATORY SETTING
While there are no specific Federal regulations related to school facilities, there are a number of Federal, State,
and local regulations that govern all aspects of education. Specifically, the Federal No Child Left Behind Act
(2001) requires states to implement statewide accountability systems for public schools. In addition, Title 5
Education Code of the California Code of Regulations regulates the education system in California. The
California Department of Education also publishes standards for school facilities.
FEDERAL
No Child Left Behind Act
In 2001, Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB Act). This act, under direction of the U.S.
Department of Education, reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 with increased
accountability for states, school districts, and schools; provides flexibility for states and local educational agencies
in the use of Federal education dollars; and places emphasis on reading skills. The NCLB Act requires states to
implement statewide accountability systems covering all public schools and students. These systems must be
based on challenging state standards in reading and mathematics, annual testing for all students in grades 3–8, and
annual statewide progress objectives ensuring that all groups of students reach proficiency within 12 years.
Assessment results and state progress objectives must be broken out by poverty, race, ethnicity, disability, and
limited English proficiency to ensure that no group is left behind. School districts and schools that fail to make
adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward statewide proficiency goals will be subject to improvement, corrective
action, and restructuring measures. Schools that meet or exceed AYP objectives or close achievement gaps will be
eligible for State Academic Achievement Awards.
STATE
California Department of Education
The California Department of Education (CDE) oversees the state’s diverse and dynamic public school system
that is responsible for the education of more than seven million children and young adults in more than 9,000
schools. The CDE and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction are responsible for enforcing education law
and regulations; and for continuing to reform and improve public elementary school programs, secondary school
programs, adult education, some preschool programs, and child care programs.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
SERVICING SCHOOL DISTRICTS
Citrus Heights is mainly served by the San Juan Unified School District. Twin Rivers Unified School District
serves a small subdivision of approximately of approximately 71 homes located off Verner Avenue as well as
approximately 80 mobile home sites within the Imperial Manor Mobile Home Park near Auburn Boulevard and
Manzanita Avenue. Since Twin Rivers School District serves such a small portion of the city, only data from San
Juan Unified School District was included in this report. Figure 8-6 depicts the school district boundaries.
San Juan Unified School District
In 1862, Citrus Heights constructed its first permanent school, the Sylvan School. This one-room schoolhouse
was the educational, civic, social, and religious center of the small farming community. In 1913, the San Juan
High School District was formed when the residents of the Citrus Heights community decided to construct a new
high school. Previously, those wishing a secondary school education had to board out in Sacramento, or after
1912, attend classes at the newly organized Roseville High School, sited in an old hotel building. By the 1950’s,
the Sylvan Elementary School District maintained eight schools - Sylvan, Mariposa, Oak Avenue, Leighton
Littlejohn, Grand Oaks, Citrus Heights, Arlington Heights, and Skycrest – with 132 teachers and 3,975 students.
The San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD) was created through a consolidation of the two local school
districts in 1959 to cover a total of 75 square miles in Sacramento County. The SJUSD currently maintains
43 elementary school sites, nine middle school sites, and nine high school sites. Additionally, the district
maintains four special high schools, three special education centers, and three adult education facilities.
School Facilities and Enrollment
SJUSD elementary school enrollment figures for the 2009 school year included 20,423 students attending
43 elementary schools throughout the District. The SJUSD also enrolled 7,890 students in nine middle schools,
and 12,952 students in nine high schools. School enrollment figures have declined over the five years, as shown in
Table 8-8. The District’s projected decline in enrollment figures through 2016 has left San Juan Unified with
extra facility capacity and no new facilities are planned.
The SJUSD maintains an Open Enrollment policy to offer choice and to help equalize site capacities and
enrollment figures throughout the District. If a school in a particular neighborhood is at or over capacity, the
District may provide bussing to accommodate students at nearby schools not experiencing capacity restrictions.
Ten elementary school sites, one middle school, and two traditional high schools are located within the planning
area (Table 8-9 and Figure 8-7). In addition to the traditional high schools, SJUSD also operates El Sereno
Independent Study High School located on the campus of San Juan High School. SJUSD also maintains the
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report

Citrus Heights School Capacities
Throughout the entire SJUSD, enrollment is declining and only one of the public school facilities within Citrus
Heights (elementary, middle and high schools) is currently at 100% capacity. The average capacity level of the
10 elementary school facilities within the planning area is approximately 88 percent, enrolling an average of
526 students per school. Two elementary schools within the planning area were recently converted to K–8
schools, therefore the sole middle school is under capacity (66%), and the two high schools are far below
capacity. Table 8-10 summarizes the enrollment and capacity figures for SJUSD schools within Citrus Heights.
Cambridge Heights Elementary School is one of six alternative schools in the SJUSD. Students from throughout
the District may enroll at Cambridge Heights Elementary.

School Closures and Reconfigurations
Over the past five years the SJUSD has closed and consolidated school campuses and programs in response to
declining enrollments. Since 2004, 10 school sites have closed. Most of the school sites have been reused to house
additional District programs and five sites have been leased to charter schools. Within Citrus Heights, one
elementary school was closed. In 2004, Sunrise Elementary closed and reopened as the Sunrise Tech Center
which houses Adult education, Regional Occupational Programs, and Early Childhood Education programs.
Currently the District expects to close and consolidate other schools outside of Citrus Heights.
SJUSD currently offers three configurations for sixth grade: K-6 schools, K-8 schools, and 6-8 middle schools.
With the wide variety of options, sixth grade classes at some schools are negatively affected as enrollments
decline and State budget deficits continue to drain school resources. Currently the SJUSD is in the process of
analyzing school configurations to help preserve school resources. The following Citrus Heights Elementary
Schools are expected to be reconfigured (Table 8-11):

Private and Parochial Schools
For the 2007–2008 school year, 18 private schools operated within Citrus Heights, offering grades ranging from
pre-kindergarten to 12th grade. As shown in Table 8-12, enrollment at these schools ranged from less than ten
students to over 500, depending on grades offered and school type. Education was provided in both religious and
non-religious settings.

Citrus Heights is supplied with potable water by three separate water purveyors. The service area boundaries of
the Citrus Heights Water District, California American Water Company, and Sacramento Suburban Water District
are shown in Figure 8-7.
WATER SUPPLY REGULATORY SETTING
FEDERAL
Clean Water Act
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established primary drinking water standards in the Clean Water Act
(CWA) Section 304 and states are required to ensure that potable water for the public meets these standards.
Standards for 81 individual constituents have been established under the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended in
1986. The U.S. EPA may add additional constituents in the future.

California Water Code Section 10610 (et seq.)
California Water Code Section 10610 (et seq.) requires that all public water systems providing water for
municipal purposes to more than 3,000 customers, or supplying more than 3,000 AFA, must prepare an Urban
Water Management Plan (UWMP). The Department of Water Resources provides guidance to urban water
suppliers in the preparation and implementation of UWMPs. UWMPs must be updated at least every five years on
or before December 31, in years ending in five and zero.
Senate Bill 610 and Assembly Bill 901
Senate Bill (SB) 610 and Assembly Bill (AB) 901 – Water Supply Planning were signed and became effective
January 1, 2002. SB 610 amends Public Resources Code section 21151.9, requiring any EIR, negative declaration,
or mitigated negative declaration for a qualifying project to include consultation with affected water supply
agencies. SB 610 also amends the following: Water Code 10656 and 10657 to restrict state funding for agencies
that fail to submit their urban water management plan to the Department of Water Resources; and Water Code
section 10910 to describe the water supply assessment that must be undertaken for projects referred under Public
Resource Code Section 21151.9, including an analysis of groundwater supplies. Water agencies are given 90 days
from the start of consultation in which to provide a water supply assessment to the CEQA lead agency; Water
Code section 10910 would also specify the circumstances under which a project for which a water supply
assessment was once prepared would be required to obtain another assessment. AB 910 amends Water Code
section 10631, expanding the contents of the UWMPs to include further information on future water supply
projects and programs and groundwater supplies.

Senate Bill 221
SB 221 adds Government Code section 66455.3, requiring that the local water agency be sent a copy of any
proposed residential subdivision of more than 500 dwelling units within 5 days of the subdivision application
being accepted as complete for processing by the city or county. It adds Government Code section 66473.7,
establishing detailed requirements for establishing whether a “sufficient water supply” exists to support any
proposed residential subdivisions of more than 500 dwellings, including any such subdivision involving a
development agreement. When approving a qualifying subdivision tentative map, the city or county must include
a condition requiring a sufficient water supply to be available. Proof of availability must be requested of and
provided by the applicable public water system. If there is no public water system, the city or county must
undertake the analysis described in section 66473.7.
REGIONAL/LOCAL
Water Forum
Initiated in 1993, the Water Forum process brought together a diverse group of stakeholders that included
business and agricultural leaders, citizens’ groups, environmentalists, water managers, and local governments to
evaluate available water resources and the future water needs of the Sacramento metropolitan area. These
stakeholders identified two coequal objectives to guide the development of the Water Forum Agreement (WFA):
►    Provide a reliable and safe water supply for the region’s economic health and planned development through
     the year 2030.
►    Preserve the fishery, wildlife, recreational, and aesthetic values of the lower American River.
After a 6-year consensus-based stakeholder process, the WFA was completed. The WFA prescribes a regional
conjunctive-use water program for the lower American River and the connected groundwater basin. The Water
Forum also completed an EIR for the Water Forum Proposal. This document was certified by the two lead
agencies (the City of Sacramento and the County) in December 1999. At the time that the City and County of
Sacramento adopted the project and they and other stakeholders adopted their purveyor specific agreements
(PSAs), the name was changed to the WFA because it was an agreed-to proposal by all stakeholders.
The WFA includes PSAs that define the benefits each water purveyor will receive as a stakeholder and the actions
each must take to receive these benefits. PSAs for the Sacramento County Water Agency (SCWA), the City of
Sacramento, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) also describe commitments by these entities to
address issues related to wheeling and wholesaling of surface water, Central Valley Project (CVP) water transfers,
and dry-year water supply in SCWA Zone 40.
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report

The Water Forum process initiated a coordinated effort for regional water supply planning within the Sacramento
region. Because of limited water supplies, the sensitive ecological values of the lower American River, and
existing groundwater contamination within the Sacramento groundwater basins, purveyors and stakeholders came
together and agreed to resolve longstanding conflicts through an interest-based negotiation process that led to
formulation of the seven elements of the WFA and individual PSAs for each purveyor. In addition, all signatories
to the WFA became members of the Water Forum successor effort, which is responsible for overseeing,
monitoring, and reporting on the implementation of the WFA.
The WFA is a long-term water supply plan that addresses water supplies and demands to 2030 for existing (as of
January 2000) purveyors and agencies. The WFA did not address water supplies beyond 2030 and did not account
for newly incorporated cities (Elk Grove and Rancho Cordova). Rather, the WFA analysis was based on existing
land use plans that were available at the time it was prepared (i.e., the County of Sacramento General Plan [1994]
and other relevant agency general plans). Since the WFA was adopted in 2000, the cities of Elk Grove and
Rancho Cordova have incorporated and pursued development and implementation of long-term land use plans.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
CITRUS HEIGHTS WATER DISTRICT
The Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD) was formed on October 25, 1920, and is one of the oldest public
agencies in the City. The CHWD encompasses the eastern two-thirds of the City as illustrated in Figure 8-8.
CHWD’s service population is approximately 66,000. The estimated distribution of water in the CHWD includes
71 percent to single-family residential
consumers and 9 percent to commercial
and business users. Unaccounted-for
water, which constitutes an estimated
5 percent of water use, is that amount
which is not metered resulting from leaks,
meter inaccuracies, fire protection, system
flushing, and some construction uses,
while all other uses include public
facilities and institutional users.

CHWD is currently at 85–90 percent of projected build-out. CHWD build-out, as estimated by the Sacramento
City-County Office of Metropolitan Water Planning (CCOMWP), will be in 2024, supporting a population of
70,148 residents and 28,034 dwelling units. The projected CHWD build-out average annual water demand
without additional conservation is 18,744 acre-feet, or an average of 239 gallons per person per day (gpcpd). With
anticipated water conservation savings, projected normal year water demand at build-out is 17,800 acre-feet (227
gpcpd).
Water Supply and Distribution
The CHWD is one of five water distribution agencies in the northeast region of Sacramento County and south
Placer County that are supplied surface water by the San Juan Water District (SJWD). Overall, the CHWD has
been supplied by SJWD with between 17,000 to 20,500 acre-feet of surface water annually between 1998 and
2008. This comprises approximately 35 percent of SJWD’s surface water delivery. The SJWD supplies the
distribution districts with surface water from Folsom Lake, after processing it through the SJWD Peterson Water
Treatment Plant (WTP) facility in Granite Bay. The surface water supplied by SJWD is delivered through gravity
flow from the Peterson WTP to CHWD. Because CHWD is planning for groundwater production facilities to help
meet various combined-use, water shortage, emergency and peak demand projections, the need for additional
surface water supplies beyond what has been historically provided by SJWD should not be required. Typically, as
pressure decreases in the distribution pipeline system during peak demand conditions, CHWD wells are
automatically started.
The CHWD is participatory to a Joint Powers Agreement with the cities of Citrus Heights, Folsom, and
Sacramento, and Sacramento County, which grants them the authority to regulate groundwater. The Sacramento
Groundwater Authority (SGA), governed by a Board of Directors made up of an appointed member of each water
agency, has the ability to levy assessments. During drought years, water supply demands will need to be met by a
combination of both surface water and ground water supplies. SGA is attempting to formalize combined-use
agreements between surface and ground water users and suppliers. The District is also a participant in the
Sacramento Area Water Forum and the Regional Water Authority (RWA).
The CHWD maintains five active wells used for peak demand, water shortages and emergency supplies. Table 8-
13 lists the District’s active wells. Four active groundwater wells are located within the planning area, with a fifth
just south of the city limits. The CHWD groundwater system provides total well capacity of 6,750 gallons per
minute (gpm). The firm capacity of the groundwater well system (i.e., with the largest producing well [#15] off-
line) is 4,750 gpm.

However, emergency water needs (in the case that CHWD’s surface water supply was interrupted) are higher than
existing pumping facilities can provide. The CHWD Water System Master Plan states that to supply the CHWD
solely with ground water during water shortages and emergency demands, seven new wells would be needed,
with an average well capacity of 1,000 gpm. The CHWD Capital Improvement Plan anticipates construction of
these seven new wells over the next 20 years.
Until 1997, the CHWD’s primary water transmission pipeline was a 42”/30” Transmission Main from the SJWD
that was installed in 1958. In 1993, the CHWD teamed with the SJWD, Fair Oaks Water District, Orange Vale
Water Company, and Northridge Water District (now Sacramento Suburban Water District) to construct a 78”/72”
Cooperative Transmission Pipeline (CTP). This new transmission line, completed in 1997, creates redundancy
within the water distribution system in the CHWD, and provides peak flow relief to the District’s 42”
Transmission Main.
The CHWD is supplied surface water from SJWD through a gravity flow transmission system. This system
provides relatively high pressure throughout the District through approximately 255 miles of distribution
pipelines. One reduced pressure zone has been developed in Citrus Heights and one reduced pressure zone has
been developed outside of Citrus Heights. Based on static pressure available from SJWD’s Hinkle Reservoir,
pressure in the District varies between 60 pounds per square inch (psi) and 110 psi.
Water Conservation
In addition to pre-1914 water rights held by SJWD, the CHWD uses United States Bureau of Reclamation
(USBR) water through a contract with the SJWD. The CHWD is therefore required to fully implement a Best
Management Practices (BMPs) conservation plan for urban water use. The CHWD Water System Master Plan
calculated that normal water demand at build-out would total 23,092 acre-feet per year. By utilizing the water
conservation programs included within the BMPs, CHWD could save an estimated 5.1 percent conservation
                                                                                         General Plan Background Report

savings (944 acre-feet per year) for a total build-out demand of 17,800 acre-feet per year. A majority of the
estimated conservation would be attained through system leak reduction, installation of Ultra Low Flow toilets
and showers, and landscape requirements for single-family homes.
Many of the BMP programs (i.e., system audits, metering with commodity rates and conservation pricing) assume
a fully metered system. By the end of 2007, all District accounts (19,541 total / 16,325 in the City) were
retrofitted with water meters and billed based upon metered rates as of January 1, 2008.
Capital Improvement Program
A major component of the CHWD’s Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for 2010 through 2018 entails replacing old
pipelines in the transmission and distribution system. Leaks and maintenance problems with old tar-dipped and
asphalt-wrapped steel pipelines, installed in the 1940s and 1950s, make them a primary target for replacement.
The CIP also plans for the replacement of fire hydrants to improve fire suppression flows. Installation of three of
the seven planned new ground water wells are anticipated to occur during the 2010-2018 CIP planning period.
CALIFORNIA AMERICAN WATER COMPANY
In 2001 the California American Water Company (CAW) acquired the Citizens Utilities Company of California
(CUCC) and its assets, which include a number of small disjointed service areas throughout the Sacramento
region. The overall service area consists of approximately 7.1 square miles. Citrus Heights is located within the
Lincoln Oaks Service Area (LOSA), which consists primarily of groundwater wells and small distribution mains.
The Lincoln Oaks Water Company first purchased water system properties in northeastern Sacramento County in
1957. A water supply permit was granted to the
Lincoln Oaks Water Company in October of
1961 to supply domestic water to the
community of Citrus Heights, and in June of
1965, the Lincoln Oaks Water Company
merged with CUCC which was subsequently
acquired by CAW. Figure 8-9 shows the
CAW’s Lincoln Oaks Service Area boundaries
and well sites in relation to the city limits.

Total water production in 2005 was 32.8 million gallons per day (mgd), or approximately 37,000 acre-feet. The
total annual demand averaged 9.21 mgd for the last 10 years. The highest maximum month demand from 2001
through 2006 is 17.05 mgd. The maximum day production is estimated at approximately 20.46 mgd.
Unaccounted-for water (i.e., water use resulting from unauthorized connections and leaks, meter inaccuracies, fire
protection and training, system and street flushing, and construction uses) is assumed to be 10 percent of water
use in the LOSA. In 2006, approximately 14,200 customers were estimated in the LOSA, with an average
residential daily demand of approximately 8.34 mgd to 10.07 mgd. The 2006 residential water use was estimated
to be approximately 97.6 percent of total water use.
Water Supply and Distribution
CAW obtains all of its water supply from groundwater wells distributed throughout the service area. The Lincoln
Oaks water system utilizes a total of 26 groundwater wells, 17 of which are in Citrus Heights, as illustrated in
Figure 8-9. Three of the LOSA well sites are currently off-line due to suspected organic contaminants, although
they meet existing drinking water standards. During the wet season, three wells can provide 85 percent of the
water demand, but during the high demand periods in the summer, all of the LOSA’s available wellheads are
used.
The wells in the LOSA have an average capacity of 900 gpm, and range in depth from 235 to 510 feet. Standing
groundwater depth is 139 to 200 feet. Table 8-14 describes capacities of the 23 well sites in the LOSA. The
CAW’s water supply sources should be adequate to deliver maximum day demand, which was 9.51 mgd during
the summer of 2001. However, groundwater levels are continuing to decline in the Sacramento region, and are of
concern to future provision of water services. Three of the Company’s wells drilled in 1955 may have to be
retired in the next few years due to water levels dropping below well pumps.
CAW maintains a gravity distribution system, using booster pumps at each wellhead. Small distribution pipelines
(6” to 8”) carry water to LOSA customers. This distribution system should be able to deliver the required fire
flow plus maximum day demand, which was 9.51 in the summer of 2001. In 2006, a total of 14,200 water
connections were identified for the Lincoln Oaks Service Area. The LOSA contained 1,841 metered connections,
while the remaining 12,359 water connections were flat rate connections.
The Lincoln Oaks system consists of one pressure zone, with pressures typically ranging from 40 to 70 psi.
However, Interstate 80 and the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks serve to separate the distribution system into
several relatively isolated subareas. The distribution system has three pipelines which cross under Interstate 80,
and one pipeline that crosses under the railroad right-of-way. CAW is currently preparing plans to construct a
large booster station just outside of the Citrus Heights to improve water pressure.

The 2006 Lincoln Oaks System Comprehensive Planning Study states that the CAW should attempt to secure an
imported surface water supply of approximately 2,500 acre-feet per year to accommodate future build-out
demand. The Lincoln Oaks system has several interconnections with neighboring water purveyors, for emergency
and fire flow demands. The CAW may also consider constructing additional storage facilities in the LOSA to
meet future peak hour and fire flow demands. The capacity of the groundwater well system is summarized in
Table 8-14.

Water Conservation
As part of regional efforts to conserve water, CAW participates in the Regional Water Authority Water Efficiency
Program and is signatory on both the WFA and the California Urban Water Conservation Council’s (CUWCC)
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The comprehensive WFA allows the region to meet its needs in a
balanced way through implementation of seven elements. These elements include detailed understandings among
stakeholder organizations on how this region will deal with key issues such as groundwater management, water
diversions, dry year water supplies, water conservation, and protection of the Lower American River.
Capital Improvement Program
Lincoln Oaks does not have enough water supply to meet peak hour demands in the event of a loss of one of the
main groundwater wells. The 2006 Lincoln Oaks System Comprehensive Plan CIP recommends that two 1.5-
million-gallon storage reservoirs be constructed in the LOSA.
It must also be noted that many of the Lincoln Oaks wells are over 40 years old. The CIP recommends that a
certain number of wells be inspected and rehabilitated per year, with wellhead treatment as necessary, focusing
first on the oldest wells which have shallow pump settings based on groundwater levels. Some of the distribution
pipelines that deliver water to LOSA customers from the wellheads are also over 40 years old and in need of
replacement.
The CAW CIP also seeks to address long-term system needs. Projects are identified as either Priority A or B.
Priority A designates high priority projects recommended for construction due to projected near term supply,
treatment, storage, pumping, and associated transmission reinforcements. Priority B projects are recommended to
enhance fire flow capacity and to provide other various improvements, and serve as a place holder for potential
future projects based upon actual system growth. Priority A projects are estimated at $12,070,000 and Priority B
projects are estimated at $5,769,000.
SACRAMENTO SUBURBAN WATER DISTRICT
In February 2002, the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) was formed as a result of a consolidation
between the former Arcade Water District (AWD) and Northridge Water District (NWD). All water service in the
Citrus Heights which was provided by the former NWD is now being served by the SSWD.
The SSWD serves a population of approximately 160,000 and a service area of approximately 36 square miles in
Sacramento County. Within the SSWD are four service areas: the North Service Area (NSA), the Arbors at
Antelope, McClellan Business Park, and the South Service Area (SSA). Water supply for the District comes from
active groundwater wells and surface water from Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) and the City of
Sacramento. The SSWD’s water system facilities and the service areas are shown on Figure 8-10.

Total water production for SSWD in 2008 was 38,498 acre-feet, which consisted of 23,516 acre-feet (61 percent)
of groundwater and 14,982 acre-feet (39 percent) of surface water. The SSWD had 43,998 customer connections
in 2007, including 37,276 single-family connections (85 percent). Half of the District’s customers are not
currently metered. The SSWD anticipates completing its metering program by 2025, the California state-
mandated deadline.
Unaccounted for water use is unmetered water use such as for fire protection and training, system and street
flushing, sewer cleaning, construction, system leaks, meter inaccuracies, and unauthorized connections. Since
about half of the District’s customers are not metered, no data is available to determine the percentage of
unaccounted for water usage. For the purposes of the SSWD 2009 Water System Master Plan unauthorized water
use is assumed to be approximately 10 percent of total water production.
Water Supply and Distribution
The SSWD’s existing system is characterized as a groundwater supply and distribution system, and surface water
from PCWA via Folsom Reservoir and SJWD’s Peterson WTP and from the American River via the City of
Sacramento’s Fairbairn WTP.
The District owns 89 active well sites
throughout the region, three of which are
located in Citrus Heights. Pumping capacities
for SSWD’s wells range from 350–3,500 gpm.
Total well production capacity is 98,390 mgd.
Table 8-15 shows well capacity data for
SSWD’s well sites, while each well’s location is
identified in Figure 8-10. The three well sites
located in Citrus Heights are Verner #N36,
Field #N8, and Park Oaks #30, which combined

The District’s current surface water agreements are with PCWA, City of Sacramento, and the USBR (Section 215
CVP water). Surface water from PCWA and the USBR is diverted from Folsom Lake and treatment is provided
by the Sydney N. Peterson WTP. The Peterson WTP is owned and operated by SJWD. SJWD also supplies
treated surface water from Folsom Reservoir for a group of water entities (SJWD Retail Service Area, Orange
Vale Water Company, CHWD, City of Folsom-Ashland Area, and Fair Oaks Water District).
The Peterson WTP has a nominal capacity of 120 mgd. Treated water is pumped to the Hinkle Reservoir, which
has 62 million gallons (mg) of storage capacity. From the Hinkle Reservoir, the potable surface water supply for
the District is delivered by gravity flow through the San Juan Cooperative Transmission Pipeline (CTP) followed
by the Antelope Conveyance Pipeline (ACP) (formerly referred to as the Northridge Conveyance Pipeline).
The 48-inch diameter, gravity flow ACP is constructed from the terminus of the San Juan Cooperative
Transmission Pipeline at C-Bar-C Park on Oak Avenue. The District owns the total pipeline capacity of 59.2 mgd
in the ACP and that same quantity of flow in the larger capacity CTP.
The SSWD has a surface water supply from the American River through a contract with the City of Sacramento,
dating to 1964. Historically, only a portion of this amount has been diverted through the American River Well
Field located in the SSA. The American River Well Field is not currently being used because it does not meet the
requirements of the Surface Water Treatment Rule. In 2006, SSWD began receiving surface water from the City
of Sacramento. This water is treated at the City’s Fairbairn WTP and delivered to the SSWD via the City’s Howe
Avenue transmission main to an existing interconnection located near Enterprise Drive and Northrop Avenue in
the NSA.
The SSWD’s distribution system consists of 682± miles of pipeline. The distribution system ranges in size from
48-inch mains down to four-inch laterals. Pipeline material consists predominantly of asbestos cement, polyvinyl
chloride (PVC), ductile iron, mortar-lined coated steel, and cast iron pipe. SSWD standards include the
requirement for gridding cross connecting mains at intervals of approximately 1,300 feet with a minimum size of
12 inches. Exceptions have been made where 10-inch mains and larger exist in the grid pattern.
In addition to the groundwater aquifer, SSWD has four active storage tanks in the NSA. A five million gallon
storage tank and booster pumping station, located at the Antelope reservoir site, stores both groundwater from
nearby wells and treated water from the Peterson WTP to meet peak hour demands and fire flows. The maximum
pumping capacity from the Antelope reservoir is approximately 10,000 gpm. Another five million gallon capacity
groundwater storage reservoir and 10,000 gpm booster pump station is located near the intersection of Watt
Avenue and Elkhorn Boulevard in North Highlands. There is a 150,000 gallon elevated storage tank located in the
Arbors at Antelope area, and a 125,000 gallon elevated storage tank located at the District’s Walnut Corporation
Yard. There are two active elevated storage tanks in the McClellan Business Park. The SSA has one active

storage tank which was recently constructed in 2006. It is a five million gallon storage tank and booster pumping
station located at Enterprise Drive and Northrop Avenue.
Water Conservation
The SSWD has begun implementing the CUWCC water conservation BMPs. SSWD began implementing water
conservation BMPs based on the WFA, and is moving towards implementing the CUWCC water conservation
BMPs as part of their Water Forum renegotiations.
In the SSWD 2006 Water Conservation Master Plan, Phase 1 of the technical analysis was performed on the
CUWCC water conservation BMPs (Brown and Caldwell, 2006). The WCMP is a technical analysis of
quantifiable urban water conservation BMPs for six large purveyors in t he Sacramento region. The purpose of the
technical analysis was to accurately define the benefits (water savings) and costs of the quantifiable BMPs.
Quantifiable BMPs are those for which water savings estimates are available. These include water surveys,
plumbing retrofits, metering, large landscape water audits, high-efficiency washing machines, and toilet rebates.
Non-quantifiable BMPs are those for which water savings cannot be accurately estimated (i.e., public education
and outreach). Although the Plan estimates water savings due to metering at 20 percent, it is assumed for this
study that unmetered customers would reduce water use by 10 percent due to metering.
Water efficiencies gained from the natural replacement of water using fixtures will reduce unit water use in
addition to the continued implementation of the BMPs. The projected demands in the District include reduced
water use due to natural replacement of toilets, shower fixtures, and washing machines installed in single-family
and multi-family housing units as well as commercial establishments. Natural replacement does not include
water-efficient fixtures installed in new construction, or fixtures that are replaced under a rebate program.
Decreased water use due to natural replacement was calculated in the Plan.
Capital Improvement Program
In March 2004, the SSWD Board adopted a 15-year CIP with a total of 30 projects and an estimated total cost of
$106.6 million. This 15-year CIP includes surface water conjunctive use projects, groundwater projects,
rehabilitation and/or replacement of existing distribution pipeline facilities, metering of unmetered service
connections to comply with the WFA, various analytical studies, and other projects.
An analysis of the SSWD’s capital needs for a 15-year period from 2010 through 2024 was prepared as part of the
Water System Master Plan. The Plan identifies a list of capital improvement projects for supply, storage,
distribution and special and potential capital needs, some of which include: additional water supply backup
power, well rehabilitation/pump station improvements, installation and replacement of removed terminal units,
telemetry and communication improvements, water quality/wellhead treatment, well replacement, installation of a
                                                                                           General Plan Background Report

8.7        WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT
WASTEWATER REGULATORY SETTING
FEDERAL AND STATE
Clean Water Act and State Water Resources Control Board
With regard to wastewater, the Federal CWA and regulations set forth by the California Department of Health
Services (DHS) and State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) are aimed primarily at discharges of effluent
to surface waters. Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 503, Title 23 California Code of
Regulations, and standards established by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board regulate the
disposal of biosolids generated by wastewater treatment plants. Under the CWA, the Regional Water Quality
Control Board administers programs related to wastewater treatment.
REGIONAL/LOCAL
Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District and Sacramento Area Sewer District
The Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (SRCSD) and the Sacramento Area Sewer District (SASD)
are both separate political subdivisions of the State of California formed under the State of California Health and
Safety Code. As such, these Districts’ policies must conform to the statutes of the State Health and Safety Code.
Additionally, the Districts are separately funded entities that do not depend upon Sacramento County for funding
capital improvements, maintenance, or operations. User fees provide for the systems’ operation and maintenance,
while hookup fees provide most of the funding for new trunks and interceptors. The SRCSD requires a regional
connection fee be paid to the District for any users connecting to or expanding sewer collection systems (SRCSD
Ordinance No. SRCSD-0043).
EXISTING CONDITIONS
SACRAMENTO REGIONAL COUNTY SANITATION AND SACRAMENTO AREA SEWER DISTRICTS
The SRCSD provides public wastewater conveyance, treatment, and disposal in the urbanized portions of
Sacramento County. SRCSD is a publicly owned wastewater agency serving over one million people in the major
Sacramento Metropolitan Area through its three contributing agencies: the City of Folsom; the City of
General Plan Background Report

Sacramento; and SASD, formerly known as the County Sanitation District 1 (CSD-1). Under the Master
Interagency Agreement (MIA) that defines the operational, financial, and administrative responsibilities of the
SRCSD, the County of Sacramento and the Contributing Agencies, SRCSD is responsible for the planning and
financing of any new sewer facilities.
Collection System
The main SASD collection system includes over 2,800 miles of sewer pipelines ranging in size from four to
75 inches in diameter. The collection system pipelines are categorized and based on size, function and hydraulic
capacity. In general, sewer collectors are pipes that receive flows from homes and businesses and are 10-inches or
smaller in diameter. In contrast, trunk sewers are pipes that function as conveyance facilities to transport the
collected wastewater flows to the SRCSD interceptor system and are 12-inches in diameter or larger. Interceptors
are a massive system of pipes (up to 10 feet in diameter) and pump stations, which carry wastewater directly to
the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (SRWTP). At times of peak use, the interceptor system
carries as much as 400 million gallons of wastewater per day. The existing SRCSD interceptor system consists of
the Cordova (COR) Interceptor, the Folsom Interceptor Trunks (FOI) and the Northeast Interceptor Trunks (NEI).
The SRWTP receives and treats an average of 165 million gallons per day (mgd) (as of 2005). The SRWTP has a
permitted dry weather flow design capacity of 181 mgd. Effluent discharges from the planning area are collected
and conveyed through the SASD trunk and SRCSD interceptors to the SRWTP and ultimately discharged into the
Sacramento River near the unincorporated town of Freeport.
The average dry weather flow (ADWF) is the basic measure of wastewater flows, made up of the sanitary flow
contributed by residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional users of the system and the extraneous
infiltration/inflow water that enters the system (i.e., groundwater infiltration and rainfall inflow). The peak dry
weather flow (PDWF) and the peak hour wet weather flow (PHWWF) are those highest wastewater flows
occurring during their respective weather seasons. The ADWF of wastewater to the treatment plant is 154 mgd,
with the PWWF reaching 312 mgd. The total projected ADWF at buildout within the Sewerage Service Area is
estimated to be 350 mgd. The total projected PHWWF for a two-year design storm is approximately 833 mgd.
Citrus Heights is located in the District’s Northeast System, as shown in Figure 8-11. The Northeast System is the
largest of the sewer trunk systems in the Sacramento Area Sewer District (SASD), totaling approximately 552,000
feet of pipeline ranging in size from 12” to 75” diameter sewers. The Mission Trunk Sewer extends north from
the Northeast Siphons along Mission Avenue to Arcade Creek. There are also two major branches of the Mission
Trunk Sewer, the first extending east from Whitney to Madison Avenue, and the second following Arcade Creek
to Antelope Road and then extending east to Oak Avenues. Many smaller trunk sewers in the Northeast System
follow alignments along creeks.

The SRCSD is responsible for financing new interceptor sewers, which are designed to carry 10 mgd of sanitary
sewage or more. SASD is responsible for construction of new trunk sewer facilities within its current boundaries
and unincorporated areas of the County that it could potentially annex (because of increased urbanization). Trunk
sewer facilities are those that carry between one mgd and 10 mgd of flow. Because both special districts serve
Citrus Heights, the City has one voting member on both the SRCSD and the Sacramento Area Sewer District
Board of Directors.
SRCSD and SASD have completed two portions of the Upper Northwest Interceptor (UNWI) project, increasing
capacity for future demands on the local wastewater collection system. The Upper Northwest Interceptor Section
9 (UNWI 9) and the Northeast Area (NEA) Relief Projects 1 and 2 are a joint effort between SRCSD and
Sacramento Area Sewer District. UNWI 9 consists of a new interceptor pipeline which runs along Auburn
Boulevard and Old Auburn Road, from approximately Van Maren Lane east to Fair Oaks Boulevard. NEA Relief
Project 1consist of a new trunk sewer pipeline along Oak Avenue between Fair Oaks Boulevard and Hazel
Avenue, and a section of pipeline along Fair Oaks Boulevard between Oak Avenue and Old Auburn Road. NEA
Relief Project 2 is a new section of pipeline which runs along Old Auburn Road between Fair Oaks Boulevard
and Robert Creek Court. Both UNWI 9 and NEA 2 are complete, and NEA is expected to be completed in late
summer 2010.
Wastewater Treatment Plant
The SRWTP provides wastewater treatment for the district, including Citrus Heights. Design capacity for
wastewater treatment at the SRWTP is currently at 196 mgd, with plans to expand the facility to accommodate
future growth. The current SRWTP facilities serve over one million residents within approximately a 368-square
mile area.
The SRWTP is a secondary treatment facility which conducts raw influent and effluent pumping, primary
clarification, secondary treatment with the high-purity oxygen activated sludge process, cryogenic oxygen
production, disinfection, dissolved air flotation sludge thickening, and anaerobic sludge digestion. Currently,
treated wastewater flows are dechlorinated and discharged into the Sacramento River, while digested sludge is
pumped to on-site solids storage basins (SSBs) and ultimately to on-site dedicated land disposal (DLD) facilities.
Table 8-16 below provides population-based flow projections through 2020. These figures were developed in
2008, for the SRWTP 2020 Master Plan. The SRWTP service area population grew from approximately 893,800
in 1985 to approximately 1,209,500 in 2000.

The SRWTP is currently undergoing planning efforts to install a water reclamation program to provide “gray”
water to agriculture and major landscaped areas. Once the program is fully developed and operational, the
SRWTP hopes that water districts within the region will deliver reclaimed water supplies to parks, schools, golf
courses, and cemeteries.
Capital Improvement Projects
SRCSD’s 2000 Interceptor System Master Plan CIP contains 52 projects required to convey wastewater flows
from existing and planned development to the SRWTP. The facilities are scheduled to be constructed by 2035,
and when operational, will provide capacity for all planned development within the Urban Services Boundary and
West Sacramento. The total capital cost of the master planned facilities is $962,910,000. This cost is in year 2000
dollars and does not include inflation or interest adjustments for any of the identified projects.
8.8        SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING
SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING REGULATORY SETTING
FEDERAL
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) was enacted in 1976 to address the enormous amount of
municipal and industrial solid waste generated nationwide. After several amendments, the Act as it is currently
written governs the management of solid and hazardous waste and underground storage tanks (USTs). RCRA is
an amendment to the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965. RCRA has been amended several times, most
significantly by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984.
RCRA is a combination of the first solid waste statutes and all subsequent amendments. RCRA authorizes the
Environmental Protection Agency to regulate waste management activities. RCRA authorizes states to develop

and enforce their own waste management programs, in lieu of the federal program, if a state’s waste management
program is substantially equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the federal program.
STATE
Integrated Waste Management Act
The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939) requires every city and county in the state to
prepare a Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SSRE) in or as part of its Solid Waste Management Plan that
identifies how each jurisdiction will meet the mandatory State waste diversion goals of 25 percent by 1995 and 50
percent by 2000. The purpose of the Act is to “reduce, recycle, and re-use solid waste generated in the state to the
maximum extent feasible.” The term “integrated waste management” refers to the use of a variety of waste
management practices to safely and effectively handle the municipal solid waste stream with the least adverse
effects on human health and the environment. The Act has established a waste management hierarchy, as follows:
source reduction, recycling, composting, transformation, and disposal.
REGIONAL/LOCAL
Source Reduction and Recycling Element
AB 939 mandates that all cities and counties prepare, adopt and submit planning documents to CalRecycle
(formerly the California Integrated Waste Management Board), which demonstrate how cities and counties will
meet the mandatory waste diversion goals of 25 percent by 1995 and 50 percent by 2000. The required planning
documents include a SSRE, a Household Hazardous Waste Element (HHWE) and a Non-disposal Facility
Element (NDFE) which is subject to CalRecycle approval.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING
The Sacramento County Waste Management and Recycling Division (SCWMRD) provides solid waste and
recycling collection and disposal services to all unincorporated areas in Sacramento County. The SCWMRD
provides residential services to the northern suburban portion of the County including source reduction, recycling,
transformation, and land disposal. The SCWMRD also staffs the Sacramento Regional Solid Waste Authority
(SWA), is a Joint Powers Authority, which consists of the City of Sacramento and the County of Sacramento and
formerly the City of Citrus Heights and regulates the commercial solid waste collection and recycling operations
in the City of Sacramento and the unincorporated areas of Sacramento County.
In 2008, the City separated from the SWA and now administers its own solid waste management system and
provides disposal and diversion data in an annual report to the CIWMB, in accordance with AB 939 requirements.
                                                                                          General Plan Background Report

Solid waste collection services in the City are generally provided by private haulers through either a contract or
franchise. The City currently contracts residential solid waste collection and recycling services to Allied Waste
Systems, a private waste disposal company. Residential waste collection and recycling services in the City have
been provided by Allied Waste Systems since January 1, 2006. As for commercial solid waste collection and
recycling services, eight commercial haulers are currently franchised to provide commercial solid waste collection
and recycling service in the City.
WASTE DIVERSION PROGRAMS
The landfill diversion mandates of AB 939 require all cities and counties in California divert 50 percent of the
total waste generated within the boundaries of the jurisdiction from landfill disposal on an annual basis beginning
in the year 2000. Solid waste may be diverted from landfill disposal through source reduction, recycling, or
composting.
Source Reduction
Source reduction is at the top of the waste management hierarchy as defined in AB 939. This is due to the fact that
the practice of source reduction is the most environmentally beneficial and cost effective method of reducing
disposal in landfills. The City’s objectives for source reduction within its boundaries include the following:
►    Achieve at least 1.6 percent of the 50 percent overall diversion goal from source reduction activities;
►    Reduce the use of non-recyclable materials
►    Reduce packaging products;
►    Achieve a minimum of two percent diversion through source reduction programs;
►    Encourage reuse and repair of materials;
►    Increase public awareness of waste reduction and re-use concepts; and
►    Encourage the use of products with recycled-content materials.
The targeted wastes for source materials are the following:
►    Yard wastes
►    Paper products
►    Food wastes
►    Office paper
►    Pallets
►    Film plastic

currently managed through grasscycling. The manicured parks encompass 181.36 acres within the City limits.
Several businesses have been identified that reduce paper generation through various practices. In addition there
are ten thrift stores within City limits, including Goodwill Industries, St. Vincent DePaul and Eco Thrift. These
facilities all accept or either distribute or sell various reusable items, including household goods, used clothing,
furniture and appliances.
The SCWMRD has intermittently operated a Backyard Compost Program since 1991 that provides education
materials and compost bins for residents. Because the City service area was part of unincorporated Sacramento
County, many residents have participated in the program and manage their waste through backyard composting.
Table 8-17 provides a summary of the City’s existing source reduction programs and the corresponding diversion
tonnages for 2006.

Recycling
Both the residential and commercial franchisees provide recycling services within Citrus Heights. In addition,
several buy-back centers and drop-off facilities are located either within or near the City that provide recycling
opportunities. The City’s recycling objectives include the following:
►    Achieve at least 27 percent of the 50 percent overall diversion goal from recycling activities;
►    Work with the residential collector to increase participation and material recycling achieved in the curbside
     recycling program;
►    Work with the commercial franchisees to achieve a diversion rate of approximately 30 percent;
►    Increase participation of commercial businesses and government agencies in recycling programs; and
                                                                                              General Plan Background Report

►    Work with local school districts to implement recycling opportunities at schools.
The targeted wastes for recycling are the following:
►    Cardboard                                               ►   Glass
►    Newsprint                                               ►   Plastics
►    Mixed paper                                             ►   Construction and demolition materials
►    California Redemption Value beverage containers
Government recycling activities consist of commingled material recycling at offices and construction and
demolition debris recycled or reused for City road projects. Commingled recycling material is collected and
processed by Allied Waste Services and document shredding is provided by a local company. In addition to the
targeted materials, the City also promotes local special collection events for materials such as e-waste. In 2008,
the City began requiring green waste recycling and reuse from City-contracted landscaping services for City
properties and right-of-ways. If the green waste is not mulched on-site, the landscapers bring the material to City
Hall’s green waste bin and Allied Waste Services collects the material.
The current residential recycling programs feature every-other-week collection of commingled recyclables and
green waste. In addition, Allied Waste Services operates a scheduled bulky-item pickup program and a used
motor oil and filter program. The contract with Allied Waste Services requires that they recycle a minimum of 40
percent of all residential waste collected from City residents.
Residents currently have the choice of a 32, 64, or 96-gallon cart for garbage collection and pay a monthly fee
based upon the size of the garbage cart selected. The primary objective of this program is to provide an economic
incentive for customers to reduce waste and take full advantage of the commingled recycling and green waste
collection programs.
In addition to the curbside recycling programs, one drop-off center and four buyback centers are located within
the City. In 2006, resident recycling programs diverted 8,249 tons of material from landfill disposal, accounting
for approximately 6.3 percent of total generation. Table 8-18 provides a summary of the existing government,
residential and commercial recycling programs and the corresponding diversion tonnages for 2006.
Composting
Both the residential collector and commercial franchisees provide organics collection and processing services.
The City’s objectives for composting include the following:
►    Achieve at least 3.2 percent of the 50 percent overall diversion goal from composting activities;

►    Work with local landscaping maintenance companies to identify opportunities for organics drop-off and
     recycling locations within or near the City limits;
►    Work with the commercial haulers to identify and implement additional organics collection and processing
     opportunities for the local business community;
►    Encourage the use of recovered organic materials and products in the public and private sectors; and
►    Encourage regional cooperation in order to bolster use of the proposed SWA GreenCycle Facility.
The targeted wastes for composting are the following:
►    Residential and commercial organics
►    Grass clippings and leaves
►    Holiday trees
In addition to every-other-week residential green waste collection services, residential customers are also
provided with an extra 90-gallon green waste container upon request and at no additional charge. Residents can
also participate in seasonal collection programs for holiday trees, which can either be collected at the curb or
delivered to several drop-off locations. Table 8-19 provides a summary of existing composting and biomass

Special Waste
Special wastes include materials that require special handling and management methods due to potential health
and environmental effects. The City’s objectives for handling and managing special waste include the following:
►    Achieve 18.5 percent diversion of the 50 percent overall diversion goal from special wastes;
General Plan Background Report

►   Work with the franchisees and construction industry to increase the recovery, reuse and recycling of inert
    materials and wood waste;
►   Encourage the promotion and use of local drop-off facilities that accept clean inert materials;
►   Work with local woodworking and lumber businesses to identify opportunities for the reuse and recycling of
    wood waste;
►   Consider the use of recycled asphalt road-base materials in new road construction projects sponsored by the
    City;
►   Promote recycling and recovery of grease and tallow from local restaurants.
The targeted special wastes include the following:
►   Rendering (grease and tallow)
►   Wood waste
►   Scrap metal
►   Concrete, asphalt, rubble, and other inert construction and demolition debris
►   Tires
►   White goods
The special wastes targeted by the City are primarily handled by the commercial franchisees and self-hauled by
commercial generators. Commercial franchisees reported that they use Sims Metal, Recycle America, Schnitzer,
and Elder Creek Recovery and Transfer Station to recycle metals.
The commercial franchisees and self-haulers from local construction and demolition projects also recover the
majority of inert materials generated within the City. The franchisees reported using a variety of facilities located
in Sacramento and Placer Counties. The majority of wood waste identified as recycled in 2006 originated form
construction and demolition projects.
Grease and tallow materials collected throughout the City are handled either through rendering companies or
back-hauled by the parent companies. Based on the results of the Citrus Heights 2006 Solid Waste Generation
Study, it appears that rendering companies are predominately used by Citrus Heights businesses. Most rendering
services are provided by companies based in the greater Sacramento region.
Table 8-20 provides a summary of special waste programs and the corresponding diversion tonnages for 2006.

DISPOSAL FACILITIES
No existing, active, or permitted solid waste landfills or transformation facilities are located within the planning
area. Beginning on January 1, 2006, all residential solid waste was tipped at the Elder Creek Transfer Station and
transferred to Forward Landfill in San Joaquin County. Commercial solid waste is disposed at a variety of
locations, including Kiefer Landfill, L&D Landfill, Forward Landfill, and Western Regional Sanitary Landfill.
According to the Citrus Heights 2006 Waste Generation Study, Citrus Heights’ waste as part of the SWA went to
18 landfills including Kiefer Landfill, L&D Landfill, Forward Landfill, Anderson Landfill, Potrero Hills Landfill,
and Lockwood Landfill. Of the materials sent to these facilities, 10,975 tons were used as alternative daily cover
(i.e., alternative materials such as processed green waste used to cover the landfill).

quality certification requirements for “any applicant applying for a federal license or permit to conduct any
activity including, but not limited to, the construction or operation of facilities, which may result in any discharge
into the navigable waters.” Section 404, Title 33, Section 1344 of the CWA in part authorizes the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers to:

National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Program (NPDES) was established under the CWA
to address municipal and industrial discharges to surface waters. This includes regulations for point-source
discharges (e.g., wastewater treatment plant effluent discharges) and non-point discharges associated with
stormwater. In general, NPDES permit provisions consist of discharge restrictions and limitations (including
numeric and narrative) intended to protect beneficial uses of the receiving water as well as maintenance of public
health and safety.
Phase 1 of the NPDES permitting program for municipal discharges of stormwater for urban areas where the
population exceeds 100,000, industrial activity stormwater discharges and general construction activity discharges
(disturbance of 5 acres or greater) was established in 1990. Phase 2 of NDPES (2003) addresses municipal
discharges of urban areas of less than 100,000 in population as well as for construction activities that disturb 1
acre or greater.

National Flood Insurance Program
Citrus Heights is a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), a Federal program administered
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Participants in the NFIP must satisfy certain mandated
floodplain management criteria. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 has adopted as a desired level of
protection, an expectation that developments should be protected from floodwater damage of the Intermediate
Regional Flood (IRF). The IRF is defined as a flood that has an average frequency of occurrence on the order of
once in 100 years, although such a flood may occur in any given year. The City is occasionally audited by the
California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to insure the proper implementation of FEMA floodplain
management regulations.
STATE
Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act
The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act governs the coordination and control of water quality in the state, and
includes provisions relating to non-point source pollution. The California Coastal Commission, pursuant to the
Coastal Act, specifies duties regarding the federally approved California Coastal Management Program. This law
required that the SWRCB, along with the California Coastal Commission, regional boards, and other appropriate
state agencies and advisory groups, prepare a detailed program to implement the state’s non-point source
management plan on or before February 1, 2001. The law also requires that the state board, in consultation with
the Commission and other agencies, submit copies of prescribed state and regional board reports containing
information related to non-point source pollution, on or before August 1 of each year.
State Water Resources Control Board
The SWRCB is responsible for the establishment and implementation of statewide water quality policy and
delegates some of this responsibility to the nine regional water quality control boards in the state. SWRCB has
established the state’s nondegradation policy as well as the State Implementation Policy of Toxics Standards for
Inland Surface Waters, Enclosed Bays and Estuaries.
REGIONAL/LOCAL
Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board
The Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Valley Region provides planning, monitoring, and
enforcement techniques for surface and groundwater quality. A basin plan provides more specific information for
specific waterways within the region, in terms of establishing monitoring techniques to control pollutant levels
within the waterways. The RWQCB also monitors storm water quality from construction activities through an
NPDES permitting process.

Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Plan
The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Plan covers all the drainage basin areas for the Sacramento
and San Joaquin rivers, extending approximately 400 miles from the California- Oregon border to the headwaters
of the San Joaquin River. This plan describes the beneficial uses to be protected in these waterways, water quality
objectives to protect those uses, and implementation measures to make sure those objectives are achieved.
Business Environmental Resource Center
The Business Environmental Resource Center (BERC) was established in 1993 as a one-stop, non-regulatory
Permit Assistance Center to help Sacramento County Businesses understand and comply with federal, state, and
local environmental regulations. BERC’s mission is promoting business success and enhancing environmental
quality by providing free technical resource center on behalf of local government.
Sacramento Stormwater Quality Partnership
Sacramento area public agencies, including the County of Sacramento and the Cities of Sacramento, Citrus
Heights, Elk Grove, Folsom, Galt, and Rancho Cordova, have joined together to form the Sacramento Stormwater
Quality Partnership (SSQP). The agencies work together to implement the conditions of the Sacramento
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System NPDES Stormwater Permit. In addition to implementation of the permit
requirements, the goals of the SSQP are to:
►    educate and inform the public about urban runoff pollution,
►    encourage public participation in community and clean-up events,
►    work with industries and businesses to encourage pollution prevention,
►    require construction activities to reduce erosion and pollution, and
►    require developing projects to include pollution controls that will continue to operate after construction is
     complete.
The SSQP coordinates and cost-shares various major elements of its activities, including monitoring, target
pollutant reduction, special studies, regional public outreach, and program evaluation. The partnership members
also coordinate and cost-share selected construction/new development and commercial/industrial activities. The
County and City of Sacramento generally conduct and manage the joint work and are reimbursed by the other
members according to a cost-share Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).

Sacramento County Environmental Management Department
Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Water Protection Division, currently performs
routine inspection services of businesses for all the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4) permittees in
the region. Each of the regional agencies – Citrus Heights, Elk Grove, Folsom, Galt, Sacramento City and
Sacramento County – has executed an agreement to enforce best management practices for clean water. All
licensed businesses are inspected under this program. The department also provides public outreach, brochures on
storm water best management practices for particular industries and reporting data for submission to the state. The
reporting data is transmitted to the State DWR as well as each permittee.
Sacramento County Department of Water Resources
Sacramento County Department of Water Resources provides a variety of services from Flood Protection and
Operations and Maintenance of the storm system to assistance in preparing and implementing water quality and
public outreach programs for Water Quality. Residents within the City pay a drainage tax to support these
operations. These contract services will be privatized beginning July 1, 2010.
Sacramento Regional Conservation Corps
The Sacramento Regional Conservation Corps provides crews to maintain flowage and clean trash and debris
within the creeks. From August to March, the crews perform hand clearing of invasive non-native plants and
berry bushes as well as remove a variety of debris and trash.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
AMERICAN RIVER WATERSHED
Citrus Heights is located in the western-most portion of the American River Watershed, which contains
approximately 2,100 square miles of the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. Rainwater runoff
flows out of the Sierra Nevada through numerous small creeks and the three higher forks of the American River,
as shown in Figure 6-11. The three forks flow into Folsom Lake just east of Sacramento County, then back out as
a single American River, which winds its way through the southern portion of the County before flowing into the
Sacramento River to the west.
The County’s American River Flood Control System (ARFCS) consists of the Folsom Dam, Nimbus Dam, an
auxiliary dam at Mormon Island, eight earth-filled dikes, and four miles of levees on the north bank of the
American River. The Folsom Dam is undergoing modifications, a two-fold project, to increase flood protection.
According to the Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Sacramento County 2030 General Plan,
Folsom Dam currently provides approximately 100-year flood protection. After construction to of an auxiliary
spillway that will allow greater releases out of the dam during the first parts of a storm, Folsom Dam will provide

200-year protection. Project completion for the auxiliary spillway is estimated in 2015. The second part of the
project will raise the existing dikes by 3.5 feet, which will increase the amount of flood storage available to route
the flood safely through the dam and downstream levee system. Raising the dikes will increase the protection
level from 200-year to 240-year, and is expected to be completed in 2016.
Although located within the American River Drainage Basin, the creeks within Citrus Heights feed into the
County’s Sacramento River Flood Control System (SRFCS). The SRFCS consists of the Fremont Weir,
Sacramento Weir, Yolo Bypass Channel, and levees along the Sacramento River, Lower American River,
Natomas East Main Drainage Channel, Arcade Creek, Natomas Cross Channel, and the Sacramento Bypass
Channels.
FEMA prepares maps for the NFIP which delineate all areas subject to inundation of more than one foot from a
100-year interval rainfall event. Please refer to Chapter 4, Natural Resources, for floodplain information and
maps.

9.1        INTRODUCTION
This report documents current (2009) land use conditions in the planning area. The information presented in this
report will be used to develop land use policies and objectives, and to define programs to implement General Plan
policies.
9.2        DISTRIBUTION OF EXISTING LAND USES
The residential land use pattern in Citrus Heights today reflects the City’s history as a medium sized suburban
community. The densest residential and commercial areas are centered on the various circulation corridors such as
Auburn Boulevard and Sunrise Boulevard, with lower residential development located at the northern and eastern
edges of the City. The lack of vacant land and open space throughout the city is indicative of the City’s current
state as an almost built out community.
Residential uses are located throughout Citrus Heights at varying development densities. The highest residential
densities exist adjacent to Sunrise Mall and near the southwest portion of the City along Auburn Boulevard. The
lowest residential densities are largely located along the northern boundary of the City and extend southward near
Mariposa Avenue.
Commercial uses in Citrus Heights influence the physical and economic environment of the City. The historic
development of commercial uses has focused on numerous commercial corridors. While most commercial uses
located along Sunrise Boulevard and Greenback Lane serve more of a regional market, commercial uses that
serve the local community are found in pockets throughout the City. Local commercial areas are primarily located
near residential neighborhoods and consist of low-scale stand-alone commercial business and centers. The
primary regional commercial uses are Sunrise Mall and Sunrise Marketplace. Table 9-1 provides acreages by land
use category for the existing General Plan within the planning area.
Figure 9-1 depicts the distribution of existing General Plan land uses within the city limits and Figure 9-2 depicts
the existing General Plan land uses, including areas outside the city limits as of December, 2009.

The primary difference between the two figures is that there is no land designated Industrial within the city limits.
The vast majority of the land (in either scenario) is designated residential (84 percent within the city limits). After
residential uses, General Commercial (10 percent) constitutes the next largest land use within the City.
Figure 9-3 presents a map showing the distribution of existing land uses within the City and the planning area.
CORRIDOR TRANSITION OVERLAY
Among the General Plan designations adopted with the original General Plan was the designation “Transition
Overlay”. This designation was intended to provide for limited or light commercial uses combined with
underlying residential uses on specific parcels located along major transportation corridors.
“Transition” properties were depicted on the land use map through the use of a dot on the selected property. The
focus of the properties that were designated as “Transitional” were residential properties that fronted along high
traffic corridors such as Antelope Road, Sunrise Boulevard, Greenback Lane, Old Auburn Road, as well as one
property on Sylvan Road.
General Plan Background Report
City of Citrus Heights                                    9-3                                                  Land Use

In 2008, the City amended the Corridor Transition Overlay to address concerns that were brought up as the City
began to implement the concept. Although numerous properties are designated to be within the Corridor
Transition Overlay, the Zoning Code is required to be amended for each property interested in applying the
overlay. As of December 2009, two property owners have amended the zoning map as required to implement the
overlay.
CURRENT ZONING CODE
The City Zoning Code serves as the primary implementation tool for the General Plan. Whereas the General Plan
is a policy document and sets forth direction for development decisions, the Zoning Code is a regulatory
document that establishes specific standards for the use and development of all properties in the City.
Comprehensively updated in 2006, and amended as needed over time, the Zoning Code regulates development
intensity using a variety of methods, such as setting limits on building setbacks and building heights.
The ordinance specifically outlines regulations for the use of signs and the provision of parking and also indicates
which land uses are permitted in the various zones. The City is divided into the zones shown upon the City’s
“Official Zoning Map” that correspond to General Plan land use designations.
GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING CODE CONSISTENCY
Section 65860 of the California Government Code requires that Zoning Codes be consistent with a city’s General
Plan. Specific plans and any other local plan must also be consistent with the General Plan. Specifically, the
various land uses authorized by the Zoning Code must be compatible with the objectives, policies, general land
uses, and programs in the General Plan. Table 9-2 shows how each of Citrus Heights’ zone districts is consistent
with corresponding General Plan designations. If the Zoning Code becomes inconsistent with the General Plan by
reason of amendment to the General Plan, the Zoning Code must be amended within a reasonable time so that it is
consistent with the amended General Plan (Government Code § 65860).
SPECIFIC PLANS AND SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS
A specific plan is a detailed plan for the development of a particular area. Specific plans are intended to provide
predetermined specifications of the types of uses to be permitted, development standards (e.g., setbacks, height
limits, landscape, architecture), and circulation and infrastructure improvements that are broadly defined by the
General Plan.

Specific plans are often used to ensure that multiple property owners and developers adhere to a single common
development plan, as well as to provide flexibility in development standards beyond those contained in the
Zoning Code as a means of achieving superior design. The City currently has two specific plans:
►    Stock Ranch Guide for Development
►    The Boulevard Plan – Reinventing the Auburn Boulevard Corridor
In addition to two Specific Plans, the City has 12 Special Planning Areas within the City. Two of the Special
Planning Areas correspond to the Specific Plans identified above. The intent of the Special Planning Area Zone
District is to provide for flexibility in the application of Zoning Code standards to proposed development under
limited and unique circumstances. The purpose is to allow consideration of innovation in site planning and other
aspects of project design and more effectively design responses to site features, uses on adjoining properties, and

environmental impacts than the Zoning Code standards would produce without adjustment. The Special Planning
Areas require consistency with the General Plan, including allowable density or intensity of a site.
9.3      REDEVELOPMENT
Redevelopment is a process created by the State of California to assist local governments in eliminating blight and
revitalizing designated “project areas.” Redevelopment provides communities the ability to obtain funding to
make infrastructure improvements, acquire property, and otherwise bring about desired development,
reconstruction, and rehabilitation. A portion of redevelopment funds must also be used to promote affordable
housing opportunities in the community (Redevelopment Agency Housing Funds).
Blight is a term used to describe a variety of physical and economic conditions, some of which may not fit the
public’s general perception of blight. Examples of physical blight include buildings that are deteriorating, aging,
or poorly maintained. Or, it could be buildings that are in good condition but need improvements to their design
and configuration to meet current business needs. Inadequate streets, sewers, and other infrastructure are other
examples of blight. Economic blight can be characterized by vacant buildings or land, high tenant turnover rates,
residential overcrowding, or the inability to attract or retain businesses in a particular area.
The Citrus Heights Redevelopment Agency (RDA) is a separate public agency from the City. In Citrus Heights,
as in most cities, the Redevelopment Agency’s board of directors is the City Council. As with any public agency,
the Redevelopment Agency holds noticed public meetings to discuss and determine policy and approve actions.
The City has one Redevelopment Project Area, as shown in Figure 9-4. Using RDA Funds, the Agency has
completed a number of successful projects, most notably, the Sylvan Corners Redevelopment Project with a cost
of approximately $37 Million (including $400,000 from RDA). The RDA has also used redevelopment funds to
partially fund the following projects:
►    24-Hour Fitness Redevelopment at Auburn Boulevard and Van Maren Lane
►    Created the Commercial Improvements and Marketing Program to assist small businesses in marketing and
     redevelopment.
►    Assisted the Small Business Administration with utility undergrounding
►    Assisted with undergrounding of utilities at Sylvan Corners for private development
►    Provided $3-million to purchase right of way for public improvements along Auburn Boulevard.
►    Purchased 12 multi-family apartments (4-plex buildings) along Sayonara Drive for redevelopment of low
     income housing.
