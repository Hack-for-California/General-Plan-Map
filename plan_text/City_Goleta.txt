General Plan Law Requirements [GP]
The Land Use Element is one of seven                 Land Use Element Policies
elements mandated by state planning law,             LU 1:   Land Use Plan Map and General Policies
at Section 65302 of the California                   LU 2:   Residential Land Uses
Government Code. The Land Use Element                LU 3:   Commercial Land Uses

land use categories. This element defines
Goleta’s planned long-range development pattern and physical character, as well as the extent
and distribution of future growth in the city. Other elements of the plan further address the
relationships between future development and environmental quality, safety hazards, and social
and economic concerns.
Coastal Act Requirements [CP]
The California Coastal Act (Coastal Act), at Section 30250 of the Public Resources Code,
provides that new development shall be located within or contiguous to existing developed
areas in order to create a compact development pattern that avoids “leapfrogging” and achieves
efficient use of existing public facilities such as streets and utilities. An exception is provided for
hazardous industrial uses, which shall be located away from existing developed areas. Coastal-
dependent and visitor-serving uses, including open space and recreation, are given priority over
other types of uses at or near the Pacific shoreline. All development is required to accommodate
the public’s right of access to the sea and shoreline. All land uses and development must be
protective of coastal resources, including marine and land habitats, scenic and visual resources,
agricultural lands, and archaeological resources.
Existing Land Use Pattern: 2005 [GP/CP]
Goleta is a highly desirable place to live, work, or own a business because of the natural beauty
of its location along the Pacific coast, the sunny Mediterranean climate, the scenic backdrop of
the Santa Ynez Mountains, and the separation from but proximity to southern California’s
metropolitan areas. The city provides the many advantages of suburban living while enjoying
the benefits provided by the more urban parts of the south coast and the adjacent University of
California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Land use decisions in Goleta are shaped by the community’s
desire to preserve and protect its natural resources, its livable neighborhoods, existing land use
patterns, and quality of life. The nature and character of existing development and the desire for

a continued strong local economy, as well as concerns regarding infrastructure capacity, all
influence planning for future land use.
The land use and development pattern
                                                          Distribution of Existing (2003) Land Uses
observed in Goleta today is the result of
transformation over the past 75 years of a
rural landscape of ranches and agricultural
lands into a prosperous suburban community.
The community continues to derive an
essential and valued character from the
remaining agricultural and rural lands that are
intermixed with its various neighborhoods.
The city’s neighborhoods are spread over the
relatively flat coastal terrace between the
foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains to the
north and the Pacific shoreline to the south on
both sides of U.S. Highway 101 (US-101), the
major traffic artery connecting Goleta with the      Source: Santa Barbara County Assessors Data, 2003
nearby city of Santa Barbara to the east and
westward through the Gaviota Coast to northern Santa Barbara County. For the most part,
individual neighborhoods were developed as relatively large subdivision tracts of modest single-
story ranch-style homes starting in the 1950s and continuing until the present day, with
interruptions in development due to water supply limitations. Many of the original homes have
been upgraded or expanded over time as housing values and prices have increased in the
south coast area. Multifamily housing is concentrated in several areas near the Hollister Avenue
corridor, from Goleta Old Town in the east to the Ellwood Beach–Matilda area in the west and
adjacent to the Calle Real commercial district north of US-101.
Office and light industrial construction
accelerated during the 1970s and 1980s,
focused generally between Hollister Avenue
and US-101 in a corridor extending from
Fairview Avenue to Storke Road. This corridor
includes most of the Goleta Valley’s largest
employers, with the notable exception of
UCSB, which is located in an adjacent
unincorporated area south of the city. Retail
and commercial services are focused in three
distinct areas of the city: the Goleta Valley’s
original commercial center, referred to as
Goleta Old Town (Old Town); the Calle
Real/Fairview Avenue shopping area; and the
recently developed regional commercial
                                                                        Goleta Old Town
center at Camino Real Marketplace in
western Goleta. The city’s only coastal resort, Bacara, was developed in the late 1990s at the
city’s western boundary. The last remnants in the city of the oil and gas industry, which was a
prominent part of the early industrial history of the Goleta Valley, exist at the Venoco Ellwood
Onshore Oil and Gas Processing Facility (EOF) and the nearby shoreline piers at State Lease
421 (S.L. 421) adjacent to the Sandpiper Golf Course. At the geographical center of Goleta lies
a noncontiguous portion of the territory of the City of Santa Barbara. These lands are owned by
the City of Santa Barbara and encompass the regional airport, with a passenger terminal for air

Avenue for nonairport uses.
2.2      GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND GOALS [GP/CP]
The policies of this element are designed to balance the various concerns and needs of the city
and its residents and will guide future change to fit the desired character of Goleta. The
following guiding principles and goals, which are not in order of priority, provide the foundation
for the land use plan. They incorporate many comments, ideas, and suggestions offered by
participants at numerous public workshop meetings. All policies set forth in subsequent sections
of this element have been established to be in conformity with the guiding principles and goals,
and future actions of the City following adoption of the plan are required to be consistent.
1. Ensure that the amounts, locations, and characteristics of new development are determined
     in a manner that will preserve sensitive habitats and other natural resources.
2. Preserve open space within the city that is accessible to residential neighborhoods as well
     as a greenbelt around the city’s northern, western, and southern boundaries.
3. Preserve agricultural lands to allow future potential for agricultural production, including a
     locally grown food supply, specialty agriculture, and floriculture.
4. Maintain economic prosperity with a sustainable economy that is not based on growth.
5. Manage the types, amounts, and timing of future growth based on maintenance of service
     levels and quality of life.
6. Maintain a balanced community, with an appropriate mix of residences, workplaces, and
     services.
7. Maintain an appropriate balance between job-generating development and housing supply.
8. Maintain a balance of housing types, densities, and sizes and ensure creation and
     maintenance of quality, livable residential environments.
9. Ensure that the locations, amounts, and timing of new development are consistent with
     resource and service constraints, including, but not limited to, transportation infrastructure,
     parks, water supply, sewer system capacity, and energy availability.
10. Ensure that all new development and changes to existing development are compatible with
     the character, scale, and design of the neighborhood.
11. Influence future land use changes in nearby areas outside Goleta to avoid, lessen, and/or
     mitigate impacts within the city.
2.3      COASTAL ACT POLICIES [CP]
The Coastal Act policies set forth below are adopted as policies of this plan for those areas of
Goleta within the California Coastal Zone. The numbers refer to sections of the Public
Resources Code. The plan maps show the location of the California Coastal Zone boundary.
30220         Coastal areas suited for water-oriented recreational activities that cannot readily be
              provided at inland water areas shall be protected for such uses.

30221         Oceanfront land suitable for recreational use shall be protected for recreational use
              and development unless present and foreseeable future demand for public or
              commercial recreational activities that could be accommodated on the property is
              already adequately provided for in the area.
30222         The use of private lands suitable for visitor-serving commercial recreational facilities
              designed to enhance public opportunities for coastal recreation shall have priority
              over private residential, general industrial, or general commercial development, but
              not over agriculture or coastal-dependent industry.
30223         Upland areas necessary to support coastal recreational uses shall be reserved for
              such uses, where feasible.
30250         (a) New residential, commercial, or industrial development, except as otherwise
                   provided in this division, shall be located within, contiguous with, or in close
                   proximity to, existing developed areas able to accommodate it or, where such
                   areas are not able to accommodate it, other areas with adequate public services
                   and where it will not have significant adverse effects, either individually or
                   cumulatively, on coastal resources. In addition, land divisions, other than leases
                   for agricultural uses, outside existing developed areas shall be permitted only
                   where 50 percent of the usable parcels in the area have been developed and the
                   created parcels would be no smaller than the average size of surrounding
                   parcels.
              (b) Where feasible, new hazardous industrial development shall be located away
                   from existing developed areas.
              (c) Visitor-serving facilities that cannot feasibly be located in existing developed
                   areas shall be located in existing isolated development or at selected points of
                   attraction for visitors.
30255         Coastal-dependent developments shall have priority over other developments on or
              near the shoreline. Except as provided elsewhere in this division, coastal-dependent
              developments shall not be sited in a wetland. When appropriate, coastal-related
              developments should be accommodated within reasonable proximity to the coastal-
              dependent uses they support.
2.4      CITY POLICIES
Policy LU 1: Land Use Plan Map and General Policies [GP/CP]
Objective: To maintain a land use pattern that provides continuity with the past and present use
and development of the city and locates the various uses in a manner that is consistent with the
fundamental goals and principles of the plan.
LU 1.1        Land Use Plan Map. [GP/CP] The Land Use Plan map in Figure 2-1 is hereby
              adopted. The Land Use Plan map establishes the future distribution, extent, and
              geographic locations of the various land uses within Goleta. The standards
              applicable to each of the various use categories and sites are set forth in Policies
              LU 2 through LU 9.

LU 1.2        Residential Character. [GP/CP] The Land Use Plan map shall ensure that Goleta’s
              land use pattern remains predominately residential and open, with the majority of
              nonresidential development concentrated along the primary transportation corridor—
              east and west along Hollister Avenue and US-101. The intent of the Land Use Plan
              is to protect and preserve residential neighborhoods by preventing intrusion of
              nonresidential uses that would be detrimental to the preservation of the existing
              character of the neighborhoods.
LU 1.3        Goleta Old Town. [GP] The City            Distribution of Planned Land Use by Use Category
              and the City of Goleta
              Redevelopment Agency shall
              continue to develop and
              implement programs to revitalize
              the Old Town area. When
              considering development
              proposals, lots designated for
              commercial or multifamily
              residential use that are less than
              6,000 square feet shall be
              encouraged to be combined with
              any adjacent small lots to provide
              adequate parking and circulation,         Source: City of Goleta 2006

              Existing developed office and
              industrial areas shall be preserved
              and protected to continue their role
              of providing employment
              opportunities for the community. A
              mix of industries and economic
              activities is encouraged in order to
              provide a wide range of
              employment opportunities and
              wage levels and to avoid over
              reliance on any one economic
              sector.                                   Sources: Population estimates for year 2000 are based on a

              an adequate physical buffer or separation as well as fencing and screening to help
              lessen the effects on adjacent residential development. Performance standards shall
              be applicable to discretionary approvals pertaining to alteration or expansion of
              existing industrial uses and development as well as to new industrial uses and
              development.
LU 1.6        Retail and Other Commercial Centers. [GP/CP] The priority for commercial uses,
              including large regional commercial centers, shall be for the types that will meet local
              needs and those that provide goods and services not now available in the city.
              Goleta’s retail areas shall be designed to serve as community focal points and shall
              include appropriate outdoor gathering places. Retail and other commercial centers
              shall provide high levels of maintenance and upkeep to assure their quality

              Approvals of all new development shall require adherence to high environmental
              standards and the preservation and protection of environmental resources, such as
              environmentally sensitive habitats, consistent with the standards set forth in the
              Conservation Element and the City’s Zoning Code.
LU 1.8        New Development and Neighborhood Compatibility. [GP/CP] Approvals of all
              new development shall require compatibility with the character of existing
              development in the immediate area, including size, bulk, scale, and height. New
              development shall not substantially impair or block important viewsheds and scenic
              vistas, as set forth in the Visual and Historical Resources Element.
LU 1.9        Quality Design in the Built Environment. [GP/CP] The City shall encourage
              quality site, architectural, and landscape design in all new development proposals.
              Development proposals shall include coordinated site planning, circulation, and
              design. Public and/or common open spaces with quality visual environments shall be
              included to create attractive community gathering areas with a sense of place and

Objective: To provide appropriate land areas for the residential needs of existing and future city
residents consistent with the existing character of the city’s neighborhoods.
LU 2.1        Residential Land Use Categories. [GP/CP] The residential land use categories,
              permitted uses, and recommended standards for density and building intensity are
              shown in Table 2-1. The recommended planned residential densities and building
              intensities in residential neighborhoods have been established to be consistent with
              the density, intensity, and scale of existing development in order to reinforce the
              character of well-established neighborhoods. (Amended by Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)

              forth in this plan. The recommended densities described in the policies for the
              residential use categories and in Table 2-1 are maximum permitted densities but are
              not guaranteed. Density of development allowed on any site shall reflect site
              constraints, including:
              a. Environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHA).

              a. The privacy of existing residential uses in the immediate area shall be protected
                   in the design of new or expanded structures.
              b. Solar access of residential uses shall be protected in the design of new or
                   expanded structures.
              c. Proposals for construction of new or expanded homes shall be required to have a
                   size, bulk, scale, and height that are compatible with the character of the
                   immediate existing neighborhood.
LU 2.4        Single-Family Residential Use
              Category (R-SF). [GP/CP] The
              intent of this use category is to
              identify and protect appropriately
              located land areas for family living
              in low-density residential
              environments. Existing developed
              areas with this designation were
              generally subdivided at four units
              per acre or less and are
              characterized by a suburban
              atmosphere. This designation may
              be applied to provide a transition
              from the more intensely developed
              areas of the city to rural open
                                                              Existing Single-Family Residential Use
              spaces. The designation is also
              appropriate for areas that are
              subject to hazards or environmental constraints that limit the suitability of such areas
              for higher intensity uses. This designation is intended to provide for development of
              one single-family residence per lot at densities ranging from one or fewer to five units
              per acre. Assuming an average household size of 2.0 to 3.0 persons, this use
              category will allow population densities between 2.0 and 15.0 persons per acre.
LU 2.5        Planned Residential (R-P).
              [GP/CP] The intent of the Planned
              Residential designation is to allow
              flexibility and encourage
              innovation and diversity in design
              of residential developments. This
              is accomplished by allowing a wide
              range of densities and housing
              types while requiring provision of a
              substantial amount of open space
              and other common amenities
              within new developments.
              Clustering of residential units is
              encouraged where appropriate to
              provide efficient use of space while        Existing Planned Residential Use at the Willow
              preserving natural, cultural, and                        Springs Development
              scenic resources of a site. Planned
              residential areas may also function
              as a transition between business uses and single-family residential neighborhoods.

              This designation permits single-family detached and attached dwellings, duplexes,
              apartments in multiunit structures, and accessory uses customarily associated with
              residences. This designation is intended to provide for development of residential
              units at densities ranging from 5.01 units per acre to 13.0 units per acre, with
              densities for individual parcels as shown on the map in Figure 2-1. Assuming an
              average household size of 2.0 to 3.0 persons, this use category will allow population
              densities between 10 persons per acre and 39 persons per acre.
LU 2.6        Medium-Density Residential (R-MD). [GP/CP] This use category permits multi-
              family housing and accessory uses customarily associated with residences. Develop-
              ment may also include attached and detached single-family dwellings and duplex
              structures. Medium-density areas may also function as a transition between business
              uses and single-family residential neighborhoods. This designation is intended to
              provide for development of residential units at densities of up to 20.0 units per acre.
              In order to achieve efficient use of a limited supply of land designated in this use
              category, the minimum density permitted shall be 15.0 units per acre, except where
              site-specific constraints are determined to limit development to fewer units. Central
              Hollister Housing Opportunity Sites as identified in Housing Element Subpolicy
              HE 11.6 shall provide for development of residential units at densities ranging from a
              minimum of 20 to a maximum of 25 units per acre in support of the achievement of
              affordable housing goals. Assuming an average household size of 2.0 to 3.0
              persons, the range of population densities allowed in this use category is between
              26.0 persons per acre and 60.0 persons per acre. (See related Policy LU 8 and
              Subpolicy HE 11.6) (Amended by Reso. 09-44, 8/18/10)
LU 2.7        High-Density Residential (R-HD). [GP] This category permits multifamily housing
              units and accessory uses customarily associated with residences. Such areas may
              also function as a transition between higher intensity business uses and medium-
              density multifamily housing and single-family residential neighborhoods. Housing for
              special needs populations may be approved at higher than the base density in this
              designation provided that the City finds that the impacts on traffic, public facilities and
              services, biological resources, air and water quality, visual resources, or other
              environmental resources would not be greater than the impacts associated with
              development at the base density. This designation is intended to provide for
              development of residential units at densities ranging from 20.01 units per acre to
              30.0 units per acre. In order to achieve efficient use of a limited supply of land
              designated in this use category, the minimum density permitted shall be 15.0 units
              per acre, except where site-specific constraints are determined to limit development
              to fewer units. Assuming an
              average household size of 2.0 to
              3.0 persons, this use category
              allows population densities
              between 40 persons per acre and
              90 persons per acre. (Amended by
              Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)
LU 2.8        Mobile Home Park (R-MHP).
              [GP/CP] This category shall permit
              planned mobile home parks where
              sites for placement of individual
              mobile home units may be
              unsubdivided and held in a
              common ownership or subdivided
                                                                   Existing Mobile Home Park
September 2006                                                                                          2-11
Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                                2.0 Land Use Element
              and sold as separate lots to individual mobile home unit owners. The intent is that
              mobile home park sites be planned as a whole, with an adequate internal vehicular
              and pedestrian circulation system, adequate common and individual parking,
              common open space and recreation facilities, and other common amenities. Mobile
              homes usually provide a more-affordable housing alternative, and this designation is
              intended to preserve and protect existing mobile home parks in the city. The Mobile
              Home Park designation is intended to provide for development of residential units at
              densities ranging up to a maximum of 15.0 units per acre. Assuming an average
              household size of 2.0 to 3.0 persons, this use category allows population densities
              between 30.0 persons per acre and 45.0 persons per acre.
Policy LU 3: Commercial Land Uses [GP/CP]
Objective: To provide lands in locations that are suitable, functional, attractive, and convenient
for an appropriate mix and scale of residential- and business-serving commercial uses,
including business and professional offices, retail trade, business services, and residential
mixed uses.
LU 3.1        Commercial Land Use Categories. [GP/CP] Table 2-2 shows the permitted uses
              and recommended standards for building intensity in each of the commercial land
              use designations. The commercial use categories are intended to provide
              appropriate locations for business uses that serve neighborhoods, the community,
              the region, and the traveling public while seeking to minimize traffic congestion,
              visual, and other impacts on surrounding residential areas. The intent of each use
              category is further described in the following sections. (Amended by Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)
LU 3.2        Regional Commercial (C-R).
              [GP] This category is intended to
              provide for a wide range of retail
              commercial uses, including, but not
              limited to, larger scale commercial
              uses that serve the community, the
              region, and the traveling public.
              These uses are typically land-
              extensive. The Regional
              Commercial use designation
              provides for commercial uses that
              require large sites or attract large
              volumes of activity, such as “large
              box” retail uses, restaurants, high-
              volume retail businesses, and
              professional, personal, and fin-             Regional Commercial at the Camino Real
                                                                         Marketplace
              ancial services. In order to limit
              regional traffic impacts, lands
              designated in this category shall be limited to existing locations of “large-box” uses
              as of 2005, shown on the Land Use Plan map in Figure 2-1, and no additional areas
              shall be designated.
LU 3.3        Community Commercial (C-C). [GP] The Community Commercial category is
              intended to allow relatively small commercial centers that provide convenience goods
              and services to serve the everyday needs of the surrounding residential neighborhoods

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                               2.0 Land Use Element
              while protecting the residential character of the area. Uses that may attract significant
              traffic volumes from outside the Goleta Valley are discouraged. Mixed-use, including
              residential, development at densities up to 12 units per acre may be permitted
              subject to approval of a conditional use permit in appropriate locations provided that
              it is compatible with adjacent uses, does not break up the continuity of commercial
              use at the sidewalk level, or is not within the airport approach zone as designated in
              the Safety Element. All community commercial development shall be designed to
              facilitate and promote pedestrian circulation in and to the area, as well as to link
              these areas to other activity centers. Noise levels and hours of operation may be
              regulated to avoid any potential conflict with adjacent residential uses. The size of
              any mixed-use developments shall be consistent with street and utility capacities.
              The Fairview Shopping Center and Calle Real Center are included in this
              designation.
LU 3.4        Old Town Commercial (C-OT). [GP] This designation is intended to permit a wide
              range of local- and community-serving retail and office uses. A major purpose is to
              enhance the physical and economic environment for existing businesses and uses of
              the Old Town commercial district, the historic center for the Goleta Valley situated
              along Hollister Avenue between Fairview Avenue and State Route 217 (SR-217).
              The following criteria and standards shall apply to lands designated Old Town
              Commercial:
              a. Management of this area shall emphasize improving and reinforcing the
                   character of the area as a pedestrian-oriented retail business area with a mix of
                   businesses and services.
              b. “Large box” uses shall not be permitted within this use designation.
              c. Visitor-serving commercial
                   uses, including transient
                   lodging, may be permitted by
                   conditional use permit.
              d. Existing heavy commercial
                   uses (including printing and
                   auto services and repair) are
                   permitted uses although
                   significant expansion of these
                   activities shall be allowed only
                   by conditional use permit if the
                   expansion is compatible with
                   adjacent uses.
              e. Allowed uses include retail
                   uses; professional and                             Old Town Commercial
                   business office uses; public
                   uses, including governmental administration activities; restaurants;
                   entertainment; cultural activities; personal, financial, and small business services;
                   and various other public and quasi-public uses. See Table 2-2 for a complete
                   listing of permitted uses.

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                               2.0 Land Use Element
              f.   Any new development in the Old Town Commercial category shall include
                   buildings, pedestrian plazas, design amenities, and facilities that are consistent
                   with the Goleta Old Town Heritage District architecture and design guidelines.
              g. Continuity of retail and office uses is required at the street or sidewalk level.
                   Residential and office uses may be allowed on the second floor of a structure or
                   behind the portion of a building adjacent to the street, subject to approval of a
                   conditional use permit.
              h. Residential uses may be approved only in conjunction with a permitted principal
                   nonresidential use on the same site.
              i. New uses or design features (such as drive-through windows, excessive light
                   and glare) that are incompatible with residential uses or pedestrian-oriented retail
                   activities are prohibited.
LU 3.5        Intersection or Highway Commercial (C-I). [GP] This use category is intended to
              provide for a limited variety of commercial uses of low to moderate intensity located at
              major roadway intersections. Customers are anticipated to drive to these
              establishments. Uses are limited to various commercial and retail services oriented to
              the traveling public, including, but not limited to, gas stations, convenience markets,
              highway-oriented restaurants, and similar uses.
LU 3.6        Visitor Commercial (C-V). [GP/CP] This use category is intended to provide for a
              variety of commercial uses of low to moderate intensity often at or near scenic
              locations that may serve as destinations for visitors. Customers are anticipated to
              drive or be transported to these establishments by vehicles. Development in Visitor
              Commercial areas shall be designed in a manner that will limit encroachment into
              residential or resource areas. When located near the beach or other natural areas,
              public access to resource areas shall be required. Transient lodging units such as
              hotels that are operated as hotel condominiums, time-shares, or under a fractional
              ownership model shall be permitted uses, regulated through measures including but
              not limited to owner-occupancy limitations, to assure these accommodations are
              available without limitation to the general public and protect the City’s transient
              occupancy tax base. (Amended by Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)
LU 3.7        General Commercial (C-G). [GP] The purpose of this category is to provide
              appropriate sites to accommodate a diverse set of commercial uses that do not need
              highly visible locations, such as wholesale trade and service commercial, or that may
              involve activities that reduce compatibility with other uses. Appropriate sites are in
              locations that may have limited suitability for other more retail-oriented uses. General
              commercial uses may serve as a buffer between industrial activities or major
              transportation corridors and residential areas. The following criteria and standards
              apply to lands within this designation:
              a. The permitted uses in this classification have similar characteristics to some
                   industrial uses, and mixed-use developments that include residential uses,
                   except for assisted living residential uses, are not allowed.
              b. While General Commercial uses do not usually generate high volumes of traffic,
                   sites within this designation should be accessible from major arterials in order to
                   minimize the need for traffic to pass through residential areas on local streets.
              c. Uses that require access by heavy vehicles shall be permitted only in locations
                   where the street can support such heavy vehicle traffic and such uses would be
                   compatible with adjacent uses.
September 2006                                                                                          2-15

              d. Heavy commercial uses that may cause noise, air emissions, hazardous
                   materials, or excessive light and glare shall require approval of a conditional use
                   permit.
Policy LU 4: Office and Industrial Uses [GP/CP]
Objective: To provide lands in areas suitable for businesses that create diverse types of
employment opportunities and related economic activities where impacts of these uses on the
surrounding residential neighborhoods can be minimized and where traffic impacts can be
adequately managed.
LU 4.1        General Purpose. [GP/CP] Table 2-3 shows the various office and industrial land
              use designations, including permitted uses and recommended standards for building
              intensity for each category. The categories are intended to provide appropriate
              locations for a range of employment-creating economic activities, from those based
              on advanced technology to storage and warehousing, while seeking to minimize
              traffic congestion, visual, and other impacts on the surrounding residential areas.
              The intent of each office and industrial use category is further described in the
              following sections. (Amended by Reso. 09-32, 5/19/09)
LU 4.2        Business Park (I-BP). [GP/CP] This use designation is intended to identify lands for
              attractive, well-designed business parks that provide employment opportunities to the
              community and surrounding area. The intensity, design, and landscaping of
              development should be consistent with the character of existing development currently
              located in these areas. Uses in the Business Park designation may include a wide
              variety of research and development, light industrial, and office uses, as well as
              small-scale commercial uses that serve the needs of business park employees. In
              addition, lands designated with a Hotel Overlay may include transient lodging that
              emphasizes extended stays, as set forth in LU 1.12. Activities in business park areas
              shall be conducted primarily indoors, and outdoor storage, processing,
              manufacturing, and vehicle repair are prohibited.
              Performance standards for Business Park uses shall ensure that:
              a. The scale and design of these
                   uses are compatible with each
                   other and with the existing
                   character of the park and
                   surrounding neighborhoods.
              b. Lighting from these uses will
                   not interfere or conflict with
                   adjacent nonindustrial
                   properties.
              c. Signage will be controlled.
              d. Curb cuts will be minimized
                   and sharing of access
                   encouraged.

LU 4.3        Office and Institutional (I-OI).
              [GP] This designation is intended
              to provide areas for existing and
              future office-based uses. Uses
              allowed include moderate-density
              business and professional offices,
              medical and medical-related uses,
              hospitals, research and
              development, services oriented
              primarily to employees (such as
              day care centers, restaurants, per-
              sonal and professional services),
              and public and quasi-public uses.
              In addition, lands designated with
              a Hotel Overlay may include
                                                                           Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital
              transient lodging and related uses.
              Mixed-use developments with residential uses on the same site may be permitted at
              appropriate locations where the residential uses are compatible with adjacent uses
              and do not break up the continuity of office and institutional uses.
              The Office and Institutional use category includes lands intended to support the
              needs of the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital and related medical services. These
              lands, which are in the vicinity of Hollister Avenue and Patterson Avenue, are
              designated within a Hospital Overlay on the land use plan map (Figure 2-1). The
              following shall apply solely to lands within the Hospital Overlay:
              a. The recommended structure height set forth in Table 2-3 is increased from 35
                   feet to 55 feet for hospital buildings and to 45 feet for medical office buildings,
                   provided however that no building shall exceed 3 stories in height. The heights
                   of hospital and medical office buildings shall be the minimum height necessary to
                   comply with applicable state hospital construction standards and/or technical
                   requirements.
              b. The maximum recommended lot coverage ratio set forth in Table 2-3 is
                   increased from 0.4 to 0.6 for hospitals and to 0.5 for medical office buildings.

              managed environment than in the Business Park category. Allowed uses include
              warehouses, storage, outdoor storage (including storage of vehicles and recreational
              vehicles), automotive sales and rentals, manufacturing, heavy commercial uses, and
              similar uses that may be compatible with airport operations. The processing or storage
              of flammable or hazardous materials shall be strictly controlled. Near the airport,
              heights of structures and landscaping shall be limited so as not to interfere with the
              airspace in the airport approach zone and clear zone.
LU 4.5        General Industrial (I-G). [GP/CP] This designation is intended to provide land areas
              for a wide range of manufacturing uses, including those with potential noxious impacts,
              and for similar heavy commercial uses. Uses in these areas may occur in a less
              managed environment than in the Business Park designation. The processing or
              storage of hazardous materials shall be strictly controlled and subject to necessary
              permits in accordance with state and federal law. Uses appropriate in this land use
              designation include but are not limited to general manufacturing, assembly and
              fabrication, heavy commercial uses, high-technology manufacturing, research and
              development, wineries, breweries, building and construction services, and public

LU 4.6        South Kellogg Industrial Area. [GP] The following requirement shall apply to the
              South Kellogg Industrial Area, which consists of about 14 parcels generally located
              between Highway 101 and Armitos Avenue (including APNs 071-041-029; 071-041-

              090-047):
              a. Inventory of Existing Businesses. The number of businesses and types of uses
                   existing as of 2006 in the subject area is uncertain, as is whether all uses and
                   development have been properly authorized by permits. In association with the
                   owners of these parcels, the City shall require a precise inventory that includes
                   the following information for each separate business activity: (1) the name of the
                   business and its owner; (2) its location on the site; (3) a description of the type of
                   use; and (4) existing site improvements.
              b. Determination of Permit Status. The City shall review permit records and make a
                   determination as to uses and/or development that have been duly authorized by
                   the appropriate type of permits.
              c. Cessation of Unpermitted Uses. Uses determined to not have proper permit
                   authorization and which are not allowed by the zoning code shall be terminated.
              d. Permit Applications. Existing uses and development determined to not have
                   proper permit authorization but which are allowed by the zoning code shall be
                   required to submit the appropriate applications to the City.
              e. Mitigation of Adverse Impacts on the Adjacent Residential Area. Approvals of
                   any permits shall include conditions that require mitigation of adverse effects on
                   the adjacent residential area.
              f.   Time Frame. The City shall review the status of compliance after 3 years. If
                   substantial progress has not been demonstrated, the City may initiate more
                   intense code enforcement efforts and/or a General Plan amendment process to
                   consider redesignation of the subject area to “Planned Residential – 8 units/acre”
                   or other appropriate land use category.

              designation also allows quasi-
              public uses, such as private schools, religious institutions, lodges, social clubs, day
              care centers, and similar uses. Land within the rights-of-way for US-101 and SR-217
              are also designated within this use category. Public and quasi-public uses are also
              permitted in various other land use categories in order to provide maximum flexibility
              in determining locations for future public facilities. The Public and Quasi-Public use
              category does not include public and private parks, recreation, or open space, which
              are accommodated in a separate use category.
Policy LU 6: Park and Open Space Uses [GP/CP]
Objective: To provide land areas for public parks, recreation, and open space land uses and
private recreational lands within the city and recognize the importance of their contribution to the

              designated in the Agriculture land
              use category shall generally meet
              one or more of the following
              criteria:
              a. The site was zoned for
                   agriculture by the County of
                   Santa Barbara at the time of
                   incorporation of the City of
                   Goleta in 2002.
              b. The site is or has been used
                   for agricultural production
                   activities, and the site is devoid
                   of structural improvements that         Agriculture Uses at Fairview Gardens Farm
                   prevent or limit the continued
                   or resumed use of the land for agricultural purposes.
              c. The site has soils or other characteristics that make it suitable for production of
                   agricultural commodities to meet local food supply or other needs and is devoid
                   of structural improvements or other alterations that prevent or limit the use of the
                   land for agricultural purposes.
LU 7. 4       Permitted Uses. [GP] The Agriculture designation allows for a wide range of
              agricultural uses, including, but not limited to, grazing, raising of livestock and
              poultry, orchards, vineyards, growing of food and fiber crops, nurseries, and other
              forms of horticulture. Structures customary and incidental to agricultural activities are
              permitted, including one primary dwelling unit; farmworker housing, limited to
              workers employed on-site; barns; storage sheds; fences; and similar improvements.
              Except for these structures and appropriate utility and access improvements,
              activities or structures that impair the productivity of soils shall not be allowed. Retail
              sale of produce and products produced on the site, products produced by wineries
              and other small-scale processing facilities, and agricultural products grown off-site
              are allowed subject to approval of a conditional use permit.
Policy LU 8: Central Hollister Residential Development Area [GP]
Objective: To promote coordinated planning and development of designated medium-density
residential sites in the Central Hollister area in order to create a quality, livable environment with
appropriate design and amenities for future residents of this new residential neighborhood.
LU 8.1        Applicability. [GP] Twenty-four vacant parcels of land totaling 68.25 acres, situated
              largely within North Willow Springs and the Castilian Drive area, are designated for
              future medium-density residential development. This area lies between Hollister
              Avenue and the Union Pacific railroad tracks, extending from east of Los Carneros
              Way to Storke Road. These vacant lands, a portion of which is interspersed with
              existing Business Park development, collectively include a large portion of the
              residential development capacity defined by this plan. (Amended by Reso. 14-43, 7/15/14)
LU 8.2        Purpose. [GP] The intent for this area is to enable new residential development on
              the existing vacant parcels along with provision of incidental and subordinate small-

              scale commercial uses that will serve the needs of existing employees and future
              residents in the immediate area. The nonresidential development should be
              clustered at a single site or a small number of individual sites west of Los Carneros
              Way. A related intent is to enable transit-oriented development along the city’s
              primary transportation corridor so as to efficiently utilize existing infrastructure,
              reduce future increases in automobile travel, and support use of alternative, less-
              polluting modes of travel.
LU 8.3        Permitted Uses. [GP] The land area addressed by this policy shall be subject to a
              new Central Hollister Residential Overlay Zone, or district, that defines the scope,
              extent and character of neighborhood-serving nonresidential uses and development
              that may be permitted.
LU 8.4        Affordable Housing Development. [GP] The land area addressed by this policy,
              which was redesignated from nonresidential to residential use through adoption of
              this plan, is intended to accommodate a substantial portion of the future production
              of affordable housing units within the city. Properties designated 23 and 27 on Figure
              10A-2 of the Housing Element shall be subject to an Affordable Housing Overlay
              Zone. (Amended by Reso. 14-43, 7/15/14)
LU 8.5        Coordinated Development Plan and Quality Design. [GP] In considering
              proposed projects within the Central Hollister Residential Development Area,
              emphasis shall be given to coordinated planning and design for the mixed-use area
              as a whole, including the parcels designated for Business Park uses. This may be
              accomplished by the creation of specific plans.
              The provisions of specific plan and/or coordinated development projects shall:
              a. Ensure that the various uses are blended in a manner so that each use is
                   compatible with the others on an individual site, as well as uses on adjacent
                   sites.
              b. Ensure that any future residential development will not threaten the continued
                   viability of the existing Business Park uses.
              c. Require that design and location of internal roadways and circulation be
                   integrated with external circulation in a manner that improves overall safety and
                   traffic flow.
              d. Provide for appropriate internal street, bicycle, and pedestrian circulation
                   systems.
              e. Provide an adequate supply of parking within each development, with
                   consideration of shared (or joint) parking between uses where peak parking
                   demand is in the daytime and uses where peak demand is typically in the
                   evening hours.
              f.   Require that any future housing development create a living environment that is
                   attractive, with high-quality architectural and landscape design.
              g. Provide for a mix of unit sizes (number of bedrooms) in residential projects.
              h. Ensure that future development will include ample open space, recreational
                   facilities, and other amenities for employees and residents of the new housing.

              within this area shall ensure that:
              a. The scale and design of uses are compatible with each other and reinforce the
                   character and functions of other uses in the area and surrounding areas.
              b. The timing of new development will ensure a balance of housing and commercial
                   uses.
              c. Lighting, noise, odors, and air pollutant emissions from commercial and Business
                   Park uses will not interfere or conflict with residential uses.
              d. Signage will be controlled and limited to maintain an attractive living environment.
              e. Curb cuts for driveway access to individual properties will be minimized and
                   sharing of access encouraged.
              f. Efficient and attractive pedestrian and bicycle connectivity will be provided
                   between uses.

              d. Transient lodging units such as hotels that are operated as hotel condominiums,
                   time-shares, or under a fractional ownership model shall be a permitted use
                   regulated by mechanisms such as owner-occupancy limits, to ensure that these
                   accommodations are available to the general public.
              e. Approval of any proposal for transient lodging units such as hotels that are
                   operated as hotel condominiums, time-shares, or under a fractional ownership
                   model shall limit occupancy by owners of individual units to 30 or fewer
                   consecutive days for any single stay and no more than 90 total days in any
                   calendar year. All transient lodging units in above-mentioned forms of ownership
                   shall be made available for transient occupancy use by the general public
                   through the hotel reservation system at times when units are not occupied.
              f.   Any expansion or alteration of existing development shall be required to maintain
                   or expand the extent of existing coastal access facilities, including parking and
                   vertical access to the beach. “Maintain or expand” is clarified to include flexibility,
                   if at least one of the following is met:
                   1. To provide better protection of coastal resources;
                   2. To maximize public access; and/or
                   3. If natural processes impede existing access.
              g. Any expansion or alteration of existing development shall be required to protect
                   environmentally sensitive habitats and archaeological resources, including provision
                   of the buffers set forth in the Conservation Element. (Amended by Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)
LU 9.2        Site #2 – Coastal Recreation. [GP/CP] This parcel, occupied as of 2005 by the
              Venoco EOF, is designated in the Open Space/Active Recreation use category. The
              requirements applicable to this site are as follows (see Figure 2-2):
              a. The Recreation designation shall continue the nonconforming status of the
                   existing use. The use was nonconforming at the time of incorporation of the City
                   of Goleta. Its nonconforming status dates to the early 1990s when the property’s
                   zoning was changed by the County of Santa Barbara to the Recreation District as
                   part of a plan to consolidate onshore oil and gas processing at the Las Flores
                   Canyon site in the unincorporated area west of Goleta.
              b. The intent is that in the long-term use of the property for oil and gas processing
                   shall be terminated. The processing of hazardous materials and the risks
                   associated with air emissions make this location, which is adjacent to Bacara
                   Resort and Sandpiper Golf Course and near Ellwood School and the residential
                   neighborhoods of Santa Barbara Shores and Winchester Commons, unsuitable
                   for oil and gas processing in the long term.
              c. Until such time as the oil and gas processing use is terminated, any modifications
                   or alternations of the existing facilities shall be in accordance with the provisions
                   of LU 10.1 and shall be designed to improve air quality, reduce environmental
                   impacts and hazards, and improve safety for nearby lodging, recreational, and
                   residential uses.
              d. Upon termination of the oil and gas processing use, the priority use for the site
                   shall be coastal-dependent and coastal-related recreational uses that are
                   conducted primarily outdoors or limited to small-scale structures. Adequate on-
                   site parking shall be provided to serve all recreational uses (see related Policy
                   OS 2).
September 2006                                                                                              2-26

LU 9.3        Site #3 – Coastal Recreation
              Parcels. [GP/CP] These parcels,
              which were occupied by the
              Sandpiper Golf Course as of 2005,
              are designated in the Open
              Space/Active Recreation use
              category. The requirements
              applicable to this site are as
              follows (see Figure 2-2):
              a. The Sandpiper site shall
                   continue to be used for golf
                   course and other related
                   outdoor recreation purposes.
              b. The golf course shall be                   Coastal Recreation Parcels at Sandpiper Golf
                   maintained as a public course                              Course
                   and shall not be converted to a
                   members-only course.
              c. Any future project that requires a discretionary approval by the City shall be
                   subject to a condition that requires preference to be given to local residents in
                   terms of fees and tee times during appropriate time periods each week.
              d. The size and design of any new buildings and structures, or expansions and
                   alterations of existing buildings, shall be controlled so as to preserve the
                   character of the property as open land and minimize impacts on views of the
                   ocean and Channel Islands from Hollister Avenue and views of the Santa Ynez
                   Mountains from within the property and from beach and water areas.
              e. Any new development or alternation of the existing facilities and golf course shall
                   be required to maintain or expand the extent of existing coastal access facilities,
                   including parking and vertical access to the beach. Lateral bluff-top access may
                   also be considered and should connect with the bluff-top trail on Santa Barbara
                   Shores Park, with a transition down the bluff to the SL 421 access road. The
                   intent is to secure access easements, or offers to dedicate, that will provide for
                   lateral access during all seasons and tide conditions. Conceptual locations for
                   future coastal accessways are shown on Figure 3-1 in the Open Space Element
                   (see also OS 1.7).
              f.   Any commercial uses, including restaurants, shall be open to the general public.
              g. Views from Hollister Avenue to the ocean and islands shall be preserved.
                   Perimeter walls and landscaping that would obstruct or impair coastal views shall
                   not be permitted.
              h. Any rerouting or alteration of the golf course shall be designed in a manner that
                   protects and enhances environmental resources, including adjacent monarch
                   butterfly habitat areas, Devereux Creek, and other drainages, and that protects
                   safety on the beach.

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                              2.0 Land Use Element
              229 acres, is owned by the City. These lands are subject to deed restrictions that
              require the use of the property to be restricted in perpetuity to passive recreational
              activities and habitat protection. The criteria applicable to these parcels are as
              follows (see Figure 2-2):
              a. All future actions shall be consistent with the primary purposes of (1) preserving
                   and enhancing the properties’ sensitive habitats, including habitats for monarch
                   butterflies, various raptors, and western snowy plovers, as well as vernal pools,
                   riparian areas, native grasslands, coastal scrub, and other sensitive aquatic and
                   terrestrial habitats and (2) preserving or improving the past level of access and
                   use by the public.
              b. Any development of structures shall be limited to a public restroom facility to be
                   located at the public parking lot at Hollister Avenue.
              c. An extensive coastal access trail system shall be maintained, as shown in
                   Figure 3-2 of the Open Space Element. The trails shall include segments of the
                   California Coastal Trail and the Juan Bautista de Anza Historic Trail.
              d. Any trail improvements shall be designed to maintain the natural, low-impact
                   appearance of the existing informal trails; surfacing materials shall be limited to
                   compacted fines or native soil materials without binders. The widths of trails shall
                   be the minimum necessary to accommodate the planned types of users.
              e. A public coastal access parking lot, not to exceed 45 parking spaces, shall be
                   maintained at Santa Barbara Shores Park, with vehicular access from Hollister
                   Avenue.
              f.   Any ornamental landscaping shall be limited to native species that will maintain
                   the natural appearance of the area and that will not impair or obstruct scenic
                   views from Hollister Avenue to the coastal bluffs, Pacific Ocean, and Channel
                   Islands and preserve views from within the property to the Santa Ynez
                   Mountains.
              (See related Policy OS 5 and Figures 3-3 and 3-4.)
Policy LU 10: Energy-Related On- and Off-Shore Uses [GP/CP]
Objective: To promote the discontinuation of onshore processing and transport facilities for oil
and gas, the removal of unused or abandoned facilities, and the restoration of areas affected by
existing or former oil and gas facilities within the city.
LU 10.1       Oil and Gas Processing Facilities (Venoco Ellwood Onshore Oil and Gas
              Processing Facility). [GP/CP] As of 2005, the city had one existing oil and gas
              processing facility situated within its boundaries, the Venoco-owned EOF, which is a
              nonconforming use. The EOF and other oil and gas processing facilities generate
              emissions of air pollutants, pose safety hazards to nearby areas, create visual
              impacts, and create risks to marine and land resources associated with spills, leaks,
              or pipeline ruptures. The following standards shall apply to oil and gas processing
              facilities:
              a. The City supports County policies regarding consolidation of oil and gas
                   processing in the South Coast Consolidation Planning Area at Las Flores
September 2006                                                                                         2-28

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                                2.0 Land Use Element
                   Canyon in the unincorporated area west of Goleta. No new oil and gas
                   processing facilities shall be permitted within Goleta.
              b. The Venoco EOF site is an
                   inappropriate location for
                   processing of oil and gas
                   because of the public safety
                   and environmental hazards
                   associated with this type of use
                   and its close proximity to
                   residential neighborhoods,
                   Ellwood School, Bacara
                   Resort, and environmentally
                   sensitive habitat areas. The
                   site is designated in the Open
                   Space/Active Recreation use
                   category on the Land Use Plan
                   map and shall continue to be a
                                                               Venoco Ellwood Onshore Oil and Gas
                   nonconforming use.
                                                                       Processing Facility
              c. The EOF shall continue to be
                   subject to the rights and limitations applicable to nonconforming uses under
                   California law. No modifications or alterations of the facility or other actions shall
                   be authorized that would result in the expansion of the permitted throughput
                   capacity of the EOF. The existing maximum permitted capacity shall not be
                   exceeded, except for very minor increases that may be incidental to actions
                   designed to improve safety or reduce environmental impacts.
              d. Until the EOF use is terminated, the priority shall be to insure that the facility
                   strictly meets or exceeds all applicable environmental and safety standards.
LU 10.2       Decommissioning of the Venoco Ellwood Onshore Oil and Gas Processing
              Facility. [GP/CP] The following requirements shall apply to the cessation of
              operations and decommissioning of the facility:
              a. Within 12 months of cessation of operations, the existing owner/operator shall
                   submit an Abandonment Plan application for City review and approval. The
                   Abandonment Plan shall include a detailed description of all decommissioning
                   work and site restoration, including, but not limited to, remediation of soil and
                   groundwater contamination if required by the City or County Fire Department.
                   Removal of all oil and gas facilities and debris from the site shall be required,
                   except where such removal would result in greater adverse impacts than
                   abandonment in place. Disposition of all materials shall be at a properly licensed
                   disposal site and in compliance with any applicable requirements. The estimated
                   cost of the decommissioning work shall be deposited to an escrow account no
                   later than the time the Abandonment Plan is submitted to the City.
              b. An Abandonment Plan shall also be required as part of any request for
                   expansion of production levels for oil or gas. This Abandonment Plan shall be
                   subject to a requirement for the owner/operator to provide a sinking fund or other
                   financial instrument or surety that would pay for the full costs of
                   decommissioning, including any required soil or groundwater remediation.
September 2006                                                                                           2-29
Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                               2.0 Land Use Element
              c. The owner/operator shall commence the decommissioning activities within 2
                   years of the cessation of operations and shall complete removal of all oil and gas
                   facilities within 2 years following the start of the decommissioning project.
              d. Decommissioning shall include restoration of the EOF site to a natural condition
                   or to a condition that is suitable for the uses and development that are allowed
                   within the Open Space/Active Recreation use category designated for the
                   property. Restoration shall include recontouring the site, if appropriate, and
                   revegetation with suitable native plant material. The restoration plan shall be
                   prepared by the owner/operator and shall be subject to review and approval by
                   the City.
LU 10.3       Oil and Gas Transport and Storage Facilities. [GP/CP] Existing active oil and gas
              pipelines and storage facilities as of 2005 are associated with transporting oil and
              gas from Platform Holly and shoreline wells at S.L. 421 to the EOF and to Line 96,
              which transports oil from the EOF to the Ellwood Marine Terminal (EMT). Inactive
              and abandoned pipelines may exist at various locations within the city, particularly
              near the shoreline. The following shall apply to oil and gas transport and storage
              facilities within the city:
              a. New oil and gas pipelines and storage facilities, except for transmission and
                   distribution facilities of a Public Utility Commission (PUC) regulated utility, shall
                   not be approved within the city unless there is no feasible or less environmentally
                   damaging alternative location for a proposed pipeline. Existing facilities shall be
                   maintained and operated in a manner that assures safety, minimizes or avoids
                   risks of leakage or rupture, and that avoids impacts to visual and recreation and
                   scenic resources, including beaches. Alterations or replacement of existing
                   pipelines or segments of pipelines shall be limited to the minimum necessary to
                   ensure safety or prevent environmental damage.
              b. In the event that extended field development from Platform Holly is approved, the
                   City supports the processing of oil and gas production at the South Coast
                   Consolidation Planning Area at Las Flores Canyon. Any increase in throughput
                   above currently permitted levels shall require a General Plan amendment and
                   rezone of the EOF site to a use category and zoning district that allow oil and gas
                   processing.
              c. Unused, inactive, or abandoned pipelines as of 2005, including the remnants of
                   the Arco pipeline, shall be required to be decommissioned. An Abandonment
                   Plan application shall be required to be submitted for City review and approval.
                   Where such pipelines exist on property that is proposed for development or
                   redevelopment, the Abandonment Plan application shall be submitted concurrent
                   with the application for development of the property but shall be processed
                   separately.
              d. Existing pipelines that were actively used as of 2005 shall be decommissioned as
                   part of and concurrent with the decommissioning of the related oil and gas
                   facilities, such as the EOF, EMT, the S.L. 421 shoreline wells and piers, and
                   Platform Holly.
              e. When onshore and offshore oil and gas pipelines are decommissioned,
                   regardless of whether the pipeline was active or unused as of 2005, the pipeline
                   and all related debris shall be removed. Exceptions may be granted for segments

                   of onshore pipelines that are within city street rights-of-way or that traverse
                   environmentally sensitive habitat areas, provided that the applicable pipeline
                   segments are properly cleaned and treated prior to abandonment in place. Areas
                   of ground disturbance shall be restored to pre-project conditions, including
                   revegetation of the affected area. Where segments of pipelines that traverse
                   environmentally sensitive habitats, including, but not limited to, wetlands,
                   streams, or coastal dunes and beaches, are decommissioned and/or removed,
                   all affected habitat areas shall be restored consistent with the character of the
                   habitat.
              f.   The existing owner/operator of a pipeline to be decommissioned shall be
                   responsible for all costs related to the decommissioning. When a responsible
                   owner/operator of an inactive or abandoned pipeline cannot be found, any
                   successor in interest shall be the responsible party, including the owner of the
                   real property on which the pipeline is situated.
LU 10.4       State Lands Commission Lease 421. [GP/CP] Two idle wells, one for oil
              production and one for wastewater injection, and related piers exist as of 2005 in
              state tidelands at the Pacific shoreline below the Sandpiper Golf Course property.
              These are the last two remaining shoreline oil wells in the state. Production has been
              idled since 1994 when the former owner/operator stopped operations following a
              pipeline rupture and oil spill. The location of the wells within the tidal zone results in a
              risk of discharge of oil into the seawater in the event of failure of the wells or their
              components. S.L. 421 is served by several onshore facilities, including pipelines and
              an access road protected by a riprap seawall at the base of the bluff. The current
              owner, Venoco, has an interest in recommissioning production at the idled oil well.
              The following policy applies to S.L. 421 and the related onshore facilities:
              a. The City’s intent is that oil production not be recommenced at S.L. 421 because
                   of the environmental hazards posed by the resumption of oil production and
                   processing over coastal waters and the impacts to visual resources and
                   recreation at the beach. Unless it is determined that there is a vested right to
                   resume production at S.L. 421, the City supports termination of the lease by the
                   State Lands Commission (SLC) and/or a quitclaim of the lease by the
                   owner/operator.
              b. If resumption of production is
                   considered for approval, on-
                   pier processing of the oil at a
                   site within the tidal zone should
                   not be approved unless it is
                   demonstrated that there is no
                   feasible and less
                   environmentally damaging
                   alternative to processing on the
                   pier. The development of new
                   processing facilities over the
                   sea would result in an
                   increased and unacceptable
                   level of risk of environmental
                   damage.
                                                       Shoreline Wells at State Lands Commission Lease 421

              c. Decommissioning and proper abandonment of S.L. 421 facilities, including the
                   piers and riprap seawall, shall be required concurrent with decommissioning of
                   the EOF or immediately upon termination of S.L. 421. An Abandonment Plan
                   application shall be submitted by the owner/operator within 12 months following
                   an action to terminate the lease. The owner/operator shall commence the
                   decommissioning activities within 2 years of the action to terminate the lease. All
                   work to remove S.L. 421 facilities shall be completed within 3 years after starting
                   the decommissioning project.
              d. Decommissioning work shall include restoration of the site to its natural
                   preproject conditions. Restoration plans shall be subject to review and approval
                   by the City.
LU 10.5       Ellwood Marine Terminal. [GP] The onshore portion of the existing EMT is located
              just outside the city boundary on lands leased by Venoco from the University of
              California, Santa Barbara. The current lease expires in January 2016. The portion
              seaward of the mean high tide line is subject to a lease from the State Lands
              Commission and includes an undersea pipeline that extends to a mooring area for
              barges. The onshore component of the EMT is situated adjacent to the City-owned
              Ellwood Mesa Open Space Preserve. Oil is transported to the EMT from the EOF via
              the Line 96 pipeline.
              a. The City supports the termination of the lease between UCSB and Venoco at, or
                   prior to, the present expiration date in January of 2016.
              b. Upon cessation of use, the EMT should be properly decommissioned, including
                   removal of the onshore and offshore portions of the facility, except where such
                   removal would result in greater adverse impacts than abandonment in place, and
                   the site should be restored to a natural condition with appropriate revegetation.
              c. The City supports the cessation of transport of oil by barge or tanker. In the event
                   of new production at Platform Holly from extended-reach drilling of new wells, the
                   City supports the transport of the new oil and gas production by pipeline to the
                   Las Flores Canyon area for processing.
LU 10.6       Oil and Gas Production Areas. [GP] As of 2005, all oil and gas transported by or
              processed at facilities within the city was produced from wells in offshore lease
              areas. These include leases within state waters administered by SLC, specifically
              State Leases 421, 3120, and 3242. Leases beyond the 3-mile boundary of the state
              within the waters of the outer continental shelf (OCS) are administered by the U.S.
              Minerals Management Service (MMS).
              a. The City shall oppose any new leases in the western Santa Barbara Channel for
                   offshore oil and gas production within state waters and within the waters of the
                   outer continental shelf.
              b. The City shall oppose the construction of any new oil and gas production or
                   processing facilities in the waters offshore of Goleta.
              c. Upon cessation of production at Platform Holly, the City supports the timely
                   quitclaim of all associated leases, permanent discontinuation of all oil and gas
                   production, and inclusion of all former lease areas into the California Coastal
                   Sanctuary offshore of Goleta and the County of Santa Barbara.
September 2006                                                                                         2-32

              d. If oil and gas production from new offshore leases or facilities occurs, the new
                   production shall not be processed at the EOF. Any such production should be
                   transported by pipeline to the nearest consolidated processing facility as defined
                   by the County of Santa Barbara’s South Coast Consolidation Planning Area

Policy LU 11: Growth Management [GP]
Objective: To manage the timing of future growth based on maintenance of service levels and
quality of life. (Amended by Reso. 09-59, 11/17/09)
LU 11.1       Pacing of Growth. [GP] The City shall ensure that the timing of new development is
              consistent with resource and service constraints, including, but not limited to,
              transportation infrastructure, parks, water supply, sewer system capacity, and energy
              availability. (See also LU Guiding Principle and Goal #9; LU 1.13; TE 1.2; TE 13; TE
              14; PF Guiding Principles and Goals #6, 7 and 9; PF 4; PF 7.1; PF 7.2; HE 3)
              (Amended by Reso. 09-59, 11/17/09)
Policy LU 12: Land Use In Goleta’s Environs [GP]
Objectives: To identify possible areas for future service delivery and boundary expansion by
the City. To influence the amount and character of land use change and development in nearby
areas of the Goleta Valley that are not within the city but that may result in impacts inside the
city and provide guidance with respect to mitigation of those impacts.
LU 12.1       City of Goleta Planning Area. [GP] The City of Goleta Planning Area, shown on
              Figure 2-3, extends from the western sphere of influence (SOI) boundary of the City
              of Santa Barbara in the east to the westernmost boundary of the service area of the
              Goleta Water District at the El Capitan area to the west. The planning area is
              bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the south and Los Padres National Forest on the
              north. The planning area includes lands within Goleta; lands within the city of Santa
              Barbara, including the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport; lands within the UCSB
              campus subject to the jurisdiction of the University of California Board of Regents
              and the California Coastal Commission; and a wide array of lands in unincorporated
              Santa Barbara County, ranging from the densely developed community of Isla Vista
              to the scenic rural landscapes of the Gaviota Coast. The planning area also includes
              lands within the jurisdiction of a variety of special districts, including the Goleta Water
              District, the Goleta Sanitary District, the Goleta West Sanitary District, the
              Embarcadero Community Services District, the Isla Vista Recreation and Park
              District, the Santa Barbara County Fire Protection District, the Santa Barbara County
              Flood Control District, the Metropolitan Transit District, and others.
              In addition to the specific guidelines or criteria set forth in subsequent sections of this
              policy, the following general guidelines shall apply to lands within the planning area
              that are outside the city boundary:
              a. Land use changes and service delivery changes within the planning area shown
                   in Figure 2-3 are likely to have impacts on Goleta and on its residents and
                   businesses. Such changes could affect the ability of the City to fully or effectively
                   achieve the various objectives and purposes set forth in this plan. Consequently,
September 2006                                                                                            2-33

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                               2.0 Land Use Element
                   the City has a strong interest in reviewing and commenting on all proposals for
                   change in the Planning Area.
              b. The City encourages the various entities with jurisdiction over lands within the
                   Planning Area to refer all proposals for changes to the City for its review and
                   comments. The changes of interest to the City include, but are not limited to, the
                   following:
                   1. Proposals for development of buildings or other structures.
                   2. Proposals for subdivision of land, including lot line adjustments.
                   3. Proposals for changes in zoning, including the map of zoning districts and
                        text regulations applicable to the land.
                   4. Proposed new plans or amendments to existing plans, including community
                        or area plans, specific plans, the Long-Range Development Plan (LRDP) of
                        UCSB, the Santa Barbara Airport Master Plan, resource-related plans, and
                        other similar planning documents.
                   5. Master plans and similar planning documents for services and facilities of
                        special districts.
                   6. Proposals for annexation of lands.
                   7. Proposals for acquisition or disposition of real property.
                   8. Proposals to extend or modify services and/or infrastructure facilities.
              c. The City encourages that proposals related to the foregoing items be referred to
                   the City at the earliest possible time so that the City’s comments may have a role
                   in helping shape the proposal prior to its being considered for final action in
                   formal hearings or other proceedings.
              d. The City encourages that the Lead Agencies pursuant to the California
                   Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for projects situated within the Planning Area
                   include the City in their distributions of all CEQA notices for those projects,
                   including, but not limited to, notices of preparation and notices of public scoping
                   meetings.
              e. The City shall notify all agencies and governmental entities having jurisdiction
                   within the Planning Area of all City projects or actions that could potentially affect
                   the agency or entity. This shall include notifications regarding the items set forth
                   in section b. above and other notifications as may be requested by the agency or
                   entity.
              f.   Additional rural lands should not be annexed to the Goleta Water District, Goleta
                   Sanitary District, or the Goleta West Sanitary District.
              g. Creation of new private service systems for sewer and water in rural areas north
                   and west of Goleta shall be opposed.
LU 12.2       City of Goleta Service Boundary/Potential Sphere of Influence. [GP] Figure 2-4
              shows Goleta’s probable ultimate physical boundaries and service area, including
              boundaries for potential future additions to Goleta’s service area. The subject areas
              are likely to share an identity as part of the greater Goleta area and in some
              instances are portions of neighborhoods that are split by present (2006) city
              boundaries. The following guidelines shall apply to lands within these areas:
September 2006                                                                                          2-34

              a. Planned Land Uses. Figure 2-4 shows the land uses planned by the City within
                   the potential areas that may be added to Goleta’s service area. These land use
                   designations, which are described in Policies LU 2 through LU 7, indicate the
                   City’s intended land uses during the time that such lands remain under the land
                   use control of the County, as well as following any future boundary changes to
                   incorporate such lands within the City.
              b. Service Delivery. The City has determined that it has the ability to effectively and
                   efficiently provide municipal-type services to the land areas depicted on the map
                   in Figure 2-4. Further, the City is willing to extend its services to the subject
                   areas, provided that there is interest by area residents in having the City as a
                   primary service provider. In some instances, access to the subject areas is
                   exclusively by streets from within Goleta. In these and other instances, it is likely
                   to be more practical for the City of Goleta to provide services rather than other
                   governmental entities. Urban services (such as sewerage systems) should not be
                   extended outside the land areas that are designated for land uses and densities
                   that necessitate such services.
              c. Sphere of Influence. The City may prepare a request to the Santa Barbara
                   County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) for adoption (or
                   amendment) of a SOI for the City of Goleta that includes all or portions of the
                   lands identified in Figure 2-4. The environmental impact report prepared for this
                   plan has evaluated the potential impacts of the subject area being incorporated
                   into the SOI, including potential impacts of future land use and service changes.
              d. Future Boundary Changes. The City of Goleta places the highest importance on
                   self-determination by the voters and property owners within the areas identified in
                   Figure 2-4 as to the appropriate governmental organization for the areas. Since
                   some of the areas are “inhabited,” as defined in LAFCo law, any future boundary
                   change would require approval by a majority of the voters within a subject
                   territory. The City encourages property owners and residents within these areas
                   that may be interested in consideration of a boundary change to advise the City
                   at the appropriate time. The City will provide appropriate assistance to help
                   evaluate the merits of possible changes in governmental organization.
              e. Development Proposals. Following adoption of an SOI for Goleta, the City
                   encourages that any future proposals for urban-type development on lands within
                   the SOI boundary be evaluated to determine if such development should only be
                   considered following any appropriate change in governmental organization for
                   the subject area. These determinations should involve participation by all
                   affected parties, including the City, the County, the affected property owner(s),
                   and any affected residents.
LU 12.3       Santa Barbara Municipal Airport. [GP] Future changes at the Santa Barbara
              Municipal Airport, which is located on noncontiguous territory of the City of Santa
              Barbara situated at the center of Goleta, are of great interest and concern to the City
              of Goleta and Goleta’s residents. Any future changes at the airport should take into
              account the following:
              a. New facilities or changes to existing physical facilities, such as runways and
                   passenger terminals, should not be approved unless the impacts of the projects
                   on nearby areas within Goleta have been fully evaluated pursuant to CEQA, and
                   any residual impacts following implementation of mitigations are determined to
September 2006                                                                                            2-35

                   be minor or insignificant. Mitigation measures should be required that avoid or
                   reduce impacts to the maximum extent practicable.
              b. If noise impacts are anticipated to occur as a result of planned changes to airport
                   operations or facilities, appropriate noise mitigation measures shall be
                   considered, including adjustments of flight paths, authorized types of aircraft, and
                   hours of operation, as well as acoustical insulation of affected residential units.
              c. The Santa Barbara Municipal
                   Airport is situated on lands that
                   were historically a portion of
                   the Goleta Slough and its
                   associated streams and
                   wetlands. Any new facilities or
                   changes to existing physical
                   facilities should avoid or
                   minimize further fill or
                   contamination of these
                   sensitive coastal wetlands. Fill
                   or alteration of existing
                   wetlands or streams should be
                   considered only in
                   circumstances where there is
                   no feasible alternative and
                   should be the minimum
                                                         Aerial Photograph of the Santa Barbara Municipal
                   necessary to accomplish the                                Airport
                   essential purpose.
              d. The new passenger terminal project, and other future changes, should be
                   designed to provide sufficient on-site parking for all airport users so that no
                   parking impacts would occur on streets or parcels of land within Goleta
                   neighborhoods. The passenger terminal project should incorporate design
                   features to promote use of buses, vanpools, and other alternative forms of
                   transportation by air passengers to reduce or avoid parking impacts and traffic
                   impact on Goleta’s streets and neighborhoods.
              e. A Mitigation Agreement between the City of Santa Barbara and the City of Goleta
                   should be developed and adopted to provide for monetary contributions by the
                   City of Santa Barbara for its “fair share” of the costs of any road improvements
                   within Goleta needed to serve planned future airport projects. The agreement
                   should also address mitigation of other types of impacts by airport projects that
                   would occur within Goleta’s territory.
              f.   Proposed changes in tenants or uses on airport property should be evaluated for
                   impacts.
              g. Appropriate mechanisms should be created in airport governance to provide for
                   participation by representatives appointed or selected by the City of Goleta.
LU 12.4       City of Santa Barbara Lands North of Hollister Avenue. [GP] The following
              criteria should apply to future uses and development on lands owned by the City of
              Santa Barbara north of Hollister Avenue:
September 2006                                                                                            2-36

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                                  2.0 Land Use Element
              a. Goleta encourages the City of Santa Barbara to consult with the City of Goleta
                   when it considers development proposals on these lands.
              b. Development should be limited to uses that do not have high traffic-generation
                   rates. Retail uses in general have very high traffic-generation rates.
              c. Provisions for mitigation of traffic impacts of development on these lands on
                   streets and intersections within Goleta should be encompassed with the
                   Mitigation Agreement identified in LU 12.3.
              d. Development of uses that will adversely affect revitalization efforts by the City of
                   Goleta Redevelopment Agency in the Goleta Old Town Project Area should be
                   avoided. Uses that would likely adversely affect Old Town revitalization include
                   retail stores of all types, including, but not limited to, discount stores, “big box”
                   retail, convenience retail, restaurants, and specialty retail. The City of Goleta
                   supports uses such as an active park, recreational facilities oriented toward
                   teens, and cultural or performance facilities.
              e. Development should be compatible with existing and planned uses on adjacent
                   parcels within Goleta.
              f.   Projects should be designed to minimize the appearance of bulk and size. Very
                   large individual buildings should be avoided, and the mass of structures should
                   be moderated by variations in roof and wall planes.
              g. An adequate quantity of parking spaces should be provided on-site.
              h. Development should incorporate facilities to serve pedestrians and transit riders.
              i.   Any outdoor service and storage areas should be screened by fencing and
                   appropriate landscape plantings.
LU 12.5       Future Growth of the University of California, Santa Barbara. [GP] Due to its
              size and location adjacent to Goleta, actions by UCSB affect the City and its
              neighborhoods, residents, and businesses. Access to UCSB from outside the
              campus and the community of Isla Vista occurs exclusively via streets and highways
              that pass through Goleta. An ongoing mechanism or procedure to provide for
              consultation between UCSB and Goleta should be established for the purpose of
              identifying and addressing issues of mutual interest or concern. The following
              concerns should be considered when future developments and/or revisions of the
              university’s LRDP are proposed:
              a. Any future revisions to increase the cap on enrollment at UCSB and/or
                   development associated with increases in faculty and staff should be consistent
                   with the available and planned capacity of infrastructure that will be affected,
                   including Goleta’s streets and highways. Off-campus street and highway
                   improvements needed to accommodate new development, including
                   improvements within Goleta, should be provided concurrent with the construction
                   of individual projects.
              b. A Mitigation Agreement between UCSB and the City should be developed and
                   adopted to provide for monetary contributions by UCSB for its fair share of the
                   costs of road improvements needed to serve planned future university projects.
                   The agreement should also address mitigation of other types of impacts that
                   would occur within Goleta.
September 2006                                                                                             2-37

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                               2.0 Land Use Element
              c. Sufficient parking should be provided for university uses and facilities on campus
                   so that parking impacts do not spill over into nearby community areas within
                   Goleta.
              d. Any north- or west-campus projects adjacent to or near existing residential
                   neighborhoods within Goleta should be designed to be similar in scale, height,
                   and character to the existing neighborhood. Vehicular access to projects should
                   emphasize routes that minimize impacts on neighborhood streets.
              e. The UCSB portion of the Ellwood-Devereux Open Space area, including the
                   South Parcel, should be subject to deed restrictions or other equivalent
                   mechanisms that limit its use in perpetuity to open space, passive recreation, and
                   habitat management. Future improvements, including trails and habitat
                   enhancements, shall be consistent with the provisions of the joint Ellwood-
                   Devereux Coast Open Space and Habitat Management Plan.
LU 12.6       County Lands North of Cathedral Oaks Road. [GP] The following criteria should
              apply to future uses and development on lands in the unincorporated area of Santa
              Barbara County north of Cathedral Oaks Road:
              a. Low-intensity rural and agricultural uses are appropriate in this area; higher
                   intensity uses allowed by conditional use permit, such as churches or
                   greenhouses, are not appropriate in the foothill area north of the City.
              b. The urban-rural boundary line should not be extended to include any additional
                   areas within the rural area.
              c. Preservation of scenic viewsheds is a high priority; development that would
                   extend above the ridgelines should be avoided.
              d. Hillside development should be
                   avoided; appropriate erosion
                   and sediment control
                   measures should be
                   incorporated into all
                   development proposals to
                   avoid downstream impacts
                   within Goleta.
              e. Any development should be
                   designed to protect watersheds
                   and water quality and should
                   incorporate stormwater
                   retention measures to avoid
                   increases in stormwater flows
                   in downstream areas of                    Glen Annie Golf Course Located in the
                                                          Unincorporated Area North of Cathedral Oaks
                   Goleta.
                                                                             Road
              f.   The City supports the provision
                   of trail connectors between the Goleta urban area and the foothills and the Los
                   Padres National Forest area.
LU 12.7       County Lands East and South of Goleta. [GP] The following criteria should apply
              to future uses and development on lands in the unincorporated area of Santa
September 2006                                                                                          2-38
Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                              2.0 Land Use Element
              Barbara County between Goleta and the boundary of the city of Santa Barbara and
              southward of Goleta toward UCSB and Isla Vista:
              a. New development in areas near the Goleta boundary should be of a scale,
                   height, intensity, and design that will be compatible with the character of any
                   adjacent residential neighborhoods within Goleta.
              b. Any impacts of development in the unincorporated area on streets and/or
                   intersections within Goleta should be mitigated to the fullest extent feasible.
              c. A Traffic Mitigation Agreement between the County and the City should be
                   developed and adopted by the two jurisdictions. The agreement should provide
                   for payments by future project developers of appropriate traffic mitigation fees for
                   each project’s fair share of the costs of road improvements needed to address
                   the impacts on streets and/or intersections in both jurisdictions. The agreement
                   should further provide a mechanism to transfer the applicable amount of fees to
                   the other jurisdiction based upon the impacts and street and/or intersection
                   improvements required to mitigated impacts within its territory.
              d. New development in these unincorporated areas should be required to provide
                   adequate on-site parking so as to avoid any parking impacts within Goleta’s
                   neighborhoods.
              e. The Ocean Meadows Golf Course should be retained as a permanent open
                   space and recreation use. If a residential project is developed on a portion of the
                   property, a deed restriction requiring the undeveloped portion to remain as open
                   space in perpetuity should be required.
              f.   Any future development within the Devereux Creek and Slough watershed and
                   the Goleta Slough watershed should incorporate measures to protect water
                   quality and wildlife corridors.
              g. The South Patterson Agricultural Area should be preserved; large-scale or high-
                   intensity uses unrelated to agricultural use are a threat to the continued viability
                   of this area for agricultural production and should not be approved.
LU 12.8       County Lands West of Goleta. [GP] The following criteria should apply to future
              uses and development on lands in the unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County
              westward of Goleta, including the Gaviota Coast:
              a. The City supports County policies and zoning that will retain rural uses and the
                   low-intensity, undeveloped character of this segment of the coastal terrace and
                   nearby foothill areas.
              b. The urban-rural boundary line should not be extended to include any additional
                   areas.
              c. Development of residential estates and “ranchettes” should be minimized.
                   Whenever possible, any development potential should be transferred to lands on
                   the inland side of US-101 at locations where such development will not be visible
                   from the freeway and coastal bluffs.
              d. Low-intensity rural and agricultural uses are appropriate in this area; higher
                   intensity uses that are allowed subject to a conditional use permit, such as
                   churches or greenhouses, should not be approved in this coastal area.

              e. Preservation of scenic viewsheds is a high priority; development that would
                   extend above the ridgelines should be avoided.
              f.   Hillside development should be avoided; appropriate erosion and sediment
                   control measures should be incorporated into all development proposals. Any
                   development should be designed to protect watersheds and water quality.
              g. The City supports the provision of trail connectors between the Goleta urban
                   area and the foothills and the Los Padres National Forest area.
2.5      IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS [GP]
The following measures to implement this plan will need to be considered. Actions on these
measures will be taken following plan adoption:
LU-IA-1       Preparation and Adoption of New Zoning Code and Map. A new zoning code to
              replace the County zoning code adopted by the City upon incorporation must be
              prepared and adopted by the City Council. The new Zoning Code and Zoning Map
              are required to implement the policies set forth in the Land Use and other elements
              of this plan. A single, unified zoning code that includes zoning regulations applicable
              to inland areas and the coastal zone is anticipated. The portion of the zoning code
              applicable to the coastal zone will be subject to certification by the California Coastal
              Commission.
              Time period:                2006 to 2007
              Responsible parties: Planning and Environmental Services Department, Planning
                                          Commission, and City Council.
LU-IA-2       Adoption of Sphere of Influence for Goleta. The Santa Barbara County LAFCo is
              required to adopt an SOI for Goleta pursuant to Section 56425 of the California
              Government Code. The Goleta SOI will be a plan that defines the probable future
              physical boundaries and service area of the city. The SOI defines an area within
              which future annexations to the city may be considered. The City may submit a
              request to LAFCo for adoption of an SOI that is consistent with this plan.
              Alternatively, if LAFCo adopts an SOI for the City that is coterminous with Goleta’s
              existing boundaries at the conclusion of its municipal service review for the south
              coast area, the City will need to determine whether, based on this plan, it is
              appropriate to prepare and submit an SOI amendment request to LAFCo to include
              additional territory.
              Time period:                2006 to 2007
              Responsible parties: Planning and Environmental Services Department, City
                                          Council, and LAFCo (Renumbered per Reso. 09-59, 11/17/09)
LU-IA-3       Traffic Mitigation Agreements with UCSB, City of Santa Barbara, and County of
              Santa Barbara. These agreements are intended to provide for payments in lieu of
              traffic mitigation fees or pass through of traffic mitigation fees paid by private
              developers from a jurisdiction where a project is located to those jurisdictions where
              the streets and intersections are affected by the project. With respect to the Goleta-
              UCSB agreement, the agreement should address future projects that are

              accommodated by the University’s LRDP and by subsequent amendments to the
              LRDP.
              Time period:                2006 to 2007
              Responsible parties: Community Services Department and City Council (with
                                          assistance from PES) (Renumbered per Reso. 09-59, 11/17/09)
LU-IA-4       Neighborhood Compatibility Ordinance/Program. This program may consist of
              two parts: design criteria and a neighborhood compatibility ordinance (NCO). The
              NCO may be included within the new zoning code and could include standards for
              residential districts pertaining to Floor Area Ratios, height, bulk and scale, coverage
              by impervious surfaces, off-street parking, and other standards that are appropriate
              to provide for compatibility of new development and remodels with existing
              development in the immediate neighborhood, ensure access to sunlight and air,
              protect scenic views, and maintain privacy.
              Time period:                2006 to 2007
              Responsible party:          Planning and Environmental Services Department and City
                                          Council (Renumbered per Reso. 09-59, 11/17/09)
LU-IA-5       Transfer of Development Rights Ordinance/Program. This measure is intended to
              create a ordinance prescribing procedures for transfer of development rights from
              parcels within Goleta that may not be buildable due to policy limitations associated
              with habitat resources to receiving sites designated by the Land Use Plan map for
              residential use. In addition to the ordinance, the program would need to identify both
              sending and receiving sites and describe the procedures applicable to approval of
              individual density transfers. In order to facilitate regional planning goals, the program
              may include the consideration of areas outside the City’s jurisdiction as sender
              and/or receiver sites.

3.1      INTRODUCTION
General Plan Law Requirements [GP]
The Open Space Element is one of seven                Open Space Element Policies
mandatory elements of a general plan as               OS 1: Lateral Shoreline Access
described in California Government Code               OS 2: Vertical Access to the Shoreline
(Government Code) Section 65302. The                  OS 3: Coastal Access Routes, Parking, and Signage
detailed requirements applicable to the Open          OS 4: Trails and Bikeways
                                                      OS 5: Ellwood-Devereux Open Space Area
Space Element are presented in Sections               OS 6: Public Park System Plan
65560 through 65570 of the Government                 OS 7: Adoption of Open Space Plan Map
Code. The intent of this law is to ensure that        OS 8: Protection of Native American and
cities recognize that open space land is a                  Paleontological Resources
                                                      OS 9: Financing Public Parks, Open Space, and
limited and valuable resource that must be                  Recreation Facilities
conserved wherever possible and to require
local plans that will accomplish the objectives of a comprehensive open space program. Open
space land is defined by the law as any area of land that is essentially unimproved and
designated for one or more of the following open space uses: (1) land for the preservation of
natural resources; (2) land for the managed production of resources; (3) open space for outdoor
recreation; (4) open space for public health and safety; and (5) protection of Native American
cultural sites, including burial, historic or archaeological, sacred, or other cultural sites. State law
requires that any public acquisition or disposition of any interest in open space land must be
consistent with the Open Space Element. Similarly, approvals of building permits, subdivision
maps, and open space zoning ordinances must also be consistent. Portions of the required
subjects are addressed in the Visual and Historic Resources Element.
Coastal Act Requirements [CP]
One fundamental purpose of the California Coastal Act (Coastal Act) is to maximize provision of
public coastal access and recreation consistent with private property rights and protection of
sensitive habitats and other coastal resources. The Coastal Act requires that development not
interfere with the public right of access to the sea and shoreline and provides that public access
must be incorporated in new development, with limited exceptions. The Coastal Act also
addresses the need to regulate the time, place, and manner in which public access is provided.
It specifies the need to protect shoreline land suitable for coastal recreation uses and gives
priority to the use of such land for public recreational uses, including ocean-dependent and
ocean-related uses, over other uses. The Coastal Act policies provide that, wherever feasible,
public access and recreation facilities, including public parking lots, should be distributed
throughout an area so as to prevent overcrowding or overuse of any single area. The Coastal
Act further encourages the provision of lower-cost visitor and recreational facilities for the public.
Goleta’s Open Space, Recreation, and Coastal Access Resources – 2005 [GP/CP]
An essential aspect of Goleta’s character and livability is derived from the diverse open space
and resource lands within and surrounding the community. These assets include: approximately
September 2006                                                                                            3-1

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                          3.0 Open Space Element
two miles of Pacific shoreline, beaches, and coastal bluffs; open coastal mesas; Goleta and
Devereux Sloughs; agricultural lands, including citrus groves and vegetable crops as well as
fallow lands; creeks, riparian areas, ponds, wetlands, and woodlands; diverse wildlife habitats,
including eucalyptus groves comprising the largest complex of monarch aggregation sites in
southern California; numerous public and private parks and open space areas, many of which
include especially valued resource lands; lands with historic structures and landscapes; Lake
Los Carneros and its surrounding open lands; and the scenic backdrops provided by the Santa
Ynez Mountains, Pacific Ocean, and Channel Islands. Parks and open space not only serve to
protect environmental resources, but they also provide accessible recreational venues for
residents, including families, elderly persons, and disabled and low-income residents.
Preservation of these resources is integral to maintaining the natural and historical qualities of
the area for the benefit of present and future generations.
Existing Parks and Open Space
As of 2005, Goleta’s 16 public parks, four
private parks and open space areas, and 18
public open space areas comprise a total of
526 acres, which equates to about 17 acres
per 1,000 residents. The three larger City-
owned regional open space preserves—the
Sperling Preserve, Santa Barbara Shores
Park, and Lake Los Carneros Natural and
Historical Preserve—collectively accounted
for 363 acres of that total. Approximately 40
percent of Goleta’s two miles of Pacific
shoreline is now in City ownership. Together
with the neighborhood open space areas,
these preserves provide many opportunities
for passive recreation activities and                                    Stow Grove Park
enjoyment of natural areas. Areas specifically
developed for active recreational uses were
less abundant in 2005, with about 3 acres of land per 1,000 residents, and additional active
parks were an important need identified in the public workshop process that led to creation of
this plan. The city’s single recreation center, the Goleta Valley Community Center, is insufficient
to fulfill all needs by community groups and residents. In addition, although the privately owned
and managed Girsh Park provided much-needed facilities for active recreation, there was a
shortage of public facilities for active recreation, such as sports fields and tennis courts, and a
shortage of dedicated trails.
Existing Coastal Access
Direct access to beach areas is limited due to Goleta’s short 2-mile-long coastline and the
presence of steep bluffs along the shoreline, except at the mouths of Bell and Tecolote Creeks.
Existing public beach access is available at two locations—Ellwood Beach at the City-owned
Santa Barbara Shores Park/Sperling Preserve and Haskell’s Beach at the Bacara Resort
property. Coastal access improvements as of 2005 included a dedicated 50-space, public
coastal access parking lot at the Bacara access site and a City-owned 45-space lot at Santa
Barbara Shores Park/Sperling Preserve. Additional onstreet parking is available on several
streets in the Ellwood neighborhood for coastal access in the vicinity of the Coronado Preserve,
September 2006                                                                                        3-2

which is owned by the Land Trust for Santa Barbara County. Approximately 10 miles of public
trails are provided at the 228-acre Santa Barbara Shores Park/Sperling Preserve properties.
The only known outstanding offer to dedicate coastal access was at the Bacara site, which had
not been accepted as of 2005.
3.2      GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND GOALS [GP/CP]
Parks and open space provide a highly valued and important component of the existing and
future environment of Goleta. This element provides goals, policies, and actions intended to
achieve the City’s vision for open space, parks, and recreation facilities that are accessible to all
members of the community. Community workshops held as part of the public process of
creating this plan emphasized the present inadequate supply of active park and recreation
facilities and a desire that this need be addressed by the General Plan. The following guiding
principles and goals, which are not in order of priority, provide the foundation for the Open
Space Element. All policies set forth in subsequent sections of this element have been
established to conform to the guiding principles and goals, and future actions of the City
following adoption of the plan are required to be consistent.
1. Provide and maintain, in coordination with other agencies, a system of parks, open spaces,
     and recreation facilities that are accessible to and will meet the needs of present and future
     users of all age groups.
2. Ensure that new parks and recreational services for the public are provided concurrent with
     new development.
3. Increase the amount of active parks, emphasizing those areas of the community that were
     relatively underserved as of 2005 and areas designated for future new residential
     development.
4. Manage, operate, and maintain park, recreation, and open space facilities (including trails)
     in a manner that is responsive to the site and adjacent neighborhoods and balances the
     needs of the community with available funding.
5. Preserve Goleta’s existing open space areas, including its beaches and Pacific shoreline,
     sensitive habitat areas, and agricultural lands, and increase the amount of permanently
     protected open space as opportunities for acquisition arise.
6. Provide for convenient public access to Goleta’s beach and shoreline areas and protect
     these areas for coastal-dependent and coastal-related recreation use.
7. Manage open space areas in a manner that provides for public access, passive and active
     recreational use, and enjoyment, consistent with protection of natural and scenic resource
     values.
8. Provide and maintain a system of trails that will connect major parks and open space areas
     with each other, neighborhoods, the regional trail system, and Los Padres National Forest.
9. Ensure the protection of areas associated with Native American culture, including burial
     sites, religious and ceremonial sites, archaeological or historical sites, and other cultural
     sites.

3.3      COASTAL ACT POLICIES [CP]
The Coastal Act policies below are adopted as policies of this plan for those areas of Goleta
within the California Coastal Zone. The numbers refer to sections of the California Public
Resources Code. The plan maps show the location of the California Coastal Zone boundary.
30210         In carrying out the requirement of Section 4 of Article X of the California Constitution,
              maximum access, which shall be conspicuously posted, and recreational
              opportunities shall be provided for all the people consistent with public safety needs
              and the need to protect public rights, rights of private property owners, and natural
              resource areas from overuse.
30212         (a) Public access from the nearest public roadway to the shoreline and along the
                   coast shall be provided in new development projects except where: (1) it is
                   inconsistent with public safety, military security needs, or the protection of fragile
                   coastal resources, (2) adequate access exists nearby, or (3) agriculture would be
                   adversely affected. Dedicated accessway shall not be required to be opened to
                   public use until a public agency or private association agrees to accept
                   responsibility for maintenance and liability of the accessway.
              (b) For purposes of this section, “new development” does not include:
                   (1) Replacement of any structure pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (g) of
                       Section 30610.
                   (2) The demolition and reconstruction of a single-family residence; provided that
                       the reconstructed residence shall not exceed either the floor area, height or
                       bulk of the former structure by more than 10 percent, and that the
                       reconstructed residence shall be sited in the same location on the affected
                       property as the former structure.
                   (3) Improvements to any structure which do not change the intensity of its use,
                       which do not increase either the floor area, height, or bulk of the structure by
                       more than 10 percent, which do not block or impede public access, and which
                       do not result in a seaward encroachment by the structure.
                   (4) The reconstruction or repair of any seawall; provided, however, that the
                       reconstructed or repaired seawall is not seaward of the location of the former
                       structure.
                   (5) Any repair or maintenance activity for which the commission has determined,
                       pursuant to Section 30610, that a coastal development permit will be required
                       unless the commission determines that the activity will have adverse impact
                       on lateral public access along the beach.
                   As used in this subdivision, “bulk” means total interior cubic volume as measured
                   from the exterior surface of the structure.
              (c) Nothing in this division shall restrict public access nor shall it excuse the
                   performance of duties and responsibilities of public agencies which are required
                   by Sections 66478.1 to 66478.14, inclusive, of the Government Code and by
                   Section 4 of Article X of the California Constitution.
30212.5       Wherever appropriate and feasible, public facilities, including parking areas or
              facilities, shall be distributed throughout an area so as to mitigate against the
September 2006                                                                                            3-4

              impacts, social and otherwise, or overcrowding or overuse by the public of any single
              area.
30213         Lower cost visitor and recreational facilities shall be protected, encouraged, and,
              where feasible, provided. Developments providing public recreational opportunities
              are preferred.
              The commission shall not: (1) require that overnight room rentals be fixed at an
              amount certain for any privately owned and operated hotel, motel, or other similar
              visitor-serving facilities located on either public or private lands; or (2) establish or
              approve any method for the identification of low or moderate income persons for the
              purpose of determining eligibility for overnight room rentals in any such facilities.
30214         (a) The public access policies of
                   this article shall be implemented
                   in a manner that takes into
                   account the need to regulate the
                   time, place, and manner of
                   public access depending on the
                   facts and circumstances in each
                   case including, but not limited
                   to, the following:
                   (1) Topographic and geologic
                        site characteristics.
                   (2) The capacity of the site to
                        sustain use and at what                         Bella Vista Open Space
                        level of intensity.
                   (3) The appropriateness of
                        limiting public access to the right to pass and repass depending on such
                        factors as the fragility of the natural resources in the area and the proximity of
                        the access area to adjacent residential uses.
                   (4) The need to provide for the management of access areas so as to protect the
                        privacy of adjacent property owners and to protect the aesthetic values of the
                        area by providing for the collection of litter.
              (b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the public access policies of this article be
                   carried out in a reasonable manner that considers the equities and that balances
                   the rights of the individual property owner with the public’s constitutional right of
                   access pursuant to Section 4 of Article X of the California Constitution. Nothing in
                   this section or any amendment thereto shall be construed as a limitation on the
                   rights guaranteed to the public under Section 4 of Article X of the California
                   Constitution.
              (c) In carrying out the public access policies of this article, the commission and any
                   other responsible public agency shall consider and encourage the utilization of
                   innovative access management techniques, including, but not limited to,
                   agreements with private organizations which would minimize management costs
                   and encourage the use of volunteer programs.

3.4      CITY POLICIES
Policy OS 1: Lateral Shoreline Access [GP/CP]
Objective: To provide for the creation of continuous public lateral beach and bluff-top access
along the entire Goleta shoreline and increase and enhance opportunities for enjoyment of
beach, shoreline, and bluff-top areas, consistent with the natural shoreline character, private
property rights, and public safety.
OS 1.1        Definition. [GP/CP] Lateral shoreline access is defined as the right of public access
              and use of areas generally along and parallel to the shoreline that have been
              secured for public use by the granting and recordation of access easements or by
              offers to dedicate such access. As used in this plan, such public access may be on
              the beach landward from the mean high tide line for a particular specified distance or
              to the base of the ocean bluffs. Beach areas seaward of the mean high tide line are
              considered by Article X of the Constitution of the State of California to be public
              tidelands and are administered by the California State Lands Commission. Lateral
              shoreline access may also include public access and use of areas along and
              generally parallel to the top of the ocean bluffs.
OS 1.2        Adoption of Coastal Access Plan Map. [GP/CP] The overall coastal access
              system plan, shown in Figure 3-1, is hereby adopted. The Coastal Access Plan map
              identifies Goleta’s existing and proposed coastal access facilities, including lateral
              and vertical accessways, the California Coastal Trail and Juan Bautista de Anza
              National Historic Trail (Anza Trail) corridors, other trails, beach access locations, and
              public parking areas.
OS 1.3        Preservation of Existing Coastal
              Access and Recreation. [GP/CP]
              Goleta’s limited Pacific shoreline
              of approximately two miles
              provides a treasured and scarce
              recreational resource for residents
              of the city, region, and state.
              Existing public beaches, shoreline,
              parklands, trails, and coastal
              access facilities shall be protected
              and preserved and shall be
              expanded or enhanced where
              feasible (see related Policies LU 9
              and OS 4).
                                                                      Ellwood Coastal Trail
OS 1.4        Mitigation of Impacts to Lateral
              Coastal Access. [GP/CP] New development, including expansions and/or
              alterations of existing development, shall be sited and designed to avoid impacts to
              public access and recreation along the beach and shoreline. If there is no feasible
              alternative that can eliminate all access impacts, then the alternative that would
              result in the least significant adverse impact shall be required. Impacts shall be
              mitigated through the dedication of an access and/or trail easement where the
              project site encompasses an existing or planned coastal accessway, as shown on
              the map in Figure 3-1.
September 2006                                                                                           3-6

OS 1.5        Existing and Planned Lateral Coastal Access. [GP/CP] Existing and planned
              lateral beach and bluff-top accessways within Goleta are shown on the map in Figure
              3-1. Lateral beach and shoreline public access and recreation shall be permitted
              uses in the Visitor-serving Commercial, Recreation, and Open Space land use
              categories, which are the land-use categories applicable to lands situated along
              Goleta’s shoreline.
OS 1.6        Dedication of Lateral Beach Accessways. [GP/CP] Lateral beach access along
              the entire length of Goleta’s shoreline shall be required. Access easements shall be
              a required condition for approval of coastal development permits for projects within
              the city, provided there is a clear nexus to project impacts and the required condition
              is roughly proportional to the extent of the impacts. The following criteria and
              standards shall apply to lateral accessways:
              a. The access easement, or offer to dedicate, shall apply to the beach area
                   extending from the mean high tide line landward to the base of the ocean bluffs.
                   Where there is no ocean bluff, the area shall extend to the nearest nonbeach
                   natural feature, but generally shall not be less than 25 feet in width.
              b. It shall be the intent of the City to accept all dedications or offers to dedicate for
                   lateral beach access for areas located within the city boundaries. If the City is
                   unable to accept the dedication of particular access easements, it shall have
                   authority to designate another public entity or a private nonprofit organization
                   such as a land trust to accept the easement, provided the entity is willing to
                   operate and maintain the easement.
              c. Mitigation measures that require dedication of public access and recreational
                   opportunities shall be implemented prior to or concurrent with construction of the
                   proposed development or initiation of the proposed use in instances where there
                   is no physical development.
OS 1.7        Lateral Bluff-Top Accessways. [GP/CP] Lateral bluff-top access easements, or
              offers to dedicate easements, may be required as a condition of approval of coastal
              development permits for projects located on shoreline parcels, provided there is a
              clear nexus to project impacts and the required condition is roughly proportional to
              the extent of the impacts. The intent shall be to provide a trail along the entire
              shoreline of the city that is usable during all seasons and tide conditions, extending
              from the eastern boundary of the City-owned Sperling Preserve westward through
              the Bacara Resort site to the City’s western boundary. Some segments of the trail,
              such as part of the alignment on the Sandpiper Golf Course property, may be located
              below the bluff but above the beach on an access road to State Lease 421.
OS 1.8        Prescriptive Access Rights. [GP/CP] Public prescriptive rights may exist in certain
              areas along the beach and shoreline within Goleta. Development shall not interfere
              with the public’s right of access to the sea where such right has been acquired
              through historic use or legislative authorization. Where there is substantial evidence
              that such rights exist, these rights shall be protected through public acquisition
              measures or through conditions imposed on approvals of permits for new
              development.
 OS 1.9       Siting and Design of Lateral Accessways. [GP/CP] Public accessways and trails
              shall be an allowed use in environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHAs). The
September 2006                                                                                           3-7

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                             3.0 Open Space Element
              following criteria and standards shall apply to the siting and design of lateral
              accessways:
              a. Sensitive habitat areas shall be avoided to the extent practicable in
                   circumstances where there are feasible alternative alignments of lateral
                   accessways.
              b. Except as expressly provided for the Anza Trail (in Policy OS 4), all lateral
                   accessways shall be designed to use native beach or soil materials and have no
                   more than the minimum width needed to accommodate the intended type(s) of
                   users.
              c. Lateral beach accessways shall be maintained in a natural condition free of
                   structures and other constructed facilities and shall be limited to native sand
                   supply.
              d. Lateral beach accessways shall be sited, designed, managed to avoid and/or
                   protect marine mammal hauling grounds, seabird and shorebird nesting and
                   roosting sites, sensitive rocky points and intertidal areas, and coastal dunes.
              e. New public beach facilities shall be limited to only those structures that provide or
                   enhance public access and recreation activities. No structures shall be permitted
                   on sandy beach areas.
              f.   All lateral shoreline access and recreation improvements shall be designed to
                   minimize any adverse impacts to visual resources and shall be compatible with
                   maintenance of a natural appearance.
              g. Signs shall be designed to minimize impacts to scenic coastal resources and
                   shall be limited to trail markers and regulatory and interpretative signs.
                   Commercial signs are prohibited.
OS 1.10       Management of Public Lateral Access Areas. [GP/CP] The following criteria and
              standards shall apply to use and management of lateral shoreline access areas:
              a. Private commercial uses of public beach areas shall be limited to coastal-
                   dependent recreational uses, including but not limited to surfing schools, ocean
                   kayaking, and similar uses. All commercial uses of beach areas and other lateral
                   accessways shall be subject to approval of a permit by the City. The number,
                   size, duration, and other characteristics of commercial uses of beach areas may
                   be limited in order to preserve opportunities for use and enjoyment of the beach
                   area by the general public. For-profit commercial uses at the City-owned Santa
                   Barbara Shores Park and Sperling Preserve (the Ellwood-Devereux Open Space
                   and Habitat Management Plan [OSHMP] area) are prohibited (see related Policy
                   OS 5).
              b. Temporary special events shall minimize impacts to public access and recreation
                   along the shoreline. Coastal Development Permits shall be required for any
                   temporary event that proposes to use a sandy beach area and involves a charge
                   for admission or participation.
              c. Where sensitive habitat resources are present, limited or controlled methods of
                   access and/or mitigation designed to eliminate or reduce impacts to ESHAs shall
                   be implemented.
September 2006                                                                                           3-8

              d. The hours during which coastal access areas are available for public use shall be
                   the maximum feasible while maintaining compatibility with nearby neighborhoods
                   and land uses. The hours for public use shall be set forth in each individual
                   coastal development permit. Unless specific hours are described within a permit,
                   the access shall be deemed to be 24 hours per day and 7 days per week.
              e. In order to maximize public use and enjoyment, user fees for access to lateral
                   beach and shoreline areas shall be prohibited. Activities and/or uses that would
                   deter or obstruct public lateral access shall be prohibited.
              f.   Overnight camping and use of motorized vehicles, except for public safety
                   vehicles and vehicles associated with construction of access improvements and
                   maintenance and restoration or enhancement activities, shall be prohibited in
                   lateral shoreline access areas.
Policy OS 2: Vertical Access to the Shoreline [GP/CP]
Objective: To provide for expanded and enhanced public vertical access to Goleta’s shoreline
by preserving existing accessways and establishing new vertical access opportunities at key
locations so as to increase opportunities for public enjoyment of beach, bluff-top, and other
shoreline areas, consistent with the natural shoreline character, private property rights, and
public safety.
OS 2.1        Definition. [GP/CP] “Vertical” accessways are defined as the right of public access
              and use of areas generally perpendicular to the beach and shoreline that provide
              access to beach and shoreline areas from public street rights-of-way or parking
              areas and that have been secured for public use by the granting and recordation of
              access easements or by offers to dedicate such access.
OS 2.2        Planned Vertical Accessways. [GP/CP] Existing and planned vertical accessways
              to the beach and bluff-top within Goleta are shown on Figure 3-1. Vertical beach and
              shoreline public access shall be a permitted use in the Visitor-serving Commercial,
              Recreation, and Open Space land use categories, which are the land-use plan map
              categories applicable to lands situated along Goleta’s shoreline.
OS 2.3        Preservation of Existing Vertical
              Accessways. [GP/CP] Vertical
              access to Goleta’s Pacific
              shoreline was limited to two
              locations as of 2005. These
              include access to Haskell’s Beach
              within the Bacara Resort property
              and access at the City-owned
              Santa Barbara Shores Park and
              Sperling Preserve properties. The
              latter includes numerous trails that
              provide access to the bluff tops,
              although access from the bluff top
              to Ellwood Beach is available at
              only two locations. Existing public
                                                                Public Access to Haskell’s Beach
              vertical coastal access facilities
              shall be protected and preserved
September 2006                                                                                           3-9

              and shall be expanded or enhanced where feasible (see related Policies LU 9 and
              OS 4).
OS 2.4        Mitigation of Impacts to Vertical Coastal Access. [GP/CP] New development,
              including expansions and/or alterations of existing development, shall be sited and
              designed to avoid impacts to public vertical accessways to the shoreline unless a
              comparable, feasible alternative is provided. If there is no feasible alternative that
              can eliminate all access impacts, then the alternative that would result in the least
              significant adverse impact shall be required. Impacts shall be mitigated through the
              dedication of an access and/or trail easement in the general location where the
              project site encompasses an existing or planned coastal accessway, as shown
              generally on the map in Figure 3-1. (Amended by Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)
OS 2.5        Dedication of Vertical Accessways. [GP/CP] Dedication of vertical access
              easements, or offers to dedicate, shall be a required condition of approval of coastal
              development permits for projects on shoreline sites within the city, provided there is a
              clear nexus to the project impacts and the required condition is roughly proportional
              to the extent of the impacts. The following criteria and standards shall apply to
              vertical accessways:
              a. The access easement, or offer to dedicate, shall apply to an area that includes
                   the entire public accessway that extends from the public road or parking area to
                   the shoreline.
              b. The width of the access easement should not be less than 25 feet and shall be
                   centered on a pathway of at least 5 feet in width.
              c. It shall be the intent of the City to accept all dedications or offers to dedicate for
                   vertical beach access for areas located within the city boundaries. If the City is
                   unable to accept the dedication of particular access easements, it shall have
                   authority to designate another public entity or a private nonprofit organization,
                   such as a land trust, to accept the easement, provided the entity is willing to
                   operate and maintain the easement.
              d. Mitigation measures that require dedication of public access and recreational
                   opportunities shall be implemented prior to or concurrent with construction of the
                   proposed development or initiation of the proposed use in instances where there
                   is no physical development.
              e. The opening of access easements that are dedicated as a condition of approval
                   of coastal development permits shall occur only after the City, or other public or
                   nonprofit entity designated by the City, has accepted the offer of dedication and
                   agreed to open, operate, and maintain the accessway.
              f.   New offers to dedicate access easements shall include an interim deed
                   restriction that: (1) states the terms and conditions of the permit do not authorize
                   any interference with prescriptive rights prior to acceptance of the offer and (2)
                   prohibits any development or obstruction in the easement area prior to
                   acceptance of the offer.
OS 2.6        Prescriptive Vertical Access Rights. [GP/CP] Public prescriptive vertical access
              rights to the shoreline may exist in certain areas within Goleta. Development or uses
              shall not interfere with the public’s right of access to the sea where such right has
              been acquired through historic use or legislative authorization. Where there is
              substantial evidence that such rights exist, these rights shall be protected through
September 2006                                                                                          3-10

              public acquisition measures or through conditions imposed on approvals of permits
              for new development.
OS 2.7        Siting and Design of Vertical Accessways. [GP/CP] Public vertical accessways
              and trails shall be an allowed use in ESHAs. The following criteria and standards
              shall apply to the siting and design of all vertical accessways:
              a. Sensitive habitat areas shall be avoided to the extent practicable in
                   circumstances where there are feasible alternative alignments of vertical
                   accessways.
              b. Public access paths shall maintain a natural appearance and shall not be paved
                   with impervious materials, except for segments that are intended to provide
                   handicapped access or short segments to beach overlook points.
              c. No structures shall be permitted on bluff faces except for vertical beach
                   accessways.
              d. Access to the beach shall be provided by natural trails or ramps down the face of
                   the bluff rather than by concrete or wooden stairways. Railroad ties or a similar
                   material may be used to provide stability to the access route and to reduce bluff
                   erosion.
              e. Where vertical access to the beach area is not feasible or appropriate, vertical
                   accessways may terminate at a beach overlook or vista point.
OS 2.8        Management of Vertical
              Accessways. [GP/CP] The
              following standards shall apply to
              management of vertical
              accessways:
              a. Where sensitive habitat
                   resources are present, limited
                   or controlled methods of
                   access and/or mitigation
                   designed to eliminate or
                   reduce impacts to ESHAs shall
                   be required.
              b. The hours during which vertical
                   coastal access areas are
                                                          Existing Vertical Accessway to Haskell’s Beach
                   available for public use shall be
                   the maximum feasible while
                   maintaining compatibility with nearby neighborhoods and land uses. The hours
                   for public use shall be set forth in each individual coastal development permit.
                   Unless specific hours are described within a permit, the access shall be deemed
                   to be 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
              c. In order to maximize public use and enjoyment, user fees for access to vertical
                   beach and shoreline areas shall be prohibited. Activities and/or uses that would
                   deter or obstruct public vertical access shall be prohibited.
              d. Private for-profit commercial use of vertical accessways shall be prohibited.
September 2006                                                                                           3-11

              e. Camping or other use of vertical accessways for overnight accommodations shall
                   be prohibited.
              f.   Motorized vehicles shall be prohibited on vertical accessways.
Policy OS 3: Coastal Access Routes, Parking, and Signage [GP/CP]
Objective: To provide an adequate supply of public coastal access parking in lots or areas that
are appropriately distributed along Goleta’s shoreline with convenient and linkages to regional
transportation routes.
OS 3.1        Coastal Access Highway Routes. [GP/CP] Coastal access highway routes are
              defined as public or private roadways or rights-of-way that link the local and regional
              highway network to vertical coastal access facilities, including public parking areas.
              These routes, shown on Figure 3-1, include the following:
              a. Hollister Avenue, from its interchange at U.S. Highway 101 (US-101) to the
                   Bacara access road and to the Santa Barbara Shores Park parking lot, which

Policy OS 4: Trails and Bikeways [GP/CP]
Objective: To designate, preserve, and expand a public trail system that will provide recreation
opportunities for multiple types of users in diverse and attractive environmental settings and that
will connect various parks and neighborhoods with the regional trail network and to Los Padres
National Forest.
OS 4.1        Definition. [GP/CP] As set forth in this policy, trails are defined as foot paths where
              rights of public use are obtained through acquisition of access easements for trail
              purposes by a public agency or a nonprofit organization and are made available for
September 2006                                                                                          3-13

              use by the general public. Some trail segments may be multiuse, and allow use by
              bicyclists and/or equestrians as well as pedestrians.
OS 4.2        Adoption of Trail Plan Map. [GP/CP] The overall trail system plan, shown in Figure
              3-2, is hereby adopted. The Trail Plan map identifies the city’s existing and proposed
              trail segments, which are intended to provide diverse recreational and aesthetic
              experiences serving the entire community, achieve connections to parks and major
              recreational facilities, link with trail systems of adjacent jurisdictions, and facilitate
              recreational corridors between the Santa Ynez Mountains (Los Padres National
              Forest) and the coast. The alignments for proposed trail segments are conceptual
              only. Sidewalks and bikeways are intended to be connecting links to or between
              trails. The Pedestrian System Plan Map and the Bikeways Plan Map are Figures 7-5
              and 7-6 in the Transportation Element.
OS 4.3        California Coastal Trail. [GP/CP] The California Coastal Trail segment within
              Goleta, as shown on the maps in Figures 3-1 and 3-3, shall be planned as a part of a
              continuous lateral shoreline trail system traversing the entire length of the state’s
              coastline, connecting with contiguous California Coastal Trail segments within the
              jurisdictions of the County and UCSB. The following criteria and standards shall
              apply to the California Coastal Trail:
              a. The trail shall be sited as close to the ocean as possible, while maintaining an
                   appropriate setback for safety purposes from the edge of the coastal bluff.
              b. The trail shall be connected at appropriate intervals to existing and proposed
                   local trail systems and to vertical access facilities.
              c. The trail shall be sited to maximize ocean views and scenic coastal vistas.
              d. The trail shall be planned
                   primarily as a pedestrian trail,
                   although certain segments,
                   particularly within the City-
                   owned Ellwood-Devereux Open
                   Space Area, may be planned to
                   accommodate the needs of
                   bicyclists and/or equestrians.          California Coastal Trail
                                                           The California Coastal Trail (CCT) is a continuous
              e. Segments of the trail located             public right-of-way along the entire California
                   along the beach and shoreline           coastline designed to foster appreciation and
                                                           stewardship of the diverse scenic and natural
                   that may not be passable at all         resources of the California coast through a hiking,
                   times shall, where feasible,            biking, and equestrian trail system. The CCT’s
                   have an alternate landward or           projected length of 1,300 miles will be comprised of
                   bluff-top route that will allow         many different segments over varied terrain, reflecting
                   continuous passage during all           the great diversity of California’s coastal communities
                                                           and providing opportunities for public access to
                   seasons and tide conditions.            beaches, scenic vistas, wildlife viewing areas,
                                                           recreational or interpretive facilities and other points
              f.   The trail shall be sited and
                                                           of interest.
                   designed to minimize impacts to
                   environmentally sensitive habitat areas to the extent feasible. The trail surface
                   shall generally be limited to groomed and/or compacted native soil or sand
                   material, except that segments intended for handicapped access or to beach
                   overlooks (vista points) may be improved to a higher standard.

              g. Trail easement dedication and installation of trail improvements shall be required
                   as a condition of approval of all coastal development permits on properties
                   located on the California Coastal Trail corridor, when dedication will mitigate
                   impacts by the project on public access and/or recreation.
OS 4.4        Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail. [GP/CP] The following criteria and
              standards apply to future improvements to the Anza Trail segment within Goleta:
              a. The planned corridor for the Anza Trail is shown on the maps in Figures 3-1 and
                   3-3.
              b. Within the City-owned Sperling
                   Preserve and Santa Barbara
                   Shores Park, the Anza Trail
                   shall be planned for multiple
                   user types, including
                   pedestrians, bicyclists, and
                                                          Juan Bautista de Anza Trail

                   shall generally be designed as         Mexico through little-known territory to Alta California.
                   follows:                               The expedition, an integral part of Spanish foreign
                                                          and colonial policy to extend its hold upon territories

                        tread may be separate from        language, customs, traditions, and general
                                                          expressions of Hispanic culture on the early
                        or combined with the main         development of California.
                        trail tread for pedestrians
                        and bicyclists.
                   2) The trail shall be designed to have the minimum width necessary to
                        accommodate the multiple users. The surface may be native soil materials or
                        imported compacted fines (such as decomposed granite) without stabilizer or
                        binder.
              d. As it exits the public open space area, the future Anza Trail corridor extends
                   along Hollister Avenue to the Bacara access road and along that road to the
                   city’s western boundary. Standards for improvements of this segment of the Anza
                   Trail shall be flexible to respond to the amount of available space for trail
                   improvements. Dedication of a public access easement for the trail shall be
                   required as a condition of approval of all coastal development permits for
                   properties located along the Anza Trail corridor.
              e. Connectivity of the Anza Trail in Goleta with segments within the jurisdictions of
                   the County and UCSB shall be provided as indicated in the multi-jurisdictional
                   Ellwood-Devereux OSHMP.
OS 4.5        Creekside Trails. [GP] Trails shall be sited to minimize damage to riparian areas
              while allowing some public access. To the extent feasible, trail corridors should be
              located outside riparian areas but provide occasional contact to streams to allow
              public access and enjoyment of the resources. Where feasible, public trail
              easements should be located within the boundaries of flood control easements. All
              trail construction should minimize removal of riparian vegetation and utilize natural
              features and/or lateral fencing to discourage public access to streamside areas not

              directly within the trail alignment. Any fences constructed along trail corridors should
              allow for wildlife movement. Where necessary to prevent disturbance of nesting
              birds, sections of trails may be closed on a seasonal basis. At such times, alternative
              trail segments should be provided, where feasible. In order to protect riparian
              resources, the number of creek crossings should be limited and maintenance should
              be conducted to minimize introduction and spread of invasive plants.
OS 4.6        Trail Connectors to Los Padres National Forest. [GP] The City shall encourage
              and help facilitate public trail access from the community to the rural foothills and
              mountainous areas of the Los Padres National Forest by providing connections from
              the urban areas within city boundaries to the following proposed trail segments:
              a. Ellwood Canyon Trail.
              b. Glen Annie Trail.
              c. San Jose Creek Trail.
  OS 4.7      Acquisition/Dedication of Trails. [GP] The City shall create a system of
              interconnecting, useable public trails within designated trail corridors through a
              combination of mechanisms such as required dedications of easements, public
              purchase, land exchange, private donation and other voluntary means. Trail
              easement dedications shall be required as a condition of approval for development
              on property that contains a mapped trail corridor when the dedication will mitigate
              adverse impacts created by the project on public access and/or recreation.
              Development and the trail alignment shall be sited and designed to provide
              maximum privacy and safety for both residents and trail users. The corridors for
              proposed trail segments shown on Figure 3-2 are conceptual, and precise
              alignments shall be determined at the time of development approval.
Policy OS 5: Ellwood-Devereux Open Space Area [GP/CP]
Objective: The portion of the Ellwood-Devereux Open Space Area within Goleta, which
includes the City-owned Sperling Preserve and Santa Barbara Shores Park units, shall be
managed to provide coastal access and passive, coastal-dependent recreational opportunities
consistent with protection and enhancement of the site’s environmentally sensitive habitat areas
and other environmental and scenic resources.
OS 5.1        Definition. [GP/CP] The provisions of this policy apply to the lands within the
              boundaries of the Ellwood-Devereux Coast OSHMP that are within the City’s
              jurisdiction, as shown on Figures 3-3 and 3-4. These lands include the City-owned
              137.6-acre Sperling Preserve, acquired in February 2005 by the City with the
              assistance of the Trust for Public Land; the 91.7-acre City-owned Santa Barbara
              Shores Park; other contiguous City-owned open space areas; and the 9.5-acre
              Coronado Preserve, owned and managed by the Land Trust for Santa Barbara
              County.
OS 5.2        Adoption of Open Space and Habitat Management Plan Maps. [GP/CP] The
              Open Space and Habitat Management Plan maps in Figures 3-3 and 3-4, which
              respectively designate coastal access and recreation areas and environmentally
              sensitive habitat areas that are to be protected and/or enhanced, are hereby
              adopted.
September 2006                                                                                        3-16

OS 5.3        Public Access and Recreation.
              [GP/CP] The Ellwood-Devereux
              Open Space Area shall be
              managed to maintain the site’s
              historical public access and
              recreation uses while managing
              accessways to protect natural
              resources such as the monarch
              butterfly groves, vernal pools,
              native grasslands, beaches,
              coastal bluffs, and other
              environmentally sensitive habitat
              areas. The planned trail and beach               Ellwood-Devereux Open Space Area
              access system, shown on the map
              in Figure 3-3, is based on the locations of existing informal trails created by repeated
              public use, with some trail segments being closed to avoid impacts to
              environmentally sensitive areas, to eliminate hazardous segments, and/or to
              eliminate parallel redundant trail segments. Although some trail closures are
              proposed, the planned trail system will not reduce overall access or trail experiences
              in the public open space area, but will redirect users to alternate routes located in
              close proximity. The following standards shall apply to public access and recreation
              in the open space area:
              a. The Anza Trail is one of two major planned east-west trails across the Ellwood
                   Mesa. This trail extends from the eastern boundary with UCSB to the public
                   access parking lot at Santa Barbara Shores Park adjacent to Hollister Avenue
                   (see related OS 4.4).
              b. The California Coastal Trail segment within the Ellwood-Devereux Open Space
                   Area, the other major east-west trail, is planned to have a bluff-top alignment
                   (see related OS 4.3).
              c. The locations of additional planned trails are also shown on Figure 3-3. Although
                   the trail system shall be planned primarily as footpaths for pedestrians, bicyclists
                   and/or equestrians may also be accommodated on certain trail segments as
                   shown in Figure 3-3. At least one trail from the Hollister parking lot to the bluff-top
                   shall be designated for exclusive use by pedestrians.
              d. Except for the Anza Trail, trails shall generally be designed to utilize native soil
                   materials with appropriate grooming and maintenance to provide for slightly
                   crowned cross sections, defined trail edges, and proper drainage. Trail
                   improvements shall be designed to maintain natural drainage patterns in order to
                   avoid potential impacts to Devereux Creek and the associated eucalyptus groves
                   that comprise the monarch butterfly aggregation sites. Trail improvements may
                   include boardwalks and/or bridges across Devereux Creek in wet or eroded
                   areas in the vicinity of the Ellwood Main grove
              e. Two accessways from the bluff top to Ellwood Beach (identified as accessways
                   E and F) are planned, as shown on Figure 3-3. These beach accessways shall
                   be planned to accommodate pedestrians only.
                   1) Improvements to accessway E, which is a steeply sloped former roadway
                       with a badly eroded asphalt surface, are limited to repairs to improve the

                       surface for the safety of users and to reduce further erosion of the bluff face
                       and pathway.
                   2) Improvements to accessway F, which is a steep pathway down the face of
                       the bluff, shall be designed to smooth the surface, improve drainage, and
                       reduce erosion of the path and bluff face and are generally limited to minor
                       grading and placement of landscape ties or a similar material to stabilize the
                       pathway.
              f.   A public access parking lot consisting of not less than 40 parking spaces shall be
                   provided adjacent to Hollister Avenue, as shown in Figure 3-3. The following
                   standards shall apply to public parking serving the open space area:
                   1) The Hollister Avenue lot shall be paved with permeable materials to reduce
                       stormwater runoff and prevent pollution of surface waters.
                   2) Landscaping of the parking lot and Hollister Avenue street frontage shall
                       maintain a natural appearance and shall be limited to drought-tolerant
                       species. Landscaping shall not impair views of the coastal bluff-top, ocean,
                       and Channel Islands from Hollister Avenue.
                   3) Onstreet parking on streets within the Ellwood neighborhood shall be
                       available as needed for public coastal access, subject to appropriate
                       restrictions on the hours of availability and duration of such parking.
              g. A limited amount of facilities or amenities may be provided within the open space
                   area to better accommodate users and manage accessways to protect natural
                   resources. These may include the following:
                   1) A potential public restroom facility to be located between the public parking
                       lot and Hollister Avenue, which shall be designed to avoid impairing views of
                       the ocean and the Channel Islands from Hollister Avenue.
                   2) Low-profile signs to identify permitted uses, guide pedestrians, interpret
                       resources, and advise users on resource protection regulations.
                   3) Temporary or permanent barriers to establish protection for sensitive plants
                       and animals and habitat restoration areas that are compatible with the natural
                       appearance of the surroundings.
                   4) Benches at a limited number of selected scenic locations.
                   5) Trash receptacles, mutt-mitt dispensers, and other similar low-impact
                       facilities.
              h. A signage program shall be prepared for the open space area. The overall intent
                   or purposes of the sign program shall be to assist and inform visitors as to open
                   space regulations, directions, and information. Signs shall be designed and
                   located in a manner that is protective of environmental and visual resources and
                   may include the following:
                   1) A donor recognition sign.
                   2) Trail markers identifying names, directions, and distances.

OS 5.4        Protection and Enhancement of Habitat Areas. [GP/CP] Within its boundaries, the
              Ellwood-Devereux Open Space Area encompasses a diverse array of sensitive
              aquatic and upland habitats, as shown on Figure 3-3. These habitats include beach
              and shoreline areas, dunes, rocky intertidal areas, coastal bluffs, monarch butterfly
              aggregation sites and associated eucalyptus groves, vernal pools, riparian areas
              along Devereux Creek and its tributaries, coastal sage and scrub areas, native
              grasslands, and raptor nesting and roosting areas. All environmentally sensitive
              habitat areas shall be managed and protected consistent with the policies and
              standards described in the Conservation Element of this plan. In addition, the
              following criteria and standards shall apply to the Ellwood-Devereux Open Space
              Area:
              a. Habitat management on City owned lands shall be implemented within a broad
                   ecosystem context in which habitat management priorities will consider the role
                   of the targeted habitats and the interrelationships with other habitats in the open
                   space area. In addition to protection of existing habitats, management actions
                   may include interventions to enhance or restore degraded habitat conditions. All
                   management activities shall use an adaptive approach that includes monitoring
                   and adjustments to ensure that self-sustaining habitats will be created that are
                   not reliant on long-term human intervention.
              b. Priority habitat management activities include ensuring the long-term vitality of
                   the eucalyptus groves and stability in the monarch butterfly population;
                   restoration of native grasslands; enhancement of vernal pools and riparian
                   habitats; and protection of special status species, including various raptors and
                   the western snowy plover. Some examples of habitat management action areas
                   are shown on Figure 3-4.
              c. Habitat management activities shall be designed to accommodate public access
                   and use in or adjacent to habitat areas, where practicable, in a manner
                   consistent with protection of the resource.
              d. In all habitat enhancement or restoration projects, genetic stock for seeds and
                   plants from the Devereux Creek watershed shall be used, unless such use has
                   been determined to be infeasible.
OS 5.5        Use and Management of the Open Space Area. [GP/CP] The following
              management policies shall apply to lands owned by the City within the Ellwood-

              g. Use of herbicides, insecticides, and similar toxic substances shall not be
                   permitted unless other nonchemical methods of pest control have been
                   attempted or determined to be infeasible.
OS 5.6        Multi-jurisdictional Open Space Area. [GP/CP] The Ellwood-Devereux Open
              Space area within Goleta is a part of a planned contiguous open space area of over
              650 acres along or near the Pacific shoreline. This larger multi-jurisdictional open
              space area includes lands managed by the Land Trust for Santa Barbara County,
              UCSB, and the County of Santa Barbara. The City intends to cooperate with the
              Land Trust of Santa Barbara County, UCSB, and the County of Santa Barbara in
              assuring connectivity of trails and in formulating and implementing habitat
              management strategies where such management activities have effects that extend
              beyond the boundaries of individual jurisdictions.
Policy OS 6: Public Park System Plan [GP]
Objective: To develop a well-maintained, interconnected system of multi-functional parks,
recreation facilities and public open spaces that will meet the needs of existing and future
residents and employees and that are attractive, safe, and accessible to all segments of the
city’s population, and supportive of established neighborhoods.
OS 6.1        Definition. [GP] The following types of public parks and open space are defined by
              this plan: mini parks, neighborhood parks, neighborhood open space, community
              parks, regional open space, and special-use parks. The provisions set forth in
              subsequent sections of this policy define each of these categories and provide
              criteria and standards applicable to each category.
OS 6.2        Equitable Distribution of Park Facilities. [GP] To the extent feasible, park and
              recreation facilities shall be equitably distributed throughout the city to serve the
              various neighborhoods and all socioeconomic segments of the city’s population.
              Particular emphasis shall be placed on provision of new park and recreation facilities

              in areas that were underserved as of 2005 and in areas of the city that are
              designated for new residential use and development in the future. These areas
              include, but are not limited to, the Goleta Old Town (Old Town) and the Mid-Hollister
              areas. The distribution of existing and planned future public park and recreation
              facilities and public open space areas is shown on Figure 3-2, and information about
              each site is summarized in Table 3-1.
OS 6.3        Mini or “Pocket” Parks. [GP] A
              mini park is characterized by a
              relatively small size and
              specialized facilities that serve a
              small local area and/or specific
              segment of the population, such
              as children or senior citizens. The
              following standards shall apply to
              mini or pocket parks:
              a. The typical service area shall
                   be a radius of 0.33 mile.
              b. The typical size shall be 1 acre
                   or less.
                                                                       Nectarine Park
              c. Mini parks should be located in
                   close proximity to housing
                   and/or other activity centers in the immediate neighborhood to provide
                   accessibility and visibility.
              d. Typical facilities provided in mini parks may include children’s play areas and
                   equipment, exercise and fitness areas, outdoor seating and picnic areas, and
                   plazas.
OS 6.4        Neighborhood Parks. [GP]
              Neighborhood parks provide the
              nearby residential neighborhood
              with active recreational activities
              for a variety of age groups. The
              following standards shall apply to
              neighborhood parks:
              a. The typical service area radius
                   shall be 0.5 mile.

              d. Typical facilities provided in neighborhood parks include playgrounds and
                   associated equipment, picnic tables, open undeveloped areas, lawns or grassy
                   areas for field games, and benches.
              e. Neighborhood parks may be developed as a school park or community center
                   park.
OS 6.5        Neighborhood Open Space. [GP] Neighborhood open space areas integrate
              natural features such as trees, riparian corridors, and varied undeveloped landscape
              with the adjacent neighborhoods. The following standards apply to neighborhood
              open space areas:
              a. Primary emphasis is placed on
                   protection of the natural
                   resource, with limited passive
                   recreation activities such as
                   trails. Accordingly, the
                   locations of these facilities are
                   based upon the presence of
                   natural resources rather than
                   accessibility to a service area.
              b. The typical size is variable and
                   is based upon the physical
                   extent of the natural resource
                   area.
              c. Neighborhood open space
                   areas should be made                               Oro Verde Open Space
                   accessible to the surrounding
                   neighborhood population through safe pedestrian and bicycle access, where
                   feasible and appropriate. Onsite parking facilities are not appropriate in
                   neighborhood open space areas.
              d. Typical facilities provided in neighborhood open space areas are limited to space
                   for quiet or passive recreational activities. Structural or land improvements, other
                   than dirt trails and resting areas, shall be avoided in these areas. Some
                   neighborhood open space areas may integrate with a small neighborhood park
                   (as described above), usually consisting of a small playground or similar active
                   area. Restrooms and facilities for more intensive, active forms of recreation are
                   not appropriate improvements in neighborhood open space areas.
OS 6.6        Community Parks. [GP] Community parks include developed areas suited for
              intense active recreational activities, large natural areas suited for passive outdoor
              recreation, or a combination of both. These parks may contain special amenities,
              facilities, or features that attract people from throughout the surrounding community.
              The following standards apply to community parks:
              a. The typical service area radius shall be 1 to 2 miles.
              b. The typical size shall be 10 or more acres.
              c. Community parks should be easily accessible from the surrounding
                   neighborhoods and by automobile from more distant neighborhoods. Since these

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                           3.0 Open Space Element
                   facilities are intended to
                   serve areas beyond their
                   immediate neighborhoods,
                   onsite parking and restroom
                   facilities may be provided.
              d. Multiple facilities for various
                   types of users are typically
                   provided in community parks,
                   including both active and
                   passive recreational facilities.
                   Active facilities may include a
                   range of formal and informal
                   athletic fields (i.e., the play
                   areas are less developed
                   and generally not designed
                                                                 Evergreen Open Space
                   to support competitive play),
                   tennis courts, play areas,
                   developed picnic areas, and meeting and gathering spaces. Passive facilities
                   may include areas for rest and relaxation with a mix of both improved areas
                   (lawns and informal play areas) and unimproved natural areas.
OS 6.7        Regional Open Space. [GP] Regional open space areas are contiguous to or
              encompass significant natural resources and may include areas of historical,
              environmental, or ecological value. These areas may contain special amenities or
              features that attract people from throughout the city and the surrounding region. The
              following standards apply to regional open space areas:
              a. The typical service area shall
                   be within a 0.5- to 1.0-hour
                   drive.
              b. The typical size shall be
                   appropriate for the protection
                   of the associated natural or
                   open space values.
              c. Regional open spaces should
                   be easily accessible from the
                   surrounding neighborhoods
                   and easily accessible by
                   automobile for visitors from
                   more distant locations. Since
                   these areas may attract people
                                                                 Santa Barbara Shores Park
                   from distant locations, they
                   may provide on-site parking
                   and restroom facilities. Such services should be located on the periphery of the
                   open space area and designed in a way to minimize any adverse impact on
                   natural and visual resources. The capacity of such parking and restroom facilities
                   shall be consistent with the character and carrying capacity of the open space
                   area.
September 2006                                                                                        3-25
Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                              3.0 Open Space Element
              d. Typical facilities provided in regional open space areas are designed to be
                   primarily passive in character, although historical and special purpose attractions
                   may be included. The primary purpose of these areas is to protect their open
                   space and natural values and passive recreation shall be managed in a way that
                   does not conflict with these values, while still providing appropriate public access.
OS 6.8        Special Use Parks. [GP] Special use parks cover a broad range of parks and
              facilities oriented toward a single-purpose use or a small number of uses. Special
              use parks are facilities strategically located throughout the community. The following
              standards apply to special use parks:
              a. The typical service area is variable, depending upon the type of facilities
                   provided.
              b. The typical size will depend on the specific facility space requirements.
              c. Special use parks should be
                   accessible from the
                   surrounding neighborhoods
                   and by automobile for visitors
                   from more distant locations.
                   Since these areas may attract
                   people from distant locations,
                   such areas may require onsite
                   restroom facilities, parking,
                   and automobile access.
              d. Typical facilities are those
                   appropriate and associated
                   with uses such as golf courses;              Goleta Valley Community Center
                   skateboard parks; tennis
                   courts; ice rinks; zoos; areas
                   that preserve buildings, sites, or features of historical significance; and
                   community centers. Special use parks may also include public beach access
                   points not included in another park type.
OS 6.9        Park Master Plan. [GP] The City will prepare a Park Master Plan for the system of
              municipal park facilities. This master plan may be used to determine resource
              development, expansion, maintenance, operation, or capital improvements
              appropriate for these city facilities and as a basis for pursuing funding opportunities.
              To match resource needs to individual park sites, the City may prepare a
              development and/or management plan for individual parks, particularly for the largest
              park sites.
OS 6.10       Design and Management of Public Parks and Open Space. [GP] The City should
              ensure that park, recreation, and open space facilities are designed and managed in
              a manner that is consistent with protection of the ecology of the natural systems at
              each park site and that will serve the needs of the intended user groups. The
              following criteria shall apply to the design and management of public parks and open
              space areas:
September 2006                                                                                           3-26
Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                               3.0 Open Space Element
              a. Wherever feasible and appropriate, landscaping should emphasize native and
                   drought-tolerant, noninvasive species that will reduce maintenance costs and
                   water use and be supportive of wildlife habitats.
              b. To the extent feasible, the City shall maintain parks and open space areas
                   without the use of herbicides, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and other toxic
                   substances. Herbicide use is restricted within 100 feet of the top-of-bank of any
                   watercourse in parks and open space to those herbicides approved by the U.S.
                   EPA for use in aquatic environments.
              c. The types of improvements and facilities at each site should be based on the
                   recreation and leisure needs of the targeted user groups and the physical
                   opportunities and constraints of the site.
              d. Improvements should provide for convenient access by pedestrians from the
                   adjacent neighborhood areas.
              e. The design of improvements shall provide for maximum visibility of the park from
                   public streets and incorporate measures to assure adequate security and safety
                   for users.
              f.   Provision of lighting shall be limited to the minimum needed for the types of uses
                   planned in order to reduce light pollution and glare. Lights shall not be directed
                   upward or into adjacent habitat.
              g. Adequate off-street parking to serve the intended uses shall be provided in order
                   to minimize the burden placed on onstreet parking in the neighborhood.
OS 6.11       Planned New Parks and Open Space. [GP] The locations of planned new public
              parks and open space are shown on Figure 3-2 and described in Table 3-1. Specific
              improvements will be implemented as conditions require and when funding is
              available. These planned new public parks and open space include:
              a. Expansion of the Armitos Park. An approximately 4-acre neighborhood park
                   located in the vicinity of Old San Jose Creek between Hollister Avenue and
                   Armitos Avenue adjacent to the Armitos Park in Old Town.
              b. A park in the southern portion of Old Town. A 4- to 5-acre active recreation
                   community park, potentially including sports fields, located on or in the vicinity of
                   the former drive-in theater in Old Town between the Santa Barbara Airport and
                   SR-217.
              c. Willow Springs Park. A 2- to 3-acre neighborhood park in the proposed Willow
                   Springs North project located south of US-101, east of Los Carneros Road, and
                   north of Camino Vista Road, on property totaling approximately 16.19 gross
                   acres.
              d. Village at Los Carneros Park. A 3- to 5-acre neighborhood park in the proposed
                   Village at Los Carneros project located south of US-101 and west of Los
                   Carneros Road, on property totaling approximately 18 acres. The park should
                   include active recreation facilities, such as fields suitable for organized sports.
              e. Cabrillo Business Park Open Space. An approximately 15-acre neighborhood
                   open space located west of Santa Barbara Airport on an approximately 92-acre
                   property bound by Hollister Avenue and Los Carneros Road.

              Parks and open space in new developments shall be open to the general public and
              not limited to residents of individual development projects. (Amended by Reso. 12-46, 7/17/12)
OS 6.12       Public Use of Private Facilities. [GP] Private open space and recreational facilities
              shall be made accessible to the public whenever the associated development is
              granted concessions related to park impact fee reductions, open space dedication, or
              other similar benefits.
Policy OS 7: Adoption of Open Space Plan Map [GP]
Objective: To designate, preserve, and protect significant open space resources including
agricultural, ecological, recreational, and scenic lands in Goleta and surrounding areas for
current and future generations.
OS 7.1        Definition. [GP] Pursuant to Section 65560 of the California Government Code,
              open space land is defined as any area of land, parcel, or portion of a parcel that is
              essentially free of structures and similar improvements and that is designated by this
              plan to remain in an open and undeveloped status for the following public purposes:
              a. To preserve natural resources, including but not limited to, areas required for the
                   preservation of plant and animal life, streams, lagoons, coastal beaches, and
                   lands needed for watershed protection.
              b. To preserve lands for the managed production of resources, including but not
                   limited to, agricultural lands, lands with soils suitable for agricultural production,
                   streams and marshes important to maintain fishery resources, and areas
                   required for the recharge of groundwater basins.
              c. To preserve lands for outdoor recreation, including but not limited to, areas with
                   outstanding scenic, historic, and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park
                   and recreation purposes, including access to lakeshores, beaches, and streams,
                   including amenities/structures that support the public’s use or enjoyment of
                   beach areas and other such open space areas; and areas that serve as links
                   between recreation lands, including utility easements and banks of streams.
              d. To protect health and safety, including but not limited to, lands that require
                   special management or regulation because of hazardous or special conditions
                   such as earthquake fault zones, flood plains, tsunami run-up areas, and others.
              e. To protect the places, features, and objects associated with Native American
                   cemeteries, religious or ceremonial sites, archaeological or historical sites, or
                   other cultural sites. (Amended by Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)
OS 7.2        Adoption of Open Space Plan Map. [GP] Figure 3-5 designates land areas in
              Goleta that are planned for preservation as public and private open space.
OS 7.3        Open Space for Preservation of Natural Resources. [GP] Goleta’s natural
              resource lands include sandy beaches and dunes; rocky intertidal areas; coastal
              lagoons; coastal bluffs; eucalyptus groves and monarch butterfly aggregation sites;
              native grasslands; streams and associated riparian areas; wetlands, lakes, and
              ponds; and habitats for various protected plant and animal species. Figure 3-5
              designates all ESHAs as protected open space. The following standards shall apply
              to these areas:
September 2006                                                                                            3-28

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                                 3.0 Open Space Element
              a. The designated natural resource areas shall be managed by the City in accord
                   with the policies described in the Conservation Element.
              b. The City may require dedication of open space easements as a condition of
                   approval of development on sites that have open space resources as shown in
                   Figure 3-5.
              c. The City encourages the donation of easements or fee-simple interests in open
                   space lands to the City or other appropriate nonprofit entity, such as a land trust.
OS 7.4        Open Space for Managed Production of Resources. [GP] Goleta’s managed
              resource lands include lands actively used for agricultural production, vacant lands
              that were historically used and zoned for agriculture and that have soils suitable for
              agricultural production, watersheds appropriate for recharge of groundwater basins,
              and coastal streams and marshes important for the management of recreational and
              commercial fisheries. Figure 3-5 designates land areas that are to be preserved as
              open space for managed production of resources. The following standards shall
              apply to these areas:
              a. Lands designated for
                   agricultural use by the Land
                   Use Element include areas
                   devoted to agricultural
                   production as of 2005 and
                   those lands that were zoned
                   for agriculture at the time of
                   incorporation of the City in
                   February 2002. These lands,
                   shown on the Land Use Plan
                   map in Figure 2-1, shall be
                   protected as open space to
                   preserve the potential for
                   future agricultural production.
                   Although some of these lands
                                                                          Fairview Gardens
                   were not actively used for
                   agriculture, their historical use for agricultural activities and soil characteristics
                   make them suitable for agricultural production in the long term.
              b. Agricultural lands shall be managed in accord with Land Use Element Policy LU
                   7 and with Conservation Element Policy CE 11. Conversion of lands designated
                   for agriculture to urban or other nonagricultural uses shall not be permitted.
              c. Streams and their associated watershed lands shall be managed in accord with
                   Conservation Element Policy CE 10.
              d. Open space easements or deed restrictions may be acquired by dedication,
                   where feasible, or by donation or purchase.
OS 7.5        Open Space for Outdoor Recreation. [GP] Lands designated in Figure 3-5 for
              outdoor recreation include Goleta’s diverse City-owned parks and open space areas,
              as well as private lands that are devoted to active recreation. Private lands, such as
              Girsh Park and the Sandpiper Golf Course, may be available to the general public or
              may be for the exclusive use and enjoyment of residents or customers of particular

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                           3.0 Open Space Element
              development projects. The following shall apply to lands designated for outdoor
              recreation:
              a. City-owned parks and
                   recreation areas shall be
                   managed in accord with the
                   provisions of Policy OS 7.
              b. Lake Los Carneros Natural
                   and Historic Preserve shall be
                   managed primarily as a
                   passive preserve, with low-
                   intensity activities allowed near
                   the Stow House, the historic
                   farm buildings, and the historic
                   Goleta Train Depot and South
                   Coast Railroad Museum.
              c. Private lands for outdoor
                   recreation, including but not                         Girsh Park
                   limited to Girsh Park and
                   Sandpiper Golf Course, shall be protected and preserved for the valuable
                   contribution that they make to the supply of recreation services available to
                   residents of Goleta and adjacent areas.
              d. The City should maximize the use of the existing park, recreation, and open
                   space resources within the City by connecting them with an integrated system of
                   trails and sidewalks.
              e. General locations for proposed or planned future park sites are shown in
                   Figure 3-2.
OS 7.6        Open Space for Protection of Public Health and Safety. [GP] Although lands that
              provide open space for public health and safety are not specifically designated on
              Figure 3-5, the following land areas that are subject to hazardous conditions shall be
              considered to be designated open space as if fully depicted on the map:
              a. Lands situated along streams identified on the latest edition of the Flood
                   Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) published by the Federal Emergency Management
                   Agency (FEMA), or any successor agency, as falling within the area of inundation
                   caused by a 100-year flood event.
              b. Lands along the Pacific shoreline and at the mouths of streams identified on the
                   FIRM maps as subject to 100-year event coastal flooding hazards, including
                   areas potentially inundated by high velocity wave action.
              c. Lands subject to wildland fire hazards or lands needed as a buffer between
                   urban development and wildland fire hazard areas.
              d. Lands within 50 feet on each side of active earthquake fault zones.
              e. Land areas with slopes in excess of 25 percent.
              f.   Lands subject to the safety hazards identified in items a through e above shall be
                   managed in accord with the applicable policies and standards of the Safety
                   Element of this plan.
September 2006                                                                                        3-30

OS 7.7        Ownership of Open Space Lands. [GP] Open space lands include public lands
              owned by the City or other public entities, lands owned by nonprofit organizations
              such as the Land Trust for Santa Barbara County and the Girsh Park Foundation, as
              well as lands in private ownership. The Open Space Plan Map (Figure 3-5) and
              related provisions of this policy shall not be construed in such a manner as to render
              any privately owned legal parcel created prior to the date of this plan unusable in its
              entirety for any purpose allowed by the Land Use Element.
OS 7.8        Provision of Open Space in New Development. [GP] A minimum open space area
              shall be required in new development situated in certain land use categories, as set
              forth in the applicable policies of the Land Use Element. These private open space
              areas shall be in addition to any public park and open space land that may be
              required to be dedicated pursuant to the Quimby Act or other state or local statutes.
              Although private open space areas may be reserved to protect resources or avoid
              development in areas subject to hazards, such reservations shall include lands
              usable for outdoor recreation activities, where feasible.
OS 7.9        Open Space or Greenbelt around Goleta. [GP] The City supports the preservation
              of an open space area, or greenbelt, around the city’s perimeter in existing
              unincorporated rural areas. To advance this purpose, the Land Use Element
              designates lands near Goleta’s northern, southeastern, and western boundaries for
              low-intensity uses to provide a gradual transition between the city’s urban edge and
              the surrounding open rural areas.
Policy OS 8: Protection of Native American and Paleontological Resources
[GP/CP]
Objective: To identify and protect prehistoric and historic cultural sites and resources from
destruction or harmful alteration.
OS 8.1        Definition. [GP/CP] Cultural resources include Native American archaeological sites
              and areas of the natural landscape that have traditional cultural significance.
              Archaeological sites include prehistoric sites that represent the material remains of
              Native American societies and their activities and ethnohistoric sites that are Native
              American settlements occupied after the arrival of European settlers in California.
              Such archaeological sites may include villages, seasonal campsites, burial sites,
              stone tool quarry sites, hunting sites, traditional trails, and sites with rock carvings or
              paintings. Areas of traditional cultural significance include Native American sacred
              areas where religious ceremonies are practiced or which are central to their origins
              as a people, as well as areas traditionally used to gather plants for food, medicinal,
              or economic purposes.
OS 8.2        Inventory. [GP/CP] The City shall coordinate with UCSB’s Central Coast Information
              Center to identify archaeologically sensitive areas within city boundaries. To prevent
              artifact gathering and other forms of destruction, the exact location of sensitive sites
              may remain confidential.
OS 8.3        Preservation. [GP/CP] The City shall protect and preserve cultural resources from
              destruction. The preferred method for preserving a recorded archeological site shall
              be by preservation in place to maintain the relationship between the artifacts and the
              archaeological context. Preservation in place may be accomplished by deed
September 2006                                                                                           3-31

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                            3.0 Open Space Element
              restriction as a permanent conservation easement, avoidance through site planning
              and design, or incorporation of sites into other open spaces to prevent any future
              development or use that might otherwise adversely impact these resources.
OS 8.4        Evaluation of Significance. [GP/CP] For any development proposal identified as
              being located in an area of archaeological sensitivity, a Phase I cultural resources
              inventory shall be conducted by a professional archaeologist or other qualified
              expert. All sites determined through a Phase 1 investigation to potentially include
              cultural resources must undergo subsurface investigation to determine the extent,
              integrity, and significance of the site. Where Native American artifacts have been
              found or where oral traditions indicate the site was used by Native Americans in the
              past, research shall be conducted to determine the extent of the archaeological
              significance of the site.
OS 8.5        Mitigation. [GP/CP] If research and surface reconnaissance shows that the project
              area contains a resource of cultural significance that would be adversely impacted by
              proposed development and avoidance is infeasible, mitigation measures sensitive to
              the cultural beliefs of the affected population shall be required. Reasonable efforts to
              leave these resources in an undisturbed state through capping or covering resources
              with a soil layer prior to development shall be required. If data recovery through
              excavation is the only feasible mitigation, the City shall confer with the affected
              Native American nation or most-likely descendants, as well as agencies charged with
              the responsibility of preserving these resources and organizations having a
              professional or cultural interest, prior to the removal and disposition of any artifacts.
OS 8.6        Monitoring and Discovery. [GP/CP] On-site monitoring by a qualified archaeologist
              and appropriate Native American observer shall be required for all grading,
              excavation, and site preparation that involves earth moving operations on sites
              identified as archaeologically sensitive. If cultural resources of potential importance
              are uncovered during construction, the following shall occur:
              a. The grading or excavation shall cease and the City shall be notified.
              b. A qualified archeologist shall prepare a report assessing the significance of the
                   find and provide recommendations regarding appropriate disposition.
              c. Disposition will be determined by the City in conjunction with the affected Native
                   American nation.
OS 8.7        Protection of Paleontological Resources. [GP/CP] Should substantial
              paleontological resources be encountered during construction activities, all work that
              could further disturb the find shall be stopped and the City of Goleta shall be notified
              within 24 hours. The applicant shall retain a qualified consultant to prepare a report
              to the City that evaluates the significance of the find and, if warranted, identifies
              recovery measures. Upon review and approval of the report by the City, construction
              may continue after implementation of any identified recovery measures.
September 2006                                                                                         3-32

Policy OS 9: Financing Public Parks, Open Space, and Recreation Facilities [GP]
Objective: To establish equitable methods that will generate sufficient financial resources to
meet future needs for acquisition and improvement of public parks, recreation facilities, and
open space areas.
OS 9.1        Park and Open Space Standards and Fee Study. [GP] As of 2005, the City owned
              a total of 491 acres of park and open space lands, or 16 acres per 1,000 people. If
              private park facilities, such as Girsh Park, are included, the total acreage was 526
              acres, or 17 acres per 1,000 people. The City shall undertake a study pursuant to AB
              1600 (Chapter 927, stats. 1987, California Government Code Section 66000 et seq.)
              to: (1) establish specific service standards for parks, recreation, and open space
              facilities; (2) describe and quantify the costs of acquiring land for proposed new
              facilities and constructing proposed improvements to existing and new park,
              recreation, and open space facilities; (3) apportion the costs between those needed
              to address existing deficiencies and those needed to serve new development; and
              (4) establish an equitable method for determining each individual new development’s
              proportionate share of the total costs attributable to new development. Separate
              requirements may be established for parks, recreation facilities, and open space.
OS 9.2        Mitigation of Impacts of New Development on Parks and Recreation Facilities.
              [GP] The following shall apply to approvals of new development projects:
              a. To ensure new development pays a proportionate share of the cost of acquisition
                   and improvement of parks, recreation facilities, and open space, the City shall
                   require a one-time impact fee to offset costs necessary to accommodate the
                   development. These fees shall be used for acquiring and/or developing new or
                   improving/rehabilitating existing park, recreation, or open space facilities.
              b. At its discretion, the City may allow any appropriate park and recreational
                   facilities provided within a development to meet all or part of the mitigation
                   requirement in lieu of payment of a portion of the impact fee only if they are open
                   and accessible to the public.
              c. Within new subdivisions, where the City may allow dedications of land in lieu of
                   payment of fees pursuant to California Government Code Section 66477
                   (Quimby Act), the land area to be dedicated shall be usable space for active
                   recreation purposes.
OS 9.3        Alternatives to Impact Fees. [GP] In appropriate circumstances for larger
              development proposals, the City may consider using alternatives to impact fees for
              meeting park, recreation, and open space needs. These alternatives may include
              negotiated development agreements wherein the developer agrees to provide land
              and construct appropriate park, recreation, and open space facilities that will be
              dedicated to the City and made available for use by the general public. Any
              agreements may also include a funding mechanism for maintenance of the dedicated
              facilities.
OS 9.4        Other Funding Sources. [GP] The City shall consider other funding mechanisms for
              the acquisition of land and improvements to parks as well as recreation and open
              space facilities, including, but not limited to, the following:

              a. State, federal, local, and private grant sources.
              b. Special assessments, subject to the requirements of applicable law.
              c. Special taxes, subject to the requirements of applicable law.
              d. Special districts.
              e. Private gifts and donations.
              f.   User fees.
OS 9.5        Park and Recreation Facilities of Other Public and Private Entities. [GP] To
              maximize the provision of park and recreation services with limited land and facilities,
              the City may consider joint use agreements with the Goleta Union School District
              and/or the Santa Barbara High School District to make existing or planned facilities
              available for use by the public during certain times when they are not needed for
              school activities. The City may also support joint use of existing and/or planned
              recreation facilities with the City of Santa Barbara and the County.
OS 9.6        Private Support. [GP] The City encourages and supports efforts to establish a
              foundation to support parks, trails, and public landscaping.
3.5      IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS [GP]
OS-IA-1       Preparation and Adoption of New Zoning Code. A new zoning code to replace the
              County Zoning Code adopted by the City upon incorporation must be prepared and
              adopted by the City Council. The new zoning code shall include an open space
              overlay district and establish requirements for dedications or reservations of lands for
              parks, coastal access, trails, and open space. At a minimum, the open space
              overlay will include the following APNs: 079-554-023, 079-554-024, 079-554-025,

OS-IA-2       AB 1600 Fee Study for Park, Recreation, and Open Space Facilities. A study
              pursuant to AB 1600 must be prepared to identify the purpose and use of
              development fees before such fees are imposed. This study is intended to (1)
              establish specific service standards for parks, recreation, and open space facilities;
              (2) describe and quantify the costs of acquiring land for proposed new facilities and
              constructing proposed improvements to existing and new park, recreation, and open
              space facilities; (3) apportion the costs between those needed to address existing
              deficiencies and those needed to serve new development; and (4) establish an
              equitable method for determining each individual new development’s proportionate
              share of the total costs attributable to new development.

preservation of resources. Although no
harbors, major fisheries, significant mineral resources, or timberlands exist within the Planning
Area, this element identifies and establishes policies to protect other important resources
including native plant and wildlife habitats, natural landform features, and other natural
resources that are potentially affected by urban land uses and development.
Coastal Act Requirements [CP]
One of the chief objectives of the Coastal Act is preservation, protection, and enhancement of
coastal resources, including marine, aquatic, and terrestrial habitats and water quality. At
Section 30240 of the Public Resources Code, the Coastal Act requires the protection of
environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHAs) against any significant disruption of habitat
values. Generally, development is not allowed in any ESHA and adjacent development must be
sited to avoid impacts that would degrade the quality of ESHA. In addition, creeks and
associated riparian habitat are protected to maintain their biological productivity and quality of
coastal waters. The Coastal Act requires that alteration of creeks and waterways be minimized
and narrowly limits the purposes for which alterations may be considered. Various sections of
Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act require that marine resources be maintained and enhanced to
sustain the biological productivity of coastal waters.
Existing Marine, Land, and Air Resources—2005 [GP/CP]
Terrestrial and Marine Biological Resources
Goleta is situated on the coastal terrace and adjacent foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains in
the middle of a narrow ecological transition that extends from the top of the Santa Ynez
Mountains to the intertidal zone of the Pacific Ocean. The habitats and wildlife resources within
Goleta reflect those typically found within the coastal plains of southern California. They include
resources such as monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) aggregations and overwintering
habitat, raptor nests, coastal estuaries, vernal pools and other wetlands, riparian corridors, and

other habitats and associated wildlife. Relatively undisturbed native habitats are present along
narrow riparian corridors, in scattered undeveloped lands of varying sizes, and in protected
open space areas such as Ellwood Mesa Open Space and Lake Los Carneros. The following
habitats occur within Goleta and are considered to be ESHAs: marine resources, beach and
shoreline resources, coastal dunes, coastal bluff scrub, foredune, oak woodlands/savannah,
dense stands of native grasslands, all wetlands such as vernal pools, riparian habitats, butterfly
roosts, raptor roosts and nests, and habitats that support special-status plant and wildlife
species, including western snowy plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus) habitat. Potentially
occurring special-status species are listed in Table 4-1. This list is based on a review of the
California Natural Diversity Database for species occurring in the region.
Surface Water Resources
Within Goleta, 12 creeks drain from the
foothills south to the Pacific Ocean. Most of
the creeks exhibit intermittent, seasonal
flows, and creek conditions vary greatly. Two
creeks, Bell Canyon Creek and Tecolote
Creek, form small coastal lagoons at the
Pacific Ocean. Sections of some creeks are
channelized to provide conveyance for flood
flows such as along El Encanto, San Pedro,
and Tecolotito Creeks. Creeks in areas
subject to human disturbance have impaired
water quality and lower biological diversity.
San Jose Creek, located in the eastern
portion of the city, is part of a pilot project for
watershed planning. The goal of this
watershed plan is to protect existing                                   Lake Los Carneros
resources and identify opportunities to
improve the functioning of the creek ecosystem, while protecting existing land uses and
community values.
With the exception of Bell Canyon and Tecolote Creeks, the creeks within the city drain to one
of two sloughs located to the south of the city boundary: Goleta Slough and Devereux Slough.
Both sloughs have large expanses of wetlands and estuarine habitats and support a rich and
diverse coastal ecosystem despite substantial human impacts. Goleta Slough, the larger of the
two, is now less than half of its original size; this is the result of extensive fill from development
of the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, and of sedimentation from upstream land uses. Glenn
Annie, Los Carneros, San Pedro, Las Vegas, San Jose, and Maria Ignacio Creeks drain into the
Goleta Slough. The total watershed area of the Goleta Slough drainage is about 45 square
miles. Several smaller creeks, including Devereux and El Encanto Creeks, drain western Goleta
and are tributary to Devereux Slough, which is in an area owned by the University of California,
Santa Barbara. The Devereux Slough watershed, which totals about 3.5 square miles, currently
experiences a greater inflow than prior to urbanization, which affects its water quality and slough
dynamics.
There are 640 acres (about one square mile) within the FEMA-designated 100 year flood plain
within Goleta. This is approximately 12 percent of the entire area of the city.

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                         4.0 Conservation Element
Agricultural Resources
For over 200 years the Goleta Valley has been a land of great agricultural diversity and
productivity. Today the Goleta urban area contains about 920 acres zoned for agriculture—less
than half of the amount that remained in 1967. The agricultural land that remains contains a
variety of agricultural uses ranging from small produce and specialty truck farms and
greenhouses to avocado and lemon orchards in the adjacent foothills. Farms in the canyons
and along the coastal plain grow a variety of fruits and vegetables, many of which are
organically grown. Agricultural activities in Goleta are generally divided along Cathedral Oaks
Road, with more urban agriculture located to the south and more rural agriculture located to the
north.
Air Quality Resources
Goleta is located within the South Central Coast Air Basin. Air quality measurements indicate
that the South Central Coast Air Basin is a “nonattainment” area for the federal and state
standards for ozone and suspended particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in size (PM10).
However, the air basin is in an “attainment” area for all other federal and state air quality
standards. Although air quality in the city is generally characterized as acceptable, vehicular
traffic produces more than half of the onshore smog-forming pollution in Santa Barbara County
and is a major contributor of PM10 and toxic air pollution. Other sources of air pollution include
the Venoco Ellwood Onshore Oil and Gas Processing Facility as well as, offshore oil and gas
production and transport activities, natural oil seeps, and ship traffic in the Santa Barbara
Channel.
4.2      GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND GOALS [GP/CP]
The policies of the Conservation Element are designed to preserve and protect Goleta’s
environmental resources, including valuable habitat areas, to the maximum extent feasible while
allowing reasonable development in conformance with the provisions of the Land Use Element
(see Chapter 2.0). The following principles or goals, which are not in order of priority, provide
the foundation for the detailed policies in subsequent sections of this element. All policies have
been established to conform with the guiding principles and goals, and future actions of the City
following adoption of the plan are required to be consistent.
1. Protect, maintain, and enhance natural ecosystem processes and functions in Goleta and its
     environs in order to maintain their natural ecological diversity.
2. Preserve, restore, and enhance the physical and biological integrity of Goleta’s creeks and
     natural drainages and their associated riparian and creekside habitats.
3. Protect, restore, and enhance coastal bluffs and dune areas.
4. Identify and protect wetlands, including vernal pools, as highly productive and complex
     ecosystems that provide special habitats for flora and fauna as well as for their role in
     cleansing surface waters and drainages.
5. Protect water quality and the biological diversity of Goleta Slough and Devereux Slough.
6. Protect and enhance other important aquatic and terrestrial habitats, including those
     associated with rare, threatened, or endangered species of plants or animals.
7. Protect, preserve, and enhance Goleta’s Urban Forest.

8. Preserve and protect agriculture, encourage future expanded agricultural production by
     protecting land and supporting direct marketing, and ensure compatibility of nearby
     development with agriculture.
9. Manage water resources at the watershed level cooperatively with other agencies to
     maintain high groundwater and surface water quality and to protect marine aquatic habitats.
10. Manage groundwater and surface water resources to promote water quality and quantity
     adequate to support natural ecosystem processes and functions.
11. Manage water use efficiency, conserve water, promote recycling, and promote public
     awareness of water and recycling issues.
12. Conserve soil resources as the foundation of resource production and minimize erosion and
     other soil-depleting processes.
13. Minimize emissions of atmospheric pollutants that result from new development within
     Goleta and reduce emissions from transportation sources by promoting transit and other
     less polluting alternative modes of travel.
14. Encourage energy efficiency in new development and encourage use of alternative energy
     sources such as solar energy.
4.3      COASTAL ACT POLICIES [CP]
The Coastal Act definitions and policies set forth below are adopted as policies of this plan for
those areas of Goleta within the California Coastal Zone. The numbers refer to sections of the
California Public Resources Code. The figures in this chapter show the location of the Coastal
Zone boundary.
30107.5       “Environmentally sensitive area” means any area in which plant or animal life or their
              habitats are either rare or especially valuable because of their special nature or role
              in an ecosystem and which could be easily disturbed or degraded by human
              activities and developments.
30230         Marine resources shall be maintained, enhanced, and where feasible, restored.
              Special protection shall be given to areas and species of special biological or
              economic significance. Uses of the marine environment shall be carried out in a
              manner that will sustain the biological productivity of coastal waters and that will
              maintain healthy populations of all species of marine organisms adequate for long-
              term commercial, recreational, scientific, and educational purposes.
30231         The biological productivity and the quality of coastal waters, creeks, wetlands,
              estuaries, and lakes appropriate to maintain optimum populations of marine
              organisms and for the protection of human health shall be maintained and, where
              feasible, restored through, among other means, minimizing adverse effects of waste
              water discharges and entrainment, controlling runoff, preventing depletion of ground
              water supplies and substantial interference with surface water flow, encouraging
              waste water reclamation, maintaining natural vegetation buffer areas that protect
              riparian habitats, and minimizing alteration of natural creeks.
30233         (a) The diking, filling, or dredging of open coastal waters, wetlands, estuaries, and
                   lakes shall be permitted in accordance with other applicable provisions of this
                   division, where there is no feasible less environmentally damaging alternative,

                   and where feasible mitigation measures have been provided to minimize adverse
                   environmental effects, and shall be limited to the following:
                   (1) New or expanded port, energy, and coastal-dependent industrial facilities,
                       including commercial fishing facilities.
                   (2) Maintaining existing, or restoring previously dredged, depths in existing
                       navigational channels, turning basins, vessel berthing and mooring areas,
                       and boat launching ramps.
                   (3) In wetland areas only, entrance channels for new or expanded boating
                       facilities; and in a degraded wetland, identified by the Department of Fish and
                       Game pursuant to subdivision (b) or Section 30411, for boating facilities if, in
                       conjunction with such boating facilities, a substantial portion of the degraded
                       wetland is restored and maintained as a biologically productive wetland. The
                       size of the wetland area used for boating facilities, including berthing space,
                       turning basins, necessary navigation channels, and any necessary support
                       facilities, shall not exceed 25 percent of the degraded wetland.
                   (4) In open coastal waters, other than wetlands, including creeks, estuaries, and
                       lakes, new or expanded boating facilities and the placement of structural
                       pilings for public recreational piers that provide public access and recreational
                       opportunities.
                   (5) Incidental public service purposes, including but not limited to, burying cables
                       and pipes or inspection of piers and maintenance of existing intake and
                       outfall lines.
                   (6) Mineral extraction, including sand for restoring beaches, except in
                       environmentally sensitive areas.
                   (7) Restoration purposes.
                   (8) Nature study, aquaculture, or similar resource dependent activities.
              (b) Dredging and spoils disposal shall be planned and carried out to avoid significant
                   disruption to marine and wildlife habitats and water circulation. Dredge spoils
                   suitable for replenishment should be transported for such purposes to
                   appropriate beaches or into suitable long shore current systems.
              (c) In addition to the other provisions of this section, diking, filling, or dredging in
                   existing estuaries and wetlands shall maintain or enhance the functional capacity
                   of the wetland or estuary. [remainder omitted]
              (d) Erosion control and flood control facilities constructed on water courses can
                   impede the movement of sediment and nutrients which would otherwise be
                   carried by storm runoff into coastal waters. To facilitate the continued delivery of
                   these sediments to the litoral zone, whenever feasible, the material removed
                   from these facilities may be placed at appropriate points on the shoreline in
                   accordance with other applicable provisions of this division, where feasible
                   mitigation measures have been provided to minimize adverse environmental
                   effects. Aspects that shall be considered before issuing a coastal development
                   permit for such purposes are the method of placement, time of year of
                   placement, and sensitivity of the placement area.

30236         Channelizations, dams, or other substantial alternations of rivers and creeks shall
              incorporate the best mitigation measures feasible, and be limited to (1) necessary
              water supply projects, (2) flood control projects where no other method for protecting
              existing structures in the floodplain is feasible and where such protection is
              necessary for public safety or to protect existing development, or (3) developments
              where the primary function is the improvement of fish and wildlife habitat.
30240         (a) Environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall be protected against any significant
                   disruption of habitat values, and only uses dependent on those resources shall
                   be allowed within those areas.
              (b) Development in areas adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat areas and
                   parks and recreation areas shall be sited and designed to prevent impacts which
                   would significantly degrade those areas, and shall be compatible with the
                   continuance of those habitat and recreation areas.
30241         The maximum amount of prime agricultural land shall be maintained in agricultural
              production to assure the protection of the area’s agricultural economy, and conflicts
              shall be minimized between agricultural and urban land uses through all of the
              following:
              (a) By establishing stable boundaries separating urban and rural areas, including,
                   where necessary, clearly defined buffer areas to minimize conflicts between
                   agricultural and urban land uses.
              (b) By limiting conversions of agricultural lands around the periphery of urban areas
                   to the lands where the viability of existing agricultural use is already severely
                   limited by conflicts with urban uses or where the conversion of the lands would
                   complete a logical and viable neighborhood and contribute to the establishment
                   of a stable limit to urban development.
              (c) By permitting the conversion of agricultural land surrounded by urban uses where
                   the conversion of the land would be consistent with Section 20350.
              (d) By developing available lands not suited for agriculture prior to the conversion of
                   agricultural lands.
              (e) By assuring that public service and facility expansions and nonagricultural
                   development do not impair agricultural viability, either through increased
                   assessment costs or degraded air and water quality.
              (f) By assuring that all divisions of prime agricultural lands, except those
                   conversions approved pursuant to subdivision (b), and all development adjacent
                   to prime agricultural lands shall not diminish the productivity of such prime
                   agricultural lands.
30242         All other lands suitable for agricultural use shall not be converted to nonagricultural
              uses unless (1) continued or renewed agricultural use is not feasible, or (2) such
              conversion would preserve agricultural land or concentrate development consistent
              with Section 30250. Any such permitted conversion shall be compatible with
              continued agricultural use on surrounding lands.

CE 1.3          Site-Specific Studies and Unmapped ESHAs. [GP/CP] Any area not designated
                on the ESHA map in Figure 4-1 that meets the ESHA criteria for the resources
                specified in CE 1.1 shall be granted the same protections as if the area was shown
                on the map. Proposals for development on sites where ESHAs are shown on the
                map or where there is probable cause to believe that ESHAs may exist shall be
                required to provide the City with a site-specific biological study that includes the
                following information:
                a. A base map that delineates topographic lines, parcel boundaries, and adjacent
                     roads.
                b. A vegetation map that identifies species that may be indicators of ESHAs.
                c. A soils map that delineates hydric and nonhydric soils, if applicable.

              d. A census of animal species that indicates the potential existence of ESHAs.
              e. A detailed map that shows the conclusions regarding the boundary, precise
                   location and extent, or current status of the ESHA based on substantial evidence
                   provided in the biological studies.
CE 1.4        Illegal Destruction of ESHAs. [GP/CP] Any area mapped as an ESHA in Figure 4-1
              shall not be deprived of the protections granted by this plan on the basis that the
              habitat has been illegally removed or degraded, or because the nature or role of a
              species that is rare or especially valuable has been eliminated.
CE 1.5        Corrections to Map of ESHAs. [GP/CP] If a site-specific biological study contains
              substantial evidence that an area previously shown as an ESHA on Figure 4-1 does
              not contain habitat that meets the definition of an ESHA for reasons other than that
              set forth in CE 1.4, the City biologist and the Planning Commission shall review all
              available information and determine if the area in question should no longer be
              considered an ESHA and therefore not be subject to the ESHA protection policies of
              this plan. If the final decision-making body determines that the area is not an ESHA,
              a map modification shall be included in the next General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan
              amendment; however, Local Coastal Program policies and standards for protection
              of ESHAs shall not apply, and approval of development consistent with all other
              requirements of this plan may be considered prior to the map revision. (Amended by
              Reso. 09-59, 11/17/09)
CE 1.6        Protection of ESHAs. [GP/CP] ESHAs shall be protected against significant
              disruption of habitat values, and only uses or development dependent on and
              compatible with maintaining such resources shall be allowed within ESHAs or their
              buffers. The following shall apply:
              a. No development, except as otherwise allowed by this element, shall be allowed
                   within ESHAs and/or ESHA buffers.
              b. A setback or buffer separating all permitted development from an adjacent ESHA
                   shall be required and shall have a minimum width as set forth in subsequent
                   policies of this element. The purpose of such setbacks shall be to prevent any
                   degradation of the ecological functions provided by the habitat area.
              c. Public accessways and trails are considered resource-dependent uses and may
                   be located within or adjacent to ESHAs. These uses shall be sited to avoid or
                   minimize impacts on the resource to the maximum extent feasible. Measures—
                   such as signage, placement of boardwalks, and limited fencing or other
                   barriers—shall be implemented as necessary to protect ESHAs.
              d. The following uses and development may be allowed in ESHAs or ESHA buffers
                   only where there are no feasible, less environmentally damaging alternatives and
                   will be subject to requirements for mitigation measures to avoid or lessen impacts
                   to the maximum extent feasible: 1) public road crossings, 2) utility lines, 3)
                   resource restoration and enhancement projects, 4) nature education, 5)
                   biological research, and 6) Public Works projects as identified in the Capital
                   Improvement Plan, only where there are no feasible, less environmentally
                   damaging alternatives.
              e. If the provisions herein would result in any legal parcel created prior to the date
                   of this plan being made unusable in its entirety for any purpose allowed by the
                   land use plan, exceptions to the foregoing may be made to allow a reasonable

                   economic use of the parcel. Alternatively, the City may establish a program to
                   allow transfer of development rights for such parcels to receiving parcels that
                   have areas suitable for and are designated on the Land Use Plan map for the
                   appropriate type of use and development. (Amended by Reso. 09-59, 11/17/09)
CE 1.7        Mitigation of Impacts to EHSAs. [GP/CP] New development shall be sited and
              designed to avoid impacts to ESHAs. If there is no feasible alternative that can
              eliminate all impacts, then the alternative that would result in the fewest or least
              significant impacts shall be selected. Any impacts that cannot be avoided shall be
              fully mitigated, with priority given to onsite mitigation. Offsite mitigation measures
              shall only be approved when it is not feasible to fully mitigate impacts on site. If
              impacts to onsite ESHAs occur in the Coastal Zone, any offsite mitigation area shall
              also be located within the Coastal Zone. All mitigation sites shall be monitored for a
              minimum period of 5 years following completion, with changes made as necessary
              based on annual monitoring reports. Where appropriate, mitigation sites shall be
              subject to deed restrictions. Mitigation sites shall be subject to the protections set
              forth in this plan for the habitat type unless the City has made a specific
              determination that the mitigation is unsuccessful and is to be discontinued.
CE 1.8        ESHA Buffers. [GP/CP] Development adjacent to an ESHA shall minimize impacts
              to habitat values or sensitive species to the maximum extent feasible. Native
              vegetation shall be provided in buffer areas to serve as transitional habitat. All
              buffers shall be of a sufficient size to ensure the biological integrity and preservation
              of the ESHA they are designed to protect.
CE 1.9        Standards Applicable to Development Projects. [GP/CP] The following standards
              shall apply to consideration of developments within or adjacent to ESHAs:
              a. Site designs shall preserve wildlife corridors or habitat networks. Corridors shall
                   be of sufficient width to protect habitat and dispersal zones for small mammals,
                   amphibians, reptiles, and birds.
              b. Land divisions for parcels within or adjacent to an ESHA shall only be allowed if
                   each new lot being created, except for open space lots, is capable of being
                   developed without building in any ESHA or ESHA buffer and without any need for
                   impacts to ESHAs related to fuel modification for fire safety purposes.
              c. Site plans and landscaping shall be designed to protect ESHAs. Landscaping,
                   screening, or vegetated buffers shall retain, salvage, and/or reestablish
                   vegetation that supports wildlife habitat whenever feasible. Development within
                   or adjacent to wildlife habitat networks shall incorporate design techniques that
                   protect, support, and enhance wildlife habitat values. Planting of nonnative,
                   invasive species shall not be allowed in ESHAs and buffer areas adjacent to
                   ESHAs.
              d. All new development shall be sited and designed so as to minimize grading,
                   alteration of natural landforms and physical features, and vegetation clearance in
                   order to reduce or avoid soil erosion, creek siltation, increased runoff, and
                   reduced infiltration of stormwater and to prevent net increases in baseline flows
                   for any receiving water body.

              e. Light and glare from new development shall be controlled and directed away
                   from wildlife habitats. Exterior night lighting shall be minimized, restricted to low
                   intensity fixtures, shielded, and directed away from ESHAs.
              f.   All new development should minimize potentially significant noise impacts on
                   special-status species in adjacent ESHAs.
              g. All new development shall be
                   sited and designed to minimize
                   the need for fuel modification,
                   or weed abatement, for fire
                   safety in order to preserve
                   native and/or nonnative
                   supporting habitats.
                   Development shall use fire-
                   resistant materials and
                   incorporate alternative
                   measures, such as firewalls
                   and landscaping techniques,
                   that will reduce or avoid fuel
                   modification activities.
              h. The timing of grading and                            Tecolote Creek Lagoon
                   construction activities shall be
                   controlled to minimize potential disruption of wildlife during critical time periods
                   such as nesting or breeding seasons.
              i.   Grading, earthmoving, and vegetation clearance adjacent to an ESHA shall be
                   prohibited during the rainy season, generally from November 1 to March 31,
                   except as follows: 1) where erosion control measures such as sediment basins,
                   silt fencing, sandbagging, or installation of geofabrics have been incorporated
                   into the project and approved in advance by the City; 2) where necessary to
                   protect or enhance the ESHA itself; or 3) where necessary to remediate
                   hazardous flooding or geologic conditions that endanger public health and safety.
              j.   In areas that are not adjacent to ESHAs, where grading may be allowed during
                   the rainy season, erosion control measures such as sediment basins, silt fencing,
                   sandbagging, and installation of geofabrics shall be implemented prior to and
                   concurrent with all grading operations. (Amended by Reso. 09-59, 11/17/09)
CE 1.10       Management of ESHAs. [GP/CP] The following standards shall apply to the
              ongoing management of ESHAs:
              a. The use of insecticides, herbicides, artificial fertilizers, or other toxic chemical
                   substances that have the potential to degrade ESHAs shall be prohibited within
                   and adjacent to such areas, except where necessary to protect or enhance the
                   ESHA itself.
              b. The use of insecticides, herbicides, or other toxic substances by City employees
                   and contractors in construction and maintenance of City facilities and open space
                   lands shall be minimized.
              c. Mosquito abatement within or adjacent to ESHAs shall be limited to the
                   implementation of the minimum measures necessary to protect human health

                   and shall be undertaken in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts to the
                   ESHAs.
              d. Weed abatement and brush-clearing activities for fire safety purposes shall be
                   the minimum that is necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. Techniques
                   shall be limited to mowing and other low-impact methods such as hand crews for
                   brushing, tarping, and hot water/foam for weed control. Disking shall be
                   prohibited.
              e. Where there are feasible alternatives, existing sewer lines and other utilities that
                   are located within an ESHA shall be taken out of service, abandoned in place,
                   and replaced by facilities located outside the ESHA to avoid degradation of the
                   ESHA resources, which could be caused by pipeline rupture or leakage and by
                   routine maintenance practices such as clearing of vegetation.
              f. Removal of nonnative invasive plant species within ESHAs may be allowed and
                   encouraged, unless the nonnatives contribute to habitat values.
              g. The following flood management activities may be allowed in creek and creek
                   protection areas: desilting, obstruction clearance, minor vegetation removal, and
                   similar flood management methods.
Policy CE 2: Protection of Creeks and Riparian Areas [GP/CP]
Objective: Enhance, maintain, and restore the biological integrity of creek courses and their
associated wetlands and riparian habitats as important natural features of Goleta’s landscape.
CE 2.1        Designation of Protected Creeks. [GP/CP] The provisions of this policy shall apply
              to creeks shown in Figure 4-1. These watercourses and their associated riparian
              areas are defined as ESHAs. They serve as habitat for fish and wildlife, provide
              wildlife movement corridors, provide for the flow of stormwater runoff and
              floodwaters, and furnish open space and passive recreational areas for city
              residents.
CE 2.2        Streamside Protection Areas. [GP/CP] A streamside protection area (SPA) is
              hereby established along both sides of the creeks identified in Figure 4-1. The
              purpose of the designation shall be to preserve the SPA in a natural state in order to
              protect the associated riparian habitats and ecosystems. The SPA shall include the
              creek channel, wetlands and/or riparian vegetation related to the creek hydrology,
              and an adjacent upland buffer area. The width of the SPA upland buffer shall be as
              follows:
              a. The SPA upland buffer shall be 100 feet outward on both sides of the creek,
                   measured from the top of the bank or the outer limit of wetlands and/or riparian
                   vegetation, whichever is greater. The City may consider increasing or decreasing
                   the width of the SPA upland buffer on a case-by-case basis at the time of
                   environmental review. The City may allow portions of a SPA upland buffer to be
                   less than 100 feet wide, but not less than 25 feet wide, based on a site specific
                   assessment if (1) there is no feasible alternative siting for development that will
                   avoid the SPA upland buffer; and (2) the project’s impacts will not have
                   significant adverse effects on streamside vegetation or the biotic quality of the
                   stream.
              b. If the provisions above would result in any legal parcel created prior to the date of
                   this plan being made unusable in its entirety for any purpose allowed by the land-
                   use plan, exceptions to the foregoing may be made to allow a reasonable

CE 2.3        Allowable Uses and Activities in Streamside Protection Areas. [GP/CP] The
              following compatible land uses and activities may be allowed in SPAs, subject to all
              other policies of this plan, including those requiring avoidance or mitigation of
              impacts:
              a. Agricultural operations, provided they are compatible with preservation of riparian
                   resources.
              b. Fencing and other access barriers along property boundaries and along SPA
                   boundaries.
              c. Maintenance of existing roads, driveways, utilities, structures, and drainage
                   improvements.
              d. Construction of public road crossings and utilities, provided that there is no
                   feasible, less environmentally damaging alternative.
              e. Construction and maintenance of foot trails, bicycle paths, and similar low-impact
                   facilities for public access.
              f.   Resource restoration or enhancement projects.
              g. Nature education and research activities.
              h. Low-impact interpretive and public access signage.
              i.   Other such Public Works projects as identified in the Capital Improvement Plan,
                   only where there are no feasible, less environmentally damaging alternatives.
                   (Amended by Reso. 09-59, 11/17/09)
CE 2.4        Dedication of Easements or Other Property Interests. [GP/CP] In new
              subdivisions of land, SPAs shall not be included in developable lots but shall be
              within a separate parcel or parcels, unless the subdivider demonstrates that it is not
              feasible to create a separate open space lot for the SPA. An easement or deed
              restriction limiting the uses allowed on the open space lot to those set forth in CE 2.3
              shall be required. Dedication of the open space lot or easement area to the City or a
              nonprofit land trust is encouraged.
CE 2.5        Maintenance of Creeks as Natural Drainage Systems. [GP/CP] Creek banks,
              creek channels, and associated riparian areas shall be maintained or restored to
              their natural condition wherever such conditions or opportunities exist. Creeks carry
              a significant amount of Goleta’s stormwater flows. The following standards shall
              apply:
              a. The capacity of natural drainage courses shall not be diminished by development
                   or other activities.
              b. Drainage controls and improvements shall be accomplished with the minimum
                   vegetation removal and disruption of the creek and riparian ecosystem that is
                   necessary to accomplish the drainage objective.
              c. Measures to stabilize creek banks, improve flow capacity, and reduce flooding
                   are allowed but shall not include installation of new concrete channels, culverts,
                   or pipes except at street crossings, unless it is demonstrated that there is no
                   feasible alternative for improving capacity.

              d. Drainage controls in new development shall be required to minimize erosion,
                   sedimentation, and flood impacts to creeks. Onsite treatment of stormwater
                   through retention basins, infiltration, vegetated swales, and other best
                   management practices (BMPs) shall be required in order to protect water quality
                   and the biological functions of creek ecosystems.
              e. Alteration of creeks for the purpose of road or driveway crossings shall be
                   prohibited except where the alteration is not substantial and there is no other
                   feasible alternative to provide access to new development on an existing legal
                   parcel. Creek crossings shall be accomplished by bridging and shall be designed
                   to allow the passage of fish and wildlife. Bridge abutments or piers shall be
                   located outside creek beds and banks, unless an environmentally superior
                   alternative exists. (Amended by Reso. 09-59, 11/17/09)
CE 2.6        Restoration of Degraded Creeks. [GP/CP] Segments of several creeks in Goleta
              have been covered or channelized by concrete culverts, causing degradation of the
              creek ecosystem. Restoration activities for improving degraded creek resources shall
              include the following:
              a. Channelized creek segments and culverts shall be evaluated and removed to
                   restore natural channel bed and bank, where feasible.
              b. Creek courses in public rights-of-way shall be uncovered as part of public works
                   improvement projects.
              c. Barriers that prevent migration of fish such as anadromous salmonids from
                   reaching their critical habitat shall be removed or modified.
              d. Restoration of native riparian vegetation and removal of exotic plant species shall
                   be implemented, unless such plants provide critical habitat for monarch
                   butterflies, raptors, or other protected animals.
              e. Creek rehabilitation projects shall be designed to maintain or improve flow
                   capacity, trap sediments and other pollutants that decrease water quality,
                   minimize channel erosion, prevent new sources of pollutants from entering the
                   creek, and enhance in-creek and riparian habitat.
              f.   The use of closed-pipe drainage systems for fish-bearing creeks shall be
                   prohibited unless there is no feasible, less environmentally damaging alternative.
                   When the use of culverts is necessary, the culverts shall be oversized and have
                   gravel bottoms that maintain the channel's width and grade.
Policy CE 3: Protection of Wetlands [GP/CP]
Objective: To preserve, protect, and enhance the functions and values of Goleta’s wetlands.
CE 3.1        Definition of Wetlands. [GP/CP] Wetlands are defined as any area that meets the
              definition of a wetland as defined by the California Coastal Commission, California
              Department of Fish and Game, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The most
              protective of definitions shall be applied and used to determine the boundary of a
              wetland. The City of Goleta uses the identification of a single indicator (soil,

CE 3.2        Designation of Wetland ESHAs. [GP/CP] Wetland ESHAs are included on Figure
              4-1. In the Coastal Zone, wetlands are lands that may be covered periodically or
              permanently with shallow water and include saltwater marshes, freshwater marshes,
              open or closed brackish water marshes, swamps, mudflats, and fens. Goleta’s
              wetlands are associated with small lagoons at the mouths of Bell Canyon and
              Tecolote Creeks, vernal pools, and freshwater marshes and ponds or
              impoundments, such as Lake Los Carneros. All wetlands are defined as ESHAs. Any
              unmapped areas that meet the criteria identified in CE 3.1 are wetlands and shall be
              granted all of the protections for wetlands set forth in this plan.
CE 3.3        Site-Specific Wetland Delineations. [GP/CP] In considering development
              proposals where an initial site inventory or reconnaissance indicates the presence or
              potential for wetland species or indicators, the City shall require the submittal of a
              detailed biological study of the site, with the addition of a delineation of all wetland
              areas on the project site. Wetland delineations shall be based on the definitions
              contained in Section 13577(b) of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations. A
              preponderance of hydric soils or a preponderance of wetland indicator species will
              be considered presumptive evidence of wetland conditions. At a minimum, the
              delineation report shall contain:
              a. A map at a scale of 1”:200’ or larger showing topographic contours.
              b. An aerial photo base map.
              c. A map at a scale of 1”:200’ or larger with polygons delineating all wetland areas,
                   polygons delineating all areas of vegetation with a preponderance of wetland
                   indicator species, and the locations of sampling points.
              d. A description of the survey methods and surface indicators used for delineating
                   the wetland polygons.
              e. A statement of the qualifications of the person preparing the wetland delineation.
CE 3.4        Protection of Wetlands in the Coastal Zone. [CP] The biological productivity and
              the quality of wetlands shall be protected and, where feasible, restored in
              accordance with the federal and state regulations and policies that apply to wetlands
              within the Coastal Zone. Only uses permitted by the regulating agencies shall be
              allowed within wetlands. The filling, diking, or dredging of open coastal waters,
              wetlands, estuaries, and lakes is prohibited unless it can be demonstrated that:
              a. There is no feasible, environmentally less damaging alternative to wetland fill.
              b. The extent of the fill is the least amount necessary to allow development of the
                   permitted use.
              c. Mitigation measures have been provided to minimize adverse environmental
                   effects.
              d. The purposes of the fill are limited to: incidental public services, such as burying
                   cables or pipes; restoration of wetlands; and nature study, education, or similar
                   resource-dependent activities.
              A wetland buffer of a sufficient size to ensure the biological integrity and preservation
              of the wetland shall be required. Generally the required buffer shall be 100 feet, but
              in no case shall wetland buffers be less than 50 feet. The buffer size should take into

              features such as topography, the functions and values of the wetland, and the need
              for upland transitional habitat. A 100-foot minimum buffer area shall not be reduced
              when it serves the functions and values of slowing and absorbing flood waters for
              flood and erosion control, sediment filtration, water purification, and ground water
              recharge. The buffer area shall serve as transitional habitat with native vegetation

CE 3.5        Protection of Wetlands Outside the Coastal Zone. [GP] The biological
              productivity and the quality of inland wetlands shall be protected and, where feasible,
              restored. The filling of wetlands outside the Coastal Zone is prohibited unless it can
              be demonstrated that:
              a. The wetland area is small, isolated, not part of a larger hydrologic system, and
                   generally lacks productive or functional habitat value.
              b. The extent of the fill is the least amount necessary to allow reasonable
                   development of a use allowed by the Land Use Element.
              c. Mitigation measures will be provided to minimize adverse environmental effects,
                   including restoration or enhancement of habitat values of wetlands at another
                   location on the site or at another appropriate offsite location within the City.
              A wetland buffer of a sufficient size to ensure the biological integrity and preservation
              of the wetland shall be required. A wetland buffer shall be no less than 50 feet. The
              buffer size should take into consideration the type and size of the development, the
              sensitivity of the wetland resources to detrimental edge effects of the development to
              the resources, natural features such as topography, the functions and values of the
              wetland and the need for upland transitional habitat. The buffer area shall serve as
              transitional habitat with native vegetation and shall provide physical barriers to

CE 3.6        Mitigation of Wetland Fill. [GP/CP] Where any dike or fill development is permitted
              in wetlands in accordance with the Coastal Act and the policies of this plan, at a
              minimum mitigation measures shall include creation or substantial restoration of
              wetlands of a similar type. Adverse impacts shall be mitigated at a ratio of 3:1 unless
              the project proponent provides evidence that the creation or restoration of a lesser
              area of wetlands will fully mitigate the adverse impacts of the fill. However, in no
              event shall the mitigation ratio be less than 2:1. All mitigation measures are subject

              Vernal pools, an especially rare
              wetland habitat on the south coast
              of Santa Barbara County, shall be

              pools in Goleta, which are
              generally small in area and only a
              few inches deep, are found at
              scattered locations on the City-
              owned Ellwood Mesa and Santa

              altered hydrology. Trails on these                Vernal Pool on Ellwood Mesa
              two properties shall be sited and
              constructed in a manner that avoids impacts to vernal pool hydrology and that will
              allow restoration by removing several informal trail segments that bisect vernal pool
              habitats. Additional vernal pools are found at Lake Los Carneros Natural and

Policy CE 4: Protection of Monarch Butterfly Habitat Areas [GP/CP]
Objective: To preserve, protect, and enhance habitats for monarch butterflies in Goleta,
including existing and historical autumnal and winter roost or aggregation sites, and promote the
long-term stability of over-wintering butterfly populations.
CE 4.1        Definition of Habitat Area. [GP/CP] The monarch butterfly is recognized as a
              California and Goleta special resource. Although the species is not threatened with
              extinction, its autumnal and winter aggregation sites, or roosts, are especially
              vulnerable to disturbance. Sites that provide the key elements essential for
              successful monarch butterfly aggregation areas and are locations where monarchs
              have been historically present shall be considered ESHAs. These elements include
              stands of eucalyptus or other suitable trees that offer shelter from strong winds and
              storms, provide a microclimate with adequate sunlight, are situated near a source of
              water or moisture, and that provide a source of nectar to nourish the butterflies.
CE 4.2        Designation of Monarch                                  Monarch butterflies migrate up to

              as ESHAs. These include about                           wintering site in southern California
              20 known roosts, eight of which                         with approximately 55,000 monarchs
              comprise the Ellwood Complex, a                         identified in January 2006.
              series of sites within a network
              consisting of eucalyptus groves and windrows interspersed by open fields and
              crossed by small creeks. This network includes several separate but interconnected
              autumnal and winter roost sites. The Ellwood Main site, the largest roost in Santa
              Barbara County and one of the largest in the state, occupies a site along Devereux
              Creek in the Sperling Preserve, a City-owned tract situated near the coastal bluffs in
              western Goleta.

CE 4.3        Site-Specific Studies and Unmapped Monarch ESHAs. [GP/CP] Any area not
              designated on Figure 4-1 that is determined by a site-specific study to contain
              monarch habitats, including autumnal and winter roost sites, shall be granted the
              same protections as if the area was shown on the figure. Proposals for development
              on sites shown on this figure or where there is probable cause to believe that
              monarch habitats may exist shall be required to provide a site-specific study.
CE 4.4        Protection of Monarch Butterfly ESHAs. [GP/CP] Monarch butterfly ESHAs shall
              be protected against significant disruption of habitat values, and only uses or
              development dependent on and compatible with maintaining such resources shall be
              allowed within these ESHAs or their buffer areas. The following standards shall
              apply:
              a. No development, except as otherwise allowed by this policy, shall be allowed
                   within monarch butterfly ESHAs or ESHA buffers.
              b. Since the specific locations of aggregation sites may vary from one year to the
                   next, the focus of protection shall be the entire grove of trees rather than
                   individual trees that are the location of the roost.
              c. Removal of vegetation within monarch ESHAs shall be prohibited, except for
                   minor pruning of trees or removal of dead trees and debris that are a threat to
                   public safety.
              d. Public accessways are considered resource-dependent uses and may be located
                   within a monarch ESHA or its buffer; however, such accessways shall be sited to
                   avoid or minimize impacts to aggregation sites.
              e. Interpretative signage is allowed within a monarch ESHA or its buffer, but shall
                   be designed to be visually unobtrusive.
              f.   Butterfly research, including tree disturbance or other invasive methods, may be
                   allowed subject to City approval of a permit.

              and historic roost sites as
              measured from the outer extent of
              the tree canopy. The buffer area
              shall serve as transitional habitat
              with native vegetation and shall
              provide physical barriers to human intrusion. The buffer may be reduced to 50 feet in
              circumstances where the trees contribute to the habitat but are not considered likely
              to function as an aggregation site, such as along narrow windrows. Grading and
              other activities that could alter the surface hydrology that sustains the groves of trees
              are prohibited within or adjacent to the buffer area.

              [GP/CP] The following standards shall apply to consideration of proposals for new
              development adjacent to monarch ESHAs or ESHA buffers:
              a. A site-specific biological study, prepared by an expert approved by the City who
                   is qualified by virtue of education and experience in the study of monarch
                   butterflies, shall be required to be submitted by the project proponent.
              b. The study shall include preparation of a Monarch Butterfly Habitat Protection
                   Plan, which at a minimum shall include: 1) the mapped location of the cluster of
                   trees where monarchs are known, or have been known, to roost in both autumnal
                   and over-wintering aggregations; 2) an estimate of the size of the population
                   within the colony; 3) the mapped extent of the entire habitat area; and 4) the
                   boundaries of the buffer zone around the habitat area.
              c. A temporary fence shall be installed along the outer boundary of the buffer zone
                   prior to and during any grading and construction activities on the site.
              d. If an active roost or aggregation is present on the project site, any construction
                   grading, or other development within 200 feet of the active roost, shall be
                   prohibited between October 1 and March 1.

              the following standards shall
              apply:
              a. For purposes of this policy,
                   existing native grasslands are
                   defined as an area where
                   native grassland species
                   comprise 10 percent or more
                   of the total relative plant cover.

              b. To the maximum extent feasible, development shall avoid impacts to native
                   grasslands that would destroy, isolate, interrupt, or cause a break in continuous
                   habitat that would (1) disrupt associated animal movement patterns and seed
                   dispersal, or (2) increase vulnerability to weed invasions.
              c. Removal or disturbance to a patch of native grasses less than 0.25 acre that is
                   clearly isolated and is not part of a significant native grassland or an integral
                   component of a larger ecosystem may be allowed. Removal or disturbance to
                   restoration areas shall not be allowed.
              d. Impacts to protected native grasslands shall be minimized by providing at least a
                   10-foot buffer that is restored with native species around the perimeter of the
                   delineated native grassland area.
              e. Removal of nonnative and invasive exotic species shall be allowed; revegetation
                   shall be with plants or seeds collected within the same watershed whenever
                   feasible.

                   occurring on exposed coastal bluffs. Example species in bluff scrub habitat
                   include Brewer’s saltbush (Atriplex lentiformis), lemonade berry (Rhus
                   integrifolia), seashore blight (Suaeda californica), seacliff buckwheat (Eriogonum
                   parvifolium), California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), and coyote bush
                   (Baccharis pilularis). Coastal sage scrub is defined as a drought-tolerant,
                   Mediterranean habitat characterized by soft-leaved, shallow-rooted subshrubs
                   such as California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), coyote bush (Baccharis
                   pilularis), and California encelia (Encelia californica). It is found at lower
                   elevations in both coastal and interior areas where moist maritime air penetrates
                   inland. Chaparral is defined as fire- and drought-adapted woody, evergreen
                   shrubs generally occurring on hills and lower mountain slopes. The area must
                   have both the compositional and structural characteristics of coastal bluff scrub,
                   coastal sage scrub, or chaparral habitat as described in Preliminary Descriptions
                   of Terrestrial Natural Communities of California (Holland 1986) or other
                   classification system recognized by the California Department of Fish and Game.
              b. To the maximum extent feasible, development shall avoid impacts to coastal bluff
                   scrub, coastal sage scrub, or chaparral habitat that is part of a wildlife movement
                   corridor and the impact would preclude animal movement or isolate ESHAs
                   previously connected by the corridor such as (1) disrupting associated bird and
                   animal movement patterns and seed dispersal, and/or (2) increasing erosion and
                   sedimentation impacts to nearby creeks or drainages.
              c. Impacts to coastal bluff scrub, coastal sage scrub, and chaparral ESHAs shall be
                   minimized by providing at least a 25-foot buffer restored with native species
                   around the perimeter of the ESHA, unless the activity is allowed under other CE
                   subpolicies and mitigation is applied per CE 1.7.
              d. Removal of nonnative and invasive exotic species shall be allowed; revegetation
                   shall be with plants or seeds collected within the same watershed whenever
                   feasible. (Amended by Reso. 09-59, 11/17/09)

              native trees cannot be avoided through the implementation of project alternatives or
              where development encroaches into the protected zone and could threaten the
              continued viability of the tree(s), mitigation measures shall include, at a minimum, the
              planting of replacement trees on site, if suitable area exists on the subject site, or
              offsite if suitable onsite area is unavailable, consistent with the Tree Protection
              Ordinance (see also CE-IA-4). The Tree Protection Ordinance shall establish the
              mitigation ratios for replacement trees for every tree removed. Where onsite
              mitigation is not feasible, offsite mitigation shall be provided by planting of
              replacement trees at a site within the same watershed. If the tree removal occurs at
              a site within the Coastal Zone, any offsite mitigation area shall also be located within
              the Coastal Zone. Minimum sizes for various species of replacement trees shall be
              established in the Tree Protection Ordinance. Mitigation sites shall be monitored for
              a period of 5 years. The City may require replanting of trees that do not survive.

Policy CE 14: Preservation and Enhancement of Urban Forest [GP]
Objective: To protect, preserve, and enhance Goleta’s urban forest for its aesthetic, visual, and
environmental benefits to the community.
CE 14.1       Definition of Urban Forest. [GP] Goleta’s urban forest consists of all public and
              private trees, which include the street tree system, trees on parks and other public
              lands, trees on private properties throughout the city, and others.
CE 14.2       Public Urban Forest Management. [GP] Urban forests are recognized as a
              resource created and sustained for people. The urban forest is different from
              wildland forests in that it requires a higher level of management. The City considers
              the urban forest a valuable resource. As of 2005, it was estimated that the total
              number of trees situated within city street rights-of-way was about 7,500. The public
              portion of the urban forest shall be protected, preserved, and enhanced to:
              a. Provide an appropriate shade canopy for each of the various types of land uses
                   so that the average total canopy will increase over time.
              b. Provide for a tree population of mixed ages, diverse species, and appropriate mix
                   of tree types (evergreen and deciduous; native and nonnative in non-ESHA
                   areas) in order to support a diverse forest ecosystem able to adapt to changing
                   environmental pressures such as disease, pest infestation, and climate change.
              c. Maximize availability of planting spaces.
              d. Survive within the limitations of the existing resources with minimal maintenance
                   once establishment occurs.
              e. Recognize that the maximum environmental benefit, such as those related to air
                   quality, storm water runoff, and shade, occurs as trees reach maturity.
CE 14.3       Tree Species List. [GP] The City shall prepare and maintain an official public tree
              species list and apply it, as appropriate, to streets, parks, and other public areas.
CE 14.4       Conservation of Trees on Public Property. [GP] Trees on City property, including
              street rights-of-way, are valuable resources that will not generally be added to,
              removed, or substantially altered without City authorization.
CE 14. 5      Public Urban Forest Master Plan. [GP] The City may develop and maintain an
              Urban Forest Master Plan that describes and maps the resource, provides a vision
              statement, establishes measurable urban forest management goals and
              performance standards, presents a timeline for managing the Goleta urban forest,
              and includes any additional information that the City determines is appropriate.
September 2006                                                                                          4-34

              program to educate property owners on the benefits of and responsibilities for the
              care of Goleta’s urban forest.
CE 14. 7      Ordinance Standards. [GP] The City will consider an ordinance to strengthen
              standards for trees in streets, medians, parkways, parks, or open space; heritage
              and native trees where they occur in an urban setting; parking lot shade; tree
              replacement; heat island mitigation; and anti-topping. The ordinance may establish
              an advisory committee and define its roles and responsibilities. The Urban Forest
              Ordinance shall be designed with the intention to meet the requirements to obtain
              Tree City USA status.

         items relate to identified fire and geologic hazards.
Coastal hazards such as bluff retreat and shoreline erosion are also addressed in this element,
as are hazards associated with oil and gas production, processing, and transport.
California Coastal Act Requirements [CP]
The California Coastal Act (Coastal Act) requires new development to be sited and designed to
minimize risks, ensure stability and structural integrity, and neither create nor contribute
significantly to erosion or require the construction of new shoreline protective devices that would
substantially alter natural landforms along coastal bluffs and cliffs. Section 30235 of the Public
Resources Code allows the construction of shoreline protective devices where existing
development is threatened by erosion and when designed to eliminate or mitigate impacts on
shoreline sand supply. The Coastal Act provides that development damaged or destroyed by
natural disaster can be rebuilt in the same location and is exempt from the requirements for a
coastal development permit under certain circumstances. It also provides standards for oil and
gas development in the Coastal Zone. Appropriate oil spill prevention and response measures
are required, and a number of policies require adverse environmental impacts to be minimized.

Coastal Hazards
Bluff Erosion and Retreat: Much of Goleta’s
coastline is characterized by sea cliffs and
coastal bluffs, with typical heights of 50 to 70
feet. Sea cliffs are susceptible to periodic
failure and erosion when wave action
undermines the toe of the cliff. This sea cliff
retreat occurs episodically, with a lateral loss
of several feet or tens of feet resulting from a
single collapse, followed by years of relative
stability. Average cliff retreat rates are
primarily dependent on oceanographic
exposure and cliff composition, with certain                   Coastal Bluff at Ellwood Mesa
types of rocks and sediments more resistant
to weathering and erosion than others.
Surface drainage and saturated soils also contribute to bluff failure. Shoreline change studies
have documented average, long-term rates of sea cliff retreat of 0.45 to 0.62 foot per year for
the Ellwood Mesa area (Hoover & Associates 1998), and rates of 0.3 to 1.3 feet per year for the
cliffs along Isla Vista to the east of Goleta’s coastline (Sylvester 2005). Areas subject to cliff
retreat are among the areas depicted as having a high landslide potential on Figure 5-1.
Beach Erosion and Other Shoreline Hazards: Beaches and shoreline areas are dynamic
features that continually adjust to changing oceanography and climatic conditions. Beaches will
erode—laterally in the form of shoreline retreat, and vertically by deflation or scour—during
high-wave events such as storms and also in response to seasonal changes in wave
characteristics. Heavy surf seasons associated with the El Niño storms in 1982 to 1983 and
1997 to 1998 resulted in considerable beach erosion and the complete loss of bluff-fronting
dunes, although much of Goleta’s coastline has recovered since that time. In general, beaches
in southern Santa Barbara County tend to be wider and have higher elevations during the
summer, and narrower and lower during the winter.
Beach scour, or vertical beach erosion, can expose previously buried hazards, such as
remnants of piers and oil and gas wells. While attempts to remove these structures were made
at the time of their demolition or abandonment, removal often consisted of mechanically cutting

pilings and caissons at some level (1 to 3 feet, typically) below the sand level. Removal down to
bedrock was rarely achieved, and subsequent beach erosion and scour periodically has
exposed these remnants. As these remnants are usually iron or concrete and can be partially or
fully submerged, they pose a hazard to beach users, swimmers, and surfers.
Seismic and Seismically Induced Hazards
Ground Shaking: Goleta, like much of California, is in an area prone to earthquakes. In
general, the closer an earthquake’s epicenter and the larger the magnitude of the event, the
higher the likelihood of strong ground shaking. California Building Code requirements set forth
the minimum design and construction standards for structures to resist seismic forces.
Nevertheless, strong ground shaking can crack the foundation and walls of buildings, damage
roads, power lines, pipelines, and other infrastructure, and cause injuries and deaths. Un-
reinforced brick masonry structures are particularly susceptible to damage or collapse.
Surface Rupture: A fault surface rupture is         The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act

structures. Surface rupture or displacement
along city streets and highways can interfere with traffic flow and present constraints on
emergency access. Faults near or within Goleta include the More Ranch Fault, the Glen Annie
Fault, and the Carneros Fault (see Figure 5-1). None of these faults are classified as active by
the State Division of Mines and Geology or subject to an Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone.
However, according to the Santa Barbara County Seismic Safety and Safety Element (SSSE),
the More Ranch Fault is considered active based on the existence of a geologically recent fault
scarp (County of Santa Barbara 1991).
Liquefaction and Seismic Settlement: Liquefaction is the sudden loss of soil strength due to a
rapid increase in soil pore water pressures resulting from ground shaking during an earthquake.
Seismic settlement is the reduction of volume within a saturated or unsaturated soil mass due to
ground shaking during a seismic event. Seismic settlement may occur simultaneously or
independent of liquefaction. Either of these events can result in the severe damage to building
foundations and in slope failure. The areas most vulnerable to liquefaction and seismic
settlement are underlain by younger alluvium where groundwater and granular sediments are
both present. These areas include low-lying lands adjacent to rivers, creeks, beaches, and
estuaries. The current California Building Code requires that the potential for liquefaction be
assessed for the design of all structures.
Tsunami: Tsunamis impinging upon land can reach heights of 50 to 100 feet in some areas of
the world, although a wave of this size would not be expected to occur in the Goleta area.
Tsunami run-up and the extent of inland flooding depend on the individual triggering event, the
orientation of the coast, offshore bathymetry, and onshore topography. In general, low-lying
shoreline areas, and areas adjacent to sloughs and coastal streams, are most susceptible to
tsunami hazards. Areas subject to potential tsunami run-up are depicted schematically on
Figure 5-2. Santa Barbara County’s SSSE considers a 10-foot high sea wave as being more
probable in the area and recommends that a contour elevation of 40 feet be used in planning as
the tsunami risk limit (Goleta Community Plan Final EIR, August 1992).
September 2006                                                                                             5-3

Soil Stability Hazards
Expansive Soils: Expansive soils have a high shrink/swell potential. Clay minerals in these
soils expand when moisture content increases and shrink when moisture content decreases.
These volume changes are significant enough to move structures built upon such soils.
Shrink/swell potential is site-specific to a degree that a given construction site or building pad
may be subject to differential heave and settlement. Hazards related to building on sites
characterized by expansive soils are primarily associated with damage to foundations, walls,
and buried utilities. Soils deriving from the Rincon and Monterey Formations are associated with
high shrink/swell potentials (County of Santa Barbara 1991).
Compressible and Collapsible Soils: Compressible and collapsible soils are those soils
subject to settlement and subsidence because of either low soil strength or high and unstable
porosity. Subsidence can also occur from excessive extraction of groundwater. Neither
compressible soils nor collapsible soils are capable of supporting heavy loads, and damage to
structures is possible without the implementation of standard geotechnical practices.
Landslides: Slope-failure hazards such as landslides and rockfalls are generally confined to
areas with steep (greater than 25-percent) slopes and unstable soils. Areas within Goleta that
may be susceptible to slope failure include coastal bluffs, steep stream banks, railroad and road
cuts, and areas north of Cathedral Oaks Road with steep ground slopes (see Figure 5-1). The
Rincon geologic formation is susceptible to landslides, but outcrops of this formation are limited
to portions of northwestern and northeastern Goleta.
Radon Hazards
Certain geologic formations may contain minerals that produce radon gas. Radon-222 is a
naturally occurring, colorless, and odorless gas that is radioactive. Because of its radioactivity,
radon levels in excess of 4.0 picocuries per liter are considered hazardous by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and require radon reduction measures. Radon gas is
associated with the Rincon formation, and areas subject to moderate and high potential for
radon gas levels exceeding 4.0 picocuries per liter occur where the Rincon Formation is at or
close to the ground surface. These areas are generally located in the portions of the City along
and north of Cathedral Oaks Road.

it includes two of the city’s three major commercial areas: the Calle Real Center and the Goleta
Old Town area.
Urban and Wildland Fire Hazards
Urban fires pose a potential risk to structures in any city. In addition, certain areas within Goleta
have been designated as high wildland fire hazard areas, including areas north of Cathedral
Oaks Road, portions of the Winchester Commons subdivision, and the Bacara Resort property.
Areas susceptible to high-fire hazards generally include lands with steep slopes and ample
vegetation, or fuel load. The Santa Barbara County Fire Department provides Goleta with fire
suppression and fire prevention services and has established standards for building and
development review to minimize fire hazards and provide for adequate fire suppression.
Standards for peak-load water supply require that adequate water flow be available for effective
fire suppression. The minimum required firewater flow depends on the type of building
construction, the proximity of adjacent structures, and presence or absence of fire walls and
other fire protection devices. Minimum required firewater flow standards are specified in the
Uniform Fire Code, and the Santa Barbara County Fire Department reviews development to
ensure compliance.
Oil and Gas Production, Processing, and Transport Hazards
Processing Facilities: One major oil and
gas production and processing facility, the
Venoco Ellwood Onshore Oil and Gas
Processing Facility (EOF), is located within
the city’s boundaries (Figure 5-3). Owned by
Venoco, Inc., the EOF is located on a 4.46-
acre parcel near the western end of Goleta.
The plant treats crude oil and gas produced
from Platform Holly, which is located
approximately 2.5 miles offshore. Processes
at the EOF include the separation of oil and
water, treatment of oil to reduce hydrogen
sulfide (H2S) content, separation and storage
of lighter-end hydrocarbons such as liquefied        Venoco Ellwood Onshore Oil and Gas Processing
                                                                          Facility
petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas liquids
(NGL), treatment and discharge of produced
water, and the conversion of raw, sour (H2S-rich) gas to sweet (low-H2S) sales-grade natural
gas. Elemental sulfur, a product of the H2S removal processes, is also produced at the EOF
and sold primarily for use in fertilizers.
The potential hazardous effects to land uses located near the EOF would be from toxicity of a
catastrophic H2S release from a major plant upset, fires from different hydrocarbon streams
released under different scenarios, and explosions from vapor clouds or boiling liquid expanding
vapor. H2S is a toxic material with the potential to cause human fatalities given sufficient
exposure duration and concentration. Less severe hazards include the risk of a trucking
accident and subsequent release of hazardous materials from one of the trucks transporting
NGL, LPG, or sulfur cake. As a result of a quantitative risk analysis in 2000, Venoco was
required to implement—and has completed—a number of risk-reduction measures. Notably
among these safety improvements were improved fire suppression measures in the LPG and
NGL tank areas and the installation of a H2S siren that would sound in the event of a

catastrophic release of H2S. The implementation of these measures has substantially reduced
the hazard posed by this facility, but a plant upset is still possible.
Oil and Gas Pipelines: Natural gas pipelines operating outside of industrial facilities and public
works facilities are located in most city rights-of-way. Oil pipelines are less common but are also
typically located within city rights-of-way. These pipelines are regulated by the U.S. Department
of Transportation and the California Public Utilities Commission. In part because of regulatory
oversight, oil and gas pipelines within the city are not subject to frequent leaks. However, Third-
party damage to pipelines remains a major cause of pipeline leaks, and third-party-caused gas
leaks can result in an explosion. Local governments, unless preempted by state or federal law,
can establish standards and policies related to development in proximity to gas pipelines.
Airport-Related Hazards
The Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, while            Santa Barbara Municipal Airport
part of the city of Santa Barbara, is located         The Santa Barbara Municipal Airport is the busiest
near the geographical center of Goleta (see           commercial service airport on the California coast
Figure 5-3). Almost the entire city of Goleta is      between San Jose and Los Angeles. It served
                                                      approximately 853,000 passengers in 2005.
located within the Airport Influence Area
(AIA). For Goleta, the hazards associated
with airport operations consist primarily of the risk of aircraft accidents in areas outside of the
immediate airport. The risk of accidents is highest during takeoffs and landings, including
approaches and ascents. The Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC), a body within the Santa
Barbara County Association of Governments, participates in the regulation of land use within the
airport’s AIA. The ALUC’s policies and standards for development are contained in the Airport
Land Use Plan (1993). Noise issues associated with the airport are addressed in the Noise
Element.
Transport and Storage of Hazardous Materials
As defined by the State of California, a hazardous material is a substance that is toxic, ignitable
or flammable, or reactive and/or corrosive. Hazardous materials may be used in certain
manufacturing or industrial operations, in construction, and in other land uses such as gas
stations. As a result of the history of industrial and commercial development, several sites within
the city have the potential to have been impacted by previous or current releases of
contaminated materials. The primary concern associated with the release of a hazardous
material is the short- and long-term effects that exposure to a hazardous substance may have
on the public.
Hazardous materials are governed by                   Hazardous Materials Business Plans
regulations that require proper storage,              A Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) is a
handling, employee and public noticing, spill         program that requires a business that handles or
contingency planning,                                 stores certain amounts of hazardous materials to
                                                      prepare a plan, which includes an inventory of
business/environmental management plans,              hazardous materials stored onsite, an emergency
and other emergency response measures                 response plan, and an employee-training program.
necessary to ensure public safety and to
minimize the risk of accidental releases or environmental impacts. In Goleta, the administering
agencies are the Santa Barbara County Fire Prevention Division and the Santa Barbara County
Office of Emergency Services.

Goleta General Plan /Coastal Land Use Plan                                               5.0 Safety Element
In addition to the risks associated with land uses, major transportation corridors are also a
potential source of accidental releases or environmental incidents that could affect various
areas of the city. Transport of hazardous materials in Goleta is most likely to occur along US-
101, State Route 217 (SR-217), Hollister Avenue, and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks (see
Figure 5-3). The California Highway Patrol and the California Department of Transportation
enforce federal and state regulations and respond to incidents associated with transport of
hazardous materials.
Public Safety Concerns
Goleta is a suburban community where the primary policing challenges are theft-related crimes
and traffic enforcement. As of 2005, the City of Goleta Police Department had a staff of 34
deputies, including a full-time patrol contingent that responds to calls for service and engages in
active enforcement and crime prevention. Four deputies were assigned to dedicated traffic unit
that provides in-depth traffic enforcement and accident investigation. A school resource deputy
and gang enforcement deputy provide additional education and enforcement services to the
community. (Refer to the Public Facilities Element for additional information.)
Safe and secure streets are essential to the community’s well being. The proper design and
effective use of the built environment can lead to a reduction in safety fears and a lessening of
crime. Appropriate decisions on the layout of development and components such as street
orientation, the placement of buildings, and clearly defined and visible public spaces can create
a safer environment.
Emergency Preparedness
Effective emergency preparedness is
necessary to avoid or minimize the loss of life
and property as a result of natural and other
disasters, to reduce the social, cultural,
environmental, and economic costs of
disasters, and to assist the rapid recovery
from disasters. The effectiveness of a
community’s emergency preparedness and
response can affect the severity of
consequences of any given disaster event.
The City—in cooperation with FEMA, the
County, and State Offices of Emergency
Services—is responsible for emergency
preparedness and response. Components of
emergency preparedness and response

secondary emergency accesses, as well as
provision of information to the community regarding appropriate individual actions in the event of
various types of emergencies.
5.2      GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND GOALS [GP/CP]
The quality of life in Goleta is directly affected by a sense of security and safety for its residents
and businesses. In order to promote the creation of a safe environment, the General Plan
addresses hazards to public safety that may be found in the city’s natural and built environment.
September 2006                                                                                          5-7

Goleta General Plan /Coastal Land Use Plan                                                 5.0 Safety Element
The following principles or goals, which are not in order of priority, provide the foundation for the
detailed policies in subsequent sections of this element; all policies have been established to be
in conformity with the guiding principles and goals. Future actions of the City following adoption
of the plan are required to be consistent.
1. Ensure that new development is sized, sited, and designed to avoid or minimize exposure to
     known physical or other hazards and that appropriate mitigations are included to reduce or
     avoid risks to people and property.
2. Ensure that new critical facilities (hospitals, schools, communication centers, fire and police
     facilities, power plants, etc.) are located and designed to continue functioning after potential
     earthquakes or other disasters.
3. Minimize exposure to hazardous materials for all residential development through
     consideration of appropriate locations for new residential development as well as potential
     impacts of new or expanded industrial uses.
4. Increase awareness of residents and workers of coastal, geological, industrial, and other
     hazards, as well as appropriate hazard avoidance measures and emergency preparedness.
5. Give priority to hazard avoidance over hazard mitigation, particularly with respect to coastal
     safety hazards, in order to minimize disturbance to environmentally sensitive habitat areas.
6. Maintain a natural Pacific shoreline, allow coastal armoring only in very limited
     circumstances, and maintain natural mechanisms for distribution of shoreline sand supply.
7. Strictly enforce California Building Code compliance to protect building owners and
     occupants and minimize risk of structural damage and economic disruption.
8. Minimize risks posed by oil and gas production, processing, and storage by supporting
     cessation or relocation of hazardous components of this industry and by careful monitoring
     of safety measures and practices.
9. Work cooperatively with federal, state, and county agencies to maintain a high level of
     emergency preparedness and provide effective and efficient emergency response and
     prevention measures.
5.3      COASTAL ACT POLICIES [CP]
The Coastal Act policies set forth below are adopted as policies of this plan for those areas of
Goleta within the California Coastal Zone. The numbers refer to sections of the California Public
Resources Code. The Safety Element maps show the location of the California Coastal Zone
boundary.

              provided for accidental spills that do occur.
30233         (d) Erosion control and flood control facilities constructed on watercourses can
                   impede of sediment and nutrients which would otherwise be carried by storm
                   runoff into coastal waters. To facilitate the continued delivery of these sediments
                   to the littoral zone, whenever feasible, the removed from these facilities may be
                   placed at appropriate points on the shoreline in accordance applicable provisions
                   of this division, where feasible mitigation measures have been provided adverse

                   environmental effects. Aspects that shall be considered before issuing a coastal
                   development permit for such purposes are the method of placement, time of year
                   of placement, and sensitivity placement area.
30235         Revetments, breakwaters, groins, harbor channels, seawalls, cliff retaining walls, and
              other such construction that alters natural shoreline processes shall be permitted
              when required to serve coastal-dependent uses or to protect existing structures or
              public beaches in danger from erosion, and when designed to eliminate or mitigate
              adverse impacts on local shoreline sand supply. Existing marine structures causing
              water stagnation contributing to pollution problems and fish kills should be phased
              out or upgraded where feasible.
30236         Channelizations, dams, or other substantial alterations of rivers and streams shall
              incorporate the best mitigation measures feasible, and be limited to (l) necessary
              water supply projects, (2) flood control projects where no other method for protecting
              existing structures in the floodplain is feasible and where such protection is
              necessary for public safety or to protect existing development, or (3) developments
              where the primary function is the improvement of fish and wildlife habitat.
30250         (b) Where feasible, new hazardous industrial development shall be located away
                   from existing developed areas.
30253         New development shall: (1) Minimize risks to life and property in areas of high
              geologic, flood, and fire hazard. (2) Assure stability and structural integrity, and
              neither create nor contribute significantly to erosion, geologic instability, or
              destruction of the site or surrounding area or in any way require the construction of
              protective devices that would substantially alter natural landforms along bluffs and
              cliffs.
30262         (a) Oil and gas development shall be permitted in accordance with Section 30260, if
                   the following conditions are met:
                   (1) The development is performed safely and consistent with the geologic
                        conditions of the well site.
                   (2) New or expanded facilities related to that development are consolidated, to
                        the maximum extent feasible and legally permissible, unless consolidation will
                        have adverse environmental consequences and will not significantly reduce
                        the number of producing wells, support facilities, or sites required to produce
                        the reservoir economically and with minimal environmental impacts.
                   (3) Environmentally safe and feasible subsea completions are used when drilling
                        platforms or islands would substantially degrade coastal visual qualities
                        unless use of those structures will result in substantially less environmental
                        risks.
                   (4) Platforms or islands will not be sited where a substantial hazard to vessel
                        traffic might result from the facility or related operations, determined in
                        consultation with the United States Coast Guard and the Army Corps of
                        Engineers.

Goleta General Plan /Coastal Land Use Plan                                                       5.0 Safety Element
                   (5) The development will not cause or contribute to subsidence hazards unless it
                        is determined that adequate measures will be undertaken to prevent damage
                        from such subsidence.
                   (6) With respect to new facilities, all oilfield brines are reinjected into oil-
                        producing zones unless the Division of Oil and Gas of the Department of
                        Conservation determines to do so would adversely affect production of the
                        reservoirs and unless injection into other subsurface zones will reduce
                        environmental risks. Exceptions to reinjections will be granted consistent with
                        the Ocean Waters Discharge Plan of the State Water Resources Control
                        Board and where adequate provision is made for the elimination of petroleum
                        odors and water quality problems.
                   (7) (A) All oil produced offshore California shall be transported onshore by
                             pipeline only. The pipelines used to transport this oil shall utilize the best
                             achievable technology to ensure maximum protection of public health and
                             safety and of the integrity and productivity of terrestrial and marine
                             ecosystems.
                        (B) Once oil produced offshore California is onshore, it shall be transported to
                             processing and refining facilities by pipeline.
                        (C) The following guidelines shall be used when applying subparagraphs (A)
                             and (B):
                             (i) "Best achievable technology," means the technology that provides the
                                   greatest degree of protection taking into consideration both of the
                                   following:
                                   (I) Processes that are being developed, or could feasibly be
                                        developed, anywhere in the world, given overall reasonable
                                        expenditures on research and development.
                                   (II) Processes that are currently in use anywhere in the world. This
                                        clause is not intended to create any conflicting or duplicative
                                        regulation of pipelines, including those governing the
                                        transportation of oil produced from onshore reserves.
                             (ii) "Oil" refers to crude oil before it is refined into products, including
                                   gasoline, bunker fuel, lubricants, and asphalt. Crude oil that is
                                   upgraded in quality through residue reduction or other means shall be
                                   transported as provided in subparagraphs (A) and (B).
                             (iii) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall apply only to new or expanded oil
                                   extraction operations. "New extraction operations" means production
                                   of offshore oil from leases that did not exist or had never produced oil,
                                   as of January 1, 2003, or from platforms, drilling island, subsea
                                   completions, or onshore drilling sites, that did not exist as of January
                                   1, 2003. "Expanded oil extraction" means an increase in the
                                   geographic extent of existing leases or units, including lease boundary
                                   adjustments, or an increase in the number of well heads, on or after
                                   January 1, 2003.
                             (iv) For new or expanded oil extraction operations subject to clause (iii), if
                                   the crude oil is so highly viscous that pipelining is determined to be an
                                   infeasible mode of transportation, or where there is no feasible access

                                  to a pipeline, shipment of crude oil may be permitted over land by
                                  other modes of transportation, including trains or trucks, which meet
                                  all applicable rules and regulations, excluding any waterborne mode
                                  of transport.
                   (8) If a state of emergency is declared by the Governor for an emergency that
                        disrupts the transportation of oil by pipeline, oil may be transported by a
                        waterborne vessel, if authorized by permit, in the same manner as required
                        by emergency permits that are issued pursuant to Section 30624.
                   (9) In addition to all other measures that will maximize the protection of marine
                        habitat and environmental quality, when an offshore well is abandoned, the
                        best achievable technology shall be used.
              b) Where appropriate, monitoring programs to record land surface and near-shore
                   ocean floor movements shall be initiated in locations of new large-scale fluid
                   extraction on land or near shore before operations begin and shall continue until
                   surface conditions have stabilized. Costs of monitoring and mitigation programs
                   shall be borne by liquid and gas extraction operators.
              c) Nothing in this section shall affect the activities of any state agency that is
                   responsible for regulating the extraction, production, or transport of oil and gas.
30263         (a) New or expanded refineries or petrochemical facilities not otherwise consistent
                   with the provisions of this division shall be permitted if (1) alternative locations
                   are not feasible or are more environmentally damaging; (2) adverse
                   environmental effects are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible; (3) it is
                   found that not permitting such development would adversely affect the public
                   welfare; (4) the facility is not located in a highly scenic or seismically hazardous
                   area, on any of the Channel Islands, or within or contiguous to environmentally
                   sensitive areas; and (5) the facility is sited so as to provide a sufficient buffer
                   area to minimize adverse impacts on surrounding property.
              (b) New or expanded refineries or petrochemical facilities shall minimize the need for
                   once-through cooling by using air cooling to the maximum extent feasible and by
                   using treated waste waters from inplant processes where feasible.
30265         The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
              (a) Offshore oil production will increase dramatically in the next 10 years from the
                   current 80,000 barrels per day to over 400,000 barrels per day.
              (b) Transportation studies have concluded that pipeline transport of oil is generally
                   both economically feasible and environmentally preferable to other forms of
                   crude oil transport.
              (c) Oil companies have proposed to build a pipeline to transport offshore crude oil
                   from central California to southern California refineries, and to transport offshore
                   oil to out-of-state refiners.
              (d) California refineries would need to be retrofitted if California offshore crude oil
                   were to be used directly as a major feedstock. Refinery modifications may delay
                   achievement of air quality goals in the southern California air basin and other
                   regions of the state.

              (e) The County of Santa Barbara has issued an Oil Transportation Plan which
                   assesses the environmental and economic differences among various methods
                   for transporting crude oil from offshore California to refineries.
              (f) The Governor should help coordinate decisions concerning the transport and
                   refining of offshore oil in a manner which considers state and local studies
                   undertaken to date, which fully addresses the concerns of all affected regions,
                   and which promotes the greatest benefits to the people of the state.
5.4      CITY POLICIES
Policy SE 1: Safety in General [GP/CP]
Objective: To avoid siting of development or land use activities in hazardous areas, and where
this is infeasible, require appropriate mitigation to lessen or minimize exposure to hazards.
SE 1.1        Maintenance of Maps and Resources on Hazards. [GP/CP] The City shall
              maintain and make available to the public maps and resources provided by other
              agencies that depict or describe areas of known safety hazards, including seismic
              and seismically induced hazards, coastal hazards, soil- and slope-related hazards,
              radon hazards, flooding hazards, industrial hazards, and fire hazards. The City shall
              periodically update such maps and resources, as new or refined information
              becomes available.
SE 1.2        Guidelines for Siting Highly Sensitive Uses and Critical Facilities. [GP/CP] In
              accord with the Land Use Element, the City shall discourage essential services
              buildings and other highly sensitive uses in areas subject to safety hazards. Highly
              sensitive uses are defined as those that meet one more of the following criteria:
              a. Land uses whose onsite population cannot be readily evacuated or otherwise
                   adequately protected from serious harm through methods such as sheltering in-
                   place. This includes, but is not limited to, schools, hospitals, clinics, nursing
                   homes, multiple-family housing exclusively for the elderly or disabled, high-
                   density residential, stadiums, arenas, and other uses with large public-assembly
                   facilities.
              b. Land uses that serve critical “lifeline” functions such as water supplies, fire
                   response, and police response if exposed to a significant risk that will curtail their
                   lifeline functions for a critical period of time.
SE 1.3        Site-Specific Hazards Studies. [GP/CP] Applications for new development shall
              consider exposure of the new development to coastal and other hazards. Where
              appropriate, an application for new development shall include a
              geologic/soils/geotechnical study and any other studies that identify geologic hazards
              affecting the proposed project site and any necessary mitigation measures. The
              study report shall contain a statement certifying that the project site is suitable for the
              proposed development and that the development will be safe from geologic hazards.
              The report shall be prepared and signed by a licensed certified engineering geologist
              or geotechnical engineer and shall be subject to review and acceptance by the City.
SE 1.4        Deed Restriction in Hazardous Areas. [GP/CP] As a condition of development on
              property subject to the hazards addressed in this Safety Element, the property owner
              shall be required to execute and record a deed restriction that acknowledges and

Goleta General Plan /Coastal Land Use Plan                                                5.0 Safety Element
              assumes responsibility for the risks; waives any future claims of damage or liability
              against the City; and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the City against any and
              all liability, claims, damages, and/or expenses arising from any injury to any person
              or damage to property due to such hazards.
SE 1.5        Subdivision of New Lots in Hazard Areas. [GP/CP] Land divisions, including lot
              line adjustments, shall be prohibited in areas subject to geologic, seismic, flooding,
              and other hazards unless it is demonstrated by the subdivider that all lots in the new
              subdivision will have sufficient buildable land area that is situated outside the
              hazardous portions of the property.
SE 1.6        Enforcement of Building Codes. [GP] The City shall ensure through effective
              enforcement measures that all new construction in the city is built according to the
              adopted building and fire codes.
SE 1.7        Abatement of Public Safety Hazards. [GP] Where feasible, the City shall
              aggressively abate public safety hazards that may be discovered in the city.
SE 1.8        Reduction of Non-Conforming or Substandard Structural Conditions. [GP] The
              City shall implement programs to identify existing structures not conforming to
              earthquake or fire standards, and encourage conformance with acceptable levels of
              risk through programs such as structural rehabilitation, occupancy reduction, and
              demolition and reconstruction.
SE 1.9        Reduction of Radon Hazards. [GP] The City shall require the consideration of
              radon hazards for all new construction and require testing of radon levels for
              construction of homes and buildings located in areas subject to moderate or high
              potential for radon gas levels exceeding 4.0 picocuries as shown on maps produced
              by the California Division of Mines and Geology. The City shall require new homes
              to use radon-resistant construction where needed based on U.S. Environmental
              Protection Agency guidelines.
Policy SE 2: Bluff Erosion and Retreat [GP/CP]
Objective: To ensure safe siting of bluff-top buildings and other development and to avoid the
need for shoreline erosion-control structures.
SE 2.1        Coastal Bluff Setbacks for
              Buildings. [GP/CP] All new
              permanent buildings shall be set
              back at least 130 feet from the top
              of the bluff. The 130-foot setback
              consists of the sum of a) 100
              times a conservative average rate
              of bluff retreat of 1.0 feet per year,
              and b) a 30-foot additional safety
              buffer. A lesser setback may be
              considered provided that a site-
              specific geological or geotechnical

              retreat rate is less than 1.0 feet per year and that the proposed setback meets the
              100-year bluff-retreat rate, plus 30 feet, standard. Repair and maintenance of
              existing bluff structures that encroach into the required setback are allowed. Minor
              additions (less than 10 percent of the existing building’s floor area) to existing bluff-
              top structures within the bluff setback may be allowed, provided that the addition
              does not encroach further into the setback than the existing structure. (Amended by Reso.

SE 2.2        Coastal Bluff Setbacks for Other Structures. [GP/CP] Structures other than
              buildings may be permitted within the 130-foot bluff setback area, but in no case
              shall any new structure be located less than 30 feet from the top of the coastal bluff.
              All such structures should be moveable or replaceable such that coastal armoring or
              coastal bluff retaining walls are not permitted should these structures be threatened
              by bluff retreat. This setback prohibition does not apply to minor structures
              associated with passive recreational uses such as signs and benches. (Amended by
              Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)
SE 2.3        Prohibition of Shoreline Armoring for Bluff-Top Development. [GP/CP] The
              installation of coastal armoring to protect bluff-top development constructed after the
              effective date of Public Resources Code Section 30235 shall be prohibited. Such
              prohibited armoring includes but is not limited to seawalls, revetments, and riprap.
              Should existing bluff-top buildings be threatened by coastal bluff retreat, threatened
              structures shall be relocated or removed.
SE 2.4        Building Setbacks along Non-Bluff Coastlines. [GP/CP] Appropriate setbacks
              shall be required for shoreline segments that lack coastal bluffs. For all structures
              proposed within 500 feet of the mean high tide line in areas that lack coastal bluffs, a
              site-specific shoreline erosion rate and shoreline hazards study shall be required.
              Such a study must demonstrate that the proposed structure would not be expected
              to be subject to shoreline erosion or other hazards for the structure’s lifetime or for
              50 years, whichever is greater.
SE 2.5        Prohibition on Armoring for Non-Bluff Coastlines. [GP/CP] The installation of
              coastal armoring along nonbluff segments of the coastline to protect shoreline
              development constructed after the effective date of Public Resources Code Section
              30235 shall be prohibited. Such prohibited armoring includes but is not limited to
              seawalls, revetments, and riprap. Should shoreline structures constructed after
              adoption of these policies be threatened by coastal bluff retreat, threatened
              structures shall be relocated or removed.
SE 2.6        Prohibition of Structures on Bluff Faces. [GP/CP] No permanent structures shall
              be permitted on a bluff face, except for engineered public beach accessways. Such
              structures shall be designed and constructed to prevent any further erosion of the
              bluff face and to be visually compatible with the surrounding area.
SE 2.7        Deed Restriction Regarding Coastal Hazards. [GP/CP] As a condition of approval
              of development on a beach or shoreline that is subject to wave action, erosion,
              flooding, landslides, or other hazards, the property owner shall be required to
              execute and record a deed restriction that acknowledges and assumes responsibility
              associated with such risks; waives any future claims of damage or liability against the

Policy SE 3: Beach Erosion and Shoreline Hazards [GP/CP]
Objective: To minimize or eliminate the need for shoreline protection structures while siting
development safely, maintaining shoreline sand supply, and providing safe lateral and vertical
shoreline access.
SE 3.1        Permanent Structures. [GP/CP] New permanent structures shall be prohibited
              seaward of the top of the coastal bluff. The exceptions to this prohibition include: 1)
              wooden stairs and other lightly constructed structures that provide public beach
              access, and 2) improvements necessary to provide access to the beach for
              emergency responders, if such access is appropriate and no other methods of
              access are feasible.
SE 3.2        Coastal Engineering Report. [GP/CP] Where appropriate, applications for new
              development on a beach, dune, or bluff-top property shall include a wave uprush and
              impact report and analysis prepared by a licensed civil engineer with expertise in
              coastal engineering that addresses and demonstrates the effects of the proposed
              development in relation to the following:
              a. The profile of the beach.
              b. Surveyed locations of mean high tide lines acceptable to the State Lands
                   Commission.
              c. The availability of public access to and along the beach.
              d. The area of the site subject to wave uprush.
              e. Foundation design requirements.
              f.   The potential need for a shoreline protection structure over the life of the project.
              g. The long-term effects of the proposed development on shoreline sand supply.
              h. Future projections of rise in sea levels.
              i.   Project alternatives designed to avoid or lessen impacts and/or exposure to
                   shoreline hazards.
SE 3.3        Temporary Structures. [GP/CP] Temporary structures seaward of the top of the
              coastal bluff shall be allowed subject to approval of an appropriate discretionary
              permit. The findings for approval of such a permit shall include the requirement that
              the temporary structure not substantially interfere with lateral or vertical beach
              access or adversely impact coastal processes. Temporary structures are defined as
              structures that will be retained no longer than 3 years. Standards for review of
              temporary structures and the appropriate permit process shall be included in the
              City’s new zoning code.
SE 3.4        Installation of New Coastal Armoring. [GP/CP] Pursuant to Public Resources
              Code Section 30235, revetments, breakwaters, groins, harbor channels, seawalls,
              cliff retaining walls, and other such construction that alters natural shoreline
              processes shall only be permitted when required to serve coastal-dependent uses or

Goleta General Plan /Coastal Land Use Plan                                                 5.0 Safety Element
              to protect structures existing as of the effective date of Public Resources Code
              Section 30235 or public beaches in danger from erosion and when designed to
              eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts on local shoreline sand supply. In particular,
              the goals of mitigation shall include, but not be limited to, maintaining beach widths
              fronting and adjacent to coastal armoring structures and maintaining safe lateral
              beach access.
SE 3.5        Permitted Coastal Armoring for Publicly Owned Beaches and Vertical Beach
              Accesses. [GP/CP] Coastal armoring may be allowed to protect and maintain safe
              public vertical beach accessways. Coastal armoring may also be allowed as a
              component of a beach restoration project for a publicly owned beach. Coastal
              armoring designed to provide for safe vertical beach access should be limited in size
              and scope to the minimum amount necessary and be placed as far landward as
              possible to minimize impacts to beach processes and maximize the provision of safe
              lateral beach access. Similar standards for limiting armoring to the least amount
              necessary apply to armoring associated with public-beach restoration projects.
SE 3.6        Repair and Maintenance of Coastal Armoring. [GP/CP] Repair and maintenance
              of existing or legally permitted coastal armoring may be permitted only if the repair
              and maintenance activities do not result in an enlargement or extension of armoring,
              and where an engineering or geological study demonstrates that in the absence of
              such repair and maintenance, the structure protected by the armoring would be
              subject to damage from identified coastal hazards. “Existing” as used in this policy
              shall mean existing as of the effective date of Public Resources Code Section 30235.
              Repair and maintenance activities shall not result in a seaward encroachment of the
              coastal armoring.
SE 3.7        Standards for Coastal Armoring and Requirements for Applications. [GP/CP]
              Any proposal for installation or repair and maintenance of coastal armoring submitted
              pursuant to Subpolicies SE 3.4, SE 3.5, or SE 3.6 shall include an engineering or
              geological study that demonstrates that in the absence of the proposed project, the
              structure to be protected by the armoring would be subject to damage by identified
              coastal hazards. Such a proposal shall also include an analysis of all feasible
              alternatives to coastal armoring. The alternatives analysis shall include but not be
              limited to the relocation of the threatened structure or development as well as the
              removal of portions of the threatened structure or development. The alternatives
              analysis should demonstrate that the proposed armoring is the least environmentally
              damaging alternative and that the armoring has been designed to eliminate or
              mitigate adverse impacts on local
              shoreline sand supply. All
              armoring structures shall be
              designed to be visually compatible
              with the adjacent shoreline
              segment.
SE 3.8        Removal of Derelict Coastal
              Armoring Structures. [GP/CP]
              The City shall support the removal
              of derelict coastal armoring
              structures. Derelict coastal
              armoring is defined as armoring                Remnants of Seawall at the Base of the
                                                                      Ellwood Mesa Bluffs

              that was constructed to protect any structure that has been demolished or removed
              or armoring that has fallen into disrepair, or presents a nuisance or safety hazard.
              Portions of the steel-reinforced wooden seawall along the eastern frontage of the
              Sandpiper Golf Course (east of the shoreline oil piers of State Lease 421) should be
              removed as such portions are exposed seaward of the toe of the bluff. The
              placement of additional backfill to shore up this structure shall be prohibited, and
              natural shoreline processes shall be allowed to resume. This requirement does not
              apply to the rock revetment that protects the access road to the State Lease 421
              piers, unless and until these wells are properly abandoned and the pier structures
              are removed.
SE 3.9        Removal of Beach Hazards. [GP/CP] The City supports existing and new efforts to
              identify and properly remove remnant piers, bulkheads, derelict oil well materials,
              and other beach hazards. The City encourages implementation of the State Lands
              Commission’s Beach Hazards Removal Project, which was approved by the State
              Lands Commission in May 2002, but not implemented due to state budget
              limitations.
SE 3.10       Complete and Prompt
              Abandonment of Shoreline
              Structures. [GP/CP] Upon
              decommissioning of the two
              shoreline oil wells (State Lease
              421 wells), the complete
              demolition and removal of all
              associated structures shall be
              required. The timeframe for
              complete demolition shall be within
              3 years of the ceasing of
              production operations in
              accordance with LU 10.4.
              Associated structures include but
              are not limited to the caisson walls,      Piers Associated with Oil Production along the
              the piers, the revetment, and any         Shoreline Adjacent to the Sandpiper Golf Course
              inactive pipelines within 100 feet of
              the top of the revetment. Abandonment in place for inactive pipelines associated with
              State Lease 421 production shall not be permitted, as subsequent coastal erosion
              could expose these structures. Pier supports and pilings shall be cut below the
              surface as far as possible, and ideally down to bedrock to prevent subsequent
              exposure by winter beach scour.
Policy SE 4: Seismic and Seismically Induced Hazards [GP/CP]
Objective: To minimize the potential for loss of life and property and economic and social
disruption resulting from seismic events and seismically induced hazards.
SE 4.1        Information on Faults and Geologic Hazards. [GP/CP] The City will maintain up-
              to-date information on faults and geologic hazards in and offshore of Goleta as
              provided in source documents from the California Division of Mines and Geology, the
              U.S. Geological Survey, and other agencies. As new information from geologic

              studies becomes available, the City shall incorporate this information into its maps
              and resources pertaining to seismic hazards.
SE 4.2        Potentially Active Faults. [GP/CP] Potentially active faults shall be subject to the
              same requirements as active faults unless and until geological or geotechnical
              studies demonstrate that a given potentially active fault is not active.
SE 4.3        Geotechnical and Geologic Studies Required. [GP/CP] Where appropriate, the
              City shall require applications for planning entitlements for new or expanded
              development to address potential geologic and seismic hazards through the
              preparation of geotechnical and geologic reports for City review and acceptance.
SE 4.4        Setback from Faults. [GP/CP] New development shall not be located closer than 50
              feet to any active or potentially active fault line to reduce potential damage from
              surface rupture. Nonstructural development may be allowed in such areas,
              depending on how such nonstructural development would withstand or respond to
              fault rupture or other seismic damage.
SE 4.5        Adoption of Updated California Building Code Requirements. [GP] The City
              shall review, amend, and adopt new California Building Code requirements, when
              necessary, to promote the use of updated construction standards. The City shall
              consider and may adopt new optional state revisions for Seismic Hazards.
SE 4.6        Identification of Un-reinforced Buildings. [GP] The City will identify un-reinforced
              brick and masonry buildings and require reinforcement through applicable building
              design standards. The City shall maintain and periodically update the list of un-
              reinforced masonry buildings.
SE 4.7        Seismic Retrofit Program. [GP] The City shall work with state and federal agencies
              to seek funding for and implement a seismic retrofit program for un-reinforced brick
              and masonry buildings.
SE 4.8        Seismic Standards for Critical Facilities. [GP] New critical facilities (hospitals,
              schools, communication centers, fire and police facilities, power plants, etc.) shall be
              designed and built in conformance with all California Building Code Requirements.
              Existing critical facilities within Goleta should be evaluated by a qualified structural
              engineer to assess the facilities’ earthquake resistance. If any such facility is found to
              be deficient, appropriate structural retrofits or other mitigation measures should be
              identified and required.
SE 4.9        Safety Measures for Utilities. [GP] For certain utilities, such as gas, oil, sewer, and
              water pipelines, that are not or cannot be routed to avoid crossing faults, appropriate
              safety measures (valve shutoffs, leak detection, etc.) shall be required to minimize
              earthquake-related impacts and promote rapid post-event repair and cleanup.
SE 4.10       Avoidance of Liquefaction Hazard Areas for Critical Facilities. [GP/CP] The City
              shall discourage the construction of critical facilities in areas of potential liquefaction.
              In cases where construction of such facilities cannot avoid liquefaction-hazard areas,
              the City shall require implementation of appropriate mitigation as recommended in
              site-specific geotechnical and soils studies.

SE 4.11       Geotechnical Report Required. [GP/CP] The City shall require geotechnical and/or
              geologic reports as part of the application for construction of habitable structures and
              essential services buildings (as defined by the building code) sited in areas having a
              medium-to-high potential for liquefaction and seismic settlement. The geotechnical
              study shall evaluate the potential for liquefaction and/or seismic-related settlement to
              impact the development, and identify appropriate structural-design parameters to
              mitigate potential hazards.
SE 4.12       Safety Measures for Tsunami Hazard Areas. [GP/CP] The following shall apply in
              tsunami hazard areas:
              a. New developments shall include design features or other measures that provide
                   for safe harbor on site.
              b. Existing critical facilities within the tsunami hazard area should be reviewed by
                   the City Building Official, or designee, in conjunction with the appropriate state
                   agency, to ensure that adequate areas for safe harbor are available on site
                   and/or that other measures or features exist to minimize risk of injuries and
                   deaths in the event of a tsunami.
              c. The City, in cooperation with the County and/or State Offices of Emergency
                   Services, encourages development of an emergency notification and evacuation
                   plan in response to a tsunami warning. The City shall cooperate with these
                   agencies to develop educational materials informing people of the causes of
                   tsunamis, tsunami characteristics and warning signs (such as a locally felt
                   earthquake or unusually recession of near-shore waters), and appropriate
                   tsunami-response measures. These educational materials shall be made
                   available to residents of and visitors to Goleta.
Policy SE 5: Soil and Slope Stability Hazards [GP/CP]
Objectives: To promote safely sized, sited, and designed development in erosion-prone hazard
areas. To reduce the potential loss of both public and private property in areas subject to steep
slopes and erosion hazards.
SE 5.1        Evaluation of Slope-Related Hazards. [GP/CP] The City shall require
              geotechnical/geological, soil, and structural engineering studies for all development
              proposed in areas of known high and moderate landslide potential or on slopes
              equaling or exceeding 25 percent. The studies shall evaluate the potential for
              landslides, rockfalls, creep, and other mass movement processes that could impact
              the development; they shall also identify mitigation to reduce these potential impacts,
              if needed. The studies shall be included as part of an application for development.
SE 5.2        Evaluation of Soil-Related Hazards. [GP/CP] The City shall require structural
              evaluation reports with appropriate mitigation measures to be provided for all new
              subdivisions, and for discretionary projects proposing new nonresidential buildings or
              substantial additions. Depending on the conclusions of the structural evaluation
              report, soil and geological reports may also be required. Such studies shall evaluate
              the potential for soil expansion, compression, and collapse to impact the
              development; they shall also identify mitigation to reduce these potential impacts, if
              needed.

SE 5.3        Avoidance of Landslide Hazards for Critical Facilities. [GP/CP] The City shall
              prohibit the construction of critical facilities (hospitals, schools, communication
              centers, fire and police facilities, power plants, etc.) in areas of high landslide
              potential. The City shall discourage the construction of critical facilities in areas of
              moderate landslide potential. In cases where construction of such facilities cannot
              avoid moderate landslide hazard areas, the City shall require implementation of
              appropriate mitigation as recommended in site-specific geotechnical and soils
              studies.
SE 5.4        Avoidance of Soil-Related Hazards. [GP/CP] For the proposed development of
              any critical facilities in areas subject to soil-related hazards, as well as for noncritical
              facilities in areas subject to soil-related hazards, the City shall require site-specific
              geotechnical, soil, and/or structural engineering studies to assess the degree of
              hazard on the proposed site and recommend any appropriate site design
              modifications or considerations as well as any other mitigation measures. The City
              shall not approve development in areas subject to soil-related hazards, unless
              mitigation measures are identified and committed to that would reduce hazards to an
              acceptable level.
SE 5.5        Minimization of Grading in Hazardous Areas. [GP/CP] All construction proposed
              for areas with steep (equal to or greater than 25 percent) slopes or subject to soil-
              and slope-related hazards shall minimize the area to be graded and shall also
              minimize the area of vegetation removal or disturbance.
SE 5.6        Streambed Stabilization Projects. [GP/CP] In stream areas susceptible to slope
              failure, the City shall pursue and implement streambed stabilization projects. For
              these projects, stabilization by restoration with native plantings and natural-looking,
              “soft” stabilization methods shall be preferred over concrete channelization, gabions,
              riprap, and other “hard” stabilization methods.
Policy SE 6: Flood Hazards [GP/CP]
Objective: To minimize damage to structures and the danger to life caused by stream flooding,
dam failure inundation, and other flooding hazards.
SE 6.1        Map of Flood Hazard Areas. [GP/CP] The City shall use the most recent edition of
              the federal Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM maps) in evaluating applications for
              new or expanded development on properties subject to flood hazards. All
              applications for new or expanded development shall be required to show, where
              applicable, the floodway, 100-year floodplain, and the 500-year floodplain on the site
              plan showing the proposed development. The map in Figure 5-2 is a facsimile rather
              than the official flood hazard map and is intended only to be illustrative of possible
              flood hazard areas.
SE 6.2        Areas Subject to Local Urban Flooding. [GP] In addition to flood hazard areas
              shown on the FIRM maps, the City may require applications for new or expanded
              development in areas with known persistent local urban flooding to include measures
              that lessen the urban flooding hazard and/or that mitigate its effects on the proposed
              development. This requirement shall apply to flooding on any street or roadway that
              provides access to the proposed development.
September 2006                                                                                            5-20

SE 6.3        Floodplain Management Ordinance. [GP] The City shall maintain and strictly
              enforce the policies, regulations, and standards within a Floodplain Management
              Ordinance.
SE 6.4        Avoidance of Flood Hazard Areas. [GP/CP] The City shall discourage any new
              intensive development in any flood hazard area. Similarly, the City shall require
              appropriate flood mitigation for intensification of existing development in any flood-
              prone area. The City shall not approve development within areas designated as the
              100-year floodplain that would obstruct flood flow (such as construction in the
              designated floodway), displace floodwaters onto other property, or be subject to flood
              damage. The City shall not allow development that will create or worsen drainage
              problems.
SE 6.5        Siting of Critical Facilities. [GP] The City shall discourage the construction of
              critical facilities within the 100-year floodplain. In cases where construction of such
              facilities cannot avoid flood hazard areas, the City shall require implementation of
              appropriate mitigation as recommended in site-specific hydrology/hydraulic and/or
              engineering studies.
SE 6.6        Enforcement of Watercourse
              Setback Ordinance. [GP/CP] A
              minimum 50-foot setback shall be
              required from streambanks and
              flood control channels for all new
              development (see related CE 2.2).
              For projects that would be
              rendered infeasible by the
              application of such minimum
              setbacks, the project applicant
              shall provide a site-specific
              engineering study with
              recommended mitigation
              measures to allow for a reduced                Riparian Corridor along Glen Annie Creek
              setback that would not expose
              development to unacceptable risk.
              Furthermore, in these cases, the City shall consult with the Santa Barbara County
              Flood Control District to determine whether the proposed lesser setback would be
              appropriate, in that it would allow access for flood control maintenance and enable
              proper operation of the channels. The City shall maintain and enforce the policies
              and standards within a Water Course Setback Ordinance.
SE 6.7        Evaluation of Potential Inundation Hazard. [GP/CP] When reviewing proposals for
              development of water reservoirs, large retention basins, or drainage channels, the
              City shall require an evaluation of potential inundation areas and require design to
              withstand potential seismic activity.
SE 6.8        Flood Control Projects. [GP/CP] The City shall seek funding for and implement
              capital improvement projects to mitigate hazards for low-lying flood-prone areas. The
              City shall require restoration of natural processes in drainage ways where
              appropriate and feasible. For these flood control projects, methods that employ
              native plantings and natural-looking, “soft” stabilization shall be preferred over
September 2006                                                                                            5-21

              methods that rely solely on concrete channelization and other “hard” stabilization
              methods.
SE 6.9        Restoration of Armored or Channelized Stream Beds. [GP/CP] The City shall
              pursue opportunities to eliminate or soften existing concrete channels and/or rock- or
              concrete-stabilized banks from streams. (See CE 2.5.)
Policy SE 7: Urban and Wildland Fire Hazards [GP/CP]
Objective: To reduce the threat to life, structures, and the environment caused by urban and
wildland fires.
SE 7.1        Fire Prevention and Response Measures for New Development. [GP/CP] New
              development and redevelopment projects shall be designed and constructed in
              accordance with National Fire Protection Association standards to minimize fire
              hazards, with special attention given to fuel management and improved access in
              areas with higher fire risk, with access or water supply deficiencies, or beyond a 5-
              minute response time.
SE 7.2        Review of New Development.
              [GP/CP] Applications for new or
              expanded development shall be
              reviewed by appropriate Santa
              Barbara County Fire Department
              personnel to ensure they are
              designed in a manner that reduces
              the risk of loss due to fire. Such
              review shall include consideration
              of the adequacy of “defensible
              space” around structures at risk;
                                                        Fire Department Engine Responding to a Wildfire
              access for fire suppression
              equipment, water supplies,                Source: Santa Barbara County Fire Department 2003
              construction standards; and
              vegetation clearance. Secondary access may be required and shall be considered
              on a case-by-case basis. The City shall encourage built-in fire suppression systems
              such as sprinklers, particularly in high-risk or high-value areas.
SE 7.3        Identification of Fire Hazard Areas. [GP/CP] The Santa Barbara County Fire
              Department should identify high-value and high-risk areas, including urban/wildlife
              interface areas, and develop mitigation efforts to reduce the threat of fire.
SE 7.4        Fuel Modification Plans. [GP/CP] Applications for new development that require
              fuel modification shall include a Fuel Modification Plan for the project. This plan shall
              be prepared by a landscape architect or resource specialist and shall include
              measures to minimize removal of native vegetation, minimize disturbance to
              environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHAs), and incorporate fire-retardant
              vegetation in new plantings. Such plans shall be reviewed and approved by the
              Santa Barbara County Fire Department.
SE 7.5        Automatic Fire Sprinkler Systems. [GP] The City shall require the installation of
              automatic fire sprinklers for: a) all new buildings that have a total floor area of 5,000
September 2006                                                                                            5-22

              square feet or more and b) any existing building proposed for remodeling or an
              addition, which, upon completion of the remodel or addition, will have a total floor
              area of 5,000 square feet or more. The 5,000-square-foot threshold cited in criteria a)
              and b), above, shall be reduced to 1,000 square feet for any building zoned or used
              for commercial or industrial purposes if such building is within 100 feet of any
              residentially zoned parcel.
SE 7.6        Standards for Rebuilding in High Fire Hazard Areas. [GP] Any rebuilding in high
              fire hazard areas shall incorporate development standards and precautions that
              reduce the chance of structure losses from fire.
Policy SE 8: Oil and Gas Industry Hazards [GP/CP]
Objective: To minimize the risk of potential short- and long-term hazards associated with the
operation of the Venoco Ellwood facilities and other oil and gas extraction, processing, and
transportation facilities.
SE 8.1        Nonconforming Status of EOF. [GP/CP] In accord with the legal nonconforming
              status of the EOF in western Goleta, the City may allow safety improvements that
              incidentally could prolong the life of the plant. (See related LU 10.1.)
SE 8.2        Consideration of Offshore Gas Processing. [GP/CP] The City supports
              minimizing the risk of a H2S release within the City’s boundaries. The environmental
              document prepared in connection with any project proposal requiring discretionary
              permit approval by the City of Goleta for a substantial increase in EOF throughput
              should include among the reasonable range of project alternatives the cessation of
              gas sweetening (H2S removal) at the EOF and relocation of such gas treatment
              facilities and processes to Platform Holly. The intent is to provide an analysis of the
              feasibility of this method of reducing the risk of an H2S release within the City’s
              boundaries.
SE 8.3        Annual Safety Audits Required. [GP/CP] Annual safety audits of all new and
              existing oil and gas production, processing, and storage facilities shall be required.
              The City, or its agent, shall participate in these safety audits. All deficiencies noted in
              each audit shall be addressed promptly, in timeframes as recommended by the
              audit’s conclusions.
SE 8.4        Enhanced Preparedness for Hydrogen Sulfide Release. [GP] The City shall work
              with the County’s Office of Emergency Services to increase awareness of and
              emergency preparedness for the H2S hazard associated with the EOF, such that
              nearby residents, businesses, their clients, and other potentially affected persons
              understand what to do in the event of a catastrophic release. For most affected
              persons, sheltering in place is preferable to evacuation, as certain evacuation routes
              would expose people to a greater hazard.
SE 8.5        Inventory of Oil and Gas Pipelines. [GP/CP] The City should develop and maintain
              an inventory of gas and oil pipelines, including public utility transmission pipelines,
              and shall require operators of petroleum pipelines to provide information deemed
              essential for such inventory.
September 2006                                                                                           5-23

SE 8.6        Quantitative Risk Assessment. [GP/CP] The City shall require a Quantitative Risk
              Assessment to be a component of any application for a new oil and gas production
              and processing facility or for any proposed substantial alterations of existing oil and
              gas production and processing facilities. The scope of the assessment should
              include any pipelines associated with or serving the facility. The Quantitative Risk
              Assessment should identify and quantify any new or substantially changed risks and
              show any substantial changes to hazard footprints, such that any potential impacts to
              surrounding development and uses can be assessed and mitigated. The Quantitative
              Risk Assessment should also recommend any appropriate mitigation measures to
              limit exposure of new or expanded hazards to surrounding development and uses.
SE 8.7        Routing of Gas Pipelines. [GP/CP] When reviewing proposals for new or relocated
              gas pipeline routes, the City shall consult with the federal Office of Pipeline Safety or
              the California Public Utilities Commission as appropriate. New gas pipelines, or
              relocations of existing gas pipelines, shall be routed to avoid significant risk to
              populated areas where feasible. This policy applies to gathering and transmission
              pipelines but not to distribution pipelines. The determination of populated areas shall
              consider both present and reasonably anticipated future development according to
              applicable land-use plans, zoning, and urban spheres of influence. New or relocated
              pipelines shall also be routed to prevent significant risk to highly sensitive land uses
              as defined in this element, unless the risk can be rendered insignificant by
              incorporation of feasible mitigation measures.
SE 8.8        Development near Gas
              Pipelines. [GP/CP] The City shall
              limit or prohibit development of
              highly sensitive land uses near
              gas gathering and transmission
              pipelines, if the existing pipeline
              would expose the new use to
              significant risk. For other types of
              proposed development near
              existing gas pipelines, the City
              may require mitigation if they are
              located within a presumptive
              hazard zone of the pipeline.
              Applicants proposing development
              within a presumptive hazardous
              zone may rebut the presumed                 Processing Equipment at the Venoco Ellwood
                                                            Onshore Oil and Gas Processing Facility
              boundaries of this zone through
              site-specific analysis that complies
              with City thresholds.
SE 8.9        Safety Requirements for New Petroleum Pipelines. [GP/CP] In a manner
              consistent with applicable law, the City shall condition discretionary land use
              approvals of new petroleum pipelines to require safe design, including technology to
              prevent failure and reduce the consequences of failure. Examples include proven
              controls for preventing internal and external corrosion and fractures, proven leak
              detection, safe venting systems, appropriate capabilities for shutting the pipeline
              down and isolating potential pipeline leaks, and effective public-warning systems.
September 2006                                                                                          5-24

              Requirements shall be commensurate with the level and anticipated duration of the
              risk.
SE 8.10       Safety, Inspection, and Maintenance of Oil and Gas Pipelines. [GP/CP] The City
              shall condition discretionary land use approvals of new or substantially upgraded gas
              and oil pipelines to require a Safety Inspection, Maintenance, and Quality Assurance
              Program or similar mechanism to ensure adequate ongoing inspection, maintenance,
              and other operating procedures. Any such mechanism shall be subject to City
              approval prior to commencement of pipeline operations and provide for systematic
              updates as appropriate. Requirements shall be commensurate with the level and
              anticipated duration of the risk.
SE 8.11       Safety Measures for Pipelines Transporting Produced Gas. [GP/CP] Consistent
              with applicable law, the City shall require feasible operating methods for reducing the
              hazard along natural gas pipeline corridors that are commensurate with the level of
              risk. Potential considerations include, but are not limited to, one or more of the
              following methods: sweetening of gas offshore, removal of condensate at the
              production site to achieve a single-phased flow in the gas pipeline, reduction of
              maximum allowable operating pressure, thicker-walled pipelines, and systematic
              surveillance of the right-of-way. Measures required shall be commensurate with the
              level of significant risk posed by the pipeline, and may be adjusted as that level of
              significance changes over time.
SE 8.12       Consultation with Pipeline Operators. [GP/CP] The City shall consult with
              applicable pipeline operators, including public utilities, during the preparation of land
              use plans and during the early stages of reviewing discretionary permit applications
              on all properties that contain, or are adjacent to, oil or gas pipelines, including public-
              utility high-pressure gas pipelines.
SE 8.13       Setbacks from Gas Pipelines. [GP/CP] The City shall generally require a minimum
              setback of 25 feet from the centerline of gas gathering and transmission pipelines,
              including public-utility high-pressure pipelines, for all buildings and structures to
              prevent damage to the pipeline by external mechanical forces and to permit
              operators timely and unhindered access for repair, maintenance, survey, and
              emergency response. Exceptions to this requirement shall include:
              a. Corridor-type locations such as roads and highways, and corridor-type uses such
                   as other pipelines, bicycle and pedestrian paths, utilities, and appurtenances of
                   corridors located in public rights-of-way.
              b. Pipeline endpoints and interconnecting pipelines.
              c. Replacement of a public-utility pipeline with a functionally equivalent pipeline.
              d. Instances where this requirement is preempted by state or federal law.
              e. Instances where the City finds the 25-foot setback poses an undue hardship to
                   proposed development, provided that any reduced setback shall not be less than
                   15 feet and shall substantially accomplish the purpose.
SE 8.14       Pipeline Burial Depths. [GP/CP] New oil and gas pipelines, or relocation of existing
              oil and gas pipelines, excluding gas distribution pipelines, shall be buried at an
              appropriate depth, one that safely accommodates potential of scouring, slope failure,
              and other forms of natural or human-caused erosion and earth movement. The

              calculation of initial burial depth should take into account depth reduction via erosion
              and other forms of earth movement (including grading and construction) unless other
              means of maintaining a safe minimum burial depth can be incorporated throughout
              the operating life of a pipeline. Pipeline operators should assess burial depths every
              five years, or at a more frequent interval when geologic characteristics, flooding, and
              other circumstances indicate a prudent need for special monitoring. These
              requirements shall apply to new and existing pipelines where burial depths are
              specified. It shall also apply to existing, buried pipelines where depths are not
              prescribed but maintenance of a minimum depth is warranted. A minimum burial
              depth shall be maintained for the entire operating life of the pipelines.
SE 8.15       Pipeline Marking and Warning. [GP/CP] New oil and gas pipelines, or relocation of
              existing pipelines, shall include measures to clearly warn outside parties about the
              presence of the pipeline, including proper marking of the right-of-way with signage
              and use of brightly colored warning tape approximately 1 foot above buried pipelines
              where feasible.

6.1      INTRODUCTION
General Plan Law Requirements [GP]
Although the Visual and Historic Resources          Visual and Historic Resources Element Policies
Element is an optional general plan element         VH 1: Scenic Views
under state law, it addresses several               VH 2: Local Scenic Corridors
mandatory subjects as set forth in the general      VH 3: Community Character
                                                    VH 4: Design Review
plan law. In particular, Government Code            VH 5: Historic Resources
Section 65560 defines open space to include         VH 6: Historical and Cultural Landscapes
areas of outstanding scenic, historic, and
cultural value, as well as scenic highway corridors. Further, general plan law (Government Code
Section 65302.4) authorizes the general plan to express community intentions regarding urban
form and design. These expressions may provide for specific measures to regulate relationships
between buildings as well as between buildings and outdoor public areas, including streets.
Coastal Act Requirements [CP]
A primary objective of the California Coastal Act (Coastal Act) is the protection of scenic and
visual resources, particularly as viewed from public places such as road rights-of-way and park
and open space areas. New development is required to be sited and designed to protect views
to the ocean and along the shoreline and other scenic views in coastal areas. Additionally, new
development is required to minimize alteration of natural landforms and must be sited and
designed to be visually compatible with the character of the surrounding areas. The Coastal Act
further encourages measures to restore and enhance visual quality in areas where scenic and
visual resources have been degraded.
Goleta’s Visual and Historic Resources – 2005 [GP/CP]
Aesthetic values are important aspects of a community in establishing its identity, sense of
place, and quality of life. Although measuring aesthetic qualities is subject to individual
interpretation, the Goleta Valley is well known for the scenic beauty of its open spaces, foothills,
and ocean and mountain views. Goleta lies between the Santa Ynez Mountains and the Pacific
Ocean. Although the foothills and mountains are outside city boundaries, these landforms will
remain largely undeveloped and provide a scenic backdrop to Goleta’s urbanized area.
Prominent features of the foothills and mountains are seen throughout the city and include
expanses of orchards, chaparral, and rock outcroppings.
Visually attractive open spaces within Goleta include public recreation areas, such as the Lake
Los Carneros Natural and Historical Preserve, and agricultural lands, such as Fairview Gardens
and the Bishop Ranch, all readily visible to the public from public streets. A large lemon orchard
and other agricultural areas located adjacent to the city boundary can be seen south of Hollister
Avenue between Patterson Avenue and State Route 217 (SR-217). Goleta also encompasses
highly scenic coastal open space areas. Santa Barbara Shores Park and the Sperling Preserve
are important upland drainage areas associated with the Devereux Slough ecosystem. Home to
significant natural features and one of the largest monarch butterfly overwintering sites in the
United States, this open space is buffered on the west by the Sandpiper Golf Course and the
east by University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)-owned open space. An extensive trail

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                           6.0 Visual and Historic Resources Element
system provides access to these scenic areas, which, due to the predominantly flat terrain,
provide sweeping views of onsite eucalyptus trees, the Santa Ynez Mountains and foothills, the
Pacific Ocean, coastal bluffs, and Devereux Slough.
Goleta’s urban design reflects its transition from a farming region to a post-World War II
suburban residential community. Once inhabited by the indigenous Chumash, the Goleta Valley
changed during the Mission Period of the late 1700s when dense oak forests were cut down for
cattle grazing and farming to support the Santa Barbara Mission and Presidio. In the early to
mid-1800s, the missions were secularized and the lands granted by the Mexican government to
former Presidio soldiers. Cattle grazing and agriculture continued until a severe drought in the
1860s forced large land holdings to be split into smaller lots. As houses and barns were built on
these smaller plots, the economic base moved from cattle to mixed-crop farming such as
walnuts, lima beans and lemons. Goleta remained a small community, and fertile flatlands
supported the main industry of agriculture into the late 1940s and early 1950s. Although several
housing tracts had been created in the 1920s, it was not until the construction of U.S. Highway
101 (US-101) in 1947 and the Cachuma Dam in 1950 that large residential subdivisions of
predominantly single story ranch-style tract homes became interspersed among the lemon
orchards. Relocation of the University of California from Santa Barbara’s Riviera neighborhood
to Goleta Point in 1950 and construction of light industrial parks for the defense industry in the
1960s fostered growth in the Goleta Valley. New strip retail commercial areas along Calle Real
and Fairview Avenue were built to meet the demands of the growing residential population.
Today, Goleta retains its small-scale suburban character, with relatively low residential densities
and few visually prominent buildings (none greater than three stories). Open spaces and broad
vistas continue to provide a connection to the natural environment. Although growth was so
rapid during the 1960s that only a few pre-World War II buildings exist, the Old Town area is the
historic center of Goleta and the place where an array of architectural styles are still
represented.
6.2      GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND GOALS [GP/CP]
The policies of the Visual and Historic Resources Element are intended to preserve and protect
Goleta’s scenic and historic resources to the maximum extent feasible while allowing quality
development in conformance with the provisions of the General Plan. The following principles
and goals, which are not in order of priority, provide the foundation for the detailed policies in
the subsequent sections of this element. All policies have been established to be in conformity
with the guiding principles and goals, and following adoption of the General Plan, future actions
of the City are required to be consistent with these principles and goals:
1. Recognize and preserve the unique and valuable scenic and historic resources that reflect
     the cultural and historical heritage of Goleta.
2. Ensure that new development is designed to preserve and protect important natural features
     and scenic resources.
3. Acknowledge that all development alters the existing environment and recognize the
     importance of quality design.
4. Preserve links to Goleta’s architectural past whenever possible to avoid the loss of
     community character.
5. Preserve the city’s historic structures and sites as irreplaceable resources and protect these
     resources from deterioration, inappropriate alterations, and demolition.

Goleta within the California Coastal Zone. The number refers to the section of the California
Public Resources Code. The plan maps show the location of the California Coastal Zone
boundary.
30251          The scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas shall be considered and protected as
               a resource of public importance. Permitted development shall be sited and designed
               to protect views to and along the ocean and scenic coastal areas, to minimize the
               alteration of natural land forms, to be visually compatible with the character of
               surrounding areas, and, where feasible, to restore and enhance visual quality in
               visually degraded areas. New development in highly scenic areas such as those
               designated in the California Coastline Preservation and Recreation Plan prepared by
               the Department of Parks and Recreation and by local government shall be
               subordinate to the character of its setting.
6.4      CITY POLICIES
Policy VH 1: Scenic Views [GP/CP]
Objective: To identify, protect, and enhance Goleta’s scenic resources and protect views or
vistas of these resources from public and private areas. (Amended by Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)
VH 1.1         Scenic Resources. [GP/CP] An essential aspect of Goleta’s character is derived
               from the various scenic resources within and around the city. Views of these
               resources from public and private areas contribute to the overall attractiveness of the

VH 1.2        Scenic Resources Map. [GP/CP] The Scenic Resources Map in Figure 6-1
              identifies locations on public roads, trails, parks, open spaces, and beaches that
              serve as public vantage points for viewing scenic resources. Views from these
              locations shall be protected by minimizing any impairment that could result from new
              development.
VH 1.3        Protection of Ocean and Island Views. [GP/CP] Ocean and island views from
              public viewing areas shall be protected. View protection associated with
              development should be accomplished first through site selection and then by use of
              design alternatives that enhance rather than obstruct or degrade such views. To
              minimize impacts to these scenic resources and ensure visual compatibility, the
              following development practices shall be used, where appropriate:
              a. Limitations on the height and size of structures.
              b. Limitations on the height and use of reflective materials for exterior walls
                   (including retaining walls) and fences.

VH 1.4        Protection of Mountain and Foothill Views. [GP/CP] Views of mountains and
              foothills from public areas shall be protected. View protection associated with
              development that may affect views of mountains or foothills should be accomplished
              first through site selection and then by use of design alternatives that enhance,
              rather than obstruct or degrade, such views. To minimize structural intrusion into the
              skyline, the following development practices shall be used where appropriate:
September 2006                                                                                                  6-4

VH 2.2        Preservation of Scenic Corridors. [GP] The aesthetic qualities of scenic corridors
              shall be preserved through retention of the general character of significant natural
              features; views of the ocean, foothills, and mountainous areas; and open space
              associated with recreational and agricultural areas including orchards, prominent
              vegetation, and historic structures. If landscaping is used to add visual interest or for
              screening, care should be taken to prevent a wall-like appearance. Bridges, culverts,
              drainage ditches and other roadway ancillary elements should be appropriately
              designed; side slopes and earthen berms adjacent to roadways should be natural in
              appearance.
VH 2.3        Development Projects Along Scenic Corridors. [GP] Development adjacent to
              scenic corridors should not degrade or obstruct views of scenic areas. To ensure
              visual compatibility with the scenic qualities, the following practices shall be used,
              where appropriate:
              a. Incorporate natural features in design.
              b. Use landscaping for screening purposes and/or for minimizing view blockage as
                   applicable.
              c. Minimize vegetation removal.
              d. Limit the height and size of structures.

Policy VH 3: Community Character [GP]
Objective: To protect and enhance Goleta’s visual character. (Amended by Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)
VH 3.1        Community Design Character. [GP] The visual character of Goleta is derived from
              the natural landscape and the built environment. The city’s agricultural heritage,
              open spaces, views of natural features, established low-density residential
              neighborhoods, and small-scale development with few visually prominent buildings
              contribute to this character. Residential, commercial, and industrial development
              should acknowledge and respect the desired aspects of Goleta’s visual character
              and make a positive contribution to the city through exemplary design.
VH 3.2        Neighborhood Identity. [GP] The unique qualities and character of each
              neighborhood shall be preserved and strengthened. Neighborhood context and scale
              shall be maintained. New development shall be compatible with existing architectural
              styles of adjacent development, except where poor quality design exists.
VH 3.3        Site Design. [GP] The city’s visual character shall be enhanced through appropriate
              site design. Site plans shall provide for buildings, structures, and uses that are
              subordinate to the natural topography, existing vegetation, and drainage courses;
              adequate landscaping; adequate vehicular circulation and parking; adequate
              pedestrian circulation; and provision and/or maintenance of solar access.
VH 3.4        Building Design. [GP] The city’s visual character shall be enhanced through
              development of structures that are appropriate in scale and orientation and that use
              high quality, durable materials. Structures shall incorporate architectural styles,
              landscaping, and amenities that are compatible with and complement surrounding
              development.
September 2006                                                                                                6-8

VH 3.5        Pedestrian-Oriented Design. [GP] The city’s visual character shall be enhanced
              through provision of aesthetically pleasing pedestrian connections within and
              between neighborhoods, recreational facilities, shopping, workplaces, and other
              modes of transportation, including bicycles and transit.
VH 3.6        Public Spaces. [GP] The city’s visual character shall be enhanced by creating well-
              defined community outdoor gathering places that incorporate focal points such as
              parks, fountains, public art, and/or landscape features. Small public open spaces
              should be provided in each neighborhood either through acquisition in existing
              neighborhoods or by design in new neighborhood developments in order to establish
              community focal points.
VH 3.7        Signage. [GP] The city’s visual character shall be enhanced through the use of
              restrained and tasteful signage that conveys an orderly and attractive appearance,
              complements project design, and enhances the city’s image. Excessive signage
              should be minimized. A graphics image should be developed to consistently identify
              public amenities citywide, such as signage on public buildings, streets and rights-of-
              way, public parks, and city entry points.
Policy VH 4: Design Review [GP]
Objective: To preserve, protect, and enhance Goleta’s character through high quality design.
(Amended by Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)
VH 4.1        Design Review Board. [GP] To
              enhance Goleta’s visual quality,
              the City shall maintain a Design
              Review Board, consisting of
              licensed professionals and city
              residents, to encourage
              development that exemplifies the
              best professional design practices.
              (See also LU 1.8.)
VH 4.2        Old Town. [GP] Old Town is a
              unique asset and the historic
              center of Goleta. Accordingly, all
              design shall maintain and enhance
              the historic character and be
              consistent with the Goleta Heritage                Hollister Avenue in Old Town
              District Architecture and Design
              Guidelines, where applicable.
              Superior materials and architectural detailing shall be used. Development shall
              continue to reflect Goleta’s small-scale character, promote individual identity, and
              avoid uniformity or a false historic look. The Design Review Board shall evaluate
              applicable proposals for new development within the Heritage District to achieve
              variation in heights of structures along the Hollister corridor to avoid a
              “canyonization” effect. The pedestrian experience shall be supported and enhanced
              by provision of street trees; landscaped passageways; human-scale entries; and
              amenities such as benches, bicycle racks, trash containers, and public art.

              and heavy landscaping. (See also LU 1.3.)
VH 4.3        Single-Family Residential
              Areas. [GP] The following
              standards shall be applicable to
              single-family residential
              development (see related LU 2.3):
              a. The distinct architectural
                   character of Goleta’s existing
                   neighborhoods shall be
                   protected.
              b. Buildings and structures shall
                   be designed to be compatible
                   with adjacent development
                   relative to size, bulk, and
                   scale.                                   A Single-Family Residential Neighborhood
              c. New construction shall utilize
                   consistent architectural
                   detailing and high quality materials to promote cohesiveness and compatibility.
                   Strong contrasts in size, bulk, scale, color, and roof forms shall be avoided.
              d. All building elevations should be well articulated and include architectural
                   features to vary wall planes.
              e. Safe and aesthetically pleasing pedestrian access that is physically separated
                   from vehicular access shall be provided in all new residential developments,
                   whenever feasible. Transitional spaces, including landscape or hardscape
                   elements, should be provided from the pedestrian access to the main entrance.
                   Main entrances should not open directly onto driveways or streets. Safe bicycle
                   access should be considered in all residential developments.
              f.   Visual impacts of parking, including driveways, garages, and garage doors,
                   should be minimized. Forward-facing garages should be designed so that the
                   garage does not dominate the streetscape or overall residential design.
              g. To maximize safety, garages should not open directly onto public or private
                   accessways.
              h. Private open space shall be provided in proportion to building size.
              i.   Privacy of residents and adjacent neighbors shall be protected. Examples of
                   measures that might provide protection include site selection and design that
                   uses setbacks and considers placement of windows, decks, balconies, and noise
                   producing equipment. The use of landscape screening to provide privacy should
                   be secondary to appropriate structural design.
              j.   New gated residential communities shall be prohibited. Connectivity to
                   neighborhood commercial areas, schools, recreational areas, and other facilities
                   shall be encouraged. Fencing and walls used to define private yards shall be
                   designed to prevent isolation of structures from the street.

                   hardware should be placed outside sidewalks and away from intersections to the
                   extent feasible.
VH 4.11       Parking Lots. [GP] Parking lots shall be adequately designed and landscaped. The
              following standards shall apply (see related Policy TE 9):
              a. Adequate parking requirements shall be established for all zone districts and
                   conditionally permitted uses.
              b. Adequate parking space dimensions and aisle widths shall be established.
              c. Angled parking spaces are encouraged in order to maximize visibility for drivers
                   and pedestrians. Retail parking lot design that includes 90-degree parking
                   spaces is discouraged.
              d. Pedestrian circulation shall be adequate, clearly delineated, and integrated with
                   internal vehicle circulation to allow for safe and convenient pedestrian links from
                   parking areas to building entrances. Planting strips should be used between
                   traffic zones and sidewalks wherever possible.
              e. Retail parking lots shall provide for adequate shopping cart storage that is

                   shade. Adequate tree density shall be established and shall include
                   approximately one tree for every four parking spaces. Deciduous trees in parking
                   lots are discouraged due to the visual effects of loss of canopy.
              g. Parking lot lighting shall be considered relative to the selection and location of
                   parking lot trees and their height at maturity.

                   for the intended purpose. Fixtures shall be fully shielded and have full cut off
                   lights to minimize visibility from public viewing areas and prevent light pollution
                   into residential areas or other sensitive uses such as wildlife habitats or migration
                   routes.
              b. Direct upward light emission shall be avoided to protect views of the night sky.
              c. Light fixtures used in new development shall be appropriate to the architectural
                   style and scale and compatible with the surrounding area.

              d. Signs shall be of appropriate and high quality style, color, materials, size, height,
                   and illumination.
              e. Lighting is considered an integral part of sign design and shall be controlled to
                   prevent glare and spillage onto adjacent areas.
              f.   Internally illuminated cabinet or can signs shall be prohibited.
              g. Billboards and other off-premises advertising signs shall be prohibited.
VH 4.14       Utilities. [GP] New development projects shall be required to place new utility lines
              underground. Existing overhead utility lines should be placed underground when
              feasible. Undergrounding of utility hardware is encouraged. Any aboveground utility
              hardware, such as water meters, electrical transformers, or backflow devices, shall
              not inhibit line of sight or encroach into public walkways and, where feasible, should
              be screened from public view by methods including, but not limited to, appropriate
              paint color, landscaping, and/or walls.

VH 5.4        Preservation of Historic Resources. [GP] Historic resources and the heritage they
              represent shall be protected, preserved, and enhanced to the fullest extent feasible.
              The City shall recognize, preserve and rehabilitate publicly owned historic resources
              and provide incentive programs to encourage the designation, protection, and
              preservation of privately owned historic resources. Various incentives or benefits to
              the property owner shall be considered, such as direct financial assistance, reduced
              permitting fees to upgrade structures, flexibility with regard to allowed uses,
              compliance with the State Historic Building Code rather than the Uniform Building
              Code, façade conservation easements, identification of grant sources, provision of
              information regarding rehabilitation loan financing, and tax advantages.
VH 5.5        Alterations to Historic Resources. [GP] Any proposed alterations to historic
              resources shall be subject to a Phase 1 and/or Phase 2 historical study. Any
              alterations deemed acceptable that may affect the historical integrity of a historic site
              or structure shall respect the character of the building and its setting and maintain
              architectural consistency with the original site or structure. Such proposals may
              require an evaluation from a cultural resources professional or landmarks
              commission and/or design review prior to approval. To encourage rehabilitation,
              maintenance, and sensitivity in additions and remodels, the City shall support
              adaptive reuse of historic sites and structures and may consider allowing for flexibility
              when applying zoning regulations that retain or promote the historical significance.
VH 5.6        Demolition of Historic Structures. [GP] Structures proposed for demolition shall be
              subject to a Phase 1 and/or Phase 2 historical study. If a structure or site is
              determined important to the city’s heritage, preservation or relocation shall be
              pursued before demolition. In the event preservation or relocation is not feasible
              and/or demolition is deemed acceptable, the Phase 1 and/or Phase 2 historical study
              shall identify appropriate mitigation measures, which may include but not be limited
              to the following:
              a. Provide public notice of the availability of the structure through advertisements or
                   other means.
              b. Salvage and reuse building elements that have value and may be irreplaceable
                   such as cornices, columns, mantels, doors, hardware, and lighting fixtures.
              c. Video- and photo-document the structure and its setting using archival quality
                   materials.
VH 5.7        New Construction. [GP] Development approved in proximity to an identified historic
              resource shall respect and be aesthetically compatible with the structures or sites in
              terms of scale, materials, and character.
VH 5.8        Public Information and Involvement. [GP] The City shall encourage and promote
              public awareness and appreciation of Goleta’s historic resources through measures
              such as informational guides and tours. The City shall support public recognition
              programs through awards and plaques that acknowledge designated or rehabilitated
              resources. The City shall encourage public participation in defining historic values of
              properties.
VH 5.9        Coordination with Other Organizations. [GP] The City shall coordinate with
              organizations such as the Goleta Valley Historical Society and Goleta Valley
September 2006                                                                                               6-21

              Beautiful to help foster community pride through identification, aesthetic
              improvement, and qualification of historic resources for designation.
VH 5.10       Historic Districts. [GP] The City may identify areas appropriate for the formation of
              Historic Districts as a means of preserving those areas that exemplify particular
              architectural styles and possess attributes that create a unique neighborhood
              character. The architectural significance of the structures and associated landscapes
              shall be protected by requiring any proposed alterations or adjacent development to
              be compatible with the heritage of the district. Demolition shall be discouraged.
Policy VH 6: Historical and Cultural Landscapes [GP]
Objective: To identify, preserve, protect, and enhance significant historic landscaping, gardens,
and open spaces, including agricultural areas and heritage trees, which contribute to the setting
or context of Goleta.
VH 6.1        Historical and Cultural Landscapes Definition. [GP]A cultural landscape is
              defined as a geographical area including both cultural and natural resources
              associated with a historic event, activity, or person. A historical landscape is
              composed of character-defining features that contribute to the physical appearance
              over time. Such features may include vegetation, topography, water features,
              circulation features, buildings, and furnishings such as lights, benches, or fences.
              Historical and cultural landscapes may have been created through specific intent of a
              designer or by vernacular means.
VH 6.2        Preservation. [GP]Historical and cultural landscapes and the heritage they
              represent shall be protected, preserved, and enhanced to the fullest extent feasible.
              Particular attention shall be paid to retention of the elements of agricultural areas that
              provide a historic context for buildings, such as the landscape around the caretaker’s
              residence on Bishop Ranch. The City may consider acquiring protective easements
              to maintain such landscapes.
6.5      IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS [GP]
VH-IA-1       Preparation and Adoption of New Zoning Code. The new zoning code may
              include requirements for design review, appropriate development standards, parking
              regulations, wireless communications regulations, and sign regulations. In addition, a
              Historic Resources Overlay Zone shall be included.

The State General Plan Guidelines recommend that the circulation policies and plans should:
integrate the transportation and circulation system with planned land uses; promote the safe
and efficient transport of goods and the safe and effective mobility of all segments of the
population; make efficient use of existing transportation facilities; and protect environmental
quality and promote the wise and equitable use of economic and natural resources.
Coastal Act Requirements [CP]
Generally, only short segments of Goleta’s arterial street system and U.S. Highway 101 (US-
101) and State Route 217 (SR-217) traverse areas within the California Coastal Zone.
Provisions of the Coastal Act promote maintenance and enhancement of public coastal access
by automobile and transit. New development is required to avoid overwhelming the local
circulation system so as to allow ease of public access. New or expanded public roadways must
be designed and limited to accommodate needs generated by planned new development.
Where existing or planned transportation infrastructure can accommodate only a limited amount
of new development, priority shall be given to coastal-dependent land uses so that they are not
precluded.
Existing Transportation System and Conditions: 2005 [GP]
Regional Setting
Goleta is situated on the south coast of Santa Barbara County along the US-101 and Union
Pacific Railroad (UPRR) corridors, which traverse the city from east to west and divide it into
northern and southern sections. The City has little or no control over regional traffic that passes
through Goleta on US-101 or on SR-217, which connects southward to the University of
September 2006                                                                                            7-1

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                          7.0 Transportation Element
California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus and the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport. Congestion
on these routes in the future will continue to affect traffic conditions on the city’s street network.
Even if the City limited future development within its boundaries entirely, traffic congestion
would continue to increase as a result of growth in surrounding areas and particularly at UCSB,
which is adjacent to the city’s southern boundary. At the same time, alternatives to automobile
travel are limited within Goleta and the urbanized south coast area.
Existing Street and Highway System
Goleta’s arterial network includes two
continuous east-west arterials that generally
parallel the US-101 corridor: Hollister Avenue
south of the freeway and Cathedral Oaks
Road to the north. All major north-south
arterials in the city have interchanges with
US-101: Patterson Avenue, Fairview Avenue,
Los Carneros Road, and Storke-Glen Annie
Road. Goleta experiences significant traffic
volumes and congestion, and these issues
rank high among the concerns of residents.
As traffic congestion increases, it can frustrate
drivers, waste fuel, contribute to pollution, and
reduce productivity and recreational time.
Because the area is largely developed and
                                                         Fairview/U.S. Highway 101 Overpass Traffic
nearly built out, the components of the city’s
future road system are already in place,
except for a limited number of new links proposed in this plan. A major emphasis in the future
will be on achieving more efficient utilization of the existing street network.
Traffic conditions are greatly influenced by the limited number of north-south crossings of US-
101 and the lack of a street grid system. These constraints reduce the connectivity of the street
system and contribute to congestion on the cross routes at their freeway ramps and at their
intersections with east-west arterials such as Hollister Avenue. Limited capacity on US-101,
which consists of two travel lanes each direction west of Fairview Avenue and three travel lanes
east to Santa Barbara, can result in pressure on the only two continuous parallel routes—
Hollister Avenue and Cathedral Oaks Road—as drivers seek alternate routes during periods of
severe travel delay on US-101.
Transit Services
The Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) provides public bus transit services in
Goleta and the south coast area. As of 2005, the structure of the governing board of MTD did
not provide for representation by Goleta. While Goleta’s low-density suburban residential
development pattern presents a challenge to transit providers, the concentration of larger-scale
employers and commercial services, particularly along the Hollister Corridor and at the UCSB
campus, offers opportunities for bus transit to play a larger role in the future. Additional
constraints are caused by limited funding to support public bus transportation services. As of
2005, several providers offered express commuter service to Goleta from Ventura County in the
south and from the Santa Ynez Valley, Lompoc, and Santa Maria in the north. Despite an
September 2006                                                                                            7-2

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                       7.0 Transportation Element
extensive route network within the Goleta area, for many potential users the bus transit system
was not competitive in 2005 with the automobile in terms of convenience and accessibility.
Passenger Rail Services
As of 2005, passenger rail service in Goleta was limited to Amtrak and state-supported service
in a corridor extending from San Diego to San Luis Obispo. These services use the UPRR
tracks, which are parallel and adjacent to US-101. The only terminal facilities in Goleta consist
of a passenger platform at La Patera Lane. Although the possibility of instituting commuter rail
service along the UPRR corridor between Goleta and Ventura County has been discussed by
regional organizations, no commitments or actions have been made as of 2005, and the
feasibility of such service and its potential role in reducing congestion on US-101 remain
unproven.
Existing and Forecasted Future Travel Conditions
The Goleta Travel Model, a detailed transportation model encompassing 162 traffic analysis
zones and 29 land-use variables within the city and surrounding portions of the Goleta Valley,
was developed for the General Plan by PTV America based on VISUM model software. The
model calibration is documented in a report by PTV America titled “City of Goleta 2005
Transportation Model Calibration Report,” dated September 2005. The model is a single-mode,
PM peak-period model that addresses auto travel. The Goleta Travel Model was employed by
Dowling Associates to forecast and evaluate future traffic conditions resulting from the Land Use
Plan set forth in the Land Use Element. The modeling tested several transportation system
alternatives to evaluate the effectiveness of various improvements in maintaining acceptable
levels of service (LOS) on city roadways. In addition, the transportation consequences of
several land use alternatives were evaluated. The modeling of various general plan scenarios is
documented in a report by Dowling Associates, Inc., titled “City of Goleta General Plan Traffic
Forecast Report.”
Figure 7-1 shows existing 2005 PM peak hour
traffic volumes and forecasted future traffic
volumes with full build-out, consistent with the
land use plan, on selected intersections and
roadways on the city’s street network. The
data indicate that increases in traffic volumes
of 25 percent or more can be expected on
some segments of the street system.
Table 7-1 shows the projected PM peak hour
LOS at each intersection evaluated in the
traffic model under three scenarios: the
existing condition as of 2005, buildout under
the land use plan assuming no improvements
to the transportation system, and buildout
                                                                    U.S. Highway 101
assuming improvements consistent with the
transportation plan. The data show that three
City intersections were deficient (LOS less than C) in 2005. The number of deficient
intersections would increase to 17 if growth were to continue in accordance with the proposed
land use plan without any improvement to the transportation system. The number of deficient

intersections is reduced to one with the implementation of the proposed transportation
improvements identified in this plan.
Table 7-2 identifies existing and projected average daily traffic volumes on various roadway
segments associated with the proposed land use plan. The data show that three street
segments were deficient in 2005. The number of deficient segments is expected to remain at
three if growth were to continue in accordance with the proposed land use plan without any
improvement to the transportation system. All deficient roadway segments would operate at
acceptable service levels with implementation of the proposed transportation improvements
identified in this plan.
Transportation Issues and Needs
As a result of the transportation modeling and community input at numerous public workshop
meetings, the following transportation issues and needs were identified:
1. A need for more north-south crossings of US-101 to relieve congestion on cross-routes with
     interchanges.
2. A need to reconstruct an obsolete and/or deteriorated freeway interchange.
3. A need for major operational improvements to improve traffic flow and safety for bicyclists
     and pedestrians on Hollister Avenue in the Old Town area.
4. A need to reduce congestion on Hollister Avenue in Old Town by creating an alternative
     route to divert trips via Ekwill Street and Fowler Street to South Kellogg Avenue and the SR-
     217 interchange.
5. Concerns regarding deterioration in LOS at several key intersections, and the need for
     reasonable alternatives to reduce intersection congestion.
6. Concerns about improving safety, for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians, at a number of
     locations within the city.
7. A concern that future transportation improvements be consistent with the existing and
     desired character of the community.
8. A need for convenient and accessible transit alternatives for commuters.
9. Concerns regarding substantial growth anticipated at UCSB and the university’s
     participation in mitigating the traffic impacts on Goleta’s street network.
10. Concerns regarding adequate maintenance and repair of streets in the future.
11. A key issue or concern is uncertainty regarding adequacy of funding sources to meet some
     transportation needs.

7.2      GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND GOALS [GP/CP]
The purpose of the Transportation Element is to set forth the plan for a safe, efficient, and
adequate transportation system for Goleta. To meet this purpose, the Transportation Element
addresses the general transportation and circulation improvements needed to provide adequate
capacity for future land uses as well as to resolve existing deficiencies. This element contains
goals and policies to improve overall circulation in Goleta and ensure that future development is
supported by appropriate transportation facilities. For vehicular transportation, the city’s
roadway network is classified in a hierarchical system based upon intended function and
anticipated traffic levels, and appropriate design standards are specified for each type of
roadway. Acceptable levels of service are established to determine when capacity
improvements are necessary. Because local circulation is closely linked with the regional
system, the element supports regional programs to alleviate traffic congestion and construct
capacity improvements. Alternative transportation modes are also identified in this element to
reduce dependency on the automobile and improve environmental quality.
The following guiding principles and goals, which are not in order of priority, provide the
foundation for the Transportation Element. All policies set forth in subsequent sections of this
element have been established to conform to the guiding principles and goals, and future
actions of the City following adoption of the plan are required to be consistent.
1. Plan and provide transportation facilities and services in a manner that reinforces, rather
     than detracts from, the character of the community and its quality of life.
2. Ensure that transportation improvements are provided on a timely basis to support new
     development without reducing the LOS to unacceptable levels.
3. Create and maintain a cost-effective and efficient transportation network that meets the
     mobility needs of all users.
4. Provide a transportation system that increases choice for intra-city and regional travelers
     and limits or reduces congestion on city roads.
5. Create a convenient, safe, and well-maintained street network.
6. Create and maintain a balanced and diversified transportation system with choice of modes,
     including expanded bus transit, rail, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities, to manage congestion
     and improve mobility.
7. Improve connectivity between the various travel modes, including auto, bus, rail, bicycle,
     and pedestrian facilities.
8. Lessen future increases in individual auto travel, particularly during peak commute periods,
     by enabling mixed-use development, maintaining jobs-housing balance, and designating
     lands for higher density residential use in the Hollister Transit Corridor.
9. Guide future transportation investments in a manner that will increase safety, improve traffic
     flows, and reduce congestion on local roadways.
7.3      COASTAL ACT POLICIES [CP]
The Coastal Act policies set forth below are adopted as policies of this plan for those areas of
Goleta within the California Coastal Zone. The numbers refer to sections of the California Public
Resources Code. The Transportation Element maps show the location of the Coastal Zone
boundary.

30252         The location and amount of new development should maintain and enhance public
              access to the coast by (1) facilitating the provision or extension of transit service, (2)
              providing commercial facilities within or adjoining residential development or other
              areas that will minimize the use of coastal access roads, (3) providing nonautomobile
              circulation within the development, (4) providing adequate parking facilities or
              providing substitute means of serving the development with public transportation, (5)
              assuring the potential for public transit for high intensity uses such as high-rise office
              buildings, and by (6) assuring that the recreational needs of new residents will not
              overload nearby coastal recreation resources by correlating the amount of
              development with local park acquisition and development plans with the provision of
              onsite recreational facilities to serve the new development.
30254         New or expanded public works facilities shall be designed and limited to
              accommodate needs generated by development or uses permitted consistent with
              the provisions of this division; provided, however, that it is the intent of the
              Legislature that State Highway Route 1 in rural areas of the Coastal Zone remain a
              scenic two-lane road. Special districts shall not be formed or expanded except where
              assessment for, and provision of, the service would not induce new development
              inconsistent with this division. Where existing or planned public works facilities can
              accommodate only a limited amount of new development, services to coastal-
              dependent land use, essential public services and basic industries vital to the
              economic health of the region, state, or nation, public recreation, commercial
              recreation, and visitor-serving land uses shall not be precluded by other
              development.
7.4      CITY POLICIES
Policy TE 1: Integrated Multi-Modal Transportation System [GP/CP]
Objectives: To create and maintain a balanced and integrated transportation system to support
the mobility needs of Goleta’s residents and workforce, with choice of bus transit, bicycle, and
pedestrian as well as private automobile modes. To reduce the percentage of peak-hour
person-trips that are made by automobile and provide the facilities that will enable diversion of
trips from automobiles to other modes. To develop, maintain, and operate a balanced, safe, and
efficient multimodal transportation system to serve all persons, special-needs populations, and
activities in the community.
TE 1.1        Alternative Modes. [GP/CP] The City’s intent shall be to achieve a realistic and
              cost-effective balance between travel modes, including bikeways, pedestrian
              circulation, and bus transit. The City shall encourage the use of alternative modes of
              transportation, such as bus transit, bicycling, and walking, which have the additional
              beneficial effect of reducing consumption of non-renewable energy sources.
TE 1.2        Transportation and Land Use. [GP/CP] The design of the City’s transportation
              infrastructure and services, and investments in future improvements, shall be
              supportive of the land use plan set forth in the Land Use Element and responsive to
              the transportation impacts of development located in nearby areas outside the city
              boundary. The design of and improvements to Goleta's transportation system should
              accommodate not only existing conditions, but also projected growth based on the
September 2006                                                                                              7-8

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                          7.0 Transportation Element
              Land Use Element of this plan and planned growth in adjacent jurisdictions, including
              UCSB, the County, and the City of Santa Barbara.
TE 1.3        Improved Connectivity in Street, Pedestrian, and Bikeway Systems. [GP/CP] In
              developing the future transportation system, the City will place priority on creating
              one or more additional non-interchange crossings of US-101 to connect the
              community from north to south. The intent shall be to facilitate cross-town traffic,
              improve bicycle and pedestrian flow and safety, and to relieve traffic congestion on
              cross-routes with freeway interchanges.
TE 1.4        Multi-Use Street System. [GP/CP] The City shall emphasize geometric
              configurations for street and intersections that will readily accommodate transit
              vehicles and other travel modes as well as to improve traffic flows and turning
              movements for automobiles. These actions shall be balanced with safety
              considerations and the value the community places on not widening roads and
              intersections to the extent that roadways would be inconsistent with desired
              community character.
TE 1.5        Multimodal Transportation Center. [GP] The City supports consideration of a
              multimodal transportation center in the city to facilitate interconnection and transfers
              between express bus routes, automobile, bicycle and pedestrian circulation, and
              potentially commuter and other passenger rail services. While a proposed area in the
              vicinity of the current Amtrak terminal should be studied, alternative sites should also
              be explored; the ultimate location will depend on the results of such study.
TE 1.6        Development Review. [GP/CP] As a condition of approval of new non-residential
              projects, the City may require developers to provide improvements that will reduce
              the use of single-occupancy vehicles. These improvements may include, but are not
              limited to, the following:
              a. Preferential parking spaces for carpools.
              b. Bicycle storage, parking spaces, and shower facilities for employees.
              c. Bus turnouts and shelters at bus stops.
              d. Other improvements as may be appropriate to the site.
Policy TE 2: Transportation Demand Management [GP]
Objective: To attempt to influence individual travel behavior, particularly by workers at larger-
scale employers, to lower future increases in peak-hour commute trips and other trips by
persons in single-occupant vehicles.
TE 2.1        Reduction/Shifting of Peak-Hour Vehicle Trips. [GP] The City supports efforts to
              limit traffic congestion through reducing low-occupancy auto trips and shifting peak-
              hour vehicle trips to off-peak hours. Possible means for accomplishing this include
              the following:
              a. Increased telecommuting.
              b. Establishment of flexible work schedules.

              j.   Bus pass programs for employees.
              k. Public information and promotion of ridesharing.
TE 2.2        Land Use Strategies to Reduce Automobile Travel Demand. [GP] The City
              supports the following land use strategies, as provided in the Land Use and Housing
              Elements, which may enable greater reliance by commuters, shoppers, and others,
              on alternative modes of travel:
              a. Live-work development, wherein residential units in some areas may be
                   designed to include work spaces for the residents.
              b. Mixed-use development on individual sites, whereby residential and non-
                   residential uses are permitted in an integrated development project on a single
                   site.
              c. Mixed-use development within particular subareas of the city, whereby varying
                   uses on separate parcels are located in close proximity to one another so as to
                   enable walking and bicycling between residences, workplaces, and shopping
                   areas. These sub-areas include, but are not limited to: Old Town, the Hollister
                   Corridor, and the Calle Real-Fairview Avenue areas.
              d. The provision of onsite commercial services for employees in new non-residential
                   development, such as but not limited to cafeterias, childcare, financial services,
                   convenience retail services, concierge services, and others as appropriate.
              e. The provision of onsite or nearby employee housing within business parks, office
                   and institutional uses, and other employment concentrations as appropriate, to
                   encourage walking to work.
TE 2.3        Diversion of Automobile Trips to
              Alternative Modes. [GP] The City
              encourages investment in
              alternative modes of travel that will
              make those modes more
              competitive with auto travel in
              terms of convenience,
              accessibility, costs, and safety.
              These may include, but are not
              limited to, improvements in the bus
              transit system, the bikeway
              system, pedestrian circulation
                                                                   Old Town MTD Bus Stop

              system, and potentially commuter rail services, if the region should determine to
              pursue this option.
TE 2.4        Employer-Based or Project-Based Transportation Management Plans. [GP]
              When appropriate, the City may as a condition of approval require proposed larger-
              sized non-residential developments with 100 or more employees to prepare and
              adopt a Transportation Management Plan (TMP) and to maintain a designated
              Transportation Manager. The TMP shall establish quantified objectives for trip
              reduction and shall identify the specific measures that will be employed to
              accomplish trip reduction, including but not limited to the measures identified in TE
              2.1. The Transportation Manager shall work with Santa Barbara County Association
              of Governments’ (SBCAG) Traffic Solutions (the county’s rideshare organization) and
              the City in developing, implementing, and monitoring the TDM measures and shall
              provide an annual report to the City on the status and effectiveness of the measures.
TE 2.5        City of Goleta TDM Program. [GP] The City shall establish a program that will
              provide measures or incentives to encourage reduction in vehicle trips, including
              commute trips, by its employees. These measures may include but are not limited to
              the actions identified in TE 2.1.
TE 2.6        Reduction of School-Related Automobile Traffic. [GP] The City encourages
              public and private schools to adopt TDM Plans and to implement trip reduction
              programs to reduce congestion on streets near schools caused by commuting
              students and staff. Potential measures include funding for safe routes to schools,
              encouraging MTD and other transit providers to offer free or reduced-cost bus
              passes for students and employees, increased funding of school buses, and others
              as appropriate.
Policy TE 3: Streets and Highways Plan and Standards [GP/CP]
Objective: To provide a street network, including appropriate provisions for bicycles and
pedestrians, that is adequate to support the mobility needs of city residents and businesses.
TE 3.1        Overall Street Plan. [GP/CP] Figure 7-2 shows the traffic circulation plan for Goleta.
              The map classifies the city’s street system by function and identifies major
              intersections that either have or may require signalization in the future. Future street
              improvements shall be consistent with the functional classifications designated in
              Figure 7-2.
TE 3.2        Freeways. [GP/CP] US-101 and SR-217 are designated as freeways for their entire
              length in Goleta, as shown in Figure 7-2. The rights-of-way for these routes are
              controlled and managed by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).
              The following policies and standards shall apply to roads designated as freeways:
              a. Definition/function. A freeway is a four- or six-lane divided highway with full
                   control of access by grade-separated interchanges at intersections. Freeways
                   serve as the principal routes for the inter- and intrastate system of highways,
                   carrying large volumes of high-speed traffic between regions, cities, major traffic
                   generators, and points of interest. As the highest level of road facility, freeways
                   are designed and managed to provide maximum service and safety for through
                   traffic.
September 2006                                                                                            7-11

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                               7.0 Transportation Element
              b. Design Standards. The following standards shall apply:
                   1) The number of travel lanes may vary from two to three in each direction.
                   2) Auxiliary lanes may be provided to allow easy access from one interchange
                        to the next without the need for local traffic to merge into through-travel lanes.
                   3) Interchanges shall provide for grade separation with cross-routes; priority in
                        signalization at the intersection of ramps with the cross-route should be given
                        to flow of traffic on the freeway.
              c. Additional Travel Lanes. One additional travel lane in each direction from
                   Fairview Avenue west to the planned new interchange at Cathedral
                   Oaks/Hollister Avenue may be provided in the future to create six travel lanes
                   along the entire length of US-101 within Goleta.
              d. Interchange Improvements. Appropriate operational improvements may be
                   provided at interchanges to assure maintenance of LOS standards and safety.
              e. Landscaping. Freeway medians and rights-of-way shall be appropriately
                   landscaped. The City supports landscaping improvements that will upgrade the
                   visual quality of the freeway corridors.
              f.   Viewsheds. Improvements to the freeway system shall be provided in a way that
                   will maintain existing views of the ocean and mountains to the greatest extent
                   feasible.
              g. Noise Buffers. Where warranted, noise buffers may be provided along the US-
                   101 right-of-way to mitigate noise impacts on adjacent residential uses or other
                   noise-sensitive land uses.
TE 3.3        Major Arterials. [GP/CP] Roads
              designated as major arterials are
              shown in Figure 7-2. The following
              criteria and standards shall apply
              to roads designated as major
              arterials:
              a. Definition/Function: Major
                   arterials are continuous routes
                   that carry through traffic
                   between various
                   neighborhoods and
                   communities, frequently
                   providing access to major
                   traffic generators such as
                                                                 Major Arterial—Los Carneros Overpass
                   shopping areas, employment
                   centers, recreational areas, higher-density residential areas, and places of
                   assembly. Driveway access, especially for residential uses, to a major arterial is
                   generally discouraged or kept to a minimum in order to facilitate traffic flows.
              b. Access to Abutting Properties. Although established patterns of development in
                   Goleta have created driveways along most arterial segments, access to abutting
                   properties shall be managed to maximize safety and functionality for through
                   traffic, including but not limited to the following characteristics:
September 2006                                                                                                7-12

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                                7.0 Transportation Element
                   1) Driveways shall have sufficient width to minimize conflicts between through
                        traffic and turning movements.
                   2) Driveways shall adhere to safe sight-distance requirements to the extent
                        feasible.
                   3) New development abutting major and minor arterials shall accommodate safe
                        ingress and egress without necessitating backing movements into the arterial.
                   4) Where feasible, sharing driveways with adjoining properties is encouraged,
                        with provision of reciprocal access easements.
                   Where street standards cannot be fully met and access from the arterial must be
                   approved due to the absence of any other feasible and practicable alternative,
                   development intensity may be reduced on the site to lessen or avoid potential
                   traffic safety hazards and vehicular conflicts.
              c. Design Standards. The following standards shall apply:
                   1) A principal or major arterial may be a divided or an undivided multi-lane road,
                        with or without center median.
                   2) The maximum number of through-travel lanes shall be two lanes in each
                        direction except for street segments between US-101 and Hollister Avenue,
                        where the maximum number of lanes shall be three lanes in each direction.
                   3) Lane widths and intersection geometrics shall be adequate to accommodate
                        transit vehicles and large trucks.
                   4) Intersections of arterials with cross-routes are provided at grade, although
                        partial control of access may occur at some locations. Intersection controls
                        shall give priority to traffic flow on the arterial rather than the cross-route.
                   5) Major arterials shall include facilities to accommodate pedestrians and
                        bicycles.
                   6) At a minimum, major arterials shall include curbs, gutters, and sidewalks.
                        Major arterials may include landscaped medians and/or landscaped strips
                        between curb and sidewalk.
                   7) Parking may be provided in appropriate segments on either or both sides of
                        the street.
TE 3.4        Minor Arterials. [GP] Routes designated as minor arterials are shown in Figure 7-2.
              The following criteria and standards apply to these roads:
              a. Definition/Function: Minor arterials serve as a secondary type of arterial facility
                   carrying local through traffic within communities, frequently providing access to
                   shopping areas, employment centers, recreational areas, residential areas, and
                   places of assembly. A minor arterial may connect different neighborhood areas
                   within the city.
              b. Design Standards: The following standards shall apply:
                   1) A minor arterial may be a divided or an undivided multi-lane road, with or
                        without center median.
September 2006                                                                                                 7-13
Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                               7.0 Transportation Element
                   2) The number of through-travel lanes is usually one lane in each direction,
                       although two lanes may be provided on particular segments, when warranted
                       by traffic volumes.
                   3) Lane widths and intersection geometrics shall be adequate to accommodate
                       transit vehicles and large trucks.
                   4) Intersections of arterials with cross-routes are provided at grade, although
                       partial control of access may occur at some locations. Intersection controls
                       shall give priority to traffic flow on the minor arterial rather than the cross-
                       route, except where the cross-route is a major arterial.
                   5) Minor arterials shall include facilities to accommodate pedestrians and
                       bicycles.
                   6) At a minimum, minor arterials shall include curbs, gutters, and sidewalks.
                       Minor arterials may include landscaped medians and/or landscaped strips
                       between curb and sidewalk.
                   7) Parking may be required in appropriate segments on either or both sides of
                       the street.
TE 3.5        Collector Streets and Roads. [GP/CP] Routes designated as collector streets are
              shown in Figure 7-2. The following criteria and standards apply to these roads:
              a. Definition/Function: Collector streets and roads function to collect traffic from
                   local streets and roads and to carry that traffic to major or minor arterials.
                   Collectors may also link two arterials as well as collecting traffic from local streets
                   and abutting driveways. Collector roads are designed to provide access to local
                   streets within residential and commercial areas or to connect streets of higher
                   classifications to permit adequate traffic circulation.
              b. Collector Road Design Standards: The following standards shall apply:
                   1) Collector streets shall generally not exceed two travel lanes (one lane in each
                       direction) and shall generally be undivided roads.
                   2) Collectors generally should not form a continuous system, so that they cannot
                       easily be used as substitutes for arterials.
                   3) Intersections of collectors with cross-routes are provided at grade.
                       Intersection controls shall give priority to traffic flow on the arterial rather than
                       the collector.
                   4) Collector streets and roads shall include facilities to accommodate
                       pedestrians and bicycles.
                   5) At a minimum, collectors shall include curbs, gutters, and sidewalks.
                       Collectors may include landscaped strips between curb and sidewalk.
                   6) Parking may be required in appropriate segments on either or both sides of
                       the street.

TE 3.6        Local Streets and Roads.
              [GP/CP] All roads not specifically
              designated in another category
              shall be classified as local streets
              and rural roads as shown in Figure
              7-2. The following criteria and
              standards apply to local streets
              and roads:
              a. Definition/Function. A local
                   street provides access to
                   abutting individual properties
                   and links such properties and
                   their uses to a collector street.
                   City street standards shall                              Local Street
                   ensure that local streets
                   provide access to abutting properties and should include a variety of designs and
                   spacing, depending on access needs. Local streets are intended to serve only
                   adjacent uses and are intended to protect residents from the impacts of through
                   traffic.
              b. Design Standards. The following standards shall apply:
                   1) Local streets and roads shall be designed in a manner consistent with the
                        character of the adjacent neighborhood and uses and any physical and
                        environmental constraints.
                   2) In appropriate segments, full urban street standards shall be required,
                        including curb, gutter, and sidewalks on both sides of the street. Bicycle lanes
                        should be provided if the street is designated as a Class 2 bicycle route in the
                        City’s Bicycle Transportation Plan.
                   3) City street standards should encourage residential access points to be
                        located on the least traveled roadway wherever there is an option.
                   4) Parking may be required in appropriate segments on either or both sides of
                        the street.
              c. Other. New multi-family residential and commercial development should not have
                   primary access on local streets, except where there is no feasible alternative.
              d. Traffic Calming. The City shall emphasize the use of local streets for local access
                   and residential traffic in order to minimize traffic noise, congestion, and other
                   hazards to residential uses and pedestrians. Through traffic may be discouraged
                   by a variety of methods, such as installation of traffic calming devices, provided
                   there is involvement and support from the immediate neighborhood.
TE 3.7        Guidelines for Geometric Cross Sections. [GP/CP] The following guidelines shall
              apply to determinations of appropriate cross sections for particular street segments:
              a. Travel lanes should have a typical width of 12 feet.
              b. Turn lanes have a typical width of 11 feet.
              c. The typical width for on-street parking is 8 feet.
              d. Center medians, where required, typically have widths of 14 feet.
September 2006                                                                                               7-15

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                               7.0 Transportation Element
              e. The typical width for a bike lane is 5 feet.
              f.   The typical width for a sidewalk is 6 feet in residential areas, with a greater width
                   in commercial areas.
              g. The typical width of a parkway or planting strip between curb and sidewalk is 6
                   feet.
TE 3.8        Truck Routes. [GP] Primary truck routes shall be limited to freeways and major and
              minor arterials within the city. The City may designate or prohibit use of particular
              streets by any commercial vehicle exceeding a maximum gross weight. However,
              any street so restricted may continue to be used by such vehicles for pickups and
              deliveries of goods, merchandise, or construction materials to any building or site
              located on the restricted route.
TE 3.9        Right-of-Way Dedications and Improvements. [GP/CP] Existing and future rights-
              of-way may vary along different segments of individual streets within a single
              functional classification, based upon the existing patterns of development along the
              various segments. The appropriate street cross section, frontage improvements, and
              right-of-way dedications shall be established by the City Engineer when imposing
              conditions of approval for development applications on abutting parcels. Dedications
              of right-of-way may be greater in locations where it is appropriate to secure space for
              utilities, street appurtenances, transit facilities, and landscaped areas.
Policy TE 4: Target Level of Service Standards [GP]
Objectives: To maintain an adequate LOS on the city street system, including at intersections,
to provide for the mobility needs of the community. To avoid further degradation of service
levels at intersections where existing service levels do not meet target standards.
TE 4.1        General Level of Service Standard. [GP] A traffic LOS standard C shall apply
              citywide to major arterials, minor arterials, and collector roadways and signalized and
              unsignalized intersections, except as provided in TE 4.2. The standard shall apply to
              daily traffic volumes and both AM and PM peak hours for intersections, and to
              average daily traffic volumes (ADT) for roadway segments. Table 7-3 provides
              descriptions of the LOS categories.
TE 4.2        Modified Level of Service
              Standard for Specific
              Intersections at Planned
              Capacity. [GP] Any intersection
              or arterial link that is developed
              to the maximum permitted
              number of lanes (see Policy TE
              3 and TE 6.5) shall be
              considered to be at “planned
              capacity,” and the forecasted
              volume to capacity ratio with all
              planned transportation
              improvements, as shown in
              Table 7-1, shall be the applicable
              LOS standard. As of 2005, the                  Storke and Hollister Intersection at the
                                                                    Camino Real Marketplace
September 2006                                                                                                7-16

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                                                    7.0 Transportation Element
               Storke-Hollister intersection was the only intersection in the city at “planned
               capacity,” and the applicable volume to capacity standard is 0.89.

 LOS        Description of Operation                                                                                    V/C Ratio
 A          Describes primarily free-flow conditions at average travel speeds. Vehicles are seldom                      < 0.60
            impeded in their ability to maneuver in the traffic stream. Delay at intersections is minimal.
 B          Represents reasonably unimpeded operations at average travel speeds. The ability to                         0.61 – 0.70
            maneuver in the traffic stream is slightly restricted and delays are not bothersome.
 C          Represents stable operations; however, ability to change lanes and maneuver may be                          0.71 – 0.80
            more restricted than LOS B and long queues are experienced at intersections.
 D          Congestion occurs, and a small change in volumes increases delays substantially.                            0.81 – 0.90
 E          Severe congestion occurs with extensive delays, and low travel speeds occur.                                0.91 – 1.00
 F          Characterizes arterial flow at extremely low speeds, and intersection congestion occurs                     > 1.00
            with high delays and extensive queuing.
 Note: LOS is commonly used as a qualitative description of intersection operation and is based on the capacity of the
 intersection and the volume of traffic using the intersection. Intersection capacity analysis evaluates the operation of an
 intersection using a range of LOS from LOS A (free-flow conditions) to LOS F (severely congested conditions) based on
 corresponding Volume/Capacity (V/C) ratios shown in the table.
TE 4.3         Deficiency Correction Plans. [GP] When the LOS for any intersection or arterial
               link at planned capacity falls below base year standards which are expressed in
               Table 7-1, the City shall require a Deficiency Plan to be prepared prior to approving
               any development that would further lower the LOS. The Deficiency Plan shall
               consider alternative transportation improvements, including alternative modes. Any
               improvements established in the adopted Deficiency Plan may be provided as
               mitigation by new development or included in the impact fee system. The Deficiency
               Plan shall be prepared by the City or at the City’s direction within 90 days of
               publication of a City-approved traffic report indicating degradation of service below
               base year standards which are expressed in Table 7-1. (Amended by Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)
TE 4.4         Level of Service Analysis Methodology. [GP] The City Engineer shall develop
               appropriate standards and methods for determining the LOS at intersections and
               road links, including unsignalized intersections. These methods may include the
               Intersection Capacity Utilization and the Caltrans Highway Capacity Manual
               methodologies, or other appropriate methods.
TE 4.5         Traffic Improvement Master Plan. [GP] The City shall prepare and maintain a
               master plan for street system improvements necessary to accommodate future
               growth allowed by the Land Use Element and to maintain acceptable levels of
               service. The initial plan shall include the major improvements specified in Policy TE
               5, as well as any additional improvements determined to be appropriate.
TE 4.6         LOS Effects of Future Land Use Plan Amendments. [GP] Any amendment to the
               Land Use Element that would increase impacts on arterials and intersections at
               ultimate capacity shall include the development and implementation of transportation
               measures that would not reduce the LOS (increase the traffic volume to roadway
               capacity [v/c] ratio) of these facilities.

Policy TE 5: Planned Street and Road Improvements [GP/CP]
Objective: To identify and describe the major future improvements to the street and highway
system that will be needed to accommodate the forecasted future traffic volumes, based upon
the Land Use Plan, at acceptable levels of service.
TE 5.1        General. [GP/CP] Proposed major street and highway improvements are shown in
              Figure 7-3 and Table 7-4. Major proposed improvements are deemed necessary to
              maintain the City’s LOS standards as set forth in this plan. Additional recommended
              improvements may be appropriate in the long term and are desirable to enhance
              Goleta’s circulation system, but are not necessary to maintain LOS standards.
              Specific improvements will be implemented as conditions require and funding is
              available. The design of specific improvement projects will be determined as each
              project is implemented.
TE 5.2        Replacement of the Cathedral Oaks/Hollister Interchange. [GP/CP] The major
              planned projects include replacement of the Cathedral Oaks/Hollister interchange
              with US-101 due to deterioration of the existing overpass structure caused by
              reactive aggregates in the original construction. The new interchange will be
              relocated slightly to the east to align directly with Cathedral Oaks Road and Hollister
              Avenue. The new overpass structure shall include provisions for bicycles and
              pedestrians.
TE 5.3        Ekwill–Fowler–South Kellogg Improvements. [GP/CP] This planned major project
              includes construction of new segments of Ekwill Street and Fowler Street to connect
              these streets in a direct alignment with Fairview Avenue and with a southern
              extension of South Kellogg Avenue, which extends north to Hollister Avenue at its
              interchange with SR-217. The intent of this project is to more efficiently collect
              existing and future traffic from the southern portion of the Old Town area and from
              the Santa Barbara Airport, and to divert a portion of trips having origins or
              destinations in this area away from a congested segment of Hollister Avenue in Old
              Town between Fairview Avenue and SR-217. Related purposes of this project are to
              improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians along Hollister Avenue in Old Town and
              to help facilitate revitalization efforts in the Goleta Old Town Redevelopment Project
              Area.
TE 5.4        Hollister Avenue (Old Town) Redesign Improvements. [GP] This major project is
              intended to provide substantial operational improvements along Hollister Avenue in
              the central Old Town area between Fairview Avenue and the SR 217 interchange.
              The purposes include improvement of traffic flow, improved facilities for bicyclists
              and pedestrians, and improved safety at intersections. A related intent is to help
              facilitate revitalization efforts in the Goleta Old town Redevelopment Project Area.
TE 5.5        New US-101 Freeway Crossings. [GP] Two planned major projects are new grade-
              separated freeway crossings without interchanges at US-101, to link northern and
              southern portions of Goleta. The planned new crossings are intended to connect
              Calle Real with Hollister Avenue, generally at Ellwood Station Road in western
              Goleta and at La Patera Road in the central Hollister area. The effect of these
              projects is to create alternative routes that will divert vehicle trips away from existing
              heavily used cross-routes with freeway interchanges. The purpose is to reduce
              congestion and improve LOS on these routes, particularly at the freeway ramps and

               at the intersections with Hollister Avenue and Calle Real. These projects will assist
               with congestion relief on two cross routes, Storke Road and Los Carneros Road,
               which provide access to and from UCSB, and will help mitigate future increases in
               traffic associated with development in Goleta and growth at the university. The
               precise alignments and design of the new freeway crossings will be determined by
               specific studies in the future.
TE 5.6         Extension of Overpass Road. [GP] The Overpass Road Extension Project is
               designed to connect the existing Overpass Road with Hollister Avenue at a new
               signalized intersection. The primary purpose of this major project is to accommodate
               traffic generated by planned residential development along the route extension. The
               project will also help reduce congestion at the Overpass Road/Patterson Avenue and

              the Patterson Avenue/Hollister Avenue intersections by diverting some westbound
              vehicle trips to the new route. This project is also located within the Goleta Old Town
              Redevelopment Project Area.
TE 5.7        Connection of Phelps Road. [GP/CP] This planned project will provide a
              connection between the present eastern terminus of Phelps Road and Los Carneros
              Road to the east, aligning with the intersection of Mesa Road and Los Carneros
              Road. The purpose of this project is to improve LOS on Hollister Avenue, Storke
              Road, Los Carneros Road, and El Colegio Road by enabling traffic between western
              Goleta and UCSB to utilize a direct alternative route to these roads. This project will
              also assist with reducing future congestion at the Storke Road/Hollister Avenue
              intersection.
TE 5.8        Reconstruction of Los Carneros Bridge Over the Union Pacific Railroad
              Tracks. [GP] The major planned projects include replacement of the Los Carneros
              Road bridge over the UPRR tracks, which is needed due to deterioration of the
              existing bridge structure caused by reactive aggregates in the original construction.
              The new bridge structure shall include provisions for improved level-of-service at the
              Los Carneros/US-101 southbound ramp intersection and the accommodation of
              bicycles and pedestrians.
TE 5.9        Street Frontage Improvements. [GP/CP] These projects are intended to provide
              substantial operational improvements along South Fairview Avenue and the western
              segment of Hollister Avenue. The purposes include improvement of traffic flow,
              better facilities for bicyclists and pedestrians, and increased safety at intersections. A
              particular intent for the South Fairview Avenue improvement is to help accommodate
              future increases in auto travel associated with terminal expansion and growth in
              scheduled air carrier services at the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.
TE 5.10       Major Intersection Improvements. [GP/CP] Improvements may be made to key
              intersections identified in Figure 7-3 to increase capacity and improve LOS when
              warranted as a result of future increases in traffic. Such improvements may include
              installation of controls such as stop signs or traffic signals, changes in signal timing,
              addition of through-travel lanes and/or dedicated turn lanes (except where limited by
              TE 6.5), construction of islands and/or other improvements for pedestrians, and other
              improvements as determined to be appropriate. Maintaining pedestrian safety and
              compatibility of the scale of improvements with neighborhood character shall be
              primary considerations in determining the appropriate improvements at individual
              intersections.
TE 5.11       Additional Lanes on US-101 West of Fairview Avenue. [GP/CP] This major
              project, identified as #11 in Figure 7-3, includes the addition of one travel lane in
              each direction on US-101 from Fairview Avenue west to the new interchange at
              Cathedral Oaks Road/Hollister Avenue. This improvement will reduce constraints
              created by high traffic volumes on US-101 and allow diversions of traffic from city
              streets to the freeway, thereby contributing to improved LOS on local streets.
TE 5.12       Storke Road Capacity Improvements—Hollister to US-101. [GP] This project,
              identified as #12 in Figure 7-3, includes the addition of up to one lane in each
              direction on Storke Road from Hollister Avenue to US-101. This would be
              accomplished by widening the roadway and/or reconfiguring the existing turn lane.

              [GP/CP] This project, identified as #13 in Figure 7-3, includes the addition of up to
              one lane in each direction on Storke Road south of Whittier Drive to the southern city
              limit. This would be accomplished by widening the roadway and/or reconfiguring the
              existing travel lanes.
TE 5.14       Los Carneros Road Capacity Improvements. [GP] This project, identified as #14
              in Figure 7-3, includes the addition of one lane in each direction on Los Carneros
              south of Hollister Avenue to the southern City limit.
TE 5.15       Other Improvements. [GP] In addition to the major street improvement projects
              described herein, additional minor improvements to the City’s street network may be
              undertaken in the future to respond to changing traffic conditions.
TE 5.16       Traffic Monitoring. [GP] The City shall periodically monitor traffic conditions over
              time on an as-needed basis. Based on such evaluations, the City shall identify any
              additional traffic improvements to achieve the target LOS, reduce congestion, and
              address safety concerns.
TE 5.17       Periodic Update of Major Improvements. [GP] As conditions change, planned
              major roadway improvements may be identified through the annual General Plan
              Review and status report process required by California Government Code Section
              65500. Amendment of the General Plan shall be required for any substantial change
              to the major projects identified in this policy.
TE 5.18       Timing of Roadway Improvements. [GP] Roadway improvements shall be
              periodically prioritized to be correlated with impacts caused by new development, to
              reflect the degree of need for mitigation, and to reflect future changes in congestion
              and/or LOS. The timing of construction of planned major improvements will also be
              affected by the availability of funding.

              based upon the existing conditions and constraints along each segment (see also TE
              3.9).
TE 6.3        Drainage. [GP] New transportation facilities should be designed in a manner that
              minimizes impacts on natural drainage patterns and protects water quality while
              accommodating transportation needs.
TE 6.4        Streetscape Amenities. [GP] Street design standards should incorporate
              appropriate pedestrian and neighborhood-enhancing elements in roadway design
              based on the density of development and the type of roadway. These elements may
              include wider sidewalks, separated sidewalks, planting strips, landscaped medians,
              benches, street trees, and pedestrian-oriented streetlights.

TE 6.5        Limitation on Expansion of Intersections. [GP] No city intersection, excluding
              freeway ramps and the Storke/Hollister intersection, shall exceed a total of seven
              lanes on any leg including through-travel lanes and turn lanes, even if this
              requirement reduces the LOS below the target LOS set forth in Subpolicies TE 4.1
              and TE 4.2. (Amended by Reso. 08-30, 6/17/08)
TE 6.6        Street Trees and Landscaping Guidelines. [GP] The City shall develop a street
              tree guide for selecting appropriate tree species for landscaped and median strips,
              sidewalks, and other landscaped right-of-way areas.
TE 6.7        Widths of Paved Surfaces. [GP] New rights of way and access easements should
              be paved to the smallest dimension necessary to accommodate their designed
              function (including emergency access) and to maintain the character of the
              neighborhood.

Objectives: To support the efforts by MTD and other transit providers to sustain and expand
the bus transit system to serve the needs of local and regional commuters, the transit-
dependent population, and other users in a convenient, reliable, and efficient manner. To
increase bus ridership levels in order to reduce peak-period automobile trips on area roadways.
TE 7.1        Transit Network. [GP/CP] The
              existing (2005) bus route network
              is shown in Figure 7-4, along with
              certain proposed future facility
              improvements. The City supports
              efforts by MTD and other transit
              providers to develop and maintain
              convenient, efficient, and reliable
              bus transit services in the city and
              in the Goleta Valley area.
TE 7.2        Linkage between Transit
              Services and Land Use. [GP/CP]
              The City shall work with MTD and

              convenient, reliable, and efficient service to meet the needs of the following uses:
              a. Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital and nearby medical facilities.
              b. Schools, (especially high schools and middle schools), but also including day
                   care and after-school programs.
              c. UCSB.
              d. Local public services, including City Hall and the Goleta Public Library.
              e. Retail commercial centers, including the Hollister Corridor and the Calle Real
                   commercial areas.
              f.   Employment centers along the central Hollister Corridor area.
              g. Existing and planned higher density residential areas near the Hollister Corridor.

              i.   Larger community parks, particularly those with sports fields, and open space
                   areas.
TE 7.3        Intermodal Transportation Center/Bus Transfer Areas. [GP] Figure 7-4 identifies
              areas where transit routes converge and where there are significant opportunities for
              transfer from one route to another. Two bus transfer locations are identified: (1)
              Hollister Avenue in Old Town and (2) adjacent to the Camino Real Marketplace. The
              City, MTD, and other transit providers should identify and plan for facilities in these
              areas to facilitate and accommodate such transfers. In addition to these designated
              areas the City shall also consider potential opportunities for park-and-ride facilities,
              especially any opportunities that offer shared parking facilities with other uses. The
              public transportation plan map in Figure 7-4 also designates a generalized location
              for an intermodal transportation center near the existing Amtrak station. The purpose
              of the transportation center would be to provide a convenient and safe hub for
              transfers between bus, shuttle, train, automobile, bicycle, and pedestrian modes. The
              specific site selected for a transportation center should allow convenient and safe
              drop-off and pick-up areas without adversely affecting surrounding traffic flows.
TE 7.4        Regional and Express Commuter Bus Service. [GP] Express routes, which are
              generally long-haul routes with segments on US-101 and SR-217 and fewer stops
              than other types of routes, are designed to serve longer-distance commuters to
              employment centers. Existing regional and express/commuter bus routes as of 2005
              are shown in Figure 7-4. The City supports efforts by providers to expand routes to
              better serve employment centers in the city and to increase the frequency of service
              along existing regional express and commuter bus routes linking employment
              centers in the Goleta and UCSB areas with Ventura County, Santa Barbara, the
              Buellton–Santa Ynez Valley area, and the Lompoc and Santa Maria areas. Regional
              commuter service routes are operated by Clean Air Express, VISTA, and MTD.
TE 7.5        Local Commuter Bus Service. [GP] These routes tend to traverse intermediate
              distances, have more bus stops and greater frequency of service, and connect local
              residential areas with large-scale employment centers such as UCSB and the mid-
              Hollister corridor. Existing local commute bus routes are shown in Figure 7-4. The

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                          7.0 Transportation Element
              City supports efforts by MTD and other transit providers to improve local commute
              service by appropriate adjustments to routing, scheduling, and frequency of service.
TE 7.6        Other Local Bus Service. [GP] Local bus routes generally traverse shorter
              distances and are characterized by more closely spaced and frequent stops than
              express and commute-oriented routes. Local routes generally serve trips to non-
              workplace destinations throughout the day, as well as serving some commuters.
              Existing local bus service routes as of 2005 are shown in Figure 7-4.
TE 7.7        Shuttle Bus Service. [GP] Shuttle routes, which may employ smaller transit
              vehicles, generally serve a limited area with frequent headways, and generally are
              appropriate within and/or between high-intensity commercial areas and large
              employment centers, such as UCSB. The locations of existing fixed-route shuttle bus
              services as of 2005 are shown in Figure 7-4. The City supports expansions of shuttle
              services when such expansions are shown to satisfy a significant unmet need and
              when they are cost effective.
TE 7.8        Hollister Avenue Transit Corridor. [GP] Hollister Avenue from the eastern city
              boundary west to Pacific Oaks Road is designated as the Hollister Avenue Transit
              Corridor. The public transportation map in Figure 7-4 illustrates that the highest
              concentration of transit routes and greatest frequency of service occur in this area.
              The land areas along this corridor include existing and planned future retail
              commercial and employment centers as well as higher-density housing. These
              higher-intensity uses are transit oriented; the City supports efforts by MTD and other
              providers to expand express and local bus services along this corridor as ridership
              levels warrant.
TE 7.9        Paratransit Services. [GP] The City encourages the development and/or
              maintenance of a full array of on-demand public transportation services to serve the
              Goleta area. Such services could include Easy-Lift, dial-a-ride, fixed-route van
              service, and taxi cab services to meet the needs of persons with special
              requirements and neighborhoods that do not produce sufficient transit ridership
              levels to warrant scheduled bus route services.
TE 7.10       UCSB Bus Service Programs. [GP] The City encourages programs by UCSB to
              promote bus use by students, faculty, and staff. These efforts should include free or
              discounted monthly bus passes, funding of shuttle bus services, funding of express
              bus services, automobile sharing, ridesharing, appropriate pricing of on-campus
              parking, parking management policies, and other activities.
TE 7.11       Other Bus Transportation Providers. [GP] The City supports efforts to provide
              scheduled bus service to particular external destinations, such as the Santa Barbara
              Airbus to Los Angeles International Airport and the shuttle buses operated by the
              Chumash Casino to carry employees and customers to its facility in Santa Ynez.
              Scheduled or demand-responsive bus or van service by large employers (such as
              UCSB and Raytheon) for their workers is encouraged.
TE 7.12       Transit Amenities in New Development. [GP/CP] The City shall require new or
              substantially renovated development to incorporate appropriate measures to
              facilitate transit use, such as integrating bus stop design with the design of the
              development. Bus turnouts, comfortable and attractive all-weather shelters, lighting,

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                           7.0 Transportation Element
              benches, secure bicycle parking, and other appropriate amenities shall be
              incorporated into development, when appropriate, along Hollister Avenue and along
              other bus routes within the city. Existing facilities that are inadequate or deteriorated
              shall be improved or upgraded where appropriate and feasible.
TE 7.13       Assessments of Transit Needs. [GP] The City encourages continuous efforts to
              monitor, evaluate, and adjust bus services to respond to changing conditions in order
              to meet, in a cost-effective manner, the transit needs of specific population groups,
              including but not limited to commuters, elderly persons, students and youth, persons
              with disabilities, persons with limited economic means, residents of specific
              neighborhoods, and employers.
Policy TE 8: Rail Transportation [GP]
Objective: To accommodate commuter-oriented rail passenger service along the UPRR
corridor that would serve employment centers in Goleta and UCSB, in the event that the region
determines to pursue this option to accommodate long-distance work trips between Ventura
County and Goleta.
TE 8.1        Commuter Rail Service. [GP] If the region should determine that it is cost effective
              to implement commuter rail service along the UPRR corridor, the City shall consider
              new facilities, such as (but not limited to) track sidings or a turnaround, as may be
              appropriate to accommodate the service. Any improvements should be limited to
              areas within the existing railroad right-of-way to the extent feasible.
TE 8.2        Rail Terminal. [GP] Figure 7-4 identifies the location of the existing Amtrak terminal
              as of 2005. The City, in cooperation with Amtrak and any future commuter rail
              service provider, should actively explore and promote the development of an
              expanded multimodal transportation center that includes a rail station in the city as
              referenced in TE 7.3. As of 2005, facilities were limited to a passenger platform. The
              City supports regional funding and construction of a terminal facility that includes a
              building with an indoor waiting area, ticketing, information kiosks, restrooms, and
              other appropriate amenities; parking; and drop-off and pick-up areas. Small-scale
              ancillary commercial services, such as a small restaurant, may also be permitted as
              integral to the terminal facility.
TE 8.3        Coordination of Bus Service with Commuter Rail. [GP] If the region should
              determine to implement commuter rail service along the UPRR corridor, the City
              encourages MTD, private providers, and/or employers to consider scheduled and/or
              demand-responsive shuttle bus service between the train station and local
              employment centers, including but not limited to UCSB.
TE 8.4        Linkage of Land Use With Potential Commuter Rail. [GP] The land-use plan map
              designates land areas along and near the railroad corridor in the mid-Hollister area
              for business park and medium-density multi-family residential development. It is the
              intent that these higher-intensity uses support and not prevent potential passenger
              rail service as well as support existing and potential expanded bus commute services
              along the Hollister Corridor.
September 2006                                                                                            7-26
Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                          7.0 Transportation Element
TE 8.5        Amtrak and Caltrans-Supported
              Passenger Rail Services. [GP]
              The City encourages that existing
              Amtrak services and Caltrans-
              supported passenger rail services
              be maintained, with expansion or
              increased frequency of service
              when warranted by ridership
              levels.
TE 8.6        Rail Freight Transportation. [GP]
              The existing rail line
              accommodates both freight and
              Amtrak passenger services. It is
              the intent of this plan that any
              future improvements for expanded                      Union Pacific Railroad
              passenger services provide for safe joint use of the facilities in a manner that will not
              interfere with rail freight operations.
TE 8.7        Retention of Railroad Right-of-Way. [GP] In the event that any portion of the
              existing railroad right-of-way is proposed to be abandoned by UPRR in the future,
              the City supports efforts to secure an ownership interest by a regional or local entity.
              The intent shall be to reserve the right-of-way for future use, including but not limited
              to commuter rail service, park-and-ride lots, or other appropriate transportation
              facilities.
Policy TE 9: Parking [GP/CP]
Objectives: To ensure that an adequate amount of parking is provided to accommodate the
needs of existing, new, and expanded development, with convenient accessibility and attention
to good design. To assure that on- and off-street parking is responsive to the varying and
unique needs of individual commercial areas and residential neighborhoods.
TE 9.1        Off-Street Parking. [GP/CP] The primary source of parking supply for new
              development of all types of uses within the city shall be off-street parking spaces that
              are provided on site within the development.
TE 9.2        Adequacy of Parking Supply in Proposed Development. [GP/CP] The City shall
              require all proposed new development and changes/intensifications in use of existing
              nonresidential structures to provide a sufficient number of off-street parking spaces
              to accommodate the parking demand generated by the proposed use(s), and to
              avoid spillover of parking onto neighboring properties and streets.
TE 9.3        Parking in Residential Neighborhoods. [GP/CP] Any proposed new or expanded
              use in residential areas shall provide adequate onsite parking to support the use.
              Adequate parking shall be provided to minimize the need for parking in public rights-
              of-way and to avoid spillover of parking onto adjacent uses and into other areas. The
              existing supply of on-street parking spaces shall be preserved to the maximum
              extent feasible. Off-street parking for proposed new single-family dwellings in all
              residential use categories shall be provided in enclosed garages. Driveway aprons in

              single-family residential neighborhoods shall have sufficient widths and depths to
              allow parking of two standard-sized vehicles in front of the garage.
TE 9.4        Parking within Commercial and Industrial Areas. [GP/CP] The following
              standards shall apply to parking within nonresidential areas:
              a. An adequate number and appropriate type of parking spaces shall be provided
                   on site for new development or changes of use in commercial, business park,
                   and other industrial areas.
              b. Supplemental satellite parking facilities are encouraged for large employers to
                   prevent spillover parking into neighboring areas.
              c. In determining the adequacy of proposed parking for new or substantially
                   modified development, the City may consider proximity to transit facilities and the
                   provisions of a TMP where it is demonstrated that the plan’s measures will
                   sufficiently reduce the demand for onsite parking.
              d. Conditions of approval for large nonresidential projects may include a
                   requirement to prepare a TMP that includes monitoring of parking lot utilization
                   and measures that will be implemented if the event that the supply of onsite
                   parking spaces is inadequate.
              e. Provision of large amounts of excess parking is discouraged, except that surplus
                   landscaped areas may be identified and reserved for future expansion of parking
                   areas if warranted by future conditions.
              f.   Compact parking spaces and 90-degree parking stalls are discouraged in parking
                   lots serving high-turnover uses, such as (but not limited to) retail commercial
                   centers.
TE 9.5        Parking Lot Design. [GP] Design standards applicable to retail, commercial,
              business parks, and parking lots are set forth in the Visual and Historic Resources
              Element Subpolicies VH 4.5, 4.7, and 4.11. In addition, the following standards and
              criteria shall apply to parking lots of three or more spaces:
              a. Parking lot design shall provide that all individual spaces are clearly delineated
                   and have easy ingress and egress by vehicles.
              b. Proposals that include compact parking spaces shall be subject to discretionary
                   approval by the City, and the number of compact parking spaces shall not
                   exceed 20 percent of the total; parking spaces for oversized vehicles shall be
                   included when appropriate.
              c. Access driveways and aisles shall have adequate geometrics, and the layout
                   shall be clear, functional, and well organized.
              d. Pedestrian walkways between the parking area and the street, main entrance,
                   and transit stops should be protected by landscaped or other buffers to the extent
                   feasible.
              e. The visual impact of large expanses of parking lots shall be reduced by
                   appropriate response to the design standards set forth in the Visual and Historic
                   Resources Element’s Policy VH 4.

TE 9.6        Old Town Parking. [GP] The following criteria and standards shall apply to parking
              in the Goleta Old Town area:
              a. As part of the Old Town Redevelopment program, the City and RDA shall
                   develop a parking plan that supports the goals of the Goleta Old Town
                   Revitalization Plan.
              b. Where practical and feasible, on-street parking shall be used to create a buffer
                   between pedestrians and vehicle traffic, reduce the speed of traffic, and provide
                   for needed short-term parking.
              c. The City may consider establishing a program whereby new development could
                   be allowed to pay a fee in lieu of providing all or a portion of the required onsite
                   parking. Such fee receipts, supplemented if appropriate with RDA funding, shall
                   be used exclusively to acquire land and/or construct or improve one or more off-
                   street parking facilities.
              d. Any proposed parking structures shall be compatible with the surrounding area in
                   terms of size, bulk, scale, and design. Commercial space shall be incorporated in
                   the structure along the street and sidewalk frontage.
TE 9.7        Shared (Joint Use) Parking. [GP/CP] The City’s new Zoning Code shall include
              provisions to allow consideration and approval of proposals for shared parking for
              multiple uses on a single site and/or adjacent sites where some proposed uses have
              peak demand in the daytime while the peak demand for other uses is in the nighttime
              hours. The intent shall be to promote efficient use of parking areas and to reduce the
              amount of paved or impervious surfaces.
Policy TE 10: Pedestrian Circulation [GP]
Objective: To encourage increased walking for recreational and other purposes by developing
an interconnected, safe, convenient, and visually attractive pedestrian circulation system.
TE 10.1       Pedestrian System Map. [GP] Figure 7-5 depicts the various locations that are
              planned to serve as pedestrian pathways, including sidewalks within public street
              rights-of-way, trails, parks, open spaces, and beaches. The map identifies locations
              of proposed improvements to the pedestrian circulation system, particularly where
              there are missing links in the existing system as of 2005.
TE 10.2       Master Plan for Pedestrian Facilities. [GP] The City shall develop a Master Plan
              for Pedestrian Circulation to provide an integrated network of sidewalks and trails to
              link residential neighborhoods, commercial areas, community facilities, and other
              forms of transportation. This plan should outline priorities to provide and maintain a
              continuous improved surface of sidewalks for pedestrians that meets ADA
              requirements for accessibility and includes construction of new sidewalks and repair
              of deteriorated sidewalks, and minimizes conflicts with utilities and other
              transportation modes. Where feasible, sidewalks should be constructed on both
              sides of the street. The plan shall emphasize achieving the maximum separation of
              pedestrian facilities from traffic.
TE 10.3       Design Criteria for Pedestrian Facilities. [GP] The City shall establish guidelines
              for pedestrian walkways, including but not limited to widths and other geometrics,

              appropriate. Such standards may be included in the Master Plan for Pedestrian
              Circulation.
TE 10.4       Pedestrian Facilities in New Development. [GP] Proposals for new development
              or substantial alterations of existing development shall be required to include
              pedestrian linkages and standard frontage improvements. These improvements may
              include construction of sidewalks and other pedestrian paths, provision of benches,
              public art, informational signage, appropriate landscaping, and lighting. In planning
              new subdivisions or large-scale development, pedestrian connections should be
              provided through subdivisions and cul-de-sacs to interconnect with adjacent areas.
              Dedications of public access easements shall be required where appropriate.
TE 10.5       Pedestrian Safety. [GP] The City shall consider measures to improve pedestrian
              safety, including but not limited to the following:
              a. Heightened visibility for crosswalks.
              b. Traffic controls.
              c. Expanded enforcement of pedestrian right-of-way laws.
              d. Adjustments to signal timing.
              e. Appropriate signage for pedestrians and motorists.
              f.   Prevention of obstruction of pedestrian circulation by temporary advertising
                   signs, merchandise displays, and other types of obstacles.
              g. Improved lighting at
                   intersections and at other
                   locations along the pedestrian
                   circulation network.
              h. Incorporation of appropriate
                   pedestrian safety measures,
                   such as islands, in intersection
                   designs.
              i.   Cooperation with school
                   districts to create safe routes to
                   school through provision of
                   crossing guards, sidewalks,
                   curb extensions to reduce
                   crossing length, high-visibility                   Existing Sidewalk
                   crosswalk markings, signage,

              h. Identification of estimated costs and financial needs for all projects that improve
                   safety and convenience for bicycle commuters.
              The BTP shall be regularly reviewed and updated to respond to changing conditions
              and needs. Any future changes shall be incorporated into the map in Figure 7-6
              during periodic updates or amendments to the General Plan.
TE 11.3       Design Guidelines. [GP] The City shall formulate design guidelines that establish
              standards for construction and maintenance of bikeways. Bikeways should be
              constructed on both sides of the street and incorporated into roadway and bridge
              projects located along planned bicycle routes. Where space allows, Class I bicycle
              lanes shall be the development priority over Class II and III lanes. Existing bike lanes
              shall not be removed to add traffic lanes unless bike lanes of the same or higher
              classification will be replaced as part of the roadway improvements.
TE 11.4       Facilities in New Development. [GP] Bicycle facilities such as lockers, secure
              enclosed parking, and lighting shall be incorporated into the design of all new
              development to encourage bicycle travel and facilitate and encourage bicycle
              commuting. Showers and changing rooms should be incorporated into the design of
              all new development where feasible. Transportation improvements necessitated by
              new development should provide onsite connections to existing and proposed
              bikeways.
TE 11.5       Bicyclist Safety. [GP] The City supports programs to increase public awareness of
              bicycle safety. The City should work with SBCAG Traffic Solutions and other
              appropriate regional entities to provide information to motorists and bicyclists
              regarding maps of bike path locations, safe routes, and increased signage to alert
              others of the presence of bicycles. Amenities along bikeways such as directional
              signage, water fountains, bike parking, and lighting should be appropriately placed to
              allow adequate passage. The City should work with Caltrans to reduce barriers to
              US-101 crossings. In addition, the City encourages bicyclists to take responsibility for
              their own safety by such measures as bicycle lights and wearing light and/or
              reflective clothing.
Policy TE 12: Transportation Systems Management [GP]
Objective: To establish operational controls that will manage the street network in a manner
that will efficiently and safely utilize the existing limited capacity consistent with protection of the
surrounding neighborhood.
TE 12.1       General. [GP] The City shall pursue actions that will maximize the function,
              efficiency, and safety of the local street circulation system while minimizing
              environmental impacts by observing the following general guidelines:
              a. Control the location and spacing of driveways and the design of parking lots to
                   avoid traffic and pedestrian conflicts and confusing circulation patterns
                   (especially along designated arterials).
              b. Discourage commercial and through traffic on local access streets.
              c. Designate special routes for through truck traffic and for transport of hazardous
                   materials.
September 2006                                                                                           7-32
Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                             7.0 Transportation Element
              d. Encourage through-trip travel only on designated arterials.
              e. Place high priority on the access needs of public safety vehicles, especially in
                   emergency situations.
TE 12.2       Efficient Utilization of Transportation Facilities. [GP] As a nearly built-out city,
              most of the major elements of Goleta’s transportation system are already in place.
              Consequently, a necessary priority in the future will be on making relatively minor
              improvements designed to achieve modest increases in capacity and to maximize
              efficient utilization of existing transportation facilities. These operational and safety
              improvements may include the following:
              a. Intersection improvements, such as construction of turn lanes and installation of
                   traffic controls.
              b. Adjustments of signal timing to improve traffic flows, including installation of
                   coordinated signal systems on arterials.
              c. Provision of continuous dual left-turn lanes.
              d. Reconfiguration of street geometrics.
              e. Provision of landscaped center medians.
              f.   Improved sidewalks and street crossings for pedestrians.
              g. Use of roundabouts or traffic circles instead of other intersection controls.
              h. Other transportation systems management measures as may be appropriate.
TE 12.3       Neighborhood Traffic Management. [GP] It is the intent of the City to protect
              residential neighborhoods from the effects of traffic from outside the neighborhood.
              Neighborhood Traffic Management Programs (NTMPs) may be developed to
              respond to problems or issues in a consistent and methodical approach. Generally
              the purpose of NTMPs is to reduce vehicle speeds where appropriate and to control
              traffic volumes on local streets. Each NTMP shall be a two-phase program, with the
              first phase involving education and neighborhood participation to determine whether
              there is support for potential measures to manage neighborhood traffic. The second
              phase shall involve, where appropriate and cost effective, installation of restrictive
              physical devices to manage traffic and improve safety. Neighborhood residents and
              businesses should be invited to participate in the program so that they can evaluate
              the benefits and tradeoffs of various measures and be involved in the decision-
              making process. Generally passive traffic management measures should be
              evaluated for effectiveness prior to considering installation of restrictive measures.
TE 12.4       Street Maintenance and Pavement Management Program. [GP] Street
              maintenance and safety improvements on Goleta's existing roadways shall be a
              priority. The City’s Pavement Management System, which models future changes in
              the condition of paved street surfaces, shall be used to identify and prioritize street
              maintenance, rehabilitation, and repair projects for inclusion in the City’s capital
              improvements program.
TE 12.5       Intelligent Transportation Systems. [GP] The City shall work with appropriate
              agencies to implement “Intelligent Transportation Systems” when appropriate. These
              measures may include but are not limited to the following:
September 2006                                                                                              7-33

Policy TE 13: Mitigating Traffic Impacts of Development [GP]
Objective: To ensure that new development is supported by adequate capacities in
transportation systems, including city streets and roads, without reducing the quality of services
to existing residents, commuters, and other users of the city street system.
TE 13.1       Traffic Studies for Development Proposals. [GP] Future development in Goleta
              will cause added burdens on the transportation system. Traffic analyses and reports
              shall be required for development proposals which the City Engineer and Planning
              Director determine may have effects on the local street system, including but not
              limited to possible degradation of service levels, potential creation of safety hazards,
              potential adverse effects on local neighborhood streets, or other substantial
              transportation concerns. When required by the City, traffic studies shall be performed
              by a qualified transportation engineer under a contract with the City. The costs of the
              traffic study, including costs of City staff time, shall be the responsibility of the project
              applicant.
TE 13.2       Content of Traffic Studies. [GP] The City shall develop technical standards for the
              preparation of traffic studies for development projects and for the content of traffic
              study reports.
TE 13.3       Maintenance of LOS Standards. [GP] New development shall only be allowed
              when and where such development can be adequately (as defined by the LOS
              standards in Policy TE 4) served by existing and/or planned transportation facilities.
              Transportation facilities are considered adequate if, at the time of development:
              a. Existing transportation facilities serving the development, including those to be
                   constructed by the developer as part of the project, will result in meeting the
                   adopted LOS standards set in Policy TE 4; or
              b. A binding financial commitment and agreement is in place to complete the
                   necessary transportation system improvements (except for the planned new
                   grade-separated freeway crossings), or to implement other strategies which will
                   mitigate the project-specific impacts to an acceptable level, within 6 or fewer
                   years; and
              c. Any additional offsite traffic mitigation measures are incorporated into the impact
                   fee system for addressing cumulative transportation impacts of future
                   development.
TE 13.4       Options If Traffic Mitigations Are Not Fully Funded. [GP] If the transportation
              capital improvements needed to maintain adopted transportation LOS standards are
              not able to be funded, then the City shall take one or more of the following four
              actions:

              a. Phase or delay development until such time that adequate fiscal resources can
                   be provided to build the necessary facilities transportation improvements (or to
                   include them in the impact fee system).
              b. Require the developer to construct the necessary transportation system
                   improvements, with a reimbursement agreement that uses future payments of
                   impact fees by other projects.
              c. Reduce the scope of the development to reduce the traffic generation below the
                   thresholds set in Policy TE 4.
              d. Require the developer to identify alternative strategies, such as transit
                   improvements, improving signalization, improving other streets, adding
                   pedestrian or bicycle improvements, etc., to mitigate potential traffic impacts.
TE 13.5       Developer-Constructed Transportation Improvements. [GP] Developers shall be
              required to construct transportation improvements along their property frontages in
              accordance with City standards. The Developer shall be required to provide all
              necessary access and circulation facilities within the property; such facilities shall be

              accordance with the requirements of Assembly Bill1600 to fund transportation
              improvements to mitigate the traffic impacts of new development. The impact fee
              study shall identify and be based on the estimated costs of construction of all
              transportation system improvements needed to ensure adequate levels of service
              system wide. Each new development project shall be charged a fee that represents
              its proportionate share of potential need for and impacts on the facilities included in
              the fee system. The impact fee system may incorporate improvements made and
              fees collected by the City since its incorporation in 2002.
TE 14.2       Capital Facility Plan. [GP] The City shall prepare a capital facility plan that includes
              those facilities that are necessary and appropriate to maintain acceptable LOS levels
              on the transportation network. The costs of the facilities shall be the basis for the
              impact fee system.
TE 14.3       Mitigation Payments by UCSB. [GP] A mitigation agreement between UCSB and
              the City should be developed and adopted to provide for monetary contributions by
              UCSB for its “fair share” of the costs of road improvements needed to serve planned
              future university projects. The agreement shall address transportation impacts

              links between pedestrian and bicycle routes.
TE 15.3       Critical Transportation Facilities. [GP] Critical transportation facilities for
              emergency vehicle access and emergency evacuation shall be maintained and
              improved as a priority need. Critical transportation facilities include US-101 and SR-
              217, major east-west arterials including Cathedral Oaks Road and Hollister Avenue,
              and major north-south arterials that connect portions of the city on either side of US-
              101. Due to the potential for structural failure of some facilities in a seismic
              emergency, alternative routes and procedures for their use during emergency events
              shall be identified.
TE 15.4       Shared Transportation Facilities. [GP] The City of Goleta shall work with the City
              of Santa Barbara and the County of Santa Barbara to maintain adequate service
              levels at shared streets and intersections. Shared facilities include but are not limited
              to segments of Hollister Avenue, Fairview Avenue, Storke Road, Cathedral Oaks
              Road, Patterson Avenue, and others.
TE 15.5       Regional Transportation Planning. [GP] The City of Goleta shall actively
              participate with other jurisdictions in Santa Barbara County and the south coast area
              in planning to improve local and regional transportation systems and choice,
              particularly where such partnerships will increase the likelihood of obtaining funding.
              These jurisdictions include Caltrans, SBCAG, MTD, UCSB, Cities of Santa Barbara
              and Carpinteria, the Santa Barbara County Congestion Management Agency, and
              others. These efforts may include:
              a. Improved US-101, including extension of three lanes to the Hollister
                   Avenue/Cathedral Oaks interchange.
              b. Freeway interchange improvements.
              c. Improvements to regional arterial routes, particularly routes parallel to US-101
                   such as Hollister Avenue and Cathedral Oaks Road.
              d. Routes that provide access to UCSB and Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.
              e. Improved and expanded regional and local bus service for commuters.
              f.   Creation of a Transportation Center in Goleta to improve connectivity of various
                   modes and bus routes.
              g. Study potential for commuter rail on the UPRR tracks between Goleta and
                   Ventura County.
TE 15.6       Regional Transportation Funding. [GP] The City shall support a regional funding
              approach to pay for improvements to the regional highway and bus transit systems.
TE 15.7       Traffic Mitigation Agreements. [GP] The City shall use any available method
              including participation in the review of environmental impact reports of development
              proposals outside the City to ensure that the impacts of development in the area on
              the City’s transportation system are fully mitigated by the agencies approving such
              developments. The City should develop interlocal agreements with neighboring
              jurisdictions and Caltrans that require development to mitigate significant impacts
              that development generates on the transportation system, including state routes.
September 2006                                                                                             7-37

7.5      IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS [GP]
TE-IA-1       Traffic Impact Fee Program. The City will prepare a citywide traffic impact fee study
              and adopt a traffic impact fee ordinance in accordance with the requirements of
              Assembly Bill 1600. The fees shall be used to fund transportation improvements that
              mitigate the traffic impacts of new development allowed by this plan. The impact fee
              study shall identify and be based on the estimated costs of construction of all
              transportation system improvements needed to ensure adequate levels of service
              system wide. Each new development project shall be charged a fee that represents
              its proportionate share of potential need for and impacts on the facilities included in
              the fee system.
              Time period:                2006 to 2008

TE-IA-2       Capital Improvements Program and Budget. The City shall prepare and maintain
              a Capital Improvement Program that includes a list of all transportation-related
              capital projects needed to implement the General Plan during the planning period
              and the anticipated costs and funding sources for each project. The annual budget
              should include the appropriations for those projects authorized to be initiated in the
              next fiscal year. The Capital Improvement Program should be updated annually
              along with anticipated funding capacities as part of the annual budget process.

TE-IA-3       Street Design Standards. The City will prepare a street design manual that sets
              forth standards for design of street facilities, including travel lanes, on-street parking,
              center medians, landscape strips, sidewalks, bikeways, bus turnouts, bus shelters,
              street trees, and other facilities located within street rights-of-way. The standards
              shall include dimensional requirements for the various facilities.

              Responsible parties: Community Services Department
TE-IA-4       Neighborhood Traffic Management Program. Neighborhood Traffic Management
              Programs (NTMPs) may be developed to reduce vehicle speeds where appropriate
              and to control traffic volumes on local streets. Each NTMP should be a two-phase
              program, with the first phase involving education and neighborhood participation to
              determine whether there is support for potential measures to manage neighborhood
              traffic. The second phase may involve, where appropriate and cost effective,
              installation of restrictive physical devices to manage traffic and improve safety.
              Generally passive traffic management measures should be evaluated for
              effectiveness prior to considering installation of restrictive measures.

8.1      INTRODUCTION
General Plan Law Requirements [GP]
Although some subjects addressed are
                                                      Public Facilities Element Policies
required by general plan law, the Public              PF 1:   Development of a Civic Center
Facilities Element itself is optional under state     PF 2:   Other Facilities of the City of Goleta
law. Once adopted, it has the same legal              PF 3:   Public Safety Services and Facilities
status as any of the seven mandatory                  PF 4:   Water and Sewer Facilities
                                                      PF 5:   School Facilities
elements and must be consistent with other            PF 6:   Utilities
elements, as required by Government Code              PF 7:   Coordinating Facilities and Services with
Section 65300.5. The City has considerable                    Other Agencies
latitude as to the topics addressed and depth         PF 8:   General Standards for Public Facilities
of coverage. A public facilities element is           PF 9:   Coordination of Facilities with Future
                                                              Development
generally expected to address the nature of           PF 10: Financing Public Facilities
existing infrastructure facilities and services,
available service capacities, generalized long-term policies to meet future needs, and financing
options. To ensure that facilities and services are provided to existing and future development in
an efficient and cost-effective way, the element must discuss the location of future facilities and
improvements, acceptable levels of service, funding priorities, and the timing of facility or
service availability. Transportation and park facilities are addressed in other elements of this
plan.
Coastal Act Requirements [CP]
Section 30254 of the Public Resources Code requires that new or expanded public works
facilities be “designed and limited” to accommodate development that can be permitted
consistent with the policies of the California Coastal Act (Coastal Act). This section also
provides that, where public works facilities to serve new development are limited, priority shall
be given to coastal-dependent uses, essential services, public and commercial recreation, and
visitor-serving land uses. Pursuant to Section 30114, publicly financed recreational facilities,
including projects of the California Coastal Conservancy, are considered “public works.” The
Coastal Act also provides that no term or condition may be imposed on the development of any
sewage treatment plant relative to future development that can be accommodated consistent
with the policies of the Coastal Act.
Existing Public Facilities: 2005 [GP/CP]
As of 2005, Goleta was not a “full-service” city. Water, sewerage, and fire protection facilities
and services are provided by separate, independent districts with their own elected governing
boards. Although law enforcement and library services are provided by the City, these services
are provided on a contract basis with the County of Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department and the
City of Santa Barbara, respectively. As is typical for a recently incorporated city, public facilities
owned by the City of Goleta were quite limited in 2005, consisting principally of public parks, a
library building, public streets, and participation in a lease-purchase agreement that will result in
City acquisition of the Goleta Valley Community Center from the Goleta Union School District in
September 2006                                                                                                   8-1

2014. Consequently, the provision of basic public facilities to meet future needs of the City
government and community will require a substantial commitment of financial and administrative
resources over the period of this General Plan. In addition, the decisions and actions of the
various independent special districts and agencies will influence the physical and
economic development of Goleta.
Water Supply and Wastewater Management Services
Goleta’s water supply and distribution services are provided by the Goleta Water District (GWD)
through line and storage facilities owned or controlled by the district. The district delivers water
obtained from the Cachuma Project and the State Water Project and treated through the Corona
Del Mar Water Treatment Plant, which has a normal treatment capacity of 24 million gallons per
day. GWD maintains eight reservoirs with a total combined capacity of approximately 20.2
million gallons. As of 2005, GWD delivered approximately 13,000 acre-feet/year of potable
water, and its current water supply is about 16,000 acre-feet/year of potable water. The supply
of water poses a potential long-term constraint to development in Goleta and the Goleta Valley,
although supply constraints have been partially ameliorated by deliveries from the State Water
Project beginning in 1997.
Two separate special districts, Goleta Sanitary District (GSD) and Goleta West Sanitary District
(GWSD), provide wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal services to the Goleta Valley
and territory within the city. GWSD serves the western portion of the city with a collection
system only. The eastern portion of the city is served by GSD, which collects, treats, and
disposes all wastewater, including wastewater received from GWSD. The GSD treatment plant,
located adjacent to the city and Santa Barbara Municipal Airport on William Moffett Place, has a
capacity of 9.7 million gallons per day (based on average daily flow) but is currently limited to
7.64 million gallons per day. Disposal of treated effluent is by ocean outfall offshore from Goleta
Beach. The plant currently operates under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with concurrence by the
Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. Although the NPDES permit calls for all
wastewater to undergo at least secondary treatment, GSD has obtained a waiver from full
secondary treatment under Section 301(h) of the federal Clean Water Act. All other wastewater
treatment plants in the county use a full secondary treatment. GSD’s continued use of a waiver
is subject to ongoing approval by the State Water Resources Control Board and the California
Coastal Commission.
Fire Protection Services
Goleta receives fire protection and related
services from the Santa Barbara County Fire
Department, a regional agency providing
service to 1,441 square miles of
unincorporated and incorporated territory and
an estimated population of 165,000 people.
Services are provided through six fire stations
in the Goleta Valley area, including three
stations located within city boundaries. The
stations within the city are described in
Table 8-1. Most of Goleta falls within a 5-
minute response time from existing fire                   Fire Station II Located on Storke Road

stations, although the western edge of the city and some northern neighborhoods may
experience a longer response time. This western area includes a number of dense housing
developments, a large resort hotel, and an oil and gas processing facility.
In addition, a fire station at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport is staffed by Santa Barbara city
firefighter personnel and responds only to fires in the Airport Operating Area (AOA), the area
located within the security fence that surrounds the airport, consisting primarily of runways and
taxiways. These firefighters and their specialized equipment are prohibited by Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) regulations from leaving the AOA. County firefighters are called upon to
supplement Santa Barbara city fire staff in the event of an airport emergency. Fire Station 17,
located on the University of California, Santa Barbara, (UCSB) campus, provides service to
UCSB and most of Isla Vista. Engine 17 is a county fire engine and, if available, may be called
upon for assistance when needed. The ambulance and station are owned and operated by
UCSB.

Police Protection
Police services are provided to the Goleta through a contract with the Santa Barbara County
Sheriff’s Department. Police officers enforce the statutes of the State of California and City
municipal ordinances. Assigned officers are considered city police and use vehicles identified by
the City of Goleta logo. A lieutenant is appointed as police chief, and attends weekly staff
meetings and submits monthly and annual reports to the City Council. Law enforcement
services include 24-hour police patrol for traffic enforcement, accident investigation, vehicle
abatement, and parking control, as well as detective services for special investigations.
Specialized functions through the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department are provided as
needed. These specialized services include K-9, mounted unit patrol, search and rescue,
hostage negotiations, intelligence gathering, special enforcement (SWAT) team, dive team,
mobile command unit, hazardous devices team, internal affairs investigation, organized
crime/gang intelligence unit, polygraph services, reserve forces, fugitive/warrant detail, and/or
helicopter/fixed wing patrol. There are also services available for special events and/or natural
disaster response.

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                        8.0 Public Facilities Element
As of 2006, the City of Goleta is divided into three “beats” or patrol units, with one police car
assigned to each area. Two additional traffic units are also provided. Officers of the Santa
Barbara County Sheriff’s Department assigned to the unincorporated area of the county are
available to supplement City police, as needed, for emergency response within the City limits.
City police operate out of two donated, privately owned “storefront” locations, one located in Old
Town on Hollister Avenue and one at the Camino Real Marketplace. City police also use
facilities at the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department headquarters in a nearby
unincorporated area between Turnpike Road and El Sueno Road.
Public Schools
Public education services are provided to
territory within Goleta and the remainder of
the Goleta Valley by the Goleta Union School
District (GUSD) and the Santa Barbara High
School District (SBHSD). GUSD owns five
schools (Brandon, El Rancho, Ellwood,
Kellogg, and La Patera) located within the city
and five other schools (El Camino, Foothill,
Hollister, Isla Vista, and Mountain View)
located within unincorporated areas of the
Goleta Valley. As of 2005, the El Rancho
School was leased to a private school. The
remaining nine schools serve students that
live within city boundaries because the school
attendance boundaries overlap city
boundaries. In addition, offices and central                        La Patera School
kitchen facilities are housed at a former
elementary school site within the city on North Fairview Avenue. Portions of this site are also
leased to other tenants, including a private school. GUSD also owns a vacant parcel on Phelps
Road and a bus and maintenance yard on Hollister Avenue at the Goleta Community Center
property. In general, enrollments at schools within the GUSD have been declining for the past
several years.
SBHSD oversees the secondary schools of Dos Pueblos High School and the Goleta Valley
Junior High School, situated within Goleta’s boundaries, and San Marcos High School, located
in the eastern Goleta Valley. Goleta Valley Junior High School, which has an estimated capacity
of 1,185 students (number of classrooms multiplied by 27 students per room), had an
enrollment of 972 students in October 2003. Dos Pueblos High School, situated on a 40-acre
site, contains 74 permanent classrooms, 11 portable classrooms, a gymnasium, library, outdoor
amphitheater, cafeteria, new auditorium and stadium, and various other facilities. The
designated capacity of the school is 2,304 students (including portable classrooms), while the
enrollment as of October 2003 was 2,275. Generally, enrollments in the area’s secondary
schools have increased in recent years but are anticipated to decline in the future.
Library Services
Services at the Goleta Public Library are provided by contract with the City of Santa Barbara in
a facility owned by the City of Goleta at 500 North Fairview Avenue. The 2-acre library site
includes a 15,437-square-foot building and parking areas. The number of volumes is estimated

at 90,000. As of 2003, about 34,500 library
cards were held by residents where the Goleta
Public Library was the nearest facility. This
facility provides services for the city and nearby
unincorporated areas. Annual circulation has
steadily increased to more than 506,000 as of
2000. Services were provided by seven full-
time and 13 part-time employees as of 2003,
not including maintenance personnel.
Privately Provided Utilities
Other utilities and services are provided to
residential and commercial users in Goleta by
private companies, subject to franchise
                                                                          Goleta Public Library
agreements with the City. These include solid
waste collection and disposal, provision of
natural gas and electrical energy, telephone, cable television, and Internet service providers.
Solid waste collection and disposal involves both the private and public sectors. Collection
services are provided by Marborg Industries and Allied Waste Services, while disposal services
are provided by Santa Barbara County at the Tajiguas landfill, 26 miles north of the transfer
station. Energy is provided by the Southern California Gas Company and by Southern California
Edison (SCE). In addition to electrical distribution lines, several SCE substations are located
within the city, including the Hollister Avenue and Glen Annie substations. The only electrical
generating station in the city is Reliant Energy’s “peaking station” on Las Armas between
Hollister Avenue and the railroad tracks, which generates electrical power only during
emergencies and peak-use periods. Local “land-line” telephone service is provided by Verizon;
in addition, a number of companies provide wireless, or “cell,” phone services. Cox
Communications provides both cable television and Internet services. Although the California
Public Utilities Commission has deemed that new cable should be placed underground, there
are many existing overhead lines. New development within the city is required to underground
all new utilities.
8.2      GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND GOALS [GP/CP]
The subjects addressed in the Public Facilities Element are an integral part of the City’s overall
planning strategy and a basic consideration in setting growth and development policy. This
element emphasizes the importance of providing responsive, efficient, and cost-effective
community services. It acknowledges the vital role that public facilities play in shaping
community life. Essential features of the element are policies that guide the financing of
facilities, the planning of facilities, the coordination of the facilities with the land use plan, and
the coordination of the development of facilities with other agencies. The following guiding
principles and goals, which are not in order of priority, provide the foundation for the Public
Facilities Element. All policies set forth in subsequent sections of this element have been
established to conform to the guiding principles and goals, and future actions of the City
following adoption of the plan are required to be consistent.
1. Promote the development of municipal public facilities, including a city hall, that are owned
     by the City and eliminate the need for leased facilities.
September 2006                                                                                                  8-5

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                           8.0 Public Facilities Element
2. Ensure functional, attractive, and well-maintained community facilities that are adequate to
     serve the long-term needs of Goleta’s residents, businesses, and workforce.
3. Ensure that Goleta’s public facilities are accessible to all segments of the community.
4. Guide the future character of the city by the provision of public facilities and services in a
     manner that conforms to and supports the planned land-use pattern and development
     intensities.
5. Provide an effective strategy to balance land use with capital facility development within the
     fiscal capacity of the City.
6. Ensure that development does not out-pace the City’s ability to provide and maintain
     adequate public facilities and services and that services needed to support current and
     future development are available when they are needed.
7. Ensure that Goleta serves the infrastructure needs of the community through evaluation of
     facilities, regular maintenance, and planning for additional facilities to meet future
     community needs.
8. Finance the city's needed capital facilities in an economic, efficient, and equitable manner.
9. Ensure that new development and growth does not exceed the service capacities of the City
     and other public and private entities, including: city administrative facilities; water supply and
     distribution systems; sewage collection, treatment, and disposal systems; fire protection
     services and facilities; police protection services and facilities; schools; library services and
     facilities; and utilities.
8.3      COASTAL ACT POLICIES [CP]
The Coastal Act policies set forth below are adopted as policies of this plan for those areas of
Goleta within the California Coastal Zone. The numbers refer to sections of the California Public
Resources Code. The Public Facilities Element maps show the location of the California Coastal
Zone boundary.
30254         New or expanded public works facilities shall be designed and limited to
              accommodate needs generated by development or uses permitted consistent with
              the provisions of this division; provided, however, that it is the intent of the
              Legislature that State Highway Route 1 in rural areas of the coastal zone remain a
              scenic two-lane road. Special districts shall not be formed or expanded except where
              assessment for, and provision of, the service would not induce new development
              inconsistent with this division. Where existing or planned public works facilities can
              accommodate only a limited amount of new development, services to coastal-
              dependent land use, essential public services and basic industries vital to the
              economic health of the region, state, or nation, public recreation, commercial
              recreation, and visitor-serving land uses shall not be precluded by other
              development.
30254.5       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission may not impose any
              term or condition on the development of any sewage treatment plant which is
              applicable to any future development that the commission finds can be
              accommodated by that plant consistent with this division. Nothing in this section
              modifies the provisions and requirements of Sections 30254 and 30412.
September 2006                                                                                                8-6

8.4      CITY POLICIES
Policy PF 1: Development of a Civic Center [GP]
Objective: To provide a site and appropriate buildings for a predominately or fully City-owned
city hall or civic center that will meet the needs of the city for the next 20 years and beyond.
PF 1.1        Planning Process. [GP] The City shall establish a community planning process,
              involving all segments of the community, to identify appropriate sites for and to plan
              the development of a full-service city hall or civic center to meet the city’s long term
              needs. A future city hall may be located within, and is consistent with, any land-use
              category specified in the Land Use Element.
PF 1.2        Administrative Functions. [GP] The new city hall facility shall be planned to
              accommodate administrative functions of Goleta’s municipal government. Although
              policing services were provided by contract as of 2005, planning for the new site
              shall include consideration of the possibility that the policing function may be
              performed by City personnel at some time in the future.
PF 1.3        Site Criteria. [GP] A site with a net usable area of 3 acres is estimated to be
              necessary for a future city hall. The site shall be of a sufficient size to accommodate
              any reasonably foreseeable future expansion needs, as well as the space needs for
              the next 10- to 20-year period.
PF 1.4        Space Needs. [GP] Planning for the initial building facility shall be based on the
              estimated space needs of the city for the next 10- to 20-year period. It is estimated
              that a minimum of 600 square feet of civic center space is required per 1,000
              population, exclusive of police department needs. A civic center facility should
              include a council chambers, various smaller meeting or conference rooms, and
              space for the various administrative departments. A sufficient number of parking
              spaces shall be provided on site to accommodate employee and customer needs
              during the daytime and meeting attendees during both daytime and evening hours.
PF 1.5        Design Considerations. [GP] The following criteria shall apply:
              a. City hall should be designed to be a visible landmark structure.
              b. The site layout and structure should be designed to allow development of a
                   second-phase addition in the future.
              c. The design should emphasize context and be compatible in size, bulk, and height
                   with existing and planned development in the surrounding area.
              d. The exterior façades should be articulated, with variation in wall and roof planes
                   and incorporation of detailing and architectural features appropriate for a civic
                   building.
              e. The design should emphasize durable materials and other features that will
                   minimize ongoing maintenance needs.
PF 1.6        Potential Methods of Financing. [GP] Any or various combinations of the following
              financing sources or methods may be considered in planning for the proposed city
              hall facility:
September 2006                                                                                                 8-7

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                            8.0 Public Facilities Element
              a. Development impact fees for administrative and law enforcement facilities.
              b. General obligation bonds.
              c. Certificates of participation.
              d. Lease-purchase agreements.
              e. Donation or dedication of land and/or building(s) by a developer, through a
                   negotiated development agreement or other appropriate instrument.
PF 1.7        Potential Co-Location with Facilities of Other Public Entities. [GP] If an
              appropriate opportunity arises, in order to maximize joint-use economies, the City
              may consider co-locating its administrative facilities with those of other public
              agencies serving Goleta and/or the Goleta Valley area, including school districts, the
              Santa Barbara County Fire Department, or other special districts.
Policy PF 2: Other Facilities of the City of Goleta [GP]
Objective: To provide the full range of municipal public facilities to meet the needs of the Goleta
community.
PF 2.1        Goleta Public Library. [GP] The City should evaluate the present and future need
              for library services and prepare a long-term library development plan to address
              those needs in accord with the City’s fiscal capacity. In making this evaluation, the
              City should evaluate the adequacy and location of the current site and facility and
              determine the appropriateness of expansion of the present facility or development of
              a satellite facility.
PF 2.2        Goleta Valley Community Center.
              [GP] The City should continue to
              maintain the current community
              center, and associated buildings, as
              a focal point for community activities
              and functions, including senior
              services, youth services, and various
              related classes and cultural and
              recreational activities. The City
              should evaluate whether the
              available facilities on that campus
              are adequate for community needs
              and create a planning process to
              develop any additional facilities as
              may be needed.
                                                                    Goleta Valley Community Center
PF 2.3        City Maintenance Yard. [GP] The
              City shall establish a planning process to evaluate the need for a City maintenance
              yard facility and, if appropriate, identify an appropriate site for and plan the
              development of such a facility. Such planning shall include consideration of the
              maintenance facility needs of other public agencies and explore the feasibility of co-
              locating those facilities. The types of facilities that should be considered include:
              street maintenance, water and sewer maintenance, stormwater maintenance,
              general government vehicle and equipment maintenance and storage, police vehicle

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                             8.0 Public Facilities Element
              maintenance and storage, fire vehicle maintenance, parks maintenance shops and
              storage, bus transit maintenance facilities, and recycling waste transfer facilities. The
              following criteria shall apply to development of a City maintenance facility:
              a. The site should be of adequate size to meet the city’s long-term needs.
              b. Preferred locations are south of U.S. Highway 101 (US-101) in or adjacent to
                   industrial or commercial areas.
              c. The maintenance facility shall be screened by appropriate fencing and/or
                   landscaping to provide an attractive appearance from the street and from
                   adjacent properties.
              d. Vehicle maintenance activities should be accommodated within an enclosed
                   building, to the extent practicable.
              e. Outdoor storage areas shall be paved, with best management practices
                   incorporated to address stormwater management and treatment in a manner to
                   reduce or avoid discharge off site and prevent any adverse impacts on creeks or
                   other surface water bodies.
              f.   Exterior lighting shall be minimum necessary to provide security. The heights and
                   characteristics of light fixtures shall be designed to downcast light and prevent
                   light and glare from spilling over to adjacent properties.
PF 2.4        Future Police Station. [GP] In conjunction with the planning for a civic center, the
              City shall establish a community planning process, involving all segments of the
              community, to evaluate the need for a police station and identify appropriate sites
              and plan its development. It is estimated that a minimum of 400 square feet of police
              administrative center space is required per 1,000 population.
PF 2.5        Other Public Facilities. [GP] Additional public facilities that may be considered in
              the future as resources are available include but are not limited to the following: a
              cultural center, multi-modal transit center, and active recreational facilities.
Policy PF 3: Public Safety Services and Facilities [GP]
Objective: Ensure that adequate fire and police services and facilities are available to meet the
needs of both existing and new development in the city as well as service demands from
outside Goleta’s boundaries.
PF 3.1        Fire Protection Standards. [GP] The Santa Barbara County Fire Department
              employs the following three standards with respect to provision of fire protection
              services:
              a. A firefighter-to-population ratio of one firefighter on duty 24 hours a day for every
                   2,000 in population is considered “ideal,” although a countywide ratio (including
                   rural areas) of one firefighter per 4,000 population is the absolute minimum
                   standard. Considering the daytime population in Goleta due to employees and
                   customers, all fire stations within Goleta fell short of this service standard as of
                   2005.
              b. A ratio of one engine company per 16,000 population, assuming four firefighters
                   per station, represents the maximum population that the Santa Barbara County

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                         8.0 Public Facilities Element
                   Fire Department has determined can be adequately served by a four-person
                   crew. Fire stations 11 and 12 (see Table 8-1) did not satisfy this standard as of
                   2005. Currently, all three fire engines that serve Goleta are staffed with only
                   three-person crews. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) guidelines
                   state that engine companies shall be staffed with a minimum of four on-duty
                   personnel.
              c. The third fire protection standard is a 5-minute response time in urban areas.
                   This incorporates the following NFPA response-time objectives:
                   1) One minute (60 seconds) for
                       turnout time.
                   2) Four minutes (240 seconds)
                       or less for the arrival of the
                       first-arriving engine company
                       at a fire suppression incident
                       and/or 8 minutes (480
                       seconds) or less for the
                       deployment of a full first-
                       alarm assignment at a fire
                       suppression incident.
                   3) Four minutes (240 seconds)
                       or less for the arrival of a unit
                       with first-responder or higher
                       level capability at an                              Fire Engine
                       emergency medical incident.
                   4) Eight minutes (480 seconds) or less for the arrival of an advanced life support
                       unit at an emergency medical incident, where this service is provided by the
                       fire department.
PF 3.2        New Fire Station in Western Goleta. [GP/CP] The Santa Barbara County Fire
              Department has determined that the most under-served area in Goleta is the
              extreme western portion near Winchester Canyon. In conjunction with the fire
              department, the City shall provide a site consisting of approximately 2 acres of land
              for proposed new Fire Station 10 to serve the western area of the city, as shown on
              the map in Figure 8-1. The Santa Barbara County Fire Department will construct Fire
              Station 10 as soon as funding becomes available.
PF 3.3        Impact Fees for Fire Protection Facilities/Equipment. [GP] Construction of the
              new Fire Station 10 shall be funded in part by revenues from an impact fee imposed
              on new development within the city, as well as upon development in the nearby
              unincorporated areas. Such fees may also be imposed for upgrades of existing fire
              stations and for new fire apparatus.
PF 3.4        Fire Safety in New Development. [GP/CP] The following fire safety standards shall
              be met, where applicable, in new development within the city:
              a. Two routes of ingress and egress shall be required for any new development or
                   subdivision of land requiring approval of a discretionary action. This requirement
September 2006                                                                                             8-10
Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                          8.0 Public Facilities Element
                   may be waived by the City when secondary access cannot be provided and
                   maintenance of fire safety standards are ensured by other means.
              b. All private roads that provide access to structures served by the Santa Barbara
                   County Fire Department shall be constructed at a minimum to the department’s
                   standards.
              c. All nonagricultural development in the foothills area shall include provisions for

Policy PF 4: Water and Sewer Facilities [GP/CP]
Objective: Ensure that adequate water supply and distribution facilities and sewage collection
facilities and treatment capacity are available to meet the cumulative needs of both existing
users and new development in the city as well as outside Goleta’s boundaries.
PF 4.1        Water Facilities and Services. [GP/CP] The following criteria, standards, and
              procedures shall apply to water facilities and services:
              a. The City shall coordinate with GWD regarding new development within its
                   boundaries to allow the GWD to continue to plan its capital improvements in an
                   orderly manner consistent with the levels of growth allowed by the Land Use
                   Plan.
              b. The City shall review and monitor GWD’s existing Urban Water Management
                   Plan, adopted in December 2005, and future updates to that plan, and shall
                   monitor actions of GWD to meet the projected long-term water demand.
              c. The City shall monitor and compare the planned and potential consumption of
                   the available and planned water capacity within the service area of the GWD. If
                   the available and planned capacity of water supply and delivery services is not
                   adequate to serve the planned and potential consumption, then the City shall
                   take one or more of the following three actions in order of priority:
                   1) Phase development within the city consistent with the Land Use Plan until
                       such time that adequate resources can be identified to provide adequate
                       supplies and improvements and urge other entities in the service areas to
                       also reassess their plans.
                   2) Reassess the City’s Land Use Plan to reduce the demand for services to the
                       degree necessary to match the supply and urge other entities in the service
                       areas to also reassess their plans.
                   3) Explore and support ways to reduce consumption in order to conserve
                       available capacity and to reduce the volume of discharges of treated effluent
                       in ocean waters.
              d. Environmental reviews of new development shall evaluate the adequacy of water
                   supply capacity to serve cumulative demand for all existing and planned
                   development, including during extended periods of drought.
              e. Water piping systems should be interconnected (“looped”) wherever feasible to
                   facilitate the reliable delivery of water to all locations within the city. The
                   distribution system should be sized to provide minimum operating pressure of
                   45 pounds per square inch (psi) under normal conditions and 20 psi under
                   emergency conditions such as fires.
              f.   Water supply and delivery systems shall be available in time to meet the demand
                   created by new development or shall be assured through the use of bonds or
                   other sureties. An assured water supply and delivery system shall be identified
                   prior to discretionary approvals of projects to the satisfaction of the City. GWD or
                   the project applicant may provide several alternative methods of documentation,
                   including an unconditional “ability to serve” letter from the district.

              g. The applicant and GWD shall demonstrate prior to issuance of final land use
                   clearance that sufficient capacity shall be available to serve the development and
                   all other cumulative projects within GWD’s service area. This may be evidenced
                   by an unconditional “will serve” letter or contract for service from GWD. All
                   required water infrastructure for a project shall either be in place at the time of
                   approval of the land use clearance or shall be assured through the use of bonds,
                   payment of fees, or other sureties to the City’s and GWD’s satisfaction.
              h. Within new subdivisions, offsite and onsite water distribution systems required to
                   serve the subdivision shall be in place and contain water at sufficient quantity
                   and pressure prior to the issuance of any building permit. Model homes may be
                   exempted from this policy, subject to approval by the City.
              i.   The City shall encourage and actively promote long-term water conservation
                   through water-conserving features in new development, including low water-use
                   plumbing fixtures and drought-tolerant landscaping. The City also encourages
                   the reclamation of treated wastewater and development of distribution facilities
                   for reclaimed water to serve appropriate uses and locations.
              j.   New water lines shall not be located within an Environmentally Sensitive Habitat
                   Area (ESHA) or ESHA buffer unless there is no feasible alternative location. The
                   City supports the decommissioning and relocation of existing facilities located
                   within ESHA or ESHA buffers.
              k. The City shall require new water infrastructure to be located and painted so as to
                   not be visually obtrusive and, where feasible, to be located within roadway rights-
                   of-way or existing utility easements.
              l.   The City shall seek to protect the quality and quantity of groundwater resources,
                   including those that serve households and businesses that rely on private wells.
                   The City encourages that such existing development be connected to the public
                   water system of GWD and that the private wells be properly abandoned and
                   closed.
              m. All new development within the City shall be served by the public water system.
              n. New development along corridors identified by the GWD in its Master Plan as
                   locations of future water conveyance facilities shall provide appropriate
                   easements as a condition of approval.
PF 4.2        Sewer Facilities and Services. [GP/CP] The following criteria, standards, and
              procedures shall apply to sewer facilities and services:
              a. The City shall monitor and compare the planned and potential consumption of
                   the available and planned sewer capacity within the service areas of these
                   utilities. If the available and planned capacity of sewerage services is not
                   adequate to serve the planned and potential consumption, then the City shall
                   take one or more of the following three actions in order of priority:
                   1) Phase development within the City consistent with the Land Use Plan until
                        such time that adequate resources can be identified to provide adequate
                        supplies and improvements and urge other entities in the service areas to
                        also reassess their plans.
September 2006                                                                                                8-13

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                            8.0 Public Facilities Element
                   2) Reassess the City’s Land Use Plan to reduce the demand for services to the
                       degree necessary to match the supply and urge other entities in the service
                       areas to also reassess their plans.
                   3) Explore and support ways to reduce consumption in order to conserve
                       available capacity and reduce the volume of discharges of treated effluent in
                       ocean waters.
              b. The City shall encourage effective and cost-efficient organization and delivery
                   systems for provision of wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal services
                   within its boundaries.
              c. The City shall work with the GSD to ensure completion of a Capacity
                   Management Alternatives Study to determine the scope of needed improvements
                   for a higher level of treatment in order to improve the quality of effluent
                   discharged by an outfall into ocean waters offshore from Goleta Beach Park. The
                   City supports completion of this project as quickly as possible. The study should
                   include a full evaluation of alternatives and costs. Alternatives should avoid
                   construction of excess wastewater treatment capacity.
              d. The City shall encourage recycling of treated wastewater to reduce water
                   consumption and reduce ocean discharges of treated effluent.
              e. Sewage collection and wastewater treatment capacity shall be available in time
                   to meet the demand created by new development or shall be assured through
                   the use of bonds or other sureties. The adequacy of sewerage facilities shall be
                   identified prior to discretionary approvals of projects to the satisfaction of the City.
                   The applicable sanitation district or project applicant may provide several
                   alternative methods of documentation, including an unconditional “ability to
                   serve” letter from the district.
              f.   The applicant and the applicable sanitation district shall demonstrate prior to
                   issuance of final land use clearance that sufficient capacity and facilities shall be
                   available to serve the development and all other cumulative projects within the
                   service area. This may be evidenced by an unconditional “will serve” letter or
                   contract for service from the district. All required wastewater management
                   infrastructure for a project shall either be in place at the time of approval of the
                   land use clearance or shall be assured through the use of bonds, payment of
                   fees, or other sureties to the City’s and the applicable district’s satisfaction.
              g. All necessary sewage collection facilities shall be in place at the time of approval
                   of building permits.
              h. New sewer lines shall not be located within ESHA or ESHA buffer unless there is

              separate sites shall be minimized. Visual and aesthetic obtrusiveness of wireless and
              cellular telecommunications facilities shall be mitigated by provision of stealth
              designs, for example, location within elements of buildings such as parapets,
              chimneys, or other architectural features. A public notice shall be posted at
              telecommunications sites with electromagnetic field emissions; these notices shall
              inform employees, customers, and the general public as to the location of the facility
              (see related VH 4.8).
Policy PF 7: Coordinating Facilities and Services with Other Agencies [GP]
Objective: To ensure the appropriate provision of public facilities and buildings by all public
agencies and related nonprofit organizations.
PF 7.1        Coordination of Facility Planning. [GP] The City shall coordinate the planning and
              construction of public and quasi-public buildings and facilities with all agencies,
              districts, and other providers to preclude duplication and ensure the timely availability
              of these facilities to meet the needs of future growth and development.
PF 7.2        Consultation with Other Service Providers. [GP] In order to coordinate the short-
              and long-term provision of public facilities to meet existing and future community
              needs, the City shall regularly meet and consult with other public and quasi-public
              service providers and share information on pending development applications,
              growth rates, and development patterns. The City shall discuss and exchange
              population forecasts, development plans, and technical data with the service
              providers to facilitate the coordination of natural gas, electrical power, sanitary
              sewer, solid waste collection, domestic water, school, and communication services.
PF 7.3        Compatibility of Utility Facilities. [GP] The City shall coordinate with public utility
              providers and other public and quasi-public agencies to assure the most compatible
              integration of utility buildings and facilities into the city’s land use pattern.
PF 7.4        Shared Use of Facilities. [GP] In order to optimize use and value, the City shall
              take advantage of opportunities that allow the buildings and/or facilities of other
              providers to be used by other community organizations.
PF 7.6        Coordination of Construction Schedules. [GP] Wherever possible, the City,
              special districts, and private utilities should coordinate their construction programs to
              avoid unnecessary construction and street work. The 6-year capital improvement
              plans of all special-purpose districts shall be coordinated with each other and with
              the City’s pavement management program.
PF 7.7        Review of Public Works and Land Acquisitions of Other Agencies. [GP]
              Pursuant to Government Code Section 65401, 65402, and 65403, other agencies
              (such as water districts, sanitation districts, and school districts) that provide or
              maintain public facilities essential to the growth and maintenance of Goleta area’s
              urban population are required to submit proposed public works projects and/or 5-

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                            8.0 Public Facilities Element
              year capital improvement programs (CIPs) to the City for a determination by the
              Planning Agency as to the consistency of the proposed project or CIP with the
              adopted General Plan or applicable part thereof. Goleta’s Planning Agency shall
              review such proposals and submit its report to the agency or district no later than
              40 days after receipt of the proposed public works project, land acquisition, and/or
              CIP. Although the agency or district may overrule the City’s finding and carry out its
              intended project or CIP, the City encourages a cooperative approach to achieve
              consistency between the General Plan and the actions of other agencies. Upon
              certification of the City’s Local Coastal Program by the California Coastal
              Commission, proposed projects within the California Coastal Zone that constitute
              “development” under the Coastal Act will be subject to City approval of a Coastal
              Development Permit.
Policy PF 8: General Standards for Public Facilities [GP]
Objective: To ensure compatible and aesthetically appropriate integration of public buildings
and facilities into the city’s built and natural environments at appropriate locations.
PF 8.1        General Standard. [GP] The City shall ensure that all public buildings and facilities
              comply with the same development standards and regulations as would be
              applicable to private development.
PF 8.2        Siting of Public Facilities. [GP] All new public facilities, including utilities, utility
              buildings, signage, and other development components, shall be designed in a
              manner that makes them aesthetically compatible with surrounding neighborhoods
              and development. The following shall apply:
              a. Siting and design, landscape buffers, architectural elements, and other
                   appropriate design solutions shall be required, as appropriate.
              b. Critical structures and facilities (including hospitals, fire stations, police stations,
                   water reservoirs, and communications facilities) shall be restricted from
                   geologically and hydrological hazardous areas, to the greatest extent practical.
              c. To the extent practical, the City shall identify and shall make every effort to
                   assure the long-term availability of appropriate sites for the development and
                   expansion of City buildings, utility infrastructure, and other public facilities.
              d. Public agency buildings shall be conveniently located and accessible to residents
                   and all segments of the community.
PF 8.3        Design of Public Facilities. [GP] The following criteria shall apply:
              a. To the extent appropriate and practical, all utility facilities (with the possible
                   exception of substations, pumping stations, and outdoor storage areas) shall be
                   fully enclosed in buildings that are aesthetically compatible with the areas in
                   which they are located.
              b. Public buildings and facilities that house City government activities shall be
                   constructed in a functional and aesthetically pleasing manner.
              c. Wherever possible, the City should incorporate energy-saving measures and
                   other “green building” concepts in the design of City facilities.
September 2006                                                                                                8-18

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                           8.0 Public Facilities Element
              d. New community facilities should be designed and constructed to incorporate
                   flexibility and adaptability to the changing needs of the community.
              e. Facilities shall be designed to be accessible to all segments of the community.
PF 8.4        Critical Facilities Standards. [GP] To the extent possible, the City shall require that
              all critical structures located within the city be constructed to maintain sufficient
              structural integrity to remain functional following the maximum probable earthquake
              event and other natural disasters that could affect the site of the structure. All
              proposals for new critical structures, regardless of location within the city, shall
              demonstrate safety in terms of the geologic, hydrologic, and other engineering
              conditions of the site. (See also Subpolicies SE 4.8, SE 4.10, SE 5.3, and SE 6.5.)
PF 8.5        Management Standards. [GP] The City’s management of capital facilities should
              emphasize the following concepts:
              a. Preventive maintenance and cost-effective replacement of aging elements.
              b. Planning for the orderly extension and upgrading of capital systems while
                   recognizing that system extensions associated with new development should be
                   the responsibility of those desiring service.
              c. Inspecting systems to ensure conformance with design standards.
              d. Reducing the potential for cost increases through effective fiscal management.
Policy PF 9: Coordination of Facilities with Future Development [GP/CP]
Objective: To ensure that land use decisions are based on the planned capacity of capital
facilities and that such facilities are provided when they are needed to support new
development.
PF 9.1        Integration of Land Use and Public Facilities Planning. [GP/CP] The Land Use
              Plan and actions on individual development applications shall be consistent with the
              existing or planned capacities of necessary supporting public facilities and the fiscal
              capacity of the City to finance new facilities.
              a. The City shall integrate its land use and public works planning activities with an
                   ongoing program of long-range financial planning to ensure that the City’s Land
                   Use Plan is supported by quality public facilities.
              b. Individual land use decisions, including but not limited to General Plan
                   amendments, shall be based on a finding that any proposed development can be
                   supported by adequate public facilities.
PF 9.2        Phasing of New Development. [GP/CP] Development shall be allowed only when
              and where it is demonstrated that all public facilities are adequate and only when and
              where such development can be adequately served by essential public services
              without reducing levels of service elsewhere.
PF 9.3        Responsibilities of Developers. [GP/CP] Construction permits shall not be granted
              until the developer provides for the installation and/or financing of needed public
              facilities. If adequate facilities are currently unavailable and public funds are not

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                            8.0 Public Facilities Element
              committed to provide such facilities, the burden shall be on the developer to arrange
              appropriate financing or provide such facilities in order to develop. Developers shall
              provide or pay for the costs of generating technical information as to impacts the
              proposed development will have on public facilities and services. The City shall
              require new development to finance the facilities needed to support the development
              wherever a direct connection or nexus of benefit or impact can be demonstrated.
PF 9.4        City Infrastructure Investments to Guide Development. [GP/CP] The City shall
              plan and develop its infrastructure and public facilities in appropriate locations for
              development and shall encourage other public agencies to plan and implement their
              facilities in a manner that is consistent with and reinforces the General Plan.
PF 9.5        Extensions of Infrastructure and Facilities. [GP/CP] The extension of any
              individual infrastructure or public facility to serve new development, regardless of the
              method of financing, should be approved only if it is determined that adequate fiscal
              capacity exists to support:
              a. The extension of any other needed facilities.
              b. Services to the cumulative development that could be supported by the
                   extension.
              c. Cost-effective service delivery by all ongoing public services.
PF 9.6        Concurrency. [GP/CP] The City shall develop ordinances and procedures to
              achieve “concurrency” for facilities essential to support development. Pursuant to
              those procedures, the City shall evaluate the impact of any new development on the
              capacity of the supporting public facilities and require, prior to final development
              approval, that financing be in place to correct any public facility deficiency. The
              evaluation of impacts shall include an analysis of the cumulative effects of other
              development proposals in the service area.
PF 9.7        Essential Services for New Development. [GP/CP] Development shall be allowed
              only when and where all essential utility services are adequate in accord with the
              service standards of their providers and only when and where such development can
              be adequately served by essential utilities without reducing levels of service below
              the level of service guidelines elsewhere.
              a. Domestic water service, sanitary sewer service, stormwater management
                   facilities, streets, fire services, schools, and parks shall be considered essential
                   for supporting new development.
              b. A development shall not be approved if it causes the level of service of an
                   essential utility service to decline below the standards referenced above unless
                   improvements to mitigate the impacts are made concurrent with the development
                   for the purposes of this policy. "Concurrent with the development" shall mean
                   that improvements are in place at the time of the development or that a financial
                   commitment is in place to complete the improvements.
              c. If adequate essential utility services are currently unavailable and public funds
                   are not committed to provide such facilities, developers must provide such
                   facilities at their own expense in order to develop.
September 2006                                                                                                8-20

Policy PF 10: Financing Public Facilities [GP]
Objective: To use all available capital improvement revenues to finance facilities to meet the
community’s needs.
PF 10.1.      Sources of Revenue for Capital Facilities. [GP] Opportunities should be identified
              to use available local and regional funding sources, grants, and other sources of
              revenue to finance projects that provide the most benefit.
PF 10.2       Development Impact Fees. [GP] The City shall adopt and maintain a development
              impact fee program that requires new development to pay a proportionate share of
              the costs of new or upgraded capital facilities attributable to new development.
              Impact fee programs for capital facilities shall include sufficient funding for all of the
              following:
              a. Design and engineering.
              b. Environmental compliance and permitting.
              c. Land acquisition and/or right-of-way acquisition.
              d. Site preparation, including grading and installation of utilities, drainage, and other
                   necessary infrastructure.
              e. Construction of the public facility.
              f.   Parking, landscaping, and street trees, where applicable.
              g. Necessary off-site improvements, such as sidewalks, extensions of utilities, and
                   others as applicable.
              The impact fee program shall be reviewed regularly to ensure that sufficient funding
              will be available to construct all required facilities.
PF 10.3       Use of Existing Revenue Sources. [GP] Existing ongoing revenues should be
              directed to the following needs:
              a. Meeting basic safety needs and removing hazards.
              b. Improving maintenance and operational efficiencies.
              c. Rehabilitating and enhancing existing facilities.
              d. Implementing General Plan objectives through strategic investments
                   incrementally as part of a long-range strategy.
              e. Adding new capacity to improve levels of service.
              In applying these priorities, all needs should be addressed in a balanced program of
              funding. In evaluating projects, relative costs and benefits shall be considered along
              with the relative priorities.
PF 10.4       Community Support. [GP] Community support should be considered for any major
              project that adds significant capacity to an existing facility, provides a significant
              increase in level of service, or provides another major enhancement to the
              community. Such projects may include major transportation improvements, new

              parks, or major Old Town improvements. The most appropriate financing of these
              projects, in some cases, may be a voter-approved bond issue to provide revenue.
PF 10.5       Financing Methods. [GP] The following criteria shall apply to consideration of
              financing methods for capital facilities:
              a. Long-term borrowing for capital facilities should be considered as an appropriate
                   method of financing large facilities that benefit more than one generation of users
                   in the future.
              b. Where possible, special assessment revenue and other self-supporting bonds
                   should be used instead of tax-supported general obligation bonds. Special
                   benefit assessment financing mechanisms are preferred whenever the benefits
                   of a proposed facility are limited to a specific geographic area.
              c. General obligation bonds should be considered for municipal improvements that
                   are of general benefit to the public, such as arterial streets, bridges, lighting,
                   municipal buildings, general maintenance facilities and equipment, community
                   centers, and parks.
PF 10.6       Capital Facility Impacts of New Services. [GP] In evaluating whether to continue,
              change, or begin a new service, the City shall consider the impact of the decision on
              capital facility requirements.
PF 10.7       Operating Cost Impacts of New Facilities. [GP] The City shall include the costs of
              maintaining, operating, and other life-cycle costs in the consideration of whether to
              authorize or support the funding of any capital facility. Funding of life-cycle costs
              should be included in future financial forecasting and planning and incorporated into
              City budget decisions.
PF 10.8       Periodic Evaluation of Capital Facilities. [GP] The City should review on a regular
              basis its capital facility services to determine if they are being delivered cost-
              effectively and evaluate whether individual services are most cost-effectively
              delivered by the City or by outside contract. Joint facilities with adjacent service
              providers may be used, where appropriate, to provide the most efficient and cost-
              effective service to customers.
PF 10.9       Alternatives to City-Financed Facilities. [GP] The City may consider the use of
              nonfinancial options to meet its public facility needs. Such options include:
              a. Encourage private organizations to develop and finance facilities.
              b. Encourage local businesses to provide financial support for community services
                   through contributions of funds, time, materials, and expertise.
              c. Contract services with public or private entities.
              d. Rent or lease facilities.
              e. Develop cooperative programs with nonprofit organizations and other public
                   entities.
              f.   Implement demand management strategies to more efficiently use existing
                   facilities.

              h. Encourage volunteers, donations, trusts, etc.
PF 10.10 Capital Improvements Program and Budget. [GP] The City shall prepare and
              maintain a CIP that includes a list of all projects needed to implement the General
              Plan during the planning period. This list should include projects that can be planned,
              financed, and implemented during the CIP planning period. The annual budget
              should include the appropriations for those projects authorized to be initiated in the
              next fiscal year. The following criteria should apply to the CIP:
              a. Projects listed beyond the CIP planning period may be generally described and
                   estimated or grouped into broad categories, while projects in the 6-year CIP
                   should be more specifically described and individually listed.
              b. Projects shall be funded only when incorporated into the adopted annual City
                   budget.
              c. The CIP list should be updated annually along with anticipated funding capacities
                   as part of the annual budget process.
              d. Proposed new additions to the 6-year project list shall be evaluated for
                   consistency with the General Plan prior to their incorporation into the CIP.
              e. The capital facility project list should be reviewed annually to ensure that the
                   proposed capital program reflects an equitable geographic distribution of projects
                   and that the needs of the city’s neighborhoods are addressed along with citywide

                   the land use and capital facilities plan are consistent with the community’s
                   financial capacity. The City shall then consider any adjustments appropriate for

PF-IA-1       Preparation of AB 1600 Study and Impact Fee Program. Government Code
              Section 66000 allows local jurisdictions to establish development impact fees to fund
              the construction of public infrastructure necessary to serve new development. The
              adopted AB 1600 Fee Ordinances and Resolutions allow the City to impose
              developer impact fees on all new development within Goleta. Development Impact
              Mitigation Fees (DIMFs) are assessed on development projects that cause an
              increased impact on public services in order to mitigate the cost of providing these
              services to new development. DIMFs related to transportation, fire protection, parks
              and recreation, library, public administration, and police are charged to development
              occurring throughout the city. Following adoption of this plan, a new nexus study for
              impact fees shall be prepared and the existing fees revised as appropriate.

statutory update since incorporation was
adopted in 2010 and addressed the 2007 to
2014 planning period. This Housing Element covers the 2015 to 2023 planning period (referred
to as the “5th cycle” in state planning law) and contains updated information and strategic
directions (policies and specific actions) that the City is committed to undertake to address
housing needs.
Housing prices in California are among the highest in the nation. California’s housing element
law recognizes the important role that local governments play in influencing the supply and
affordability of housing. State housing element law, first enacted in 1969, directs local
governments to use their land use and zoning powers to make adequate provision for the
housing needs of all economic segments of the community. Implementation of state housing
policy rests in part upon the effective implementation of the housing elements of local general
plans.
While the City must respond to the requirements of state law, addressing local housing needs is
an important part of retaining and enhancing the quality of life in Goleta. Housing affordability in
Goleta and the south coast area of Santa Barbara County as a whole has become an
increasingly prominent issue.
Housing Element Requirements
Overview of State Law Requirements
Although state law establishes requirements for all parts of the general plan, the requirements
are more specific and extensive for the housing element than for other plan elements. The
purpose of a housing element is described in Government Code Section 65583:
     The housing element shall consist of an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing
     needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled
     programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing. The housing element shall
     identify adequate sites for housing, including rental housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, and
     emergency shelters, and shall make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all
     economic segments of the community.

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                                10.0 Housing Element
While jurisdictions must review and revise all elements of their general plans on a regular basis
to ensure that they remain up to date (generally, about every 10 to 15 years), state law was
amended in 2008 (Senate Bill 375) to require housing elements be reviewed and updated on an
8-year cycle in coordination with every other update to the Regional Transportation Plan. The
process of updating housing elements is initiated by the state through the Regional Housing
Needs Allocation (RHNA) process.

possible—remove constraints to housing
development. In addition to the five income
categories established in state housing law (extremely low-, very low-, low-, moderate-, and
above-moderate-income households), Goleta has identified an additional category—workforce
households—(121 to 200 percent of median) in recognition of the high housing costs in the
south coast area of Santa Barbara County.
The Housing Element includes both a policy document and a series of supporting studies in a
Technical Appendix. The Technical Appendix provides background data and analysis of housing
needs and conditions. When the term “Housing Element” is used, it is intended to include both
this policy element and the accompanying Technical Appendix.
Eight-Year Action Plan
In identifying housing programs, the Housing Element sets forth an Eight-Year Action Plan
(Action Plan) that details the actions, or programs, that the City or other entities intend to
undertake to implement Housing Element goals, objectives, and policies. For each program, the
Action Plan identifies the agency responsible, the timeframe for implementation, and the
quantified objectives for housing units proposed to be constructed, rehabilitated, or conserved
or the number of households that will be assisted as a result of the program.
The Action Plan must:
•    Ensure adequate sites that could accommodate the RHNA allocation for all income levels.
•    Facilitate the maintenance, improvement, and development of affordable housing.

•    Conserve and improve the existing affordable housing stock.
•    Address and remove governmental constraints.
•    Promote equal housing opportunities.
•    Preserve assisted housing.
Public Participation in the Preparation of the Housing Element
State law requires that preparation of a
housing element encourage involvement from
all economic segments of the community. As
part of the Housing Element update process,
a series of study sessions, workshops, and
public hearings were conducted with the
community, the Planning Commission, and
City Council. These outreach efforts were
well attended by the public, including
affordable housing advocates, developers,
special needs individuals, and advocates for
special needs populations, such as the
disabled and seniors. Details regarding the                 2014 Housing Element Workshop
outreach efforts—including dates, the
purpose of each meeting, and public noticing—are included in Section VI of the Technical
Appendix. This updated Housing Element reflects the comments provided during the public
outreach process, along with direction provided by the Planning Commission and City Council.
State law also requires that every updated housing element be submitted to the State of
California’s Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for review to evaluate
compliance with the state requirements. A finding of substantial compliance by HCD is often
referred to as “certification” of the housing element. This certification process is unique among
the general plan elements. Housing elements must be submitted twice to HCD for review and
comment—once during development of the draft housing element and again after adoption of
the housing element by the local jurisdiction.
Since the 2006 Housing Element was prepared concurrent with all other elements of the City’s
first General Plan, it was a unique opportunity to consider and address housing needs along
with other policies in a comprehensive fashion. The 2006 Housing Element process and the
2010 update were strategic opportunities to develop solutions to local housing needs and
opportunities to engage local residents, housing advocates, developers, elected officials, and
other interested persons and organizations in a constructive process to define and evaluate
potential strategies and solutions. The 2015–2023 Housing Element update was prepared
concurrently with a comprehensive update to the zoning regulations, which provided an
opportunity to review and refine City housing policies and development regulations in a
comprehensive and coordinated fashion.
As part of the 2015–2023 Housing Element update process, noticed public hearings were
conducted by the Planning Commission and City Council in the time and manner stipulated by
the California Government Code. Following receipt of testimony from these hearings, together
with comments received from HCD, the Housing Element was adopted and submitted to HCD
for certification. All HCD submittals and review letters are available on the City’s website.

Regional Housing Needs Assessment
One unique aspect of state housing element law is the concept of “regional fair share.” Every
city and county in the State of California must adopt land use plans and zoning regulations to
accommodate a share of the future housing needs projected by HCD for the region in which it is
located. For Goleta and other jurisdictions in Santa Barbara County, the allocation of housing
needs is determined by the Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG)
through the RHNA process. As required by state law (SB 375 of 2008), the RHNA is prepared
on an 8-year cycle concurrently with every other update to the Regional Transportation Plan.
SBCAG adopted the RHNA for the 2015–2023 planning period in August 2013. The RHNA
assigns the City of Goleta a total of 979 units for the “5th cycle” planning period. 1 This total
housing need is divided among four income categories, as shown in Table 10-1. Cities are also
required to analyze housing needs for a fifth category—extremely low-income households—
which is a subset of the very low-income household category.
New housing units completed since the beginning of the projection period (January 1, 2014) are
credited toward the City’s housing need for this planning period. Table 10-1 shows the City’s
remaining housing need after accounting for units completed during 2014.

  * Assumed to be 50% of the assigned very low-income need per California Government Code Section 65583(a)(1)
State law provides that sites with zoning that allows a density of 20 or more units per acre are
deemed to be suitable for housing affordable to extremely low-, very low- or low-income
(collectively referred to as “lower-income”) households in suburban jurisdictions such as Goleta.
The law presumes that these densities are sufficient to make affordable housing feasible. As
shown in Table 10-2 and analyzed in detail in Section V of the Technical Appendix, Goleta has
identified sufficient sites at densities of 20 units or more per acre to accommodate the RHNA
requirements for lower-income housing during this planning period. Also as shown in Table 10-2
and analyzed in detail in the Technical Appendix, sufficient sites with densities of less than

  Under state law, the “projection period” is the timeframe for determining regional housing need, while
the “planning period” is the 8-year period between the due date for one housing element update and the
due date for the next housing element update. The 5th cycle housing element planning period for
jurisdictions in Santa Barbara County runs from February 15, 2015 to February 15, 2023, while the
“projection period” is January 1, 2014 to September 30, 2022. “5th cycle” refers to the five required
housing element periods that have occurred since the comprehensive revision to state housing element
law that occurred in 1980. Following incorporation, Goleta’s first housing element was adopted in 2006 for
the 3rd planning cycle.

It is important to recognize that the RHNA allocations are planning objectives, not development
quotas. In establishing the RHNA process, the state legislature recognized that cities do not
build housing, and the development process is dependent on willing property owners,
developers, lenders, and market conditions. The role of cities in the housing development
process is to adopt plans and regulations that enable a variety of housing types to be built,
minimize constraints such as fees and permit procedures, and assist affordable housing
development to the extent possible. The Technical Appendix includes a detailed discussion of
each of these topics and demonstrates that Goleta’s policies, regulations, and programs
facilitate development of a wide variety of housing types in a manner that is consistent with
other city goals and priorities.
10.2      FRAMEWORK FOR ACTION [GP]
This part of the Housing Element sets forth the general framework for developing an action plan
for housing. It states the goals, or principles, that guide the more detailed statements of
objectives, policies, and implementing programs in the following sections of the element.
Housing Goals
The following goals are intended to respond to housing needs within the context of the entire
General Plan. A goal expresses what the community wants to achieve but not how the goal
would be accomplished. The goals are broad in scope. The policies and programs that follow
are intended to provide more detailed direction and the means for accomplishing the goals.
•    A Balanced and Diverse Community. Goleta is a balanced community with a socially and
     economically diverse population that values preservation of the community’s heritage, sense
     of community, beautiful natural environment, attractive neighborhoods, diverse businesses,
     and adequate services.
•    A Variety of Housing Types and Choices. Goleta has many housing types and choices
     appropriate for the variety of people who live and work in the community, with sufficient sites
     to accommodate new housing needs at affordable prices and rents.
December 2014                                                                                                                  10-5

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                             10.0 Housing Element
•    Great Neighborhoods. Housing and neighborhoods show pride in their design and
     maintenance. There is creativity and diversity in the design of housing, and new
     development occurs in an environmentally sustainable manner. Goleta’s residential
     neighborhoods have parks and green space and engender a strong sense of community.
•    Housing for Special Needs. Support systems and housing are in place to help the
     disadvantaged (homeless and those at risk of homelessness; persons with mental, physical,
     and developmental disabilities; lower-income seniors; farmworkers; single parents with
     children; victims of domestic violence; persons with drug and alcohol dependence; persons
     with HIV/AIDS, etc.).
•    Employee Housing. The types and prices of housing are linked to the types and salaries of
     local workers. Consistent with fair housing laws, opportunities are provided for local workers
     to find housing in Goleta.
•    Community and Regional Collaboration. Goleta encourages active engagement and
     collaboration between governmental agencies, private organizations, and community
     stakeholders to create partnerships and share resources to achieve our housing goals.
Quantified Housing Objectives
The programs included in this element identify specific numerical targets for units and
anticipated dates by which the targets are proposed to be accomplished. In addition, the entity
having primary responsibility for implementation of each program is noted. The programs are
intended to be implemented in a timely manner and monitored for effectiveness in achieving the
housing goals. Assumptions for program performance are based on past performance, recent
trends, and available funding. Table 10-3 identifies the cumulative objectives of all of the City’s
housing programs during the 2015–2023 planning period.

10.3      CITY POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
Policy HE 1: Maintain and Improve Existing Housing and Neighborhoods [GP]
Objectives: To protect, conserve, and enhance the existing housing stock and ensure that
existing affordable housing at risk of conversion to market rates will remain affordable to the
greatest extent feasible.
Implementation Programs [GP]
HE 1.1         Code Compliance. The City will continue its proactive efforts to preserve residential
               neighborhoods, encourage good property management practices, and minimize
               physical deterioration of existing housing units through compliance with zoning and

              building standards. When code violations or deferred maintenance exist, property
              owners will be notified and encouraged to avail themselves of available resources to
              assist with maintenance or repairs.
              Time period:                Code Enforcement Officer initiates investigation into housing-
                                          related code deficiencies generally within seven days of
                                          receiving a complaint throughout the planning period
              Responsible parties: Planning and Environmental Review Department;
                                          Neighborhood Services and Public Safety Department
HE 1.2        Housing Rehabilitation. The City will help to publicize community service
              organizations that provide volunteer housing repair and improvement assistance for
              homeowners who are physically or financially unable to maintain or repair their
              properties. Flyers will be posted on the City website, at City Hall, and at other
              locations around the community.
              Time period:                Throughout the planning period in concert with non-profit
                                          planned dedicated services
              Responsible party:          Neighborhood Services and Public Safety Department
HE 1.3        Monitor and Preserve Assisted Affordable Housing Units. The City will strive to
              ensure that all affordable housing—whether provided through government subsidy
              programs or incentives granted by the City or County in approving projects, through
              deed restrictions, or through City or County inclusionary requirements—will remain
              affordable for the longest term allowed by law. In its expenditures from the Affordable
              Housing Trust Fund and other actions, the City will give priority to preservation of
              existing affordable units where the County’s affordability covenants or other
              regulatory agreements will be reaching the end of the term specified in those
              documents. Specific actions include:
              a. Affordable Housing Inventory. Maintain an up-to-date inventory of affordable
                   housing subject to recorded affordability agreements and/or covenants, and
                   potential expiration of affordability covenants. When units are determined to be at
                   risk of conversion to market rate status, the City will work with the property
                   owners and other parties to extend the affordability covenants to the extent
                   feasible.
              b. Preservation Efforts for Units at Risk of Conversion. Work with nonprofit
                   sponsors seeking to acquire and rehabilitate affordable rental housing units in
                   order to maintain ongoing affordability of the units. Actions include, but are not
                   limited to: (1) contact nonprofits, (2) identify support necessary to obtain funding
                   commitments from governmental programs and nongovernmental grants, (3)
                   assist with expedited permit processing, (4) waive or reduce fees if feasible, and
                   (5) provide local affordable housing funds when available.
              c. Low/Moderate Income Housing in the Coastal Zone. As provided in California
                   Government Code Sections 65590 and 65590.1, the City must require property
                   owners to replace low- or moderate-income housing units demolished or
                   converted within the Coastal Zone and require new housing developments in the
                   Coastal Zone to include affordable housing, unless projects are exempt from
                   these requirements.
December 2014                                                                                            10-7

              Time period:                Monitor at-risk projects annually (a); provide project-specific
                                          assistance on a case-by-case basis (a,b); comply with Coastal
                                          Zone requirements throughout the planning period (c)

HE 1.4        Preserve Mobile Home Parks and Facilitate Mobile Home Park Ownership
              Opportunities. There are five mobile home parks with a total of approximately 650
              spaces in Goleta. The City recognizes these mobile home parks as an important
              source of affordable housing and will work with residents, property owners, agencies,
              and nonprofit groups to seek ways to assist in the long-term protection and
              affordability of this unique source of housing through the following actions:
              a. Mobile Home Park (MHP) Land Use Designation. Discourage the closure and/or
                   conversion of mobile home parks to other uses. Mobile home parks will be
                   designated in the MHP land use category on the General Plan Land Use Plan
                   Map (Figure 2-1), and conversion to a different use requires an amendment of
                   the General Plan Land Use Plan Map.
              b. Relocation and Tenant Assistance. If a mobile home park is approved for
                   conversion to other uses, subdivision to allow ownership of individual sites or
                   airspaces, or conversion to a cooperative, the City will require the
                   owner/developer to provide relocation assistance (financial and/or other
                   assistance) for current occupants sufficient to cover the resulting relocation costs
                   to all displaced mobile home owners or renters. The City may approve a
                   subdivision of an existing mobile home park only upon condition that existing
                   occupants be extended a first right of refusal for purchasing an individual site or
                   airspace within the mobile home park. To the extent allowed by law, any
                   subdivision of an existing mobile home park is required to provide a number of
                   sites at prices affordable to low- and moderate-income households in accordance
                   with Implementation Program HE 2.5 Inclusionary Housing.
              c. Ownership Opportunities. Facilitate mobile home park ownership opportunities
                   while preventing displacement of existing residents. Actions may include, but not
                   be limited to, establishing an assessment district to pay for any necessary offsite
                   public improvements, considering provision of financial assistance through the
                   City’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund, and identifying other ownership
                   opportunities for lower-income mobile home park residents.
              d. Reduced Impact Fees. The City Council will consider providing a tiered
                   development impact fee structure that has lower development impact fees for
                   mobile home units located in mobile home parks commensurate with the lower
                   level of impacts for this type of development as compared to conventional
                   development.
              Time period:                Throughout the planning period (a,b,c); consider adopting a
                                          tiered development impact structure by 2018 (d)

HE 1.5        Limit Conversion of Rental Housing to Condominiums or Nonresidential Use.
              The City will deny condominium conversions unless the rental vacancy rate has
              averaged 5 percent or greater during the preceding 3-year period. The following
              provisions are also required: (1) exemptions for limited-equity residential
              cooperatives that provide long-term affordability for extremely low-, very low- or low-
              income households; (2) required relocation assistance when units are converted; (3)
              first right of refusal of purchase of units by occupants; (4) required percentage of
              units, consistent with Implementation Program HE 2.5 Inclusionary Housing to be set
              aside for extremely low- to moderate-income households; and (5) recordation of an
              Agreement to Provide Affordable Housing and deed restrictions that include
              implementation of resale controls and/or equity sharing.
              The City will consider adopting and implementing regulations to discourage the
              conversion of conforming residential units to nonresidential uses and regulate, to the
              extent permitted by law, conversion of rental housing developments to nonresidential
              uses to protect and conserve the rental housing stock.
              Time period:                Throughout the planning period; Zoning Ordinance
                                          amendment in 2015
              Responsible party:          Planning and Environmental Review Department
HE 1.6        Assist in the Effective Use of Available Rental Assistance Programs. The City
              will make full use of available rental assistance programs through encouraging
              owners of apartment units to accept Section 8 vouchers. The City will maintain
              descriptions of current programs and contacts to assist interested persons and will
              coordinate with the Housing Authority on rental housing assistance programs. The
              City will work cooperatively with other entities to assist 75 very low-income
              households with the Section 8 vouchers program.
              Time period:                Throughout the planning period

Policy HE 2:           Facilitate New Housing Development to Meet Growth Needs for
                       Persons of All Income Levels [GP]
Objectives: To facilitate a variety of residential development types commensurate with the
City’s RHNA and needs of the local workforce, designed to be compatible with and enhance
Goleta's neighborhoods and the community as a whole.
Implementation Programs [GP]
HE 2.1        Encourage a Diverse Range of New Housing. The City will ensure that plans and
              regulations encourage a range of housing types, sizes, densities, tenure, affordability
              levels, and designs in appropriate locations to accommodate residents of diverse
              age, social, and economic backgrounds, and the local workforce. Specific actions will
              include the following:
              a. Residential Development Capacity to Accommodate the RHNA. The City will
                   continue to ensure that sufficient land is zoned for housing with appropriate

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                               10.0 Housing Element
                   densities and development standards to accommodate the City’s RHNA
                   allocation at all income levels during the planning period.
              b. No Net Loss of Capacity. The City may only allow development of a site at a
                   lower residential density than assumed in the Housing Element Land Inventory if
                   it makes findings consistent with California Government Code Section 65863.
              c. Facilitate a Wide Variety of Housing Types. The City will adopt and implement
                   regulations and standards for multifamily housing, mixed use, live/work
                   developments, single-room occupancy (SRO) housing, co-op housing, transit-
                   oriented development (TOD), and other development types to take advantage of
                   affordable housing opportunities and ensure that regulations do not unreasonably
                   limit housing options.
              d. Mixed-Use Housing. Well-designed mixed-use residential/nonresidential
                   developments are encouraged by the City at locations where appropriate,
                   including but not limited to areas designated as Old Town Commercial,
                   Community Commercial, and Office and Institutional on the Land Use Plan Map.
                   The City will develop incentives to encourage mixed-use development in
                   appropriate locations.
              Time period:                Throughout the planning period (a,b); Zoning Ordinance
                                          amendment in 2015 (c,d)
              Responsible party:          Planning and Environmental Review Department
HE 2.2        Linkage of Housing and Jobs. To encourage adequate housing opportunities that
              meet the needs of the local workforce, the City will pursue the following actions:
              a. Housing Priority for Goleta Residents and Employees. To the extent permitted by
                   law, the City will give persons working and/or residing in Goleta priority notice
                   regarding available units, marketing, and selecting occupants for affordable units,
                   including rental and ownership units. The intent is to meet local housing needs
                   consistent with the RHNA and contribute to mitigation of traffic, economic
                   development, and community safety conditions.
              b. Mitigation of Employee Housing Impacts. The City will require new nonresidential
                   development and proposed expansion or intensification of existing nonresidential
                   development to contribute to providing affordable employee housing. The
                   proposed amount of floor area and type of nonresidential use must be factors in
                   establishing the requirement for individual projects. Alternatives to satisfy this
                   requirement may, at the discretion of the City, include payment of a development
                   impact fee, providing housing on site, housing assistance as part of employee
                   benefit packages, or other alternatives of similar value. The City will prepare an
                   Affordable Employee Housing Plan that includes details of the program, including
                   the results of a development impact fee study and/or alternative programs.
              c. Live/Work. Live/work units can provide affordable employee housing, generate
                   additional economic activity in the community, and help maintain an appropriate
                   jobs-housing balance in Goleta. The City will encourage opportunities for
                   live/work developments in appropriate locations where housing can be provided
                   for workers on site or through caretaker or other types of housing.

              d. Housing Opportunities for Existing and New Employees. The City will cooperate
                   with local school districts, public agencies, and businesses to identify
                   opportunities for assisting their employees in finding housing, such as employer-
                   assisted development of new housing units, mortgage buy-downs or subsidies,
                   rent subsidies, etc. Moreover, the City will seek the commitment of other
                   organizations, such as the Chamber of Commerce or Board of Realtors, to have
                   their members, particularly larger employers, address employee housing needs.

HE 2.3        Housing Design Principles for Multifamily and Affordable Housing. The design
              of new multifamily and affordable housing must provide stable, safe, and attractive
              neighborhoods through high-quality architecture, site planning, and amenities that
              address the following principles:
              a. Reduce the Appearance of Building Bulk. Require designs that break up the
                   perceived bulk and minimize the apparent height and size of new buildings,
                   including the use of upper-story step-backs, variations in wall and roof planes,
                   and landscaping. For example, windows, doors, and application of exterior finish
                   materials and trim are important elements of building design and an indicator of
                   overall building quality.
              b. Recognize Existing Street Patterns. Incorporate transitions in height and
                   setbacks from adjacent properties to respect adjacent development character
                   and privacy. Design new housing so that it relates to the existing street pattern
                   and integrates with pedestrian and bicycle circulation systems.
              c. Enhance the “Sense of Place” by Incorporating Focal Areas. Design new housing
                   around natural and/or designed focal points that are emphasized through direct
                   pedestrian and bicycle pathway connections. Site design and placement of
                   structures should include the maximum feasible amount of usable, contiguous
                   open space.
              d. Parking Standards. Review parking standards to ensure that they facilitate
                   affordable housing development while avoiding impacts on other developed
                   areas. Options may include, but are not limited to, the following:
                   1. Multifamily parking requirements.
                   2. Opportunities for shared parking for mixed-use developments.
                   3. Parking requirements for projects located near transit stops on the Hollister
                       Avenue corridor.
                   4. Parking requirements for small-sized units, including SRO and accessory
                       dwelling units.
                   5. Allowances for the establishment of a landscaped parking reserve that is
                       designated for parking if needed in the future.
                   6. Evaluation of opportunities for undergrounding parking and auto sharing.

                   7. Allowances, in certain instances, for parking standards to be adjusted on a
                       case-by-case basis, depending upon the location and characteristics of the
                       development and its intended occupants.
              e. Minimize the Visual Impact of Parking and Garages. Discourage residential
                   designs in which garages dominate the public façade of the residential building.
              f.   Provide Buffers between Housing and Nonresidential Uses. Ensure compatibility
                   of residential and nonresidential uses by addressing parking and driveway
                   patterns, transitions between uses, entries, site planning, and the provision of
                   appropriate buffers to minimize noise, lighting, or use impacts.
              g. Privacy for Individual Units. Site design, including placement of structures,
                   pedestrian circulation, and common areas, as well as elements of architectural
                   design such as placement of windows, must strive to maintain privacy for
                   individual dwelling units within multifamily projects, including privacy for individual
                   exterior spaces, to the extent possible with consideration for security and crime
                   prevention.
              h. Security and Safety. Site and architectural design of multifamily residential
                   projects must incorporate principles of “defensible space,” security for residents,
                   and public safety and facilitate policing and observation by law enforcement from
                   public streets and rights-of-way to the extent feasible.

HE 2.4        Facilitate Affordable Housing Development. The City will use its regulatory,
              financial, and administrative resources to assist in developing affordable housing
              units. Specific actions to be taken include the following:
              a. Provide Assistance and Incentives to Developers. Work with developers,
                   nonprofit organizations, other agencies, and the community to address Goleta’s
                   extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income housing need by offering
                   incentives such as density bonuses, modified standards, assistance with grant
                   applications, development clustering, land dedication as an alternative to
                   inclusionary requirements, second units, use of inclusionary housing in-lieu or
                   impact funds, fast-track processing, and/or reduced processing and infrastructure
                   fees. Priority will be given to housing affordable to extremely low-income
                   households to the extent feasible.
              b. Long-Term Affordability Covenants. The City will apply resale controls and
                   income restrictions consistent with current law to ensure that affordable housing
                   provided through incentives and as a condition of development approval remains
                   affordable to the income group for which it is intended.
              c. Land Banking. Consider financial-equivalent options for affordable housing and
                   special needs housing, including land acquisition and land banking.
              d. Lot Consolidation. The City will facilitate affordable multi-family housing
                   development on small parcels by encouraging the consolidation of adjacent
                   parcels. Parcel maps or lot line adjustments will be processed as part of

HE 2.5        Inclusionary Housing. To the extent permitted by law, the City will require all
              residential developments—including, but not limited to, single-family housing,
              multifamily housing, condominiums, townhouses, stock cooperatives, and land
              subdivisions—to provide affordable housing as follows:
              a. Projects consisting of one for-sale single-family unit will be exempt from the
                   inclusionary requirement.
              b. Projects consisting of two to four for-sale units shall be required to pay an
                   inclusionary housing in-lieu payment.
              c. Projects of five or more for-sale units will be required to construct the applicable
                   number of units, except that the City Council, at its sole discretion, may allow the
                   inclusionary requirement for these projects to be satisfied by alternative means
                   as set forth in this Implementation Program.
              d. Projects of five or more for-sale units located outside of the Central Hollister
                   Affordable Housing Opportunity Sites, including subdivisions for purposes of
                   condominium conversions, are required to provide 20 percent affordable units of
                   the total number of for-sale units. The City may consider decreasing the 20
                   percent affordable unit requirement, but not less than 15 percent, on a case-by-
                   case basis where the community services, such as new onsite or nearby
                   park/open space facilities, resulting from the project exceed standards set forth in
                   applicable law.
                   Proposed projects including for-sale units qualifying for a 15 percent affordability
                   level shall provide 2 percent of the total number of for-sale units at prices
                   affordable to extremely low- and very low-income households, 5 percent
                   affordable to low-income households, 4 percent affordable to moderate-income
                   households, and 4 percent affordable to above moderate-income households
                   earning 120 to 200 percent of the median income.
                   Proposed projects including for-sale units qualifying for a 20 percent affordability
                   level shall provide 5 percent of the total number of for-sale units at prices
                   affordable to extremely low- and very low-income households, 5 percent
                   affordable to low-income households, 5 percent affordable to moderate-income
                   households, and 5 percent affordable to above moderate-income households
                   earning 120 to 200 percent of the median income.
              e. Projects of five or more for-sale units located within the Central Hollister
                   Affordable Housing Opportunity Sites, including subdivisions for purposes of
                   condominium conversions, are required to provide 20 percent affordable units of
                   the total number of for-sale units. The Central Hollister Affordable Housing

                   numbers 10, 11, and 12. Required affordability levels on these sites shall be as
                   follows:
                   1. 5 percent of the total number of for-sale units within the project shall be
                        provided at prices affordable to extremely low- and very low-income
                        households.
                   2. 5 percent of the total number of for-sale units within the project shall be
                        provided at prices affordable to low-income households.
                   3. 5 percent of the total number of for-sale units within the project shall be
                        provided at prices affordable to moderate-income households.
                   4. 5 percent of the total number of for-sale units within the project shall be
                        provided at prices affordable to above moderate-income households earning
                        120 to 200 percent of the median income.
              f.   The primary intent of the inclusionary requirement is to achieve the construction
                   of new affordable units on site. A second priority is construction of affordable
                   units off site or the transfer of sufficient land and funds to the City or a nonprofit
                   housing organization to develop the required number of affordable units. If these
                   options are determined to be infeasible by the City, other alternatives of equal
                   value, such as, but not limited to, payment of an inclusionary housing in-lieu
                   payment or acquisition and rehabilitation of existing units, may be considered at
                   the sole discretion of the City.
              g. It is the City’s intent to facilitate the production of new affordable housing
                   commensurate with the needs of the community. Creative ways to meet the
                   City’s inclusionary requirement to help achieve City housing goals are
                   encouraged, especially for extremely low-, very low-, and low-income housing,
                   such as through partnership with a nonprofit housing agency. In addition,
                   tradeoffs of extremely low- and very low-income units for moderate-income units
                   may be considered if it can be demonstrated that the City’s housing goals can be
                   more effectively achieved. Such tradeoffs may incorporate a unit equivalency
                   based on a financial pro forma provided by the applicant.
              h. The City will secure the affordability of inclusionary units by requiring a covenant,
                   or other instrument approved as to form by the City Attorney, to be recorded
                   against the property. The term of affordability restrictions shall be based on
                   applicable federal laws and financing mechanisms, generally 45 years but not
                   less than 30 years, and provide for monitoring and reporting in a manner
                   acceptable to the City Attorney.

HE 2.7        Encourage Accessory (Second) Residential Units. The City will encourage
              construction of well-designed accessory dwelling units on existing single-family lots
              and in new single-family subdivisions with four or more lots, consistent with minimum
              lot size, parking, and street capacity. If public and/or nonprofit funding is used to
              assist in the construction of an accessory dwelling unit, the City will require a use
              agreement to ensure that second unit rents are affordable to lower-income persons.
              The City’s objective is to encourage 20 new accessory dwelling units (five low-
              income and 15 moderate-income) during the planning period through the following
              actions.
              a. Continue to allow accessory dwelling units as a permitted “use by-right” when the
                   single-family lot, primary structure, and second unit meet all of the zoning and
                   building development standards established for the zoning district in which they
                   are located and adequate traffic safety and parking are available. Second units
                   approvable “by-right” may be limited in size to a maximum of 650 square feet.
              b. Ensure ministerial approval of second units by developing standard design
                   guidelines for second units.
              c. Continue to maintain a tiered development impact fee structure that provides
                   lower impact fees for accessory dwelling units commensurate with their small
                   size and level of impacts.

HE 2.8        Funding for Affordable Housing. The City will develop ongoing City and external
              sources of funding to support affordable housing as follows:
              a. Maintain the collection of housing in-lieu payments, housing development impact
                   fees for nonresidential development, and any other voluntary donations, grants,
                   and matching funds or other similar payments in a City-managed Affordable
                   Housing Trust Fund(s) to be used in support of the production, acquisition of at
                   risk affordable housing units, or rehabilitation of affordable housing.
              b. Participate in external housing programs such as the HOME Investment
                   Partnerships Program (HOME) and Community Development Block Grant
                   (CDBG) and other programs when appropriate to leverage the City's affordable
                   housing funds for specific projects and programs (such as mortgage buy-downs,
                   etc.).
              c. Prepare a Comprehensive Affordable Housing Finance Plan (CAHFP) that
                   addresses all local and external sources of housing assistance funds and
                   identifies appropriate strategies for the use and disbursement of those funds to
                   affordable housing projects and activities.

HE 4.2        Resource Conservation in Existing and New Residential Development. The City
              will promote the following practices in existing and new residential construction:
              a. Retrofitting of existing residential structures to reduce energy consumption and
                   costs to owners and tenants is encouraged. These retrofits may include, without
                   limitation, increased insulation, weather stripping, caulking of windows and doors,
                   low-flow showerheads, and other similar improvements. The City will require
                   individual residential units within multifamily housing projects to be separately
                   metered for all utilities.
              b. The City will enforce the State’s and City's residential energy conservation
                   building standards through the City's plan check and building permit issuance
                   processes.
              c. New residential development and additions to existing homes must be designed
                   to provide a maximum solar orientation when appropriate, and cannot adversely
                   affect the solar access of adjacent residential structures. Use of solar water
                   heating systems, operational skylights, passive solar heating, and waste heat
                   recovery systems is encouraged.

              Responsible party:          Planning and Environmental Review Department
HE 4.3        Use of Renewable Energy Sources. For new projects, the City encourages the
              incorporation of renewable energy sources. The City will consider incorporating
              renewable energy sources that do not have adverse effects on the environment or on
              any adjacent residential uses. Solar access must be protected in accordance with
              the State of California Solar Rights Act. New development cannot impair the
              performance of existing solar energy systems. Compensatory or mitigation measures
              may be considered in instances where there is no reasonable alternative.

HE 4.4        Transit-Oriented Development. The City will encourage transit-oriented housing
              development to enable efficient public transit systems and alternatives to driving
              (walking and bicycling). In coordination with regional transportation planning
              activities, the City will work with developers to incorporate transit improvements,
              such as bus shelters and turnouts or other transit improvements, as appropriate and
              feasible for a project. Residential development plans will incorporate pedestrian and
              bicycle facilities, including, but not limited to, sidewalks, benches, bicycle racks, and

              a. The City will continue to coordinate housing strategies with other jurisdictions,
                   agencies, and organizations in the south coast area to address housing needs on
                   a regional basis.
              b. The City will continue to facilitate and encourage public participation in affected
                   neighborhoods and all economic segments of the community in the formulation
                   and review of housing and related land use programs and actions. Specific
                   strategies include:
                   1. Provide written materials at public locations (including social service centers
                       and public transit locations, where feasible) and on the City’s website.
                   2. Provide information to real estate professionals, property owners, and tenants
                       on their rights and responsibilities and the resources available to address fair
                       housing issues.
                   3. Work with local nonprofit and service organizations to distribute information to
                       the public.
                   4. Provide public information through articles in the local newspaper and cable
                       TV public service announcements.
                   5. Work with other public agencies, businesses, and community groups to
                       identify affordable and special needs housing opportunities.
                   6. Provide fair housing in-service training, press releases, direct contact with
                       interest groups, and posting of fair housing laws, contacts, and phone
                       numbers.
              c. In recognition of the limited resources available to achieve housing goals, the
                   City will seek ways to organize and allocate staffing and other resources
                   effectively and efficiently to implement the programs of the Housing Element.
                   Opportunities to enhance Goleta’s capabilities may include:
                   1. Sharing or pooling resources and coordinating tasks among multiple
                       jurisdictions in implementing common housing programs.
                   2. Identifying information resources.

                       etc.) linked to housing programs to enable the effective and efficient
                       management of housing data.
              d. Developers of all major residential projects are encouraged to have meetings
                   with neighborhood residents early in the process to undertake problem-solving
                   and facilitate faster, more informed and constructive development review and
                   decision-making. The City will facilitate neighborhood participation in the project
                   review and decision-making process.
              e. The City will work collaboratively with other agencies in the region to identify and
                   advocate for changes in state law or regional policies to implement local housing
                   solutions and achieve housing goals.

I. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This section examines general population and household characteristics and trends, such as
age, race and ethnicity, employment, household composition and size, household income, and
special needs. Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g., number of units and type,
tenure, age and condition, costs) are also addressed. Finally, the City’s projected housing
growth needs based on the 2014–2022 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) are
examined.
The Housing Needs Assessment uses the most recent available data from the U.S. Census, the
California Department of Finance (DOF), the California Employment Development Department
(EDD), the Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG), and other relevant
sources. Supplemental data were obtained through field surveys and from the California
Department of Finance.
I.A Population Characteristics
I.A.1    Population Growth Trends
The City of Goleta was incorporated in February 2002. The apparent decline in the City’s
reported population between 2003 and 2014 was the result of inconsistencies between the
actual City boundary and the geographic area used by the Census Bureau for the Goleta
Census Designated Place (CDP). The 2010 Decennial Census was the first complete Census
tabulation of the City’s population. From 2010 to 2014 the City’s estimated population increased
by 314 persons (see Table 10A-1).

I.A.2    Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age groups
have different housing needs based on lifestyles, family types, income levels, and housing
preference. Table 10A-2 and Chart 10A-1 provide a comparison of the City and County
population by age group as reported in the 2010 Census. This table shows that the age
distribution of the City’s population is older than that for Santa Barbara County as a whole, with
Goleta’s population having a median age of 36.5 years compared to 33.6 years for the County
as a whole. An aging population has implications regarding the type and size of future housing
needs, as well as accessibility (see also the discussion of the elderly in Section I.E.2).

California Department of Finance population projections by age group for the 2010–2060 period
are illustrated in Chart 10A-2. Senior citizens are expected to be the fastest-growing age group
over the next 50 years, with the 65+ group representing almost two-thirds of the total population
increase. By contrast, the working-age adult population (25–64) is expected to comprise less
than one-third of population growth.
Section III, “Constraints,” describes how the City’s land use plans and zoning regulations
accommodate the housing needs of senior citizens.

I.A.3    Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of the City differs from that of the County in that a lower
proportion of City residents are Hispanic/Latino. Approximately 67 percent of City residents are
non-Hispanic white, contrasted with 57 percent for the County as a whole. Asians, with
9 percent of the population, represent the City’s largest non-Hispanic minority group
(Table 10A-3).

I.B Household Characteristics
I.B.1    Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing needed in a
city. The U.S. Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing unit, which
may include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated
persons sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as dormitories, retirement or
convalescent homes, or other group living situations are included in population totals but are not
considered households.
Goleta had 10,903 households as reported in the 2010 Census. Table 10A-4 provides a
comparison of households by type for the City and Santa Barbara County as a whole. Family
households in 2010 comprised approximately 62 percent of all households in the City, slightly
less than the 65 percent for the County as a whole. Single persons represented about
25 percent of all households in both the City and the County. The City’s average household size
is slightly lower than that for the County as a whole (2.72 persons per household City vs.
2.86 persons per household County). Only about one-quarter of family households reported
children under 18 living at home.

I.B.2    Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market. Communities
strive to have an adequate supply of units available both for rent and for sale in order to
accommodate a range of households with varying incomes, family sizes and composition, and
lifestyles. Table 10A-5 provides a comparison of the number of owner-occupied and renter-
occupied units in the City in 2010 as compared to that for the County as a whole. This table
reveals that about half of all housing units were owner-occupied in both the City and the County,
while about 44 percent were renter-occupied.

I.B.3    Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The
U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than one
person per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding when there are
more than 1.5 residents per room. Overcrowded households are usually a reflection of the lack
of affordable housing (see Section D.4 below for a detailed definition of “affordable” housing).
Table 10A-6 summarizes recent overcrowding data for the City of Goleta as reported by the
Census Bureau.

Based on U.S. Census standards, Goleta residents live in relatively less crowded housing
conditions than Santa Barbara County as a whole. Recent U.S. Census data indicate that only
about 2 percent of owner-occupied units and 6 percent of renter-occupied units were
overcrowded in Goleta. In the County, however, about 4 percent of owner-occupied units and
about 14 percent of renter-occupied units are considered overcrowded.
I.B.4    Household Income
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community—the ability of
residents to afford housing is directly related to household income. According to recent U.S.
Census data, the median household income in Goleta was about $73,000, compared to about
$63,000 countywide.

I.B.5    Overpayment
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30 percent of
gross household income. Table 10A-8 displays recent U.S. Census estimates for overpayment
by tenure. According to recent U.S. Census data, approximately 48 percent of all renter
households and 34 percent of all owner households were overpaying for housing. Overpayment
is most common among extremely low-income (ELI) households, with 75 percent of ELI owners
and 93 percent of ELI renters overpaying.
Although homeowners enjoy interest and property tax deductions and other benefits that help to
compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to defer maintenance
or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For lower-income renters, severe
cost burden can require families to double up, resulting in overcrowding and related problems.
Extremely Low-Income Households
State law requires quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of
extremely low-income (ELI) households. ELI is defined as households with income less than
30% of area median income. The 2014 area median income for Santa Barbara County was
$73,300 (see Table 10A-13). For ELI households, this results in an income of $23,900 or less
for a four-person household. Households with extremely low incomes have a variety of housing
problems and needs.
Existing Needs - According to recent ACS data (Table 10A-8), approximately 1,230 ELI
households resided in the City, representing 10.4% of all households. Approximately 75% of ELI
owners and 93% of ELI renters reported overpayment for housing.
Projected Needs - The projected housing need for ELI households is assumed to be 50% of
the City’s very low-income regional housing need of 235 units. As a result, the City has a
projected need for 118 ELI units. The resources and programs to address this need are the

same as for low-income housing in general and are discussed throughout the Housing Element,
including the Housing Plan. Because the needs of ELI households overlap extensively with
other special needs groups, further analysis and resources for ELI households can be found
below in Section I.E, Special Needs and Section III.A.1.b, Zoning Regulations.

I.C Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs
available in each employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and size of
housing residents can afford.
According to recent U.S. Census data, approximately 34 percent of the City’s working residents
were employed in educational services, health care, and social assistance occupations
(Table 10A-9). Other industries with relatively high employment in Goleta included professional,
scientific, management, administrative, and waste management (12 percent), retail trade
(12 percent), and manufacturing (10 percent).

I.D Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the community’s housing stock and
helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the number and type of
housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure, vacancy, housing costs,
affordability, and assisted affordable units at risk of loss due to conversion to market-rate. A
housing unit is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as a house, apartment, mobile home, or
group of rooms occupied as separate living quarters or, if vacant, intended for occupancy as
separate living quarters.
I.D.1    Housing Type and Growth Trends
As of 2014, 47 percent of the City’s housing stock consisted of single-family detached units,
while multifamily units in buildings with five or more units comprised 30 percent of the total. By
comparison, the countywide housing stock had a higher percentage of single-family detached
homes. Table 10A-10 provides a breakdown of the housing stock by type for the City compared
to the County as a whole.

I.D.2    Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior to
1978, before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed, may have interior or
exterior building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built before 1970 are
the most likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in deteriorated condition.
Lead-based paint becomes hazardous to children under age 6 and to pregnant women when it
peels off walls or is pulverized by windows and doors opening and closing.
Table 10A-11 shows the age distribution of the housing stock in Goleta compared to Santa
Barbara County as a whole as reported in recent U.S. Census data. More than 70 percent of the
City’s housing stock was built prior to 1980 and therefore is likely to be in need of ongoing
maintenance and repair.

Due to the City’s relatively high housing values, market forces would be expected to encourage
more private maintenance, rehabilitation, and lead paint remediation, as compared to lower-
income communities.
A 2003 citywide survey of housing conditions found that units needing repair were spread
throughout the City, although particularly in the Old Town area, which has been the focus of a
Housing Rehabilitation Grant Program. Eighty-five percent of units surveyed were rated as
being in very good condition, requiring no repair. Very few units were found to be in need of
substantial repair. About 7 percent (598 units) of all units were reported as needing only minor
repair. Very little variation was noted in the quality of housing by type.
As described in the Housing Action Plan, the City is continuing its efforts to identify, preserve,
maintain, and rehabilitate existing housing, although the loss of redevelopment funding in 2012
has resulted in reduced capacity to carry out these efforts.
I.D.3    Vacancy
Housing vacancy rates as reported in the 2010 Census are shown in Table 10A-12. The table
shows that vacancy rates in the City were moderate, with a rental vacancy rate of 4.5 percent
and an owner vacancy rate of only about 1 percent. A rental vacancy rate in the 5-percent range
is considered a healthy market condition that allows for tenant mobility.

I.D.4    Housing Cost
I.D.4.a Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on the
area (i.e., County) median income (AMI):
•   Extremely Low (30 percent or less of AMI)
•   Very Low (31–50 percent of AMI)
•   Low (51–80 percent of AMI)
•   Moderate (81–120 percent of AMI)
•   Above Moderate (over 120 percent of AMI)
In addition to these categories, the City has identified a “workforce” income category of
120–200 percent AMI in recognition of the high housing costs in the south coast area.
Housing affordability is based on the relationship between household income and housing
expenses. According to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), housing is considered
“affordable” if the monthly payment is no more than 30 percent of a household’s gross income.
In some areas, these income limits may be increased to adjust for high housing costs.
Table 10A-13 shows 2014 affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for
housing in Santa Barbara County by income category. Based on state-adopted standards and a
family of four, the maximum affordable monthly rent for extremely low-income households is
$598, while the maximum affordable rent for very low-income households is $995. The
maximum affordable rent for low-income households is $1593, while the maximum for
moderate-income households is $2,199.

Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage interest
rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments, homeowner
association fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the maximum home purchase
prices by income category shown in Table 10A-13 have been estimated based on typical
conditions.

I.D.4.b For-Sale Housing
Housing sales price statistics reported by DataQuick Information Systems for calendar year
2013 showed median sales prices of $708,000 for single-family homes and $437,000 for condos
in Goleta (DQNews.com 2014). Based on the estimated affordable purchase prices shown in
Table 10A-13, it is unlikely that many market rate homes or condos would be affordable to
lower- or moderate-income residents. These data illustrate the fact that in beach communities
very large public subsidies are generally required to reduce sales prices to a level that is
affordable to low- and moderate-income buyers. At a median condo price of $437,000, there is a
gap of almost $100,000 between the market price and the maximum price a moderate-income
household can afford to pay for a home. For low-income households, this gap is about
$200,000.
I.D.4.c Rental Housing
A rental survey conducted in May 2014 found typical rents for 2-bedroom units in large
apartment complexes in the $2,000 to $2,500 per month range. Median rents for smaller units
are estimated to be approximately $1,050 for studios and $1,270 (City of Goleta 2014a). As
would be expected in a desirable beach community in southern California, when market rents
are compared to the amounts households can afford to pay (Table 10A-13), it is clear that very
low- and extremely low-income households have a very difficult time finding housing without
overpaying. At a rent of $2,000 per month, the gap between market rent and affordable rent at
the very low-income level is about $1,000 per month, while the gap at the extremely low-income
level is over $1,400 per month.

I.E    Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to special
circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and income, family
characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some Goleta residents may
experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines special needs groups to include persons with disabilities, the
elderly, large households, female-headed households with children, homeless people, and
farmworkers. This section contains a discussion of the housing needs facing each of these
groups.
I.E.1    Persons with Disabilities
Recent U.S. Census data reported that approximately 493 people in Goleta between 18 and 64
years of age, or 2.6 percent of the working age population, reported a disability that affected
their ability to care for themselves (Table 10A-14). For those age 65 and over, reported
disabilities are much more prevalent. Over 1,000 seniors reported an ambulatory difficulty
(24 percent) while 19 percent reported a difficulty with living independently. Housing
opportunities for persons with disabilities can be maximized through housing assistance
programs and universal design features such as widened doorways, ramps, lowered
countertops, single-level units, and ground floor units. The City also encourages development of
assisted living and supportive housing facilities through its zoning regulations (see further
discussion in Section III, “Constraints”).

I.E.1.a Developmentally Disabled
As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an
individual that:
•   Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
    impairments.
•   Is manifested before the individual attains age 18.
•   Is likely to continue indefinitely.
•   Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major
    life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility;
    e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency.

•   Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or
    generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or
    extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
The U.S. Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S.
Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the
population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many
developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment
where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an
institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because
developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an
appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based
services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families
through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two
community-based facilities. Goleta is served by the Tri-Counties Regional Center 1 (TCRC),
which is based in Santa Barbara. As of 2014, TCRC served approximately 11,500 clients and
had 280 staff persons. Any resident who has a developmental disability that originated before
age 18 is eligible for services. Services are offered to people with developmental disabilities
based on Individual Program Plans and may include: adult day programs; advocacy;
assessment/consultation; behavior management programs; diagnosis and evaluation;
independent living services; infant development programs; information and referrals; mobility
training; prenatal diagnosis; residential care; respite care; physical and occupational therapy;
transportation; consumer, family, and vendor training; and vocational training. TCRC also
coordinates the state-mandated Early Start program, which provides services for children under
age 3 who have or are at substantial risk of having a developmental disability.
I.E.2    Elderly
According to recent U.S. Census data, about 34 percent of owner households and 12 percent of
renter households in Goleta were headed by someone age 65 or older (Table 10A-15). Many
elderly persons are dependent on fixed incomes and/or have a disability. Elderly homeowners
may be physically unable to maintain their homes or cope with living alone. The housing needs
of this group can be addressed through smaller units, second units on lots with existing homes,
shared living arrangements, congregate housing, and housing assistance programs.

I.E.3     Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as those
with five or more members. Among both owners and renters, about 60 percent of households
have only one or two members. About 10 percent of owner households and about 11 percent of
renter households had five or more members (Table 10A-16). This distribution suggests that the
need for large units in Goleta with four or more bedrooms is expected to be much less than the
need for smaller units.

I.E.4     Female-Headed Households
Recent U.S. Census data reported that approximately 8 percent of owner households and 13
percent of renter households in Goleta were headed by a female (Table 10A-17). While female-
headed households represent a small portion of households, they may have significant
difficulties finding affordable housing, particularly in expensive coastal areas.

I.E.5    Farmworkers
According to the Santa Barbara County Agricultural Commissioner, agriculture directly
contributes $1.8 billion to the County economy and provides approximately 16,000 jobs
(Agricultural Impact Associates LLC 2013). Farmworker households are considered a special
needs group due to the lower incomes typically earned by these households. Migrant workers
and their places of residence are generally located close to agricultural areas providing
employment.
As shown previously in the discussion of employment (Table 10A-9), it is estimated that there
are 159 Goleta residents employed in agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining jobs.
No data is available for residents employed as farmworkers. The housing needs of farmworkers
are met through a variety of housing types that are not limited to farmworkers, such as single-
family homes, apartments, or mobile homes. City regulations for these housing types are
discussed in the Constraints section of this Technical Appendix. In addition, housing targeted
specifically for farmworkers is regulated by Health and Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and
17021.6. These statutes require that cities treat groups of up to six farmworkers as a single
household for zoning purposes, and treat farmworker housing developments with up to 12 units
or 36 beds in group quarters as an agricultural use in any zone where agriculture is a permitted
use. Implementation Program HE 3.2e is consistent with these statutes.
I.E.6    Homeless Persons
HUD defines the term homeless as the state of a person who lacks a fixed, regular, and
adequate night-time residence, or a person who has one of the following primary night-time
residences:
•   A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living
    accommodations.
•   An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be
    institutionalized.
•   A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping
    accommodation for human beings. (Stewart B. McKinney Act, 42 U.S.C. §11301 et seq.
    [1994])

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                      10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
Although there are myriad causes of homelessness, among the most common are:
•   Substance abuse and alcohol
•   Domestic violence
•   Mental illness
Since 2003, all Continuum of Care Communities (those receiving Federal Grant Funds serving
the homeless) have been required to report the number of people who are homeless at a
particular point in time. Surveys are required every other year. The most recent Point in Time
(PIT) homeless survey in Santa Barbara County was conducted by the Central Coast Coalition
on Homelessness (C3H) on January 22–23, 2013.
At the direction of staff from C3H, approximately 650 volunteers were deployed to physically
count the homeless population in Santa Barbara County during the two-day PIT event, and also
administer the Vulnerability Index Survey for which respondents self-reported information. The
total 2013 PIT homeless count was 1,466 persons compared to a total of 1,536 recorded in the
2011 PIT survey (Table 10A-18). While exact counts by jurisdiction are not available, the PIT
survey reported 81 homeless persons in the Isla Vista/Goleta area, which includes
unincorporated territory. The City of Goleta contains approximately 56 percent of the total
population of Isla Vista/Goleta PIT survey area 2, therefore the number of homeless persons
within the City at the time of the 2013 survey is estimated to be 46 persons assuming homeless
persons are distributed in proportion to total residents.

There are a number of facilities and programs that address homelessness on a regional basis in
the southern Santa Barbara County area. Most of these are based in the City of Santa Barbara,
but many provide services to homeless people from Goleta. These include the following (City of
Goleta 2014a):

    clothing, medical care, job development, social services, life coaching, substance abuse
    recovery, and other vital services to assist homeless people into employment and
    permanent housing. The shelter program provides 30 beds for homeless individuals who are
    released from the hospital or experiencing illness living on the streets. The 24-hour shelter
    program provides 100 beds, expanding to 200 beds from December 1 to March 31.
3. Transition House: Three-stage housing program for homeless families that offers
    emergency shelter for 15–22 homeless families (70 people), transitional housing, and
    permanent affordable supportive housing. Services include meals and childcare when at the
    emergency shelter, and career counseling, financial management, and educational
    enhancements throughout all stages.
4. Health Care for the Homeless (HCH): The Santa Barbara County Public Health
    Department runs the HCH program, which provides comprehensive medical and dental care
    for the homeless population, including a significant medical outreach component led by
    Public Health Nurses (PHNs) stationed in thirteen homeless shelters and transitional living
    centers. The nurses provide triage care and make referrals to the health care centers and
    shelter-based clinics for those needing additional care.
5. New Beginnings Counseling Center: New Beginnings operates several programs for the
    homeless population, including the RV Safe Parking Program and the Supportive Services
    for Veteran Families Program. The RV Safe Parking Program provides safe overnight
    parking for individuals and families who are living in their vehicles. A few of these safe
    parking sites are located in Goleta. Included in this program are social services and case
    management provided by New Beginnings case workers. The Supportive Services for
    Veteran Families Program is designed to help end homelessness among the veteran
    population in Santa Barbara County. This housing-first model aims to provide housing
    stability by providing cash assistance to those in danger of losing their housing and to
    rapidly transition those who are homeless into stable housing.
6. Unitarian Society of Santa Barbara Warming Center Program: Emergency homeless
    sheltering program that opens warming centers in various locations on nights when
    temperatures are expected to drop below 35 degrees, when there is at least a 50 percent
    chance of rain, or when there is rain with temperatures under 40 degrees. The facilities
    provide a safe and warm place for the homeless individuals to get off the streets and have a
    clean bed for a night with dangerous weather conditions.
Senate Bill (SB) 2 of 2007 strengthened the planning requirements for emergency shelter and
transitional/supportive housing. Unless existing shelter facilities are available to meet local
needs, jurisdictions must designate at least one zone where new shelters may be established
by right (i.e., without a conditional use permit or other discretionary approval). Please refer to
Section III.A.1.b for a discussion of the City’s zoning districts and regulations regarding
emergency shelters.

I.F    Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
As part of a housing element update, state law requires jurisdictions to identify assisted units
that are at risk of conversion to market rate housing during the 10-year period 2015–2025.
Table 10A-19 summarizes assisted affordable units in Goleta. As seen in this table, there are
three developments with 33 deed-restricted units that are at risk of conversion to market rate
status during the next 10 years.
The California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) along with HCD, the California Tax Credit
Allocation Committee, and the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee are currently
undertaking a large-scale affordable housing development cost study within California. The
results of this study are expected to be released in 2014 and should provide good information
for estimating costs for replacing at-risk units.
For purposes of this analysis, typical development cost is estimated at $300,000 to $400,000
per unit in Goleta. Therefore, if all 33 of the at-risk units were lost, the total replacement cost
would be approximately $9.9 million to $13.2 million.
An alternative to new construction is preserving at-risk units through the purchase of
affordability covenants. Preservation cost is estimated as the difference between market rent
and affordable rent. Assuming an average affordability gap of approximately $500 to $1,000 per
month per unit, the total cost of preserving 33 units would be approximately $16,500 to $33,000
per month or $198,000 to $396,000 per year.
Local entities with the capacity to manage affordable units include the Housing Authority of the
County of Santa Barbara, People’s Self Help Housing, Cabrillo Economic Development
Corporation, Santa Barbara County Housing and Community Development, City of Santa
Barbara Community Development (Housing and Human Services), Housing Authority of the City
of Santa Barbara, and Habitat for Humanity

I.G Low- and Moderate-Income Housing in the Coastal Zone
As shown in Figure 10A-1, a relatively small portion of Goleta is within the Coastal Zone, and
much of this area is an undeveloped environmentally sensitive area. California Government
Code Section 65590 et seq. prohibits conversion or demolition of existing residential dwelling
units occupied by low- or moderate-income persons or families unless provision has been made
for the replacement in the same city or county of those dwelling units with units for persons and
families of low or moderate income (excludes structures with less than 3 units, or less than
10 units for projects with more than one structure, among other exclusions). Section 65590(d)
further requires new housing development in the Coastal Zone to provide housing units for
persons and families of low or moderate income or, if not feasible, to provide such units at
another location within the same city or county, within the Coastal Zone or within 3 miles
thereof. As seen in Table 10A-20, 65 affordable units have been constructed in the Coastal
Zone or within 3 miles since the City’s incorporation in 2002. No units occupied by low- or
moderate-income households have been demolished in the Coastal Zone.

I.H Future Housing Needs
The RHNA is a key tool local governments use to plan for anticipated growth. The RHNA
quantifies the anticipated need for housing within each jurisdiction in Santa Barbara County for
the projection period 3, January 1, 2014 to September 30, 2022. Communities then determine
how they will address this need through the process of updating the housing elements of their
general plans.
The RHNA for the 5th housing element cycle was adopted by the SBCAG in August 2013. The
future need for housing is determined primarily by the forecasted growth in households in a
community. Each new household, created by a child moving out of a parent’s home, by a family
moving to a community for employment, and so forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The
housing need for new households is then adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy to
promote housing choice and mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected
to be lost due to demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of
these factors—household growth, vacancy need, and replacement need—determines the
3
  Under state law, the “projection period” is the timeframe for determining regional housing need, while the “planning
period” is the 8-year period between the due date for one housing element update and the due date for the next

construction need for a community. Total housing need is then distributed among four income
categories on the basis of the County’s income distribution, with adjustments to avoid an over-
concentration of lower-income households in any community.
The new housing need allocated to the City of Goleta for the 2015–2023 planning period is
979 units, distributed by income category as shown in Table 10A-21. Pursuant to California
Government Code Section 65583(a)(1), it is assumed that the need for extremely low-income
households is half of the very low-income need. A discussion of how the City will accommodate
its housing need is provided in Section V, “Residential Land Inventory.”

II. RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
II.A Land Resources
Section 65583(a)(3) of the California Government Code requires housing elements to contain
an “inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public
facilities and services to these sites.” A detailed analysis of vacant land and potential
redevelopment opportunities has been prepared and is described in Section V, “Residential
Land Inventory.” The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 10A-22 below. The table
shows that the City’s land inventory exceeds the RHNA allocation of 2 units for this planning
period.
As discussed in Section V, the requirement to demonstrate availability of lower-income sites is
met through zoning that allows redevelopment of underutilized sites at densities greater than
20 units/acre. In 2004 state law was amended to establish 20 units/acre as the density deemed
appropriate to accommodate housing for lower-income households in suburban cities like
Goleta [California Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B)]. The land inventory analysis in
Section V contains an estimate of the realistic capacity of potential sites for residential
development with zoning to accommodate the City’s assigned RHNA allocation for all income
levels.

A discussion of public facilities and infrastructure needed to serve future development is
contained in Section III.B, “Non-Governmental Constraints.” There are currently no known
service limitations that would preclude the level of development described in the RHNA,
although developers will be required to pay fees or construct public improvements prior to or
concurrent with development.
II.B Financial and Administrative Resources
II.B.1 Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) and HOME Program
Federal funding for housing programs is provided by HUD. Goleta is an “entitlement city” and
receives funding directly from HUD on a formula basis. The City’s Consolidated Plan describes
needs, resources, and planned expenditures of federal grant funds.
December 2014                                                                                            10A-25

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                              10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
To meet the community’s needs, the Consolidated Plan is guided by three goals:
•    Provide decent housing by preserving and increasing the affordable housing stock and
     supporting housing programs for the homeless, including emergency shelter, transitional
     and permanent housing programs, and homelessness prevention.
•    Provide a suitable living environment: 1) by supporting code enforcement and crime
     prevention activities; increased affordable housing opportunities; and continued
     improvements with infrastructure reconstruction and public facilities rehabilitation; and 2) by
     increasing supportive services to people with special needs, homeless persons, and low-
     income persons and families.
•    To expand economic opportunities through public infrastructure improvements in Goleta’s
     Old Town District.
The CDBG program provides funds for a range of community development activities. Eligible
activities include, but are not limited to: acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or property;
public facilities improvements; public services; economic development; fair housing services;
relocation, rehabilitation, and construction (under certain limitations) of housing; homeownership
assistance, and clearance activities.
The City has seen its CDBG allocation generally trend downward since becoming an entitlement
city. In recent years the City has received approximately $200,000 annually in federal CDBG
funds. These funds are typically used for public services and infrastructure improvements.
Services to youth, seniors, and low-income persons; economic development; and public
improvements are the focus for the coming five year period.
The 2014–2019 Consolidated Plan proposes that more activities emphasizing affordable
housing and supportive services be provided in the next 5 years in order to address and achieve
the community’s needs and goals. CDBG program activities include rehabilitation and
construction of public facilities and infrastructure, and public services such as assistance to
seniors, youth, the homeless and those in danger of becoming homeless, persons with special
needs, and low-income people in general.
II.B.2 Section 8 Rental Assistance
The federal Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program assists very low-income senior
citizens, families, and the disabled with the cost of rental housing. Generally, a tenant pays
30 percent of his or her adjusted income toward the rent and the Section 8 program pays the
balance directly to the landlord. The Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara
administers the Section 8 program in Santa Barbara County and the City of Goleta. The
Housing Authority was founded on the belief that decent, safe, and sanitary housing is central to
the physical and emotional health, productivity, and self-esteem of the people it serves. The
agency’s mission is to provide affordable housing opportunities for low-income households in
the County of Santa Barbara (including Goleta) in an environment that preserves personal
dignity and in a manner that maintains the public trust. As of 2014, the Housing Authority
provided approximately 3,550 Section 8 housing vouchers, of which 236 were used by
households living in the Goleta area.
Demand for this program far exceeds supply. Approximately 700 persons are on the Housing
Authority’s waiting list for housing assistance. To help fill the gap, the Santa Barbara County
HOME Consortium (of which the City of Goleta is a part) has allocated HOME funds for a
December 2014                                                                                          10A-26

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                            10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
Tenant Based Rental Assistance program that is also managed by the Housing Authority. In
2013 alone, $700,000 was allocated to the program to assist low-income families countywide.
II.B.3 Public Housing
The Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara also owns and operates approximately
420 public housing units in Santa Barbara County. Within the City of Goleta, the Housing
Authority has 140 units, including 4 units for persons with special needs. These projects include
Braddock House (4 units), Aparicio Community Apartments (54 units), L.C. Grossman Homes
(14 units), and Sandpiper Apartments (68 units).
II.B.4 Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to
provide an alternate method of funding low- and moderate-income housing. Each state receives
a tax credit, based upon population, toward funding housing that meets program guidelines. The
tax credits are then used to leverage private capital into new construction or acquisition and
rehabilitation of affordable housing. Limitations on projects funded under the Low-Income
Housing Tax Credit Program include minimum requirements that a certain percentage of units
remain rent-restricted, based upon median income.
II.B.5 Mortgage Credit Certificates
The Mortgage Credit Certificates Program, which is administered by the Housing Authority of
Santa Barbara County, is a means of providing financial assistance to first-time homebuyers by
allowing those homebuyers to take a specified percentage of annual mortgage interest
payments as a tax credit against their federal personal income tax. The Mortgage Credit
Certificates are used for the purchase of new or existing housing located within participating
jurisdictions in Santa Barbara County. The certificates are available to eligible homebuyers on a
first-come, first-served basis.
II.B.6 State Housing Bond Funds
The voters of California have approved bond measures including Proposition 46, the Housing
and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2002, ($1.86 billion) and Proposition 1C, the Housing
and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, ($2.6 billion) to provide funding assistance for
affordable and special needs housing. A variety of programs are funded by these bonds,
including programs targeting both owner-occupied and rental housing. These programs are
administered by the HCD.
II.B.7 Housing Successor Agency
Prior to 2012, state law required that redevelopment agencies set aside no less than 20 percent
of all tax increment revenue derived within designated project areas for activities that increase,
improve, or preserve the supply of housing affordable to persons of low- and moderate-income.
Statutes then in effect also required that 15 percent of all new privately-developed housing and
30 percent of agency-assisted housing within the project area must be made affordable to
persons and families of low and moderate income. However, as a consequence of the state
legislature’s approval of Assembly Bill (AB) 1X26 and subsequent rulings of the California
Supreme Court, redevelopment agencies in California were dissolved in 2012 and this source of
funding for affordable housing is no longer available.
December 2014                                                                                        10A-27

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                             10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
On January 17, 2012 the City of Goleta took formal action to assume the role of Successor
Agency both for housing and non-housing functions needed to wind down the affairs of the
former Redevelopment Agency for the City of Goleta (Goleta RDA). The authority and
obligations of the Goleta RDA, along with all of its assets, property, contracts, leases, books,
and records are transferred to and thereafter vested in the “successor agency.” The successor
agency’s activities are subject to review and approval by an oversight board.
The Goleta RDA Successor Agency has complied with the RDA dissolution legislation (AB 26
and 1484). Successor Agency funds have been used to assist affordable housing units including
Sumida Gardens and Braddock House.
II.B.8 Housing Trust Fund of Santa Barbara County
The Housing Trust Fund 4 is a non-profit financing initiative with a mission to expand affordable
housing opportunities for low- to middle-income residents and workers in Santa Barbara County.
Housing Trust Fund’s primary program is a $5.5 million Revolving Loan Fund that provides
direct low-cost financing to facilitate rental and home ownership housing production throughout
the County. The Workforce Homebuyer Program, launched in May 2012, provides down
payment assistance to help low- to moderate-income households purchase a home in the
community where they work, enabling a stable residence that strengthens the family and
neighborhood.
II.B.9 City Affordable Housing Fund
The City maintains an Affordable Housing Fund that has accrued from developer payments
in-lieu of providing affordable housing units pursuant to the inclusionary housing policy.
Approximately $1.2 million is available in this fund as of 2014. Whenever possible, the City
seeks to use these funds to leverage other sources of assistance.
II.C Energy Conservation and Sustainable Housing Development
Assembly Bill (AB 32) codified the State’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target by requiring
that the State’s GHG emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. The Scoping Plan for AB
32, developed and implemented by the ARB, identifies specific measures to achieve these
reductions and articulates a key role for local governments, recommending they establish GHG
reduction targets for both their municipal operations and the community that are consistent with
those of the State (City of Goleta 2014b).
SB 375, passed in 2008, builds on the existing regional transportation planning process, which
is overseen by local officials with land use responsibilities, to connect the reduction of GHG
emissions from cars and light trucks to land use and transportation policy. SB 375 asserts that
“Without improved land use and transportation policy, California will not be able to achieve the
goals of AB 32.”
SB 375 has three goals: (1) to use the regional transportation planning process to help achieve
AB 32 goals; (2) to use California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) streamlining as an
incentive to encourage residential projects that help achieve AB 32 goals to reduce GHG
emissions; and (3) to coordinate the RHNA process with the regional transportation planning
process. SB 375 requires consistency between the Regional Transportation Plan and the

RHNA, which is accomplished through using a common growth forecast in both of these policy
documents.
In 2013 the SBCAG adopted both a Regional Transportation Plan and an RHNA. Local
governments cooperate in the implementation of SB 375 by adopting housing elements that
facilitate new housing development in a manner consistent with the growth forecast and RHNA.
II.C.1 Energy Conservation Opportunities
As residential energy costs rise, increasing utility bills can adversely affect housing affordability.
State of California Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings
were established in 1978 in response to a legislative mandate to reduce California’s energy
consumption. The standards are codified in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations and
are updated periodically to allow consideration and possible incorporation of new energy
efficiency technologies and methods. California’s building efficiency standards (along with those
for energy-efficient appliances) have saved more than $56 billion in electricity and natural gas
costs since 1978. It is estimated the standards will save an additional $23 billion by 2013
(California Energy Commission 2013).
Title 24 sets forth mandatory energy standards and requires the adoption of an energy budget
for all new residential buildings and additions to residential buildings. Separate requirements are
adopted for low-rise residential construction (i.e., buildings no more than 3 stories) and non-
residential buildings, which include hotels, motels, and multifamily residential buildings with four
or more habitable stories. The standards specify energy-saving design for lighting, walls,
ceilings, and floor installations, as well as heating and cooling equipment and systems, gas
cooling devices, conservation standards, and the use of non-depleting energy sources such as
solar energy or wind power. The home building industry must comply with these standards while
localities are responsible for enforcing the energy conservation regulations through the plan
check and building inspection processes.
State policy requires all new residential buildings to be “net zero energy” by 2020. On May 31,
2012 the California Energy Commission adopted new energy efficiency standards for both
residential and commercial buildings. The new Building Energy Efficiency Standards are 25
percent more efficient than previous standards for residential construction and 30 percent better
for nonresidential construction.
Some of the recent changes to residential standards include:
•    Solar-ready roofs to allow homeowners to add solar photovoltaic panels at a future date.
•    More efficient windows to allow increased sunlight, while decreasing heat gain.
•    Insulated hot water pipes to save water and energy and reduce the time it takes to deliver
     hot water.
•    Whole house fans to cool homes and attics with evening air, reducing the need for air
     conditioning load.
•    Air conditioner installation verification to insure efficient operation.
The Beacon Award: Local Leadership Toward Solving Climate Change, sponsored by the
Institute for Local Government and the Statewide Energy Efficiency Collaborative, is a statewide
program recognizing California cities and counties that are working to reduce GHG emissions,
December 2014                                                                                            10A-29

save energy, and adopt policies and programs that promote sustainability. Participating in the
voluntary Beacon Award program provides local agencies and their leaders with positive
recognition for saving energy, conserving resources, promoting sustainability and reducing GHG
emissions. Goleta has been recognized as a participant in this program. (Institute for Local
Government 2014.)
In July 2014, the City approved the Final Climate Action Plan (CAP). The 2014 CAP establishes
a 2007 baseline inventory; a planning horizon of 2007 through 2030 and quantifies GHG
emissions from the community-at-large and City operations; establishes reduction targets for
2020 and 2030; identifies measures to reduce GHG levels, focusing on those that the City has
authority to implement; and provides guidance for monitoring progress on an annual basis.
Consistent with the State of California’s objectives outlined in AB 32, the City added
Conservation Element Implementation Action 5 (CE-IA-5) to its 2006 General Plan/Coastal Land
Use Plan in 2009 to develop a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Plan supporting State
implementation of AB 32. The CAP outlines a framework to reduce community GHG emissions
by 2020 and 2030 in a manner that meets the intent of CE-1A-5 and is supportive of AB 32 and
Executive Order S-3-05. The Housing Element will support the CAP (City of Goleta 2014b).
The City also offers expedited processing for solar energy retrofits and requires new
developments to be solar-ready.
December 2014                                                                                       10A-30

III. CONSTRAINTS
III.A. Governmental Constraints
While most governmental regulations were originally enacted to protect the public welfare, over
time regulations can become obsolete, conflicting, or inappropriate for changing circumstances.
As a new entity, the City has inherited numerous ordinances and regulations from the County
that may not fit the City’s needs.
Like all local jurisdictions, the City of Goleta charges fees and has a number of procedures and
regulations it requires any developer to follow. There are many locally imposed land use and
building requirements that can affect the type, appearance, and cost of housing built in Goleta.
These local requirements include zoning standards, development fees, parking requirements,
subdivision design standards, and design review. Other building and design requirements
imposed by Goleta follow state laws, the Uniform Building Code, Subdivision Map Act, energy
conservation requirements, etc.
While local policies and regulations are developed to address public policy objectives in order to
protect development from hazards or nuisances or to protect important environmental or
community values, these regulations can also affect the price and availability of housing and, in
particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement
requirements, fees and required contributions to infrastructure, permit processing procedures,
and various other issues may present constraints to the maintenance, development, and
improvement of housing.
III.A.1. Land Use Plans and Regulations
III.A.1.a General Plan
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term general plan to
guide its future. As a relatively young city (incorporated in 2002) most of Goleta’s existing land
use patterns are the result of County land use plans and approvals that occurred prior to
incorporation. In 2006 the City adopted its first general plan.
The Land Use Element of the General Plan establishes allowable land uses and density of
development within the various areas of the City. Under state law, the General Plan elements
must be internally consistent and the City’s zoning must be consistent with the General Plan.
Thus, the Land Use Plan is the guiding document for future development and provides suitable
locations and densities to implement the policies of the Housing Element. Table 10A-23 shows
the allowable uses and development standards for various residential development types as
established in Table 2-1 of the Land Use Element of the General Plan.
December 2014                                                                                        10A-31

The General Plan identifies five residential land use designations and two commercial
designations where residential development may occur, as summarized below.
Single-Family Residential (R-SF)
The intent of this category is to identify and protect appropriately located land areas for families
living in low-density residential environments. Existing developed areas with this designation
were generally subdivided at four units per acre or less and are characterized by a suburban
atmosphere. This designation may provide a transition from the more intensely developed areas
of the City to rural open spaces. The designation is also appropriate for areas that are subject to
hazards or environmental constraints that limit the suitability of such areas for higher intensity
uses. This designation is intended to provide for development of one single-family residence per
lot at densities ranging up to five units per acre.
December 2014                                                                                                                                     10A-32

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                            10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
Planned Residential (R-P).
The intent of the Planned Residential designation is to allow flexibility and encourage innovation
and diversity in design of residential developments. This is accomplished by allowing a wide
range of densities and housing types while requiring provision of a substantial amount of open
space and other common amenities within new developments. Clustering of residential units is
encouraged where appropriate to provide efficient use of space while preserving natural,
cultural, and scenic resources of a site. Planned residential areas may also function as a
transition between business uses and single-family residential neighborhoods. This designation
permits single-family detached and attached dwellings, duplexes, apartments in multiunit
structures, and accessory uses customarily associated with residences. This designation is
intended to provide for development of residential units at densities ranging from 5.01 units per
acre to 13.0 units per acre, with densities for individual parcels as shown on the Land Use Map
(Figure 2-1 of the Land Use Element).
Medium-Density Residential (R-MD)
This use category permits multifamily housing and accessory uses customarily associated with
residences. Development may also include attached and detached single-family dwellings and
duplex structures. Medium-density areas may also function as a transition between business
uses and single-family residential neighborhoods. This designation is intended to provide for
development of residential units at densities of up to 20.0 units per acre. In order to achieve
efficient use of a limited supply of land designated in this use category, the minimum density
permitted shall be 15.0 units per acre, except where site-specific constraints are determined to
limit development to fewer units. During the 2007–2014 planning period, 24 parcels within the
R-MD land use designation (Central Hollister Housing Opportunity Sites) were rezoned from
non-residential to residential with allowable densities ranging from a minimum of 20 to a
maximum of 25 units per acre in support of the achievement of affordable housing goals.
High-Density Residential (R-HD)
This category permits multifamily housing units and accessory uses customarily associated with
residences. Such areas may also function as a transition between higher intensity business
uses and medium-density multifamily housing and single-family residential neighborhoods. This
designation is intended to provide for development of residential units at densities ranging from
20.01 units per acre to 30.0 units per acre. In order to achieve efficient use of a limited supply of
land designated in this use category, the minimum density permitted is 15 units per acre, except
where site-specific constraints are determined to limit development to fewer units.
Mobile Home Park (R-MHP)
This category permits planned mobile home parks where sites for placement of individual
mobile home units may be unsubdivided and held in a common ownership or subdivided and
sold as separate lots to individual mobile home unit owners. The intent is that mobile home park
sites be planned as a whole, with an adequate internal vehicular and pedestrian circulation
system, adequate common and individual parking, common open space and recreation
facilities, and other common amenities. Mobile homes usually provide a more-affordable
housing alternative, and this designation is intended to preserve and protect existing mobile
home parks in the City. The Mobile Home Park designation is intended to provide for
development of residential units at densities ranging up to a maximum of 15.0 units per acre.
Community Commercial (C-C)
The Community Commercial category is intended to allow relatively small commercial centers
that provide convenience goods and services to serve the everyday needs of the surrounding
residential neighborhoods while protecting the residential character of the area. Uses that may

attract significant traffic volumes from outside the Goleta Valley are discouraged. Mixed-use,
including residential, development at densities up to 12 units per acre may be permitted subject
to approval of a conditional use permit in appropriate locations. The Fairview Shopping Center
and Calle Real Center are included in this designation.
Old Town Commercial (C-OT)
This designation is intended to permit a wide range of local- and community-serving retail and
office uses. A major purpose is to enhance the physical and economic environment for existing
businesses and uses of the Old Town commercial district, the historic center for the Goleta
Valley situated along Hollister Avenue between Fairview Avenue and State Route 217.
Residential uses at densities up to 20 units/acre may be approved only in conjunction with a
permitted principal nonresidential use on the same site.
III.A.1.b Zoning Regulations
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development through the
Municipal Code. Zoning regulations serve to implement the General Plan and are designed to
protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents. The Municipal Code
also helps to preserve the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods. The Municipal
Code sets forth residential development standards for each zone district.
When the City incorporated in 2002, the County’s zoning regulations were adopted. A
comprehensive update to the Zoning Code is currently underway and is expected to be
completed in early 2015. The new Zoning Code will supersede current zoning regulations and
will include new provisions to address housing and other community needs. For example, the
City currently has limited mixed-use zoning regulations, which will be an important component of
the new Code. The following information reflects current zoning regulations and, where
appropriate, guidance for the new Zoning Code is provided.
Permitted Residential Uses and Development Standards
The current Zoning Code includes seven residential zoning districts:
•    Residential Ranchette (RR)
•    Single-Family Residential (R-1/E-1)
•    Two-Family Residential (R-2)
•    One-Family Exclusive Residential (EX-1)
•    Design Residential (DR)
•    Planned Residential Development (PRD)
•    Small Lot Planned Development (SLP)
The permitted residential uses and development standards for these zones are summarized in
Tables 10A-24 and 10A-25.

 Notes:
 1. As determined by the General Plan.
Zoning for Lower-Income Housing
State law requires that the densities of sites identified in the inventory be sufficient to encourage
and facilitate the development of housing affordable to lower-income (extremely low, very low-,
and low-income) households. State law allows the use of default density standards deemed by
the state legislature to be suitable for lower-income housing. The City’s assigned default density
under state law for lower-income households is 20 units or greater per acre. The DR-20, DR-25,
and DR-30 zoning districts allow densities of 20 units/acre as does the Mixed-Use Goleta
Overlay District where that District overlaps with the Old Town Commercial land use
designation. The General Commercial and Office and Institutional land uses also permit 20
units/acre residential development. These zoning regulations and land use designations help to
facilitate the development of lower-income housing.
In addition, nonresidential zones allow certain housing types as permitted uses, such as
farmworker housing and emergency shelters. Regulations for special needs housing is
discussed in more detail below.
December 2014                                                                                                                10A-35

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                             10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
Special Needs Housing
Under state law, persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities, persons
with disabilities, farmworkers, persons needing emergency shelter, transitional and supportive
housing. The City’s regulations regarding these housing types are discussed below.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
•   Residential Care Facilities. Health and Safety Code Sections 1267.8, 1566.3, and 1568.08
    require local governments to treat licensed group homes and residential care facilities with
    six or fewer residents no differently than other single-family residential uses. “Six or fewer
    persons” does not include the operator, the operator’s family, or persons employed as staff.
    Local agencies must allow these licensed care facilities in any area zoned for residential use
    and may not require licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons to obtain
    conditional use permits or variances that are not required of other family dwellings.
    The zoning regulations allow small state-licensed group homes and residential care facilities
    as a residential use in conformance with state law. Large residential care facilities are
    conditionally permitted within the Coastal Zone in the Professional/Institutional zones. As
    part of the new Zoning Ordinance, these regulations will be reviewed to ensure consistency
    with state law.
•   Reasonable Accommodation. The City’s Building Code requires that new residential
    construction comply with Title 24 accessibility standards. In addition, cities are required to
    adopt procedures for processing requests for “reasonable accommodation” in the
    application of building or zoning regulations to reduce barriers for persons with disabilities.
    The Zoning Code has been amended to include reasonable accommodation procedures in
    conformance with state law.
•   Definition of “Family.” The Zoning Code defines family as “One or more persons, related or
    unrelated, living together as a single housekeeping unit.” This definition is consistent with
    state law.
•   Maximum concentration and site planning requirements. Housing Element Program HE 3.2
    includes a commitment to ensure that the new Zoning Code provisions regarding
    concentration, separation, site planning, and parking requirements for residential care
    facilities or group homes are no more restrictive than permitted under state law.
Farmworker Housing
Under the state Employee Housing Act, farmworker housing for up to 6 employees must be
treated as a single-family residential use and permitted subject to the same regulations and
standards as apply to other residential uses in the same zone.
Additionally, farmworker housing in an agricultural zone is considered an agricultural activity
when consisting of no more than 36 beds in group quarters or 12 units or spaces designed for
use by separate households and must be treated as other agricultural activities in the same
zone consistent with the Employee Housing Act. The Zoning Ordinance is consistent with these
provisions of state law. The City also works cooperatively with local growers, agriculture-related
businesses (such as packing and distribution facilities), the Farm Bureau, and advocates for
farmworkers (e.g., California Rural Legal Assistance) for the purpose of determining available
resources and shortfalls in meeting the housing needs of farmworkers.
December 2014                                                                                         10A-36

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                              10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
Emergency Shelters
Emergency shelters are facilities that provide a safe alternative to acute homelessness either in
a shelter facility, or through the use of motel vouchers. Emergency shelter is short-term, usually
for 30 days or less. State law (SB 2 of 2007) requires that unless adequate shelter facilities are
available to meet a jurisdiction’s needs, emergency shelters must be allowed by right
(i.e., without discretionary review such as a conditional use permit) in at least one zoning district
but may include specific development standards.
Zoning regulations allow emergency shelters by right in the General Commercial (C-3) and Light
Industrial (M-1) zoning districts as wells as in the Retail Commercial (C-2) district with a Minor
Conditional Use Permit (Figure 10A-2) in conformance with SB 2.
These areas encompass over 700 acres and have vacant sites or buildings that could
accommodate year-round emergency shelters sufficient to meet the City’s estimated homeless
population of approximately 46 persons based on the latest PIT survey (see also Section I.E.6).
The General Commercial zoning district provides the most appropriate sites for an emergency
shelter because it is predominantly found in Old Town, south of Hollister Avenue. This area is
close to transit and other services.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
Transitional and supportive housing are longer-term types of housing, typically up to 2 years or
more. Residents are typically required to participate in a structured program to work toward
established goals so that they can move on to permanent housing. Supportive housing
residents are often provided with an array of supportive services to assist them in daily
activities. Under SB 2, transitional and supportive housing are deemed to be residential uses
subject only to the same requirements and standards that apply to other residential uses of the
same type in the same zone. The City’s Zoning Ordinance allows transitional and supportive
housing in conformance with state law.
Single Room Occupancy
SRO facilities are small, studio-type units that typically rent in the very low- or extremely
low-income category. California Health and Safety Code Section 17958.1 allows jurisdictions to
permit efficiency units with a minimum floor area of 150 square feet and partial kitchen or
bathroom facilities for occupancy by no more than two persons. SROs are not addressed in
current zoning regulations; however, SRO regulations will be included in the new Zoning Code
(Program HE 3.2).
III.A.1.c Off-Street Parking Requirements
Excessive parking standards can be a constraint to housing development, particularly affordable
units. The City’s residential off-street parking requirements within the coastal zone and in non-
coastal areas are summarized below.

These standards are considered reasonable and do not constrain housing development.
III.A.1.d Accessory and Second Units
Zoning regulations allow accessory units up to 650 square feet by right on single-family lots
when the main unit and the accessory unit conform to development standards. One off-street
parking space is required per bedroom. As part of the Zoning Code update, accessory unit
regulations are being reviewed (Program HE 2.7).
III.A.1.e Density Bonus
Under state law (SB 1818 of 2004), cities and counties must provide a density increase up to 35
percent over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the Municipal Code
and the Land Use Element of the General Plan (or bonuses of equivalent financial value) when
builders agree to construct housing developments with units affordable to low- or moderate-
income households. The City’s density bonus regulations have been amended in conformance
with state law.
III.A.1.f Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
There is often an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a plant rather than on site,
thereby reducing cost. State law precludes local governments from prohibiting the installation of
mobile homes on permanent foundations on single-family lots. It also declares a mobile home
park to be a permitted land use on any land planned and zoned for residential use and prohibits
requiring the average density in a new mobile home park to be less than that permitted by the
Municipal Code.
Mobile homes on a permanent foundation are permitted in any zones that allows single-family
homes, as well as in the Mobile Home Park zone. There are five mobile home parks in the City,
with a total of approximately 650 units (Figure 10A-3). Housing Element Program HE 1.4 is
intended to support the preservation of existing mobile home parks by requiring relocation
assistance for any mobile home park residents displaced as a result of conversion of the park to
another use and requiring that existing resident be offered first right of refusal in purchasing lots
in mobile home parks that are converted to ownership parks through subdivision. To the extent
allowed by law, any subdivision of an existing mobile home park shall be subject to the
requirement to provide a number of sites at prices affordable to low- and moderate-income
households in accordance with the City’s Inclusionary Housing Policy.

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                             10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
III.A.1.g Building Codes
The City’s building regulations (Title 15 of the Municipal Code) incorporate the 2013 versions of
the California Building Code, Residential Code, Electrical Code, Plumbing Code, Mechanical
Code, and Green Building Code. The City’s building regulations detail the revisions and
amendments to the Building Code that differ from state standards. These amendments are
mostly related to fire prevention and other basic safety measures.
III.A.1.h Coastal Zone
One and a half square miles (964-acres) of the City is located within the Coastal Zone (see
Figure 10A-1 in Section I, Housing Needs Assessment). The City does not currently have a
certified Local Coastal Plan. As a result, final permit authority within the Coastal Zone rests with
the California Coastal Commission. The necessity for projects in the Coastal Zone to obtain
permits from both the City and the Coastal Commission represents an additional step in the
development process, resulting in additional processing time and cost for applicants. The City is
addressing this potential constraint to development by applying for a certified Local Coastal
Program with the California Coastal Commission. The estimated time frame for certification is
no later than April 2016.
III.A.1.i Inclusionary Housing
The City’s zoning regulations require new for-sale residential developments with two or more
units to include affordable units, or pay in lieu payments. Inclusionary requirements are as
follows:
•    Projects with two to four units are required to pay an in lieu payment.
•    Projects providing community services that exceed the normal level are required to provide
     15 percent affordable units, as follows:
     ο   2 percent for extremely low- or very low-income households
     ο   5 percent for low-income households
     ο   4 percent for moderate-income households
     ο   4 percent workforce households (121-200 percent AMI)
•    Projects that do not provide community services that exceed the normal level are required to
     provide 20 percent affordable units, as follows:
     ο   5 percent for extremely low- or very low-income households
     ο   5 percent for low-income households
     ο   5 percent for moderate-income households
     ο   5 percent workforce households (121-200 percent AMI)
Inclusionary requirements may be satisfied by either for-sale or rental units. In order to minimize
the impact of the inclusionary requirement on housing cost, incentives are provided such as the
following:
•    An encroachment into the side setback of up to three feet from the property line, provided
     any structure on the adjacent lot is set back a minimum of five feet from the side property
     line;
•    A modification to the requirements for covered parking spaces;
•    Site coverage exceeding the base Zoning District standards;

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                              10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
•    A modification to standards for separation between structures on the same lot, consistent
     with building code requirements;
•    A modification to reduce the private or common open space to an amount not less than 25
     percent of gross lot area;
•    A modification to any other development standard that is mutually agreed to by the City and
     the applicant that can be demonstrated to provide for affordable housing;
•    Tandem parking in garages or driveways; or
•    Modification to the minimum lot size requirement.
These requirements help to address the need for affordable workforce housing in the
community and do not pose an unreasonable constraint on the cost and supply of housing.
III.A.2 Development Processing Procedures
III.A.2a Residential Permit Processing
State Planning and Zoning Law provides permit processing requirements for residential
development. Within the framework of state requirements, the City has structured its
development review process in order to minimize the time required to obtain permits while
ensuring that projects receive careful review.
Single-family homes in residential zones are permitted by right at the staff level. Design review
is not required. Single-family subdivisions require approval of a subdivision map by the City
Council, pursuant to state law. Multifamily apartments are permitted in the DR and PRD zones
subject to design review.
By encouraging developers to meet with neighborhood residents and allowing the combined
processing of certain applications, such as zoning and subdivision map requirements, the City
has taken actions that reduce processing time and potential delay for residential projects.

Design Review Process
The City undertakes design review of projects to ensure their fit with the community. While
design review may require processing time and impose some additional requirements, it is not
considered a significant constraint because it is important that new projects blend with the
community, becoming a natural and integral part of the existing neighborhood fabric, both
visually and structurally. Design review requirements generally provide an opportunity for design
issues to be raised early in the review process, thus helping to ensure community acceptance of

a project proposal and reducing delay due to project appeals and other forms of community
objections.
The design review process is conducted by the Design Review Board (DRB), with assistance
from City staff. All design guidelines, architectural guidelines, and development standards may
be obtained from the City’s Planning and Environmental Review Department from the City’s
website. Additionally, the Planning and Environmental Review Department has counter hours
5 days a week, Monday through Thursday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and Friday from
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., at which time City staff is immediately available for any questions
applicants or members of the public may have regarding the design review process and/or a
project that is going through the process.
The design review process includes four stages. The first step is a site visit, which is noticed
72 hours prior and attended by at least four members of the City’s seven-member DRB for
certain projects that are generally larger in scale, and 2 members for all other projects. The
purpose of this first step is to get an initial understanding of the project site and the surrounding
area. The second step is conceptual review of the project, which is an initial presentation and
discussion of the proposed project before the DRB. The applicant provides photographs, a site
plan, statistics, and schematics for this presentation. The purpose of this second step is to
provide the applicant with direction early in the process to avoid expending unnecessary time
and money. The third step is preliminary review, which is the substantive analysis of the
project’s design. The applicant provides a complete site plan, floor plans and roof plans,
elevations, and a preliminary landscape plan. The purpose of this third step is to ensure that the
project’s design is consistent with applicable City architectural guidelines and development
standards and resolution of fundamental design issues. The fourth step is final review, which is
a consultation/presentation to show compliance with standards and prior approval(s). The
applicant provides architectural plans, colors and materials drawings/plans, and site grading and
drainage plans and/or landscape drawings, if necessary, to demonstrate that the project’s final
design conforms to the prior approval(s).

The Zoning Code update will include a review of the City’s current review process with the intent
of streamlining the process to the greatest extent possible while ensuring an appropriate level of
review (Program HE 5.1).
III.A.2b. Environmental Review
Environmental review is required for all discretionary development projects under CEQA.
Processing time for residential projects depends on whether an EIR is required. Goleta follows
the procedures set forth in CEQA and its guidelines. Environmental protection requirements,
including protection of endangered species, may add time to the development process and
additional cost where it is necessary to evaluate the effects of the project and mitigate adverse
impacts.
CEQA Section 15332 (Infill Development Projects) allows the City to categorically exempt from
CEQA review infill development consistent with the Goleta General Plan and zoning
requirements. In instances where CEQA Section 15332 would not apply, the City will consider
using the Program EIR for the Goleta General Plan for assessing cumulative or area-wide
infrastructure and other potential offsite impacts to expedite the processing of subsequent
affordable housing development proposals, if appropriate.
III.A.3 Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost of
providing the service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and assessments are charged
by the City and other public agencies to cover the costs of processing permit applications and
providing services and facilities such as schools, parks, and infrastructure. Almost all of these
fees are assessed through a pro-rata share system, based on the magnitude of the project’s
impact or on the extent of the benefit that will be derived. Table 10A-27 shows fees associated
with new development in Goleta. The City periodically adjusts fees based on inflation. The last
comprehensive revision to the fee schedule occurred in 2008.

The City requires developers to provide onsite and offsite improvements necessary to serve
their projects. Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility extensions, street
construction, and traffic control device installation that are reasonably related to the project.
Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-of-way, transit
facilities, recreational facilities, and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision Map Act.
The City’s Capital Improvement Program contains a schedule of public improvements—
including street improvements and other public works projects—to facilitate the City’s continued
development according to the City’s General Plan. The program helps ensure that construction
of public improvements is coordinated with private development.
December 2014                                                                                                            10A-44

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                             10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
Although development fees and improvement requirements increase the cost of housing, cities
have little choice in establishing such requirements due to the limitations on property taxes and
other revenue sources needed to fund public improvements.
III.B Non-Governmental Constraints
III.B.1 Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones,
floodplains, or sensitive biological habitat. In many cases, development of these areas is
constrained by state and federal laws (e.g., Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
flood hazard regulations, the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, Coastal Act, California
Fish and Game Code and Alquist-Priolo Act). The City’s General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan
has been designed to protect sensitive areas from development and to protect public safety. As
discussed in Section V, Residential Land Inventory, the analysis of potential sites to
accommodate the City’s RHNA allocation has taken into account any environmental constraints
that affect development.
III.B.1.a Seismic and Geological Hazards
Seismic hazards include ground rupture, ground acceleration, liquefaction, and tsunamis.
Goleta lies within 5 miles of at least two major faults and fault systems, placing the community in
an area of high seismic risk. Nearby faults include the Glen Annie fault as well as the Carneros
and More Mesa faults. Several of these local faults are considered to be possibly or probably
active.
Goleta may also be subject to earthquakes occurring along unknown faults. Major potential
hazards occurring in the project area from seismic activity involve ground shaking and related
effects from earthquakes on local and major regional faults. Earthquakes cause a significant
amount of damage, particularly as a result of the impacts of ground shaking. Ground shaking
can result in surface rupture, liquefaction, and landslides, ultimately causing the failure of
buildings and city infrastructure.
Some areas of the City are also at risk from nonseismic geologic hazards, including soil erosion
and landslides, because of the many unstable geologic features in Goleta. Soils, slopes, and
cliffs are subject to erosion, weathering, groundwater withdrawal, and seismic processes that
could damage buildings, threaten public safety, and degrade environmental quality. The
General Plan Safety Element contains recommended actions and regulations to minimize risks
associated with development in areas with steep and/or unstable slopes, including requiring
erosion control measures and minimizing grading activities in sensitive areas.
To prevent or minimize damage associated with earthquakes, the Safety Element provides for
various land use policies, zoning and construction code requirements, and other programs that
require: (1) site-specific geologic investigations for residential development of four or more units
and that require incorporation of recommended mitigations, (2) all new construction to conform
with structural and safety standards in the latest edition of the state building codes, and (3)
complete seismic retrofit of unreinforced masonry buildings in accordance with code
requirements.
III.B.1.b Flood Areas and Hazards
There are approximately 640 acres (about 1 square mile) within the FEMA-designated 100-year
floodplain within Goleta. This is approximately 12 percent of the entire area of the City. About
December 2014                                                                                         10A-45

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                              10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
168 acres (about one-quarter of the entire amount) is in the Old Town area east of Fairview.
About 2.9 million square feet of building space (as measured by building footprints) is located in
these designated areas. Approximately 800 housing units (about 7 percent of the total housing
stock) are located in flood hazard areas.
Most of the developed area subject to flooding is along creeks flowing into Goleta Slough. The
natural and engineered drainage systems cannot fully contain periods of high runoff through the
five major creeks in this area. In addition, there may be localized flooding due primarily to
undersized storm drains. Therefore, in some cases, developers of new residential projects may
be required to upgrade storm drainage systems to mitigate flood hazards.
To prevent or minimize damage associated with flooding, the Safety Element provides for
various land use policies, zoning and construction code requirements, and other programs that
generally enforce the flood control measures required by FEMA. In addition, the General Plan
supports a capital project that will remove this hazard from much of the area designated in Old
Town where mixed-use activities may occur.
III.B.1.c Noise
The Noise Element describes noise constraints on new residential development. The policies of
the Noise Element are intended to protect public welfare. While they may increase the cost of
new development and could require some design mitigation to address potential impacts, they
are considered essential to the health and safety of future residents.
III.B.1.d Hazardous Materials/Crude Oil and Petroleum Products
The State of California defines a hazardous material as a substance that is toxic, ignitable or
flammable, or reactive and/or corrosive. Goleta has a history of urban uses, including extensive
and diverse industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential uses. These activities have
resulted in known contaminant releases occurring at active remediation sites, some closed
sites, and a number of properties that can be considered high risk for contamination based on
historic or current land uses.
Historically, extensive areas of the City were used for oil and gas production, notably in the
western coastal portions of the City. Remnants of this activity may have left behind toxic wastes
and wellheads that could pose significant hazards for new residential activity. Development
proposals in these areas must be closely examined to ensure that these potential hazards are
not present or have been fully mitigated.
Current oil and gas processing occurs at the Venoco Ellwood Onshore Oil and Gas Processing
Facility, which is located on 4.46 acres in the City. The facility treats crude oil and gas produced
from Platform Holly, located approximately 2.5 miles offshore. After treatment at the onshore
facility in the City, the oil and gas is transported west via Line 96 to a connection point at the
Plains All American Pipeline (PAAP) located on the Gaviota Coast in the unincorporated portion
of Santa Barbara County. The operation of Line 96 eliminated all marine transport (barging)
from the Ellwood Marine Terminal, which is located on 17 acres of property leased from the
University of California, Santa Barbara. The marine terminal is no longer operational and is
earmarked for decommissioning and restoration. Decommissioning and restoration activities will
be permitted by the County of Santa Barbara.
The principal hazardous effects to land uses located near these facilities would be from toxicity
of H2S, fires from different hydrocarbon streams released under different scenarios, and
explosions from vapor clouds or boiling liquid–expanding vapor explosions. The main risk to the
December 2014                                                                                          10A-46

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
population from the Ellwood Facility is from the separation and storage of liquefied petroleum
gas and natural gas liquids. While the toxic risk from the facility would be considered acceptable
based on the City’s Environmental Thresholds for Public Safety, the presence of these facilities
may limit the desirability of locations nearby for residential uses. The policies of the General
Plan encourage lower-intensity activities in these areas.
III.B.1.e Biological Resources
In Goleta and surrounding areas, nineteen habitat types support a variety of plant communities
and wildlife. Most of the land within the City is developed with a variety of agricultural,
residential, commercial, recreational, and industrial land uses. Undisturbed native habitat is
present in the mountain region where the national forest provides protection from development.
Elsewhere, undisturbed native habitat is present either along narrow riparian corridors or in
scattered undeveloped lands of varying sizes and under different management authorities. The
most extensive undeveloped land with important habitats in Goleta and its immediate vicinity
include the City-owned Ellwood Mesa Park, Santa Barbara Shores Park, Lake Los Carneros
Natural and Historic Preserve, extensions of Goleta Slough, and major stream corridors within
the City. The presence of these biological resources and laws designed to protect them can act
as a constraint on residential development.
III.B.1.f Agricultural Resources
Consistent with California Government Code Section 65589.5(c) of Housing Element law:
         The Legislature also recognizes that the premature and unnecessary development of
         agricultural lands for urban uses to have adverse effects on the availability of those lands
         for food and fiber production and on the economy of the state. Furthermore, it is the
         policy of the state that development should be guided away from prime agricultural
         lands…
The General Plan places a priority on retaining zoned farmland for agricultural uses. Since
agricultural land is a potentially suitable site for housing, this state policy reflected in the General
Plan constrains the potential supply of land for housing. Adequate sites to meet and exceed the
RHNA allocation have been identified without requiring the consideration of converting
agriculturally zoned lands.
III.B.1.g Historic and Archeological Resources
The General Plan establishes policies to protect important historical and archeological
resources in the community. Where these resources are found, constraints may be imposed on
the location or intensity of new housing.
III.B.2 Infrastructure Constraints
Site improvements include water, sewer, circulation, and other services and infrastructure
needed to facilitate residential developments. Although most of the community is well served by
infrastructure for existing needs, several areas still face various infrastructure constraints.
Moreover, the availability of water for all of the communities in Santa Barbara County remains a
significant long-term constraint on the total amount of development that can be supported in the
Goleta Valley. As a result of the ongoing drought, on September 9, 2014 the Goleta Water
District (GWD) declared a Stage II Water Shortage Emergency setting a 25% district-wide
reduction in water usage through mandatory water use restrictions and imposed a moratorium
and new or additional water connections effective October 1, 2014. GWD is a special district
that is independent of the City of Goleta or other municipal government. At this time it is unclear
how water supply will affect development over the 8-year Housing Element planning period.
December 2014                                                                                            10A-47

Goleta General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                10A Housing Element Technical Appendix
A recent assessment of wastewater treatment capacity prepared in conjunction with the Local
Coastal Program concluded that facilities are adequate to serve a population of 53,000
residents, which exceeds the level of development needed to serve projected housing growth
needs during the planning period.
As in the case of the other constraints, infrastructure constraints affect either the potential
location of housing or its cost. In some cases, such as water and sewer services, the
infrastructure is necessary for development to occur, and housing must either locate where it is
available or pay to have the service extended. In other cases, the inadequacy of the
infrastructure may be a constraint. Park and street facilities may be available but incapable of
accepting the additional use from new housing without lowering the level of service of the facility
to unacceptable levels. The General Plan establishes policies that will coordinate the provision
of these services with new development. Where new housing will reduce the level of service,
the development may either be delayed until the facility capacity can be increased or fees or
mitigation measures imposed to assist in financing the appropriate increased capacity to
accommodate the new development.
III.B.3 Land Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing. Land
values fluctuate with market conditions, and the downturn in the housing market following the
2008 mortgage crisis had a negative effect on property values. Real estate professionals have
reported that sales and property values are now recovering, however. Per-unit land cost is
generally affected by density—higher density allows the cost to be spread across more units,
reducing the total price. The City’s land use plan and zoning regulations identify appropriate
areas for higher-density housing in order to help mitigate the constraint of high land cost in
coastal areas.
III.B.4 Construction Costs
Residential construction costs vary depending on the type of construction and amenities.
Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor, development standards, and
general market conditions. The City has no influence over materials and labor costs, and the
building codes and development standards in Goleta are not substantially different from
standards of other cities in the area.
III.B.5 Cost and Availability of Financing
Goleta is similar to other communities in California with regard to private sector home financing
programs. The recent crisis in the mortgage industry has affected the availability of real estate
loans, although the long-term effects are uncertain. For buyers with good credit histories,
mortgages can be obtained at very favorable interest rates.
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire
neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in the area
(redlining). In monitoring new construction sales, resales of existing homes, and permits for
remodeling, the City has not seen any indications that redlining is practiced in any area of the
City.

III.C Fair Housing
State law prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property transactions,
and it is the City’s policy to uphold the law in this regard. Fair housing issues are addressed
through coordination with fair housing organizations to process complaints regarding housing
discrimination and to provide counseling in landlord/tenant disputes. Antidiscrimination resource
materials (e.g., handouts, booklets, and pamphlets) are made available to the public at City Hall,
at other public buildings, and on the City’s website (see Program HE 3.1 in the Housing
Element).

IV. EVALUATION OF THE 2007–2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
Section 65588(a) of the California Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the
effectiveness of the existing Housing Element; the appropriateness of goals, objectives, and
policies; and the progress in implementing programs for the previous planning period. This
section contains a review of the housing goals, policies, and programs of the previous housing
element and evaluates the degree to which these programs have been implemented during the
previous planning period. The findings from this evaluation have been instrumental in
determining the City’s 2015–2023 Housing Action Plan.
•   Table 10A-28 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Housing Element along
    with the source of funding, program objectives, and accomplishments.
•   Table 10A-29 summarizes residential development that has occurred during the 2007–2014
    period. As noted in the table, units completed on or after January 1, 2014 are credited
    toward the RHNA for the 5th cycle planning period.
•   Table 10A-30 presents the City’s progress in meeting the quantified objectives from the
    previous Housing Element.

V. RESIDENTIAL LAND INVENTORY
State law requires the Housing Element to include an inventory of vacant or underutilized sites
with the potential for residential development during the planning period. The assumptions and
methodology for estimating potential residential development capacity are discussed below. The
5th cycle RHNA projection period began January 1, 2014; therefore, units completed after that
date are credited toward the City’s RHNA allocation.
V.A Density, Capacity, and Affordability Assumptions
The land inventory analysis is based on realistic site capacity based on known constraints such
as easements or environmental conditions affecting each parcel, based on information available
to the City. Completed units and approved units are assigned to affordability categories based
on the actual or estimated price or rent (see Table 10A-13 in Section I), while sites designated
for residential development are assigned to income categories based on allowable density.
Under state law (California Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B)), the lower-income
default density for Goleta is 20 units/acre, which means that sites allowing a density at or above
that level are assumed to be appropriate for lower-income housing. Sites allowing a density of at
least 10 units/acre are considered suitable for moderate-income units, and sites with densities
below 10 units/acre are assigned to the above-moderate category.
V.B Residential Sites Inventory
The City’s inventory of residential sites is summarized in Table 10A-31. This table demonstrates
that the City’s sites inventory can accommodate the RHNA allocation for the 2015–2023
planning period in all income categories.

Table 10A-33 lists vacant parcels designated for residential development. It should be noted
that this inventory does not include every potential parcel where new residential development
could occur. Since the inventory of vacant residential sites far exceeds the City’s RHNA
allocation, analysis of underutilized residential or mixed-use sites is not required.

V.C Analysis of Unaccommodated Need from the Prior Planning Period
Pursuant to California Government Code Section 65584.09, if a city failed to identify adequate
sites in the prior planning period to accommodate its RHNA allocation, the unaccommodated
need must be carried over and added to the RHNA for the new planning period. The following
analysis demonstrates that there is no unaccommodated need from the prior period.
V.C.1 Prior RHNA Allocation
Goleta’s RHNA allocation for the June 30, 2009 – June 30, 2014 planning period was as
follows:
         Very low-income households               377 units
         Low-income households                    279 units
         Moderate-income households               230 units
         Above-moderate income households         755 units
         Total                                    1,641 units
V.C.2 Prior Land Inventory
The inventory of residential sites shown in Table 10A-33 for the 2015–2023 planning period also
reflects the City’s land inventory during the 2007–2014 planning period. Since this inventory
exceeds the prior RHNA allocation in all income categories, there is no unaccommodated need.

VI. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION SUMMARY
Public participation is an important component of the planning process in Goleta, and this
update to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties numerous
opportunities for involvement. Public notices of all workshops and hearings were distributed in
advance of each meeting and posted on the City’s website. The Draft Housing Element was
also circulated to housing advocates and nonprofit organizations representing the interests of
lower-income persons and special needs groups. (See Table 10A-34 for a list of organizations
notified of opportunities for participation.) After receiving comments on the Draft Housing
Element from the HCD, a proposed Final Housing Element was prepared and made available
for public review prior to adoption by the City Council.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this Housing
Element update.

 There is a need for emergency shelters and        The City is amending its Zoning Ordinance to minimize

                                                   housing, and it is also working with providers to facilitate
                                                   production of housing to address these needs. Unfortunately,

                                                   of redevelopment agencies falls far short of the amount
                                                   required to fully meet this need.

                                                   income (ELI) need, which is a subset of the very low-income
                                                   category. State law allows cities to estimate the ELI need as
                                                   50 percent of the very low-income RHNA allocation.
 Who is the audience for the Housing Element?      The Housing Element is used by a variety of organizations and
                                                   stakeholders, including City decision-makers, staff,
                                                   developers, providers of housing assistance, residents, and
                                                   other public agencies.

VII.     GLOSSARY
Accessible Housing: Units accessible and adaptable to the needs of persons with disabilities.
Emergency Shelter: Housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is
limited to occupancy of 6 months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may
be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.
Extremely Low-Income Households: California Government Code Section 65583(a) requires
local housing elements to provide “Documentation of projections and a quantification of the
locality’s existing and projected housing needs for all income levels, including extremely low-
income households (GC 65583 (a)(1)).” Extremely low income is a subset of the very low-
income regional housing need and is defined as households earning less than 30 percent of the
median household income.
Housing Affordability: The generally accepted measure for determining whether a person can
afford housing is spending no more than 30 percent of one’s gross household income on
housing costs, including principal, interest, property taxes, and insurance. Households spending
more than 30 percent of their income on housing are considered “overpaying households” by
the U.S. Census.
Income Limits: Income limits are updated annually by HUD for Santa Barbara County. For
many state and local programs, HCD income eligibility limits are used. HCD income-limit
regulations are similar to those used by HUD. The most recent HCD income limits can be
accessed online at http://www.hcd.ca.gov. Income limits are based on the Areawide Median
Income (AMI) as follows:
         Extremely Low-Income Households: Households earning 30 percent or less of the
         AMI.
         Very Low-Income Households: Households earning 31 to 50 percent of the AMI.
         Low-Income Households: Households earning 51 to 80 percent of the AMI.
         Lower-Income Households: Households earning less than 80 percent of the AMI.
         Moderate-Income Households: Households earning 80 to 120 percent of the AMI.
         Above-Moderate-Income Households: Households earning more than 120 percent of
         the AMI.
         Median Household Income: The middle point at which half of the City’s households
         earn more and half earn less.
Senior Citizen: Defined by California law as a person age 62 or older, or a person 55 or older
living in a senior citizen housing development.
Supportive Housing: Supportive housing is permanent rental housing linked to a range of
support services designed to enable residents to maintain stable housing and lead fuller lives.
This type of housing has no limit on length of stay, is occupied by the target population (such as
low-income persons with disabilities and certain other disabled persons) and is linked to onsite

or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving
his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the
community.
Transitional Housing: Transitional housing and transitional housing development mean rental
housing operated under program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and
recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined
future point in time, which shall be no less than 6 months.
