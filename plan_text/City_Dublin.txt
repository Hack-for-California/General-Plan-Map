Introduction
This document constitutes the fifth revision to the City of Dublin Housing Element, pursuant
to State law. This Housing Element covers a planning period from January 31, 2015
through January 31, 2023. The previous Housing Element was adopted by the Dublin City
Council in March 2010.
1. Contents of the Housing Element
The Housing Element of the General Plan is a comprehensive statement by the City of
Dublin of its current and future housing needs and proposed actions to facilitate the
provision of housing to meet those needs at all income levels. The policies contained in this
Element are an expression of the statewide housing goal of “attaining decent housing and a
suitable living environment for every California family,” as well as a reflection of the unique
concerns of the community. The purpose of the Housing Element is to establish specific
goals, policies, and objectives relative to the provision of housing, and to adopt an action
plan toward this end. In addition, the Element identifies and analyzes housing needs, and
resources and constraints to meeting those needs.
In accordance with State law, the Housing Element is to be consistent and compatible with
other General Plan elements. Additionally, Housing Elements are to provide clear policy and
direction for making decisions pertaining to zoning, subdivision approval, housing
allocations, and capital improvements. State law (Government Code Sections 65580
through 65589) mandates the contents of the Housing Element. By law, the Housing
Element must contain:
       An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints
        relevant to meeting those needs;
       A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relevant to
        the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing; and
       A program that sets forth a schedule of actions that the local government is
        undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals
        and objectives of the Housing Element.
Although, by nature of the State mandate, the Housing Element has a strong focus on the
affordability and availability of housing for low and moderate income households, the
Element must also address the housing needs and related policy issues for the entire
community and be consistent with the adopted policies of the General Plan. For these
reasons, the updated Housing Element strives to balance the desire of residents to maintain
the character of existing residential neighborhoods, manage traffic and congestion, and
minimize visual and other impacts of new development, while addressing the needs of low
and moderate income households and special needs groups (such as seniors and persons
with disabilities). This balance will require the City to examine strategies to accommodate
higher density housing, mixed-use projects in commercial zones, infill developments, and
second units without sacrificing other legitimate community goals.

2. Consistency with General Plan
The Dublin General Plan consists of the following elements: 1) Land Use; 2) Parks and
Open Space; 3) Schools, Public Lands, and Utilities; 4) Circulation and Scenic Highways; 5)
Housing; 6) Conservation; 7) Seismic Safety and Safety; 8) Noise; 9) Community Design
and Sustainability; 10) Economic Development; and, 11) Water Resources. The Housing
Element complements other General Plan elements and is consistent with the policies and
proposals set forth by the General Plan. For example, residential densities established in
the Land Use Element are incorporated within the Housing Element and form the basis for
establishing the residential capacity within the City. Environmental constraints identified in
the Seismic Safety and Safety Element are also recognized in the Housing Element.
When an element in the General Plan is amended, the Housing Element will be reviewed
and modified if necessary to ensure continued consistency among the various elements.
The Safety and Conservation Elements of the General Plan include an analysis and policies
regarding flood hazard and management information. The City will ensure that updates to
these Elements achieve internal consistency with the Housing Element as well.
3. Data Sources
In preparing the Housing Element, various sources of information are consulted. The 2010
Census provides the basis for population and household characteristics. Although dated, no
better source of information on demographics is widely accepted. In addition, the 2010
Census must be used in the Housing Element to ensure consistency with other Regional,
State, and Federal housing plans. However, several sources are used to provide reliable
updates of the 2010 Census including the following:
        Population and housing estimates by the State Department of Finance;
        Labor market statistics by the State Employment Development Department;
        Housing market information (including www.realtor.com, www.dqnews.com,
         www.rents.com, www.zillow.com);
        Special studies and reports on housing issues and market conditions, e.g.
         Continuum of Care Strategy for the Homeless and Ten-Year Plan to End
         Homelessness; and
        Lending patterns for home purchase and home improvement loans from the Home
         Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data.

                                                                   Housing Element (2015-2023)
Evaluation of Accomplishments
In order to craft an effective strategy to address the housing needs of the community, the
City must evaluate the effectiveness and appropriateness of existing housing programs and
actions. Government Code Section 65588(a) requires each jurisdiction to review its housing
element as frequently as appropriate to evaluate:
       The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to
        the attainment of the state housing goal;
       The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community’s housing
        goals and objectives; and
       The progress of the city, county or city and county in implementation of the housing
        element.
Table 1 summarizes the City’s quantified accomplishments under the 2009-2014 Housing
Element. A program-level review is included in the Technical Report.
Overall, the City has been effective in implementing the goals and objectives in the previous
Housing Element. Through planned development, and master and specific planning
processes, the City was able to achieve a significant portion of its Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA) for the planning period.
In November 2007, Windstar Communities was approved to construct 309 high density
residential units located adjacent to the West Dublin Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Station.
The project was subsequently purchased by Essex and the project completed construction
in March 2014.
In August 2008, Avalon Bay Communities completed construction of a mixed-use project
consisting of 305 high density residential units and approximately 15,000 square feet of
ground floor commercial at the Dublin Transit Center. The project, now known as Eclipse at
Dublin Station, is an apartment community with 10 percent of the units set aside for
moderate income households.
In March 2011, Avalon Bay Communities was approved to construct an additional 505 high
density residential apartment units at the Dublin Transit Center. 10 percent of the units will
be set aside for moderate income households. The project is currently under construction,
with half of the units already completed.
In April 2012, Signature Properties completed construction of the Tralee mixed-use project
which includes 130 apartment units over 34,950 square feet of ground floor commercial.
Shea Homes is currently constructing the remainder of the 103 townhouse units which are
also a part of the Tralee project.
The City also worked with Eden Housing, KB Homes and the Dublin Housing Authority on
the development of the Arroyo Vista mixed-income redevelopment project. The City
provided application/technical assistance, as well as financial assistance, as needed by the
developer in order to secure financing and other sources of funding to support the
                                               3

development of the project. The project was approved by the Dublin City Council in
September 2009 and includes the demolition of 150 existing affordable housing units and
the construction of 378 new housing units (both attached and detached) including market
rate, affordable senior housing, affordable family housing, a child care center and
community building. The project includes 194 (180 rental units and 14 for-sale units)
affordable units in various income categories. The project was completed in May 2013; all
180 of the affordable rental units have been leased and all 14 affordable for-sale units have
been sold.
In addition, the City continues to implement its Density Bonus, Inclusionary Zoning
Regulations, and Commercial Linkage Fee programs, which have been instrumental in the
creation of affordable housing in Dublin. Between 2007 and 2013, the City issued 332
permits for construction of affordable housing units, including: 189 very low income units, 99
low income units, and 44 moderate income units.
Since 2007, the Alameda County Community Development Agency has assisted 36 Dublin
households through the Minor and Major Home Improvement Programs. In addition, as of
February 2014, a total of 365 Dublin households were receiving rental assistance through
the Housing Choice Voucher Program. A total of 26 Dublin households were on the waiting
list for rental assistance. In addition, between 2007 and 2013, the City assisted a total of 54
households with first-time homebuyer loans, including: 2 very low income, 1 low income, 44
moderate income, and 7 market households.
The City also adopted amendments to the Zoning Ordinance to include provisions for
emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing and SROs in April 2011. The
City will continue to facilitate the development of housing for persons with disabilities and
extremely low income households using in-lieu fees.

Goals and Policies
This section of the Housing Element contains the goals and policies the City of Dublin
intends to implement to meet its quantified objectives and address a number of important
housing-related issues. The following major issue areas are addressed by the goals and
policies of this Element:
         Ensure that a broad range of housing types are provided to meet the needs of the
          existing and future residents;
         Encourage and facilitate the development of lower and moderate income housing;
         Maintain and enhance the quality of residential neighborhoods in Dublin;
         Promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in housing of their choice; and
         Increase energy efficiency and conservation in residential developments.
1. Range of Housing Types
Continuing to provide a balanced inventory of housing in terms of types (e.g., single-family,
duplexes, apartments, condominiums, and mixed-use), cost, and style will allow the City to
fulfill a variety of housing needs. In addition, providing regulatory and financial assistance
as available will be essential to support the production of affordable housing.
GOAL A:           Expand housing choice and multi-modal transportation opportunities
                  for existing and future Dublin residents.
Policy A.1:       Ensure the provision of a variety of housing types to fulfill regional housing
                  needs.
Policy A.2:       Facilitate development of affordable housing through use of financial and/or
                  regulatory incentives, where appropriate and subject to funding availability.
Policy A.3:       Maintain streamlined procedures for processing new residential development
                  applications.
Policy A.4:       Encourage the development of residential units intended for the special
                  groups, including seniors, large households, persons with disabilities
                  (including persons with developmental disabilities), and the homeless.
Policy A.5:       Promote affordable housing opportunities within Mixed-Use areas adjacent to
                  public transportation and within walking or cycling distance to places of
                  employment, commerce, recreation and near services.
Policy A.6:       Support existing emergency shelter programs in the Tri-Valley area.
Policy A.7:       Encourage greater access to housing for persons with disabilities (including
                  persons with developmental disabilities).

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
2. Housing Opportunities for Segments of the Population
New construction is a major source of housing for prospective homeowners and renters but
generally requires public sector support for the creation of units affordable to lower income
households, especially extremely low income households. A key element in satisfying the
housing needs of all segments of the community is the provision of adequate sites for
housing of all types, sizes, and prices. The City’s General Plan and Zoning Ordinance
determine where housing may locate, thereby affecting the supply of land available for
residential development. The following goals and policies support the expansion of housing
opportunities in Dublin.
GOAL B:         Expand housing opportunities for all segments of Dublin’s population.
Policy B.1:     Encourage development of affordable housing by non-profit organizations
                primarily engaged in housing construction or management.
Policy B.2:     Provide ongoing support to affordable housing developers.
Policy B.3:     Negotiate with developers to encourage the provision of housing that is
                affordable to extremely low income households.
Policy B.4:     Continue to allow second dwelling units on single-family parcels as a means
                of expanding rental housing opportunities.
Policy B.5:     Continue to support the development of affordable homeownership housing
                for first-time homebuyers.
3. Maintain and Enhance Residential Neighborhoods
In general, housing over 30 years old may be in need of major rehabilitation, such as a new
roof, repair of termite damage, foundation work, and plumbing, etc. With approximately 29
percent of Dublin’s housing stock built prior to 1980, preventive maintenance is essential to
avoid housing deterioration. Some households, particularly those that have owned their
homes for many years and have relatively low house payments, may be able to afford
repairs or monthly payments for rehabilitation loans; however, others, especially lower
income homeowners, may have difficulty maintaining their homes. Assisting these
households will help preserve and improve the City's existing housing stock.
GOAL C:         Use public and private resources to maintain and enhance existing
                residential neighborhood characteristics.
Policy C.1:     Continue to provide assistance for the rehabilitation of substandard and
                deteriorating units.
Policy C.2:     Encourage the preservation, rehabilitation or, if necessary, replacement of
                single-family units in order to maintain and enhance the established
                characteristics of City neighborhoods.

                                                                  Housing Element (2015-2023)
4. Promote Equal Housing Opportunities
The City seeks to expand the range of housing opportunities in Dublin, including housing for
seniors on fixed incomes, lower and moderate income residents, persons with disabilities
(including persons with developmental disabilities), large families, female-headed
households with children, and the homeless. In order to make adequate provision for the
housing needs of all segments of the community, the City must also ensure equal and fair
housing opportunities are available to all residents.
GOAL D:        Provide housing opportunities for all Dublin residents, regardless of
               race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital
               status, familial status, disability, source of income, sexual orientation,
               or any other arbitrary factor.
Policy D.1:    Support services and programs that fight housing discrimination; direct
               persons towards agencies that provide assistance to victims of discrimination.
Policy D.2:    Promote housing along with supportive services, including child care, to meet
               the special housing needs of seniors, persons with disabilities, single-parents
               and the homeless.
Policy D.3:    Encourage the provision of housing to meet the needs of families of all sizes.
5. Promote Energy Efficiency and Conservation
Energy conservation can be achieved through environmentally sensitive site planning
techniques and implementing building codes that require use of construction materials that
maximize energy efficiency. Conserving energy has the dual benefit of reducing housing
costs and improving environmental quality.
GOAL E:        Promote energy efficiency and conservation throughout Dublin.
Policy E.1:    Promote the use of Green Building techniques in all residential development.
Policy E.2:    Ensure all new residential development complies with the California Green
               Building Code and City of Dublin Green Building Ordinance.
Policy E.3:    Continue to require the recycling of construction waste.
Policy E.4:    Utilize site planning techniques to allow passive energy efficiencies through
               solar access, landscaping, and building orientation.
Policy E.5:    Seek opportunities to educate the public about energy conservation.

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
Housing Programs
The goals and policies outlined in the prior section address Dublin’s identified housing
needs, and are implemented through a series of housing programs offered primarily through
the Planning and Housing Divisions of the City’s Community Development Department.
Dublin residents may also be eligible for assistance under programs administered by the
County of Alameda. Housing programs define the specific actions the City will undertake to
achieve the stated goals and policies. The City’s housing programs for addressing
community housing needs are described according to the following issue areas:
        Housing Conservation
        Production of Housing
        Provision of Adequate Housing Sites
        Removal of Governmental Constraints
        Promotion of Equal Housing Opportunity
        Green Building Programs
The housing programs presented on the following pages include existing programs as well
as various revised and new programs that have been added to address the City’s unmet
housing needs and to respond to new State laws.
1. Conservation of the Existing Supply of Housing
Conserving and improving the housing stock is an important goal for the City of Dublin.
Approximately 29 percent of housing units in Dublin were constructed prior to 1980 and are
therefore likely to have rehabilitation needs, including new plumbing, roof repairs, foundation
work and other repairs. The City supports neighborhood preservation and improvement
through housing rehabilitation programs and code enforcement.                  Other housing
conservation needs of the City include existing multi-family rental apartments at-risk of
converting to condominiums.
Program 1: Housing Rehabilitation Assistance
Alameda County administers the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds on
behalf of the City. Using CDBG funds, the Alameda County Community Development
Agency administers the Minor and Major Home Improvement Programs for the City. Low-
interest loans up to $1,500 are available to lower income households through the Minor
Home Improvement Program. The Major Home Improvement Program makes available
loans up to $60,000 at a three-percent annual interest rate for qualified lower income
households. Between 2007 and 2013, the Alameda County Community Development
Agency has facilitated 12 minor home repair projects, eight paint grants, 11 major
rehabilitation projects, and five accessibility grants in Dublin. Accessibility grants benefit
persons with disabilities.

                             goal of assisting 32 households over eight years.
Relevant Policies:       Policy C.1; Policy C.2
Program 2: Housing Choice Voucher Rental Assistance
The Housing Choice Voucher Program extends rental subsidies to extremely low and very
low income households, including families, seniors, and the disabled. The program offers a
voucher that pays the difference between the current fair market rent (FMR) as established
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and what a tenant can
afford to pay (i.e. 30 percent of household income). The Housing Authority of the County of
Alameda administers the program in Dublin. Given the continued need for rental
assistance, the City supports and encourages the provision of additional subsidies through
the Housing Choice Voucher Program.

Objectives:               Continue to refer interested households and homeowners to the
                             Housing Authority of the County of Alameda.
Relevant Policies:       Policy A.1; Policy D.2; Policy D.3
Program 3: Code Enforcement
The Planning and Building Divisions of the Community Development Department carry out
code enforcement and inspection activities as a means to preserve and maintain the
livability and quality of neighborhoods. City staff investigates violations of property
maintenance standards as defined in the Municipal Code as well as other complaints.
When violations are identified or cited, staff encourages property owners to seek assistance
through available housing rehabilitation programs.
The City will continue to enforce property maintenance standards and abate substandard
structures through Code Enforcement. When code violations are unable to be resolved
through voluntary compliance or through the nuisance abatement procedure, the City refers
such cases to the City Attorney for prosecution. The City Attorney's office may seek
injunctions, receivership and civil lawsuits to achieve compliance with City codes.

Relevant Policies:        Policy C.1; Policy C.2
Program 4: Condominium Conversion Ordinance
The City values its rental housing stock as an important means of meeting the housing
needs of all income segments of the community. In 2005, the City Council passed a
Condominium Conversion Ordinance to preserve the existing rental housing stock. The
ordinance establishes an annual maximum number of rental apartment units that can be
converted to seven percent of the total number of multi-family units in developments of 21 or
more rental units. The Ordinance also establishes tenant notification and relocation
assistance requirements, limits rent increases once a notice of intent to convert has been
filed, and gives tenants the right to purchase units. New condominium conversions are also
subject to the City’s Inclusionary Zoning Regulations. The City will continue to implement
the Condominium Conversion Ordinance to preserve the existing multi-family rental housing
stock in Dublin.

2. Production of Housing
The City of Dublin implements various programs to encourage a diversity of housing types.
Part of this diversity is addressed through the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA),
which encourages the construction of housing for all economic segments in the community.
Housing diversity is important to ensure that all households, regardless of age, income level,
and household type, have the opportunity to find housing suited to their need and lifestyle.
The following programs support the provision of additional housing opportunities in Dublin.
Program 5: Mixed Use Development
Locating high density residential uses in compact mixed-use areas where residents have
convenient access to jobs, shopping, services, recreation, and multi-modal transportation
options can produce a number of community benefits. For example, traditionally non-
residential areas may be suitable to provide additional capacity for higher density housing.
Many residents within these areas are also less dependent upon private automobile travel,
often resulting in positive environmental effects and more money for other necessary
expenses.

The City will continue to promote high-density residential mixed-use projects in the
Downtown Dublin Specific Plan area and adjacent to or in close proximity to the City’s two
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Stations provided that infrastructure can support higher
densities. The City will undertake the following actions to promote mixed-use:
       Promote mixed-use opportunity sites;
       Continue to implement the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan;
       Use the Planned Development process to allow flexible development standards such
        as alternatives for parking, building height, floor-area ratio, lot-coverage limits, and
        residential density, to promote mixed-use developments; and
       Provide incentives for affordable housing in mixed-use projects, including reduced
        parking requirements, use of Inclusionary Zoning In-Lieu Fee Fund, assistance in
        accessing state and federal subsidies, and density bonuses.

Relevant Policies:        Policy A.1; Policy A.2; Policy A.5; Policy B.2; Policy B.5
Program 6: Affordable Housing Developers
Recognizing that an adequate supply of affordable housing cannot be supplied by the
market, the City will cooperate with developers that specialize in below market rate housing
to expand the supply of units affordable to lower income households, including extremely
low income households. The City has an excellent track record in facilitating the
development of affordable housing. Camellia Place, the Groves at Dublin Ranch, Wicklow
Square, and the new Emerald Vista (formerly Arroyo Vista) projects all include a range of
affordable units, including units for extremely low households.
The City will offer assistance in accessing local, state, and federal funding for affordable
housing by: 1) applying for such funding on behalf of affordable housing developers when
eligible applicants are limited to public agencies; or 2) providing technical assistance or
documentation necessary to support applications for funding by affordable housing
developers upon request.
The City can help locate potential sources of matching funds and provide other technical
assistance. Technical assistance will include, but not be limited to the provision of data or
documents within the City’s possession that will contain necessary information or assist in
the preparation of a successful grant application. The City can also write letters of support
(for projects that have received permit approvals by the City).

Relevant Policies:        Policy A.1; Policy A.2; Policy A.3; Policy B.1; Policy B.2; Policy B.3
Program 7: Density Bonuses
The City adopted a Density Bonus Ordinance in March 2007 to comply with State law (SB
1818 enacted 2005 and SB 435 enacted 2006). Only one developer has applied for and
received a density bonus since adoption of the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance. Density
bonuses are infrequently used in Dublin because the City’s High Density Residential land
use designation allows 25 units per acre and up, without a maximum upper density limit. In
addition to density increases, the Density Bonus Ordinance has other provisions that could
facilitate the expansion of housing opportunities.
The City will review its local Density Bonus Ordinance, and, as necessary, revise the
Density Bonus Ordinance to ensure the benefits of the Density Bonus Ordinance when the
inclusionary requirement triggers units that meet eligibility criteria for the Density Bonus
Ordinance, in compliance with State law.
The City will work with developers on a case-by-case basis to provide regulatory
concessions and incentives to assist with the development of affordable and senior housing.
In a relatively small city like Dublin, this is the most effective method of assisting developers,
as each individual project can be analyzed to determine which concessions and incentives
would be the most beneficial to the project’s feasibility. Regulatory concessions and
incentives could include, but are not limited to, reductions in the amount of required on-site
parking, and modified or waived development standards.

Program 8: Inclusionary Zoning
Under the City’s Inclusionary Zoning program, all new residential development projects of 20
units or more designed and intended for permanent occupancy must construct 12.5 percent
of the total number of dwelling units within the development as affordable units. Of the
affordable rental units, 30 percent must be set aside for very low income households, 20
percent for low income households, and 50 percent for moderate income households; of the
owner occupied affordable units, 40 percent must be set aside for low income households
and 60 percent for moderate income households. Upon request, the City Council can allow
the applicant to pay a fee in-lieu of constructing up to 40 percent of the affordable units that
the developer would otherwise be required to construct. In certain instances, the City
Council may allow a developer to construct the affordable units “off-site” and an applicant
may dedicate land to the City or City-designated local non-profit housing developer in-lieu of
construction of some or all of the required affordable units. In-lieu fees will be placed into an
Inclusionary Zoning In-Lieu Fee Fund.
The Ordinance provides for five exceptions to the 12.5 percent affordability requirement
(Section 8.68.040):
       Payment of in-lieu fees;
       Off-site projects;
       Land dedication;
       Credit transfers; and
       Waiver of requirements.

Program 13: Homeless Assistance
The City will continue to support the Alameda County Homeless Continuum of Care Council
(HCCC) and support agencies and organizations that seek to address the problem of
homelessness throughout the region. Dublin provided funding to the Alameda Countywide
HCCC for development of a Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). The HMIS
is intended to collect and report information about the homeless population and its patterns
of service utilization. The City also provides Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
funds to the Tri-Valley Haven to assist a domestic violence shelter (Shiloh) and a homeless
shelter (Sojourner House), both located in Livermore.

3. Provision of Adequate Housing Sites
Meeting the housing needs of all segments of the community requires the provision of
adequate sites for all types, size and prices of housing. The City’s General Plan and Zoning
Ordinance determine where housing may locate, thereby affecting the supply of land
available for residential development.

Program 15: Residential Sites Inventory and RHNA Monitoring
The City will continue to use specific plans, planned development, and zoning to ensure that
adequate sites are available (as defined by state housing element law, Government Code
section 65583) to accommodate the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for
all income groups.
The City will monitor housing development citywide on an ongoing basis to ensure that the
sites identified in the Residential Sites Inventory are developed at densities appropriate for
fulfilling its RHNA requirement for the 2015-2023 Housing Element. Should a project be
approved on a site with a lower density than that identified in the Residential Sites Inventory,
the City will assess its continued ability to accommodate the RHNA. Should the project
result in a shortfall in sites, the City will identify additional sites to replenish the sites
inventory.
Each year, as part of the City’s annual evaluation of its implementation of the General Plan,
the City will compare the remaining supply of land by zoning, specific plan, or planned
development in relation to the City’s remaining unmet RHNA. Should the City identify a
potential shortage of sites with appropriate densities, it will use the specific plan and planned
development process to provide adequate sites for future residential developments.

4. Removal of Governmental Constraints
Under State law, the Housing Element must address, and where legally possible, remove
governmental constraints affecting the maintenance, improvement, and development of
housing. The following programs are designed to mitigate government constraints on
residential development and facilitate development of housing affordable to lower and
moderate income households, including families, seniors, and persons with special needs.
Program 16: Fee Deferment or Amortization
The City will continue to offer deferment or amortization of planning/development fees for
senior housing units and affordable units for lower and moderate income households to
reduce the initial cost impact on an affordable housing project. The City will determine on a
case-by-case basis the financial need of the project and the most appropriate type of
assistance based on the City’s Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance.

Program 18: Emergency Shelters and Supportive and Transitional Housing
Pursuant to the provisions of SB 2, the City will continue to facilitate the establishment of
emergency shelters, transitional housing and supportive housing. With approximately 180
acres of land in the M-1 (Light Industrial) and similar PD (Planned Development) zoning
districts, there is sufficient land available for at least one emergency shelter. The City will
review, and revise as appropriate, zoning, development standards, and procedures for
consistency with GC Section 65583(a)(4). Specifically, the City will review the distance
requirements from public transit and noise provisions for emergency shelters to ensure
compliance with SB 2.
In order to clarify that transitional and supportive housing are residential uses subject only to
the same standards and procedures as apply to other residential uses of the same type in
the same zone, the City will review the Zoning Ordinance and if necessary amend the
Zoning Ordinance within two years of adoption of the 2015-2023 Housing Element to ensure
that City regulations are in conformance with state law.

6. Green Building Programs
Green building refers to the use of environmentally preferable practices and materials in the
design, location, construction, operation, and disposal of buildings. It applies to both
renovation and retrofitting of existing buildings and construction of new buildings, whether
residential or commercial, public or private. By continually improving how to locate, design,
build, operate, and retrofit buildings, the City of Dublin can contribute to the improvement of
the environment and quality of life. Advanced energy-saving technologies applied in
buildings can result in enormous reductions in demand for fossil fuels and emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHG). Better design and building practices can also help address
environmental challenges such as natural resource depletion; waste disposal; and air,
water, and soil pollution. Green building can also help achieve gains in human health and
prosperity.
Program 21: Green Building Guidelines
The City Council has established as a high priority to enhance residential green building
requirements to create a mandatory Green Building self-certification program as part of the
permitting process. The City adopted a Green Building Ordinance in April 2009. The
Ordinance applies to all residential projects over 20 units. In November 2010, the Ordinance
was updated and the changes went into effect January 1, 2012. A brochure was developed
in 2009 at the time of the original adoption and the City continues to update the brochure as
revisions are made to the Ordinance.

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
Public Participation
Section 65583 (c)(6)(B) of the Government Code states that “The local government shall
make diligent effort to achieve public participation of all the economic segments of the
community in the development of the housing element and the program shall describe this
effort.” The City of Dublin undertook a comprehensive public participation program in the
development of the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
1. Service Provider Interviews
As part of this Housing Element update, the City of Dublin consulted with affordable housing
developers and nonprofit service providers to obtain input on housing needs and
suggestions for housing programs. Fifteen agencies and developers that serve lower and
moderate income households, as well as those with special housing needs, were contacted.
Seven agencies participated in the telephone interviews and these are: Abode
Services/Allied Housing; Community Resources for Independent Living; Eden I & R; Habitat
for Humanity East Bay/Silicon Valley; Satellite Affordable Housing Associates; Tri-Valley
Haven; and Tri-Valley Reach. Their comments are summarized below:
        Affordable Housing: There is significant demand for additional affordable rental and
         ownership housing to accommodate the housing needs of low-income residents and
         those with special needs.
             o In general, affordable housing developers need assistance in identification of
                sites and funding.
             o Easing development standards can also increase the feasibility of sites.
             o Creative thinking is needed from City staff in order to avoid common
                development constraints.
             o Housing Element policies and programs should prioritize the creation of
                extremely low-income (ELI) units and provide incentives for developers.
        Homeless: There is a lack of emergency shelter and support services for Tri-Valley
         area homeless.
             o Specifically, there is a large need for shelter and housing programs for single
                men.
             o Supportive housing is also needed to transition homeless persons from
                transitional housing and emergency shelters.
        Section 8: The demand for Section 8 housing has increased over the last few years.
             o There has been a decline in the number of properties accepting Section 8
                Vouchers in the Tri-valley area.
        Supportive Services: Increased availability and funding of supportive services that
         can aid with living expenses are needed.
             o There needs to be additional support from city staff to direct residents to
                services and coordinate with providers about program changes.
Appendix A summarizes the agencies consulted, the services they provide, and housing
needs identified.

Appendix A: Public Participation
1. Interviews with Service Providers
Abode Services/Allied Housing
40849 Fremont Boulevard
Fremont, CA 94538
Louis Chicoine, Executive Director
Services Provided: The focus of Abode Services is on ending homelessness and to ensure
that those in need are able to obtain and retain housing. They offer housing programs
linked to support services for low-income and homeless families and individuals in Alameda
and Santa Clara Counties. Each Abode program integrates these two components to help
people establish permanent stability and return to independent lives. Housing options
include emergency shelter, rental subsidies, transitional housing and permanent supportive
housing. Support services include case management, primary and mental health care,
substance recovery services, job counseling and placement, life skills classes, financial
literacy training, practical tenancy training, parenting classes, and children's programs.
Abode Services and Allied housing merged as an effort to consolidate their service capacity.
As an affordable housing developer they specialize in developing small-scale housing
developments that are affordable to families and households with special needs, such as
persons with disabilities or households moving out of homelessness. Their housing
development work also focuses on providing affordable housing that is linked with
supportive services to assist low-income and special needs households to achieve and
maintain housing stability and self-sufficiency.
Population Served: A wide-range of vulnerable groups benefit from their services including
children, emancipated foster youth, adults and transition-age youth living with severe mental
illness, low-income families in vocational training, dually-diagnosed heads of households,
single mothers, victims/survivors of domestic violence, seniors and people living with
HIV/AIDS.
Housing Needs: As one of the fastest growing services providers in the Bay Area, there
has been a large increase in the demand for their services and programs. Over the last few
years, within the Tri-Valley area, Abode Services has worked with the cities of Pleasanton
and Livermore to run programs that provide rental assistance. They have not done any
projects in the City of Dublin. Chicoine noted that its organization focuses on housing that
may not be appropriate in suburban communities such as Dublin where costs and
neighborhood acceptance may be barriers. He suggested that their Rapid Re-Housing
program, which provides for quick housing placement within communities, has been an
effective program that is easy for cities to use. Lastly, he suggested that Housing Elements
need to prioritize the creation of extremely-low income units. Policies and programs which
reward developers that create housing units and services for lower income households are
needed. This can serve to incentivize and kick start the creation of the types of housing that
lacks in the region.

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
Community Resources for Independent Living (CRIL)
3311 Pacific Avenue
Livermore, CA 94550
Alejandra Hernandez, Employment Benefits Coordinator
Services Provided: CRIL is a peer-based disability resource organization that advocates
and provides resources for people with disabilities to improve lives and make communities
fully accessible. CRIL is also a resource for disability awareness education and training,
advocacy and technical advice. Among its many programs, CRIL’s housing assistance
services help people with disabilities and seniors with functional limitations with
understanding the process in obtaining accessible, low income housing, primarily within
Alameda County. CRIL keeps a current list of local rentals and reaches out to landlords to
encourage renting to individuals with disabilities; however, they do not own housing or run
their own residential facility. Their Livermore office offers Housing Workshops twice monthly
where they share information on how to seek and apply for affordable and/or accessible
housing in Alameda County, or in some cases outside of the County.
Population Served: CRIL offers its services at no charge to persons with disabilities living
in southern and eastern Alameda County. In order to become a CRIL consumer, an
individual must have a disability or functional limitation and be able to benefit from
independent living services. Everyone is welcome regardless of race, ethnicity, the nature of
the disability or limitation, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender identity and
expression, immigration status, health condition or any other characteristics. Staff at the
CRIL’s Livermore office estimate 10 to 20 Dublin residents utilize their services a month.
Housing Needs: Above all else, there is a high demand for more low-income affordable
housing and housing for persons with specials needs in the Tri-Valley area. Demand for
their housing assistance services, and affordable housing in general, has increased over the
last few years. Most significantly, there has been an increase in the need for section 8
housing. However, there has been a decline in properties who participate in the program.
This is a problem that they have noticed in Alameda County overall, but especially within the
Tri-Valley area. CRIL has benefitted from the Season of Sharing‘s provision of one-time
crisis-based assistance in coordination with their housing location services. This working
relationship recently proved successful in assisting a client with funding to place a rental
deposit and obtain housing. Further funding and support of these types of coordinated
efforts would greatly aid the CRIL in assisting their clients.
Eden I & R, Inc.
570 B. Street
Hayward, CA 94541
Barbara Bernstein, Executive Director and Alison DeJung, Deputy Director
Services Provided: Eden I&R’s mission of "linking people and resources" and services
offered are the result of collaborations that depend on the work of hundreds of community-
based organizations. They offer a range of housing and service related programs, including:
the AIDS Housing and Information Project (AHIP); Roving Veterans Affairs Supportive
Housing; After-Hours Emergency Phone Services for Alameda County’s Child and Adult
Protective Services, Foster Care Placement Line, and the Public Guardians Office; Disaster
Recovery Services; Housing Database; Social Services Database; Big Blue Book; and
various seasonal programs. Over half of all calls they receive are related to housing, with
callers needing assistance finding emergency shelter, transitional and supportive housing,
                                           Appendix A-2

                                                                                    City of Dublin
                                                                      Housing Element (2015-2023)
mental health housing, and more permanent types of housing. Overall, the issues they deal
with have a lot of components to them. Eden I&R also encounters callers with housing
sustainability problems, including issues such as, utility assistance, rental assistance,
transportation, tenant rights, employment, childcare. One of the keys to the success of their
services is their approach in which staff gathers specific household information from callers
with housing needs. This allows them to identify potential assistance opportunities that they
may be able to utilize to reduce other living expenses, and can leave these households with
more money for housing.
They are the only agency in Alameda County to offer a comprehensive housing database
listing of over 80,000 affordable housing units, including subsidized, low-income, and shared
units. The housing database is effective through its two-pronged approach, giving those in
need of housing access to a listing of affordable properties and connecting landlords/owners
to potential tenants. The database offers free listing services to landlords/owners who
qualify. In order to expand the listing, Eden I&R conducts outreach to landlords/owners
through a lot of different ways, the most effective of which has simply been word of mouth.
Their goal is to work with them to list their units as affordable through methods such as
lowering their rates, renting out a room, or agreeing to accept Section 8 vouchers.
Population Served: Since no other centralized source for health, housing, and human
services information exists anywhere else in Alameda County, Eden I & R has become a
critical resource for thousands of at-risk individuals, such as youth, non-English speakers,
the economically disadvantaged, people living with HIV/AIDS, domestic violence survivors,
the elderly, disabled, the homeless, and human service agencies seeking services or
housing for their clients. Eden I&R serves over 100,000 Alameda County residents a year.
Housing Needs: Countywide there are not enough affordable housing opportunities to meet
the needs of their callers. The issue is only becoming more challenging as federal funding
available in support of affordable housing continues to decrease. Although resources are not
always available to directly connect callers to housing, Eden I & R’s approach to connect
callers with other resources to cut other living expensive often proves effective in increasing
a caller’s ability to pay for housing. However, they estimate that they miss approximately
19,000 calls a year due to a shortage in staff. Funding to expand their 2-1-1 special
resource specialist staff would greatly impact their capability to link these missed callers with
resources that can spare them money for housing.
As one of the top service providers in the County for low-income individuals, Eden I & R
would greatly benefit from additional support for its programs. In particular, additional
assistance with expanding its housing database would be impactful. Mom-and-pop landlords
can serve as one of the biggest resources to expanding affordable housing opportunities in
the County. More importantly, these types of housing opportunities can serve as a way to
distribute the stigma often associated with public or low-income housing. This can also lead
to the integration of low-income residents into communities that may appear uninviting to
them. They need additional support from housing department staff from cities throughout the
County and Tri-Valley area to conduct outreach to these mom-and-pop landlords to list with
Eden I & R. With increased efforts from city staff they estimate they could more than expand
their housing database and thus expand access tp affordable housing opportunities. An
increase in Eden I & R staff capacity for this program would also be beneficial and allow
them conduct more of the outreach that is crucial to the expansion of their housing
database.

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
There is need for more people to become aware of the 2-1-1 services and other programs
offered. They have benefited greatly from partnering with cities throughout the County,
including the City of Dublin, and rely on city staff to refer residents to their services. Eden I &
R can benefit from increased communication from staff of expected changes in services,
programs, and affordable housing opportunities.
Habitat for Humanity East Bay/Silicon Valley
2619 Broadway
Oakland, CA 94612
David Pitson, Controller
Services Provided: Habitat’s overall focus is on developing affordable ownership housing
through new construction, home renovation, and home repair. The program provides first
time affordable homeownership opportunities for low and very low income families with
children. In addition to working on their homes through the sweat equity or self-help
program, families also attend workshops on budgeting, credit repairs, conflict resolution and
home maintenance, repair and landscaping.
Population Served: They primarily serve families who make 40 to 80 percent of the AMI.
Sometimes they aid families who make 80 to 120 percent of the AMI, but never over 120
percent. Habitat aims to provide housing opportunities not for engineers or executives at
large companies, but for the workforce who are janitors, teachers, and servers. Within the
Tri-Valley area they are currently working mostly in the cities of Pleasanton and Livermore to
purchase homes to rehabilitate.
Housing Needs: Overall there is a huge need for affordable housing within the East Bay
region, including the Tri-Valley. There are a lot of jobs being created in the Silicon Valley
area, of which Dublin is on the periphery, but the housing opportunities to match this growth
are not being developed at the same pace. Habitat has worked with the City of Dublin in the
past, but land in the City is very expensive and hard to develop. Cities often employ a
philosophy that they must utilize government funding for affordable rental housing
development in order to maximize the number of units. However, the ownership housing
model that Habitat uses is also effective in producing large number of units for those most in
need. Habitat is interested in working with the City of Dublin in the future and is also open to
partnering with market-rate developers to create affordable housing components of future
developments.
Satellite Affordable Housing Associates (SAHA)
1521 University Avenue
Berkeley, CA 94703
Eve Stewart, Director of Housing Development
Services Provided: SAHA develops and manages affordable, service-enriched housing
that promotes healthy and dignified living for people with limited options. Residents at nearly
every SAHA community have access to a wide variety of supportive services, activities, and
civic engagement programs. Resident services offered at their communities that house
elderly individuals are especially helpful in providing for residents to live as independently as
possible.
Population Served: The population served is low income families, seniors and special
needs (disabled and developmentally disabled). All have incomes of 60 percent or below
                                           Appendix A-4

                                                                                  City of Dublin
                                                                 Housing Element (2015-2023)
AMI, with the average income being 30 to 50 percent AMI. They are able to aid those who
fall below 30 percent in circumstances where they are additional subsidy assistance is
available. Within the last few years they’ve started developing housing for people who are
currently homeless, instead of only focusing on those who are at-risk. They serve a wide
geographic area, including properties in Sacramento, but are currently most active within
their core area of focus in Alameda and Contra Costa counties. Within the Tri-Valley area
they completed a project in Livermore a couple of years ago, but have not done any projects
in Dublin, nor in neighboring Pleasanton.
Housing Needs: There is a large need to make housing that is accessible for populations of
all incomes and those with special needs. There are no specific reasons SAHA has not
worked with the City of Dublin; however, Eve noted that some of the more suburban
locations can prove more difficult for them to develop in. They often encounter issues with
site zoning. Of the projects they’ve most recently completed, the lowest density they
successfully developed at allowed about 25 units per acre. Zoning that accommodates 25
units per acre is a minimum for their developments, but 30 units per acre would be
preferred. Finding appropriate sites can also be a problem, as most of their projects require
about two acres of land. Local funding is an essential component of their developments,
especially when tax credits are involved. City staff need to be able to think creatively about
development standards (e.g. setbacks, easements and parking) that constrain development,
in order to make a project happen. In general, working with cities that have high response
and turn-around standards, and good city council and planning commission leadership can
make all the difference for the success of a project.
Tri-Valley Haven
3663 Pacific Avenue
Livermore, CA 94550
Ann King, Executive Director
Services Provided: Provides shelter and counseling for survivors of sexual assault,
battered women and their children in the Tri-Valley area. They operate the County’s only 24-
hour rape crisis center and have homeless services and shelters. With 30 beds, Tri-Valley
Haven's Shiloh Domestic Violence Shelter houses and supports women and their children
who are victims of domestic violence. The Haven's 16-bed Sojourner House, located in the
City of Livermore, provides temporary shelter for homeless families in a safe, supportive
environment. With separate bedrooms for family units, a stocked kitchen, three full baths,
and laundry facilities, Sojourner House is the only homeless shelter in the Tri-Valley Area
that accepts two-parent families, single fathers with children, and families with teenage
boys. Supportive services, including counseling, housing assistance, long-term support,
legal clinic, employment assistance, seasonal provisions, and educational support are
offered through its shelters and other programs. Tri-Valley Haven also operates a food
pantry based in Livermore that serves over 4,000 low-income Tri-Valley residents a month.
The food pantry program offers mobile services at two additional locations in the City of
Pleasanton.
Population Served: Their programs serve Tri-Valley residents from cross all income
groups, who are adults and children who have experienced domestic violence, sexual
assault, or homelessness. Most of their clients are usually very low income. They also
operate the only homeless shelter in the Tri-Valley Area that accepts single fathers
accompanied by their children, and boys over the age of 10.
                                         Appendix A-5

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
Housing Needs: Low-income affordable housing is a significantly pressing need for the Tri-
Valley area. They struggle to graduate people from their shelter programs into more
permanent housing due to the lack of availability in the area. There is also a large need for
shelter and housing programs for single men. Homelessness in the Tri-Valley area has
worsened over the last few years, to the extent that King described it as almost becoming a
part of common life and accepted by the community. Many Tri-Valley residents become
homeless due to the unstable housing market, and other issues such as medical bankruptcy
and drug/alcohol reliance. Homelessness mostly goes unseen in the area but this may
change. The Tri-Valley area has the opportunity and needs to respond now to prevent
homelessness from becoming an issue that is seen everywhere within its local communities.
There is a general lack of support for homeless programs and services at the federal level.
The expectation has been for churches and non-profit organizations to pick up the slack with
no funding support. Available funding is nowhere near the level needed to match current
demand in the area. Current activities undertaken by Tri-Valley Haven include attempting to
coordinate with both the Cities of Livermore and Pleasanton to convert the Livermore
emergency shelter for families into a shelter for single men, and to open a new family shelter
in Pleasanton. Past support provided by the City of Dublin has been very helpful, including
the City’s assistance with efforts made to renovate the Haven’s facilities. They’re looking
into opening a one-stop shop day center for Tri-Valley area homeless that will provide
comprehensive shelter and supportive services. The City of Dublin can aid the Haven’s
efforts through providing capital funding for the project early on, and by also helping to
achieve the political will in the Tri-Valley area necessary to make such a project happen.
Tri-Valley Reach
P.O. Box 5564
Pleasanton, CA 94566
Judy Butterly, Co-Chair
Services Provided: Their mission is to provide resources, education, activities, community
participation and housing opportunities that will enable adults with developmental challenges
to live full and independent lives. Their housing assistance program offers eligible clients the
opportunity to live independently. Currently they own a total of nine properties in Livermore
and Pleasanton—ranging from duplexes to condo's to single family residences. They modify
their homes to suit each residents' special needs and work in close collaboration with the
Regional Center of the East Bay to provide supportive services.
Population Served: Currently, their homes support 21 tenants in Livermore and
Pleasanton. To be eligible for residency, tenants must be a client of the Regional Center and
either live in the Tri-Valley area or have family members who live in the Tri-Valley. Given
that all of the properties they currently own are in Livermore and Pleasanton, the majority of
their clients are from these areas. They serve adults of any age, with most tenants ranging
in age from 30 to 60 years old. Judy noted that adults with special needs who are younger
than 30 tend to live at home with their families for as long as possible.
Housing Needs: Demand for their services has been fairly stable over the last few years.
They have a small waitlist, but quite often when vacancies do become available the potential
tenants are not fully prepared or ready to live independently. Potential expansion of their
housing placement program would be dependent on an increase in demand for their
housing, of which they currently are not experiencing. Butterly added that this lack in
demand for housing is not representative of other independent living programs in the area,
                                            Appendix A-6

                                                                                  City of Dublin
                                                                   Housing Element (2015-2023)
such as group homes, which may be experiencing an increase in housing needs. With staff
knowledge and experience, they have the capabilities to be able to effectively respond to
future increases in demand for their housing. They do not own properties in the City of
Dublin as there has not been demand for their housing in the area. For this reason they
have not recently pursued housing in the Dublin as an option, but they are aware that the
City would be welcoming to such possibilities in the future.

Dublin’s Zoning Ordinance defines a “family” as
one or more persons occupying a dwelling and
living as a single, non-profit housekeeping unit,
as distinguished from a group occupying a
hotel, club, fraternity or sorority house. A family
includes any servants and four or fewer
boarders.       Based on court decisions, the
definition of family should not distinguish
between related and unrelated persons and
should not impose limitations on the number of
persons that may constitute a family. Because

1. Housing Needs Assessment
The Housing Needs Assessment begins with a brief history of Dublin, which is intended to
provide community context and a foundation for the analysis of demographic and housing stock
characteristics as well as various constraints to the provision of housing during the 2015-2023
Housing Element Cycle. The needs assessment identifies special housing needs among
certain population groups, evaluates housing conditions, and provides other important
information to support the goals, policies, and programs of the Housing Element to meet the
needs of current and future Dublin residents.
Brief History of Dublin
Dublin has long been known as the "crossroads" of the Bay Area.1 The City now sits at the
crossroads of two major highways: Interstate 580 and Interstate-680. However, the significance
of the "crossroads" dates back almost two hundred years when Dublin was the junction of two
important stage routes - one from the Bay Area to Stockton and the other from Martinez to San
Jose. The Alamilla Spring, located in the Dublin area, provided a place for travelers to change
horses and freshen up before continuing their journey.
Development of the Dublin area began in approximately 1822. Jose Maria Amador had been
paid in land for his years of service as a Mexican soldier and as administrator of Mission San
Jose. He received a land grant of 16,517 acres in the Amador- Livermore Valley and built
several adobe homes and many small buildings used as shops. In 1852 Michael Murray and
Jeremiah Fallon came to the area from Ireland and purchased 1,000 acres from Jose Amador.
Shortly thereafter, the area began to grow; Alameda County was created from parts of Contra
Costa and Santa Clara counties in 1853. Both Murray and Fallon served on the Alameda
County Board of Supervisors. Townships were established the next year and Murray's name
was chosen for the Dublin area.
By 1877 the first schoolhouse in the Amador-Livermore Valley, along with a church, two hotels,
Green's Store, a wagon and blacksmith shop, and a shoemaker's shop were constructed in
Dublin. Mail was delivered to the Dougherty Station Hotel; thus, the area became known as
Dougherty's Station. Dougherty Station grew slowly during the first half of the 20th Century with
the first housing tracts built in the Dublin area in 1960, transforming the formerly rural
community into a suburb. Dublin grew steadily from the early 1960s as both a residential and
retail center and incorporated in 1982.

    Much of the historical information is derived from Virginia Bennett’s book, “Dublin Reflections and Bits of Valley
    History” (1991). Copies of this book and other historical information can be found at the Dublin Library.

A. Population Characteristics and Trends
The following section describes and analyzes the various population characteristics and trends
in Dublin that affect housing needs.
Population Growth
Dublin’s population has grown steadily and dramatically over the past two decades. The number
of residents in the City increased 29 percent between 1990 and 2000 (Table C-1) and grew by
another 54 percent between 2000 and 2010. This growth has far outpaced the County’s growth
rate and that of most nearby jurisdictions. The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG)
projects continued population growth in Dublin and surrounding communities through 2020.
Most of the projected population growth in Alameda County is expected to occur through
annexation and development of city spheres of influence and areas around unincorporated
communities such as Castro Valley.

Age Composition
A population’s age characteristics are also an important factor in evaluating housing and
community development needs and determining the direction of future housing development.
Typically, distinct lifestyles, family types and sizes, incomes, and housing preferences
accompany different age groups. As people move through each stage of life, housing needs
and preferences change. For example, young householders without children usually have
different housing preferences than middle-age householders with children or senior
householders living alone.
Dublin’s population is, as measured by the median age of its residents, slightly younger than
most neighboring communities and the County as a whole. In 2010, Dublin’s median age was
35.3 years, while the County’s median age was 36.6. The City’s proportion of young residents
(22 percent) and seniors (seven percent) has remained fairly stable since 2000 and was the
lowest among its neighbors in 2010, suggesting that a significant proportion of Dublin’s
population is of workforce age (Table C-2).

 The most noticeable shift in the City’s age distribution was among working age residents (Figure
 C-1). Dublin’s workforce is beginning to age. Since 1990, the proportion of 25 to 44 year olds
 dropped by eight percentage points, while the proportion of 45 to 64 year olds increased by
 eight percentage points. This could be an indication of the City’s residents aging in place.
 Should this trend continue, Dublin’s senior population could see a significant increase in the
 coming years.

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
Race and Ethnicity
Household characteristics, income levels, and cultural backgrounds tend to vary by race and
ethnicity, often affecting housing needs and preferences. Studies have suggested that different
racial and ethnic groups also differ in their attitudes toward and/or tolerance for “housing
problems” as defined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
including overcrowding and housing cost burden.2 According to these studies, perceptions
regarding housing density and overcrowding tend to vary between racial and ethnic groups.
Especially within cultures that prefer to live with extended family members, household size and
overcrowding also tend to increase. In general, Hispanic and Asian households exhibit a
greater propensity than the White households for living in extended families.
Since 1990, the City’s population has grown significantly more diverse. Dublin’s White
population, which made up the majority of the City’s residents in 1990, has decreased by 28
percent, while the Asian population has increased by 21 percent. As of 2010, approximately 44
percent of Dublin residents were White/Caucasian, 27 percent Asian/Pacific Islander, 15
percent Hispanic/Latino, nine percent Black/African-American, and five percent were identified
as belonging to two or more or other races (Figure C-2). The 2000 Census allowed
respondents to classify themselves as belonging to “Two or More” races for the first time. This
change in methodology may explain most of the increase between 1990 and 2000 among
residents who classified themselves as belonging to “Other” races.

B. Employment Profile
An assessment of community needs must consider the occupational profile of City residents.
Incomes associated with different jobs and the number of workers in a household determines
the type and size of housing a household can afford. In some cases, the types of jobs held by
residents can affect housing needs and demand (such as in communities with military
installations, college campuses, and seasonal agriculture).
Occupation and Labor Participation
The American Community Survey (ACS) provides information about employment in the City. As
of 2011, Management, Business, Science, and Arts and Sales and Office occupations were the
two largest occupational categories in Dublin (Table C-4). These categories accounted for 79
percent of the jobs held by the City’s residents. By comparison, these occupations comprised
approximately 68 percent of the jobs held by Alameda County residents.

Employment growth typically leads to strong housing demand, while the reverse is true when
employment contracts. The City adopted a Commercial Linkage Fee in 2005. The Commercial
Linkage Fee is collected and deposited into the Inclusionary Zoning In-lieu Fee fund for the
funding of affordable housing programs. As of April 1, 2014, the In-Lieu Fee fund has a balance
of $7,013,816. The City will continue to implement its Commercial Linkage Fee program as a
means of generating revenue to increase the supply of affordable housing in Dublin.

Income by Occupation
Management occupations were the highest paid occupations in the Alameda County region in
the first quarter of 2013, while food preparation, service-related, and sales occupations were
among the lowest paid occupations (Table C-5). In 2011, a larger proportion of Dublin residents
were employed in higher paying occupations compared to the employed residents of Alameda
County as a whole. This pattern would explain the City’s higher median income (see Figure C-4
later).

C. Household Characteristics
The Census defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit. This definition
includes single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, and unrelated
individuals living together. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories, or
other group living situations are not considered households. Information on household
characteristics is important to understand the growth and changing needs of a community.
Household Type
According to the Census, Dublin was home to 14,913 households in 2010. Of these
households, 28 percent were single-person households and 11 percent were headed by seniors
(Table C-6). Dublin’s household characteristics were in many ways similar to characteristics of
households in nearby jurisdictions. However, the City does have the lowest proportion of
senior-headed households in the region.

Different household types generally have different housing needs. Seniors or young adults often
comprise the majority of the single-person households and tend to reside in apartment units,
condominiums, or smaller single-family homes. Families often prefer larger single-family
homes. Dublin’s housing stock provides a range of unit types to meet the needs of all of its
residents. Roughly, 54 percent of the City’s housing stock is comprised of detached single-
family units and approximately 33 percent are multi-family units, which include apartments and
condominiums.
Household Size
Household size identifies sources of population growth and household overcrowding. A
community's average household size will increase over time if there is a trend towards larger
families. In communities where the population is aging, the average household size may
decline. Dublin’s average household size in 2010 (2.70) was equal to the average household
size in the County (2.70) but less than most neighboring cities, with the exception of Castro
Valley (2.69) (Figure C-3). Dublin’s average household size has increased since the 2000
Census, as did the average household size in most neighboring jurisdictions.

The State and Federal government classify household income into various groups based upon
its relationship to the County Area Median Income (AMI) and adjusted for household size. In
2010, approximately 83 percent of Dublin households earned moderate or above moderate
incomes and only 17 percent of households earned lower incomes (Table C-8).4

Overcrowding
An overcrowded housing unit is defined as a unit occupied by more than one person per room.5
Overcrowding can result when there are not enough adequately sized units within a community,
when high housing costs relative to income force too many individuals to share a housing unit
than it can adequately accommodate, and/or when families reside in smaller units than they
need to devote income to other necessities, such as food and health care. Overcrowding also
tends to accelerate deterioration of housing. Therefore, maintaining a reasonable level of
occupancy and alleviating overcrowding are important City goals to enhance quality of life for
residents and aesthetic quality of neighborhoods.
In 2011, overcrowding affected only two percent of Dublin households. By comparison, six
percent of Alameda County households were living in overcrowded conditions. The incidence of
overcrowding was equal among both renter- and owner-households (two percent each).
Although these estimates show overcrowding by tenure to be near equal, proportions of housing
units with more than three bedrooms by tenure suggests an inadequate supply of larger rental
units. While 64 percent of occupied housing units in the City had more than three bedrooms
(the minimum size considered large enough to avoid most overcrowding issues for large
households), only 13 percent of these units were occupied by renters.
Although a portion of overcrowding problems is likely attributable to a lack of larger housing
units available for rent, the incidence of overcrowding is also influenced by other housing
problems, such as overpayment. When faced with high housing, many families opt to take on
additional roommates in order to share the cost burden or choose to reside in smaller units to
save on costs.
Overpayment (Cost Burden)
State and federal standards for housing overpayment (cost burden) are based on an income-to-
housing cost ratio of 30 percent and above. Households paying more than 30 percent of their
income on housing have limited remaining income for other necessities. Above moderate
income households generally are capable of paying a larger proportion of income for housing;
therefore, estimates of housing overpayment generally focus on lower and moderate income
households. In 2010, 42 percent of all Dublin households overpaid for housing. Furthermore,
overpayment was more likely to affect homeowners rather than renters (47 percent versus 33
percent, respectively). Overpayment was generally concentrated among households at the
lower income ranges and affected a larger proportion of renter-households with lower incomes
than owner-households. For households earning moderate incomes or above, overpayment
affected a larger percentage of homeowners than renters, which indicates that rental housing in
Dublin is typically affordable to moderate income households (Figure C-5).

D. Special Needs Populations
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty in finding decent, affordable
housing due to their special needs. Special circumstances may be related to one’s employment
and income, family characteristics, disability, and household characteristics, among other
factors. Consequently, some Dublin residents may experience a higher prevalence of housing
overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing problems than other community members.
“Special needs” groups include the following: senior households, single-parent households,
large households, persons with disabilities (including persons with developmental disabilities),
agricultural workers, military personnel, and homeless (Table C-9). This section provides a
detailed discussion of the housing needs facing each particular group as well as programs and
services available to address their housing needs.

   Senior Households
   The population over 65 years of age is considered senior. Many senior households have special
   housing needs due to their limited and/or fixed incomes, health care costs, and disabilities. In
   2010, seniors comprised seven percent of all Dublin residents and approximately 11 percent of
   Dublin households were headed by seniors. Of these senior-headed households, the majority
   (75 percent) owned their homes, while the remainder (25 percent) rented their homes.
   Approximately 47 percent of senior-headed households overpaid for their housing. Generally,
   this overpayment was more likely to affect senior renters rather than senior homeowners.
   Specifically, 42 percent of senior homeowners overpaid, while 58 percent of senior renters
   overpaid.6
   Aside from overpayment problems faced by seniors due to their relatively fixed incomes, many
   seniors are faced with various disabilities. Roughly, 31 percent of Dublin’s senior population
   was listed as having one or more disabilities in 2011 by the ACS. Among these disabilities, the
   most common were ambulatory, hearing, and independent living difficulties.
   6
        This figure represents a noticeable increase from the 2000 Census. The increase may be due to a range of
        factors, including increases in mortgages and rents, increases in utility costs, and large sampling errors due to
        the small sample size used by the American Community Survey.

                                                                                  Housing Element (2015-2023)
According to 2-1-1 Alameda County client statistics, householders age 62 and older represented
approximately 14 percent of all Dublin callers during Fiscal Year 2012-2013.7 Requests for
housing and shelter referrals were the most prevalent among all callers, including assistance
with senior housing information and referral. Amon other top requests were for information on
public assistance programs and legal services, including Medicaid and elder law.
Resources
The special needs of seniors can be met through a range of services, including congregate
care, rent subsides, shared housing, and housing rehabilitation assistance. According to
Community Care Licensing Division records, nine community care facilities for the elderly are
located in Dublin with a total capacity to serve 54 persons.
Affordable housing opportunities located in the City to meet the housing needs of the elderly
include:
        Carlow Court Senior Apartments at Emerald Vista – 49 below market units
        Pine and Cedar Groves at Dublin Ranch Senior Apartments – 292 below market units
        Wicklow Square Senior Apartments – 53 below market units
Senior residents can benefit from various classes, activities, and programs offered at the Dublin
Senior Center. The Senior Center also provides a variety of free health and informational
services, including health management classes, health and memory screenings, and health
insurance counseling and advocacy.
In 2007, the City adopted a Universal Design Ordinance that requires new single-family home
developers to install base universal design features in all single-family developments of 20 or
more homes. The Universal Design Ordinance is substantially the same as the Model Universal
Design Local Ordinance adopted by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development. The City developed a brochure on the Universal Design Ordinance after its
adoption in December 2007 and has updated it periodically to ensure that current information
regarding the Ordinance is distributed. The brochure and other related information regarding the
Ordinance has been posted to the City’s website and is also available at the public counter. In
2010, there was an update to the Ordinance to meet the current building code and which took
effect January 1, 2011.
Single-Parent Households
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance because of their greater
need for day care, health care, and other facilities. Female-headed single-parent households
face greater financial difficulties because they often do not have the same earning power as
their male counterparts, thus limiting housing availability for this group. Approximately seven
percent of Dublin households were headed by single parents in 2010; the large majority of
which were headed by females (69 percent). According to the 2007-2011 ACS, 16 percent of
female headed single-parent households in Dublin had incomes below the poverty level.

Single mother with minor children households represented nearly 29 percent of all Dublin callers
to 2-1-1 Alameda County during Fiscal Year 2012-2013.7 Among top caller needs were referral
requests for low income/subsidized rental housing, public assistance program, legal services,
information services, and individual and family support services.
Resources
Limited household income constrains the ability of these households to afford adequate housing
and provide for childcare, health care, and other necessities. Finding adequate and affordable
childcare is a pressing issue for many families with children. While the City has no specific
housing programs targeted at single-parent households, the City’s overall efforts to expand
affordable housing opportunities will help meet the needs of single-parent households. The City
also offers a Youth Fee Assistance Program to enable households with limited income to
participate in City-sponsored recreation programs that may be beneficial to single-parent
households. Youth programs that are offered include various preschool, elementary and middle
school after school programs, and children and teen recreation and educational classes.
In February 2010, the City amended the Zoning Ordinance to streamline the approval of Large
Family Day Care Homes and in February 2014 amended the Zoning Ordinance to streamline
the approval of Day Care Centers. Both Zoning Ordinance amendments reduce the cost and
time associated with establishing child care facilities in the City.
Large Households
Large households (households with five or more members) are identified as a group with special
housing needs because of the limited availability of adequately sized, affordable housing units.
Large households with lower incomes frequently occupy smaller and more affordable dwelling
units to offset potential cost burden, which in turn can accelerate unit deterioration.
Approximately 10 percent of Dublin households could be classified as large households in 2010.
Over 30 percent of these households rented their homes. As previously discussed, the
availability of adequately sized, affordable rental units in Dublin is limited. About 64 percent of
occupied housing units in the City had more than three bedrooms (adequate size for larger
households) in 2011; however, only a small portion of these units (13 percent) were occupied by
renters.
2-11 Alameda County client statistics indicate that approximately seven percent of Dublin callers
during Fiscal Year 2012-2013 were large households.7 Referral requests for rental and utility
payment assistance, food stamps, and eviction prevention assistance were highly prevalent
among all callers.
Resources
The City’s large households can benefit from the housing programs and services that are
available to all of the City’s lower and moderate income households, such as the Housing
Choice Voucher program, Commercial Linkage Fee Program, Inclusionary Zoning Program, and
Housing Rehabilitation Assistance Program. Such efforts help reduce overcrowding and
overpayment among lower and moderate income households, and help reduce the number of
large households formed by families or individuals sharing housing arrangements.

Persons with Disabilities
Disability is a physical or mental condition that substantially limits one or more major life
activities. Physical disabilities can hinder access to housing units of conventional design, as
well as limit the ability to earn incomes sufficient to avoid housing cost burden. The ACS
estimates that five percent of Dublin residents over five years of age had a disability in 2011.
The ACS also tallied the number of disabilities by type for residents with one or more
disabilities. Among the disabilities tallied, ambulatory difficulties were the most prevalent,
especially among the City’s senior residents. Hearing, cognitive, and independent living
difficulties were also common (Table C-10).

      Notes:
      1. Tallied only for persons five years and over.
      2. Persons may have multiple disabilities.
Four factors – affordability, design, location and discrimination – can limit the supply of housing
available to households of persons with disabilities. The most obvious housing need for
persons with disabilities is housing that is or can be adapted to their needs. Most single-family
homes are inaccessible to people with mobility and sensory limitations. Housing may not be
adaptable to widened doorways and hallways, access ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered
countertops and other features necessary for accessibility. The cost of retrofitting a home often
makes homeownership cost-prohibitive, even for individuals or families who could otherwise
afford a home. Furthermore, some providers of basic homebuying services do not have offices
or materials that are accessible to people with mobility, visual or hearing impairments.
Households that had a household member with a disability represented nearly 34 percent of all
Dublin callers to 2-1-1 Alameda County during Fiscal Year 2012-2013.7 Referral requests for
help with Medicaid and other medical information, and in home assistance were among the top
needs of all callers.
Persons with Developmental Disabilities
A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of
persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by the Section 4512 of the Welfare and
Institutions Code, “developmental disability” means “a disability that originates before an
individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and
constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. As defined by the Director of
                                                  Appendix C-15

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
Developmental Services, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction, this term
shall include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term shall also
include disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require
treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but shall not include
other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.” This definition also reflects the
individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or generic
services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or extended
duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community based
services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families
through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two
community-based facilities. The Regional Center of the East Bay (RCEB) is one of 21 regional
centers in the State of California that provides point of entry to services for people with
developmental disabilities. The RCEB is charged by the State of California with the care of
people with developmental disabilities, defined as those with severe, life-long disabilities
attributable to mental and/or physical impairments. The RCEB is a private, non-profit community
agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with
developmental disabilities and their families.
The following information from Area Board 5 of the State Council on Developmental Disabilities
provides a closer look at the disabled population. Data shown in Table C-11 estimates the
number of Dublin individuals with developmental disabilities, including both RCEB consumers
and those unaffiliated with the RCEB.

According to the State’s Department of Developmental Services, as of January 2014, about 15
percent of developmentally disabled persons (approximately 78 persons) in Dublin were
residing in community care facilities, eight percent were residing in intermediate care facilities
(approximately 41 persons), and an additional eight percent (approximately 41 persons) were
living with the assistance of Independent Living (IL) services or Supervised Living Services
(SLS). The majority of these individuals (63 percent or about 328 persons) were residing in their
own home with a parent or guardian. Approximately three percent (about 16 persons) were in
foster care and another three percent (about 16 persons) had other living arrangements. Many
developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment
where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an
institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because
developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an
appropriate level of independence as an adult.

Resources
Services for persons with disabilities are typically provided by both public and private agencies.
State and Federal legislation regulate the accessibility and adaptability of new or rehabilitated
multi-family apartment complexes to ensure accommodation for individuals with limited physical
mobility. As mentioned previously, in 2007, the City adopted a Universal Design Ordinance that
requires new single-family home developers to install base universal design features in all
single-family developments of 20 or more homes. The City developed a brochure on the
Universal Design Ordinance and has updated it periodically to ensure that current information
regarding the Ordinance is distributed. The brochure and other related information has been
posted to the City’s website and is also available at the public counter.
Housing options for persons with disabilities also include various community care facilities.
Combined, these facilities offer a capacity of 88 beds. These include:
        Six Adult Residential Care facilities – 34 beds total
        Nine Residential Care for the Elderly facilities – 54 beds total
Agricultural Workers
Agricultural workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned
through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in the fields,
processing plants, or support activities on a generally year-round basis. When workload
increases during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal labor, often
supplied by a labor contractor. For some crops, farms may employ migrant workers, defined as
those whose travel distance to work prevents them from returning to their primary residence
every evening. Determining the true size of the agricultural labor force is problematic. For
instance, government agencies that track farm labor do not consistently define farm-workers
(e.g. field laborers versus workers in processing plants), length of employment (e.g. permanent
or seasonal), or place of work (e.g. the location of the business or field). Further limiting the
ability to ascertain the number of agricultural workers within Dublin is the limited data available
on the City due to its relatively small size. Therefore, the 2007-2011 ACS is the sole source of
information that can be referenced. According to the ACS, only 47 Dublin residents (less than
one percent of the City’s residents) were employed in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and
hunting, and mining industry.
Resources
Dublin is an urbanized community with no undeveloped parcels zoned for agricultural use.
Because a negligible portion of community residents are employed in farming, fishing, and
forestry occupations and there is little potential for this occupational category to expand within
Dublin, no housing programs or policies specifically targeted at farm-workers are needed.
Military Personnel
The Camp Parks Reserve Forces Training Area is located in Dublin. Camp Parks supports
some 20,000 northern California Army Reserve and California National Guard Soldiers from an
estimated 250 reserve component units. Many of these units, however, train at Camp Parks for
just two weeks each summer and very few reside in the City. According to the 2007-2011, only
236 Dublin residents (0.7 percent) served in the Armed Forces full-time.

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
Resources
Because most of the military personnel that use Camp Parks are reservists, few live in Dublin.
In 2005, the military constructed 114 homes on the base for military personnel. Because a
negligible portion of community residents serve in the Armed Forces full-time, no housing
programs or policies specifically targeted at military personnel are needed.
Homeless
The Alameda Countywide Homeless Continuum of Care Council (HCCC) relies on a
“community-defined” definition of homeless; one that includes the HUD-defined chronic
homeless population as a subset of the County’s overall homeless population. Community-
defined homelessness includes people staying in emergency shelters or transitional housing,
living on the street or in a car, and people who will lose their housing within a month and have
nowhere to go.
Assessing a region’s homeless population is difficult because of the transient nature of the
population. As many as 16,000 people are estimated to be homeless during the course of a
year in Alameda County, and more than 5,000 are homeless on any given night. According to
the 2013 count, 4,264 people were homeless in Alameda County on January 29, 2013. The
homeless population in Dublin was estimated at 14 persons.
Based on informal interviews with patrol personnel, the Police estimated that depending on the
time of year and weather, the City has a very small amount of homeless persons at a given
time. During the winter months the homeless population ranges from one to two persons, if any
at all. While during the summer months the homeless population may increase slightly to
between two and three persons. Police typically make every effort possible to redirect
homeless persons they encounter to shelters, VA sponsored counseling, or various other
resources in the County.
Over three-quarters (78 percent) of Dublin callers to 2-1-1 Alameda County during Fiscal Year
2012-2013 were extremely low income households.7 Referral requests for housing and shelter
were highly prevalent among all callers. Specifically, there were a high number of requests for
emergency shelter, transitional housing/shelter, and homeless permanent supportive housing.
Requests were also highly prevalent for homeless prevention referrals, including access to low
income/subsidized rental housing, rental and utility payment assistance, and eviction prevention
assistance.
Resources
Emergency, transitional, and permanent supportive housing is available in Alameda County for
people who are homeless, living with HIV/AIDS, and/or mentally ill. Unlike affordable housing in
general, housing that is dedicated to one of these populations typically connects with services.
The service connection may range from a service coordinator, who can make referrals to
services off-site, up to more intensive on-site services. The following provides an overview of
Countywide housing resources available to serve the County’s homeless population:

        Emergency Shelters: An emergency shelter provides overnight shelter and fulfills a
         client’s basic needs (i.e. food, clothing, and medical care) either on site or through off-
         site services. The permitted length of stay can vary from one day at a time to three
         months.
        Transitional Housing: This type of facility provides housing for up to two years.
         Residents of transitional housing are usually connected to supportive services designed
         to assist the homeless in achieving greater economic independence and a permanent,
         stable living situation.
        Supportive Housing: Permanent supportive housing is service-enriched and linked
         with on-going supportive services (on-site or off-site) allowing formerly homeless clients
         to live at the facility on an indefinite basis. Support services can encompass a wide
         range of activities, such as case management, service coordination (assessing needs
         and coordinating services), health and mental health care, substance abuse treatment,
         employment counseling and training, and money management. Services are usually
         tailored to the needs of the housed individuals, and may be delivered on-site or through
         linkages to community-based agencies.
Approximately 40 agencies throughout the County provide emergency shelter or transitional
housing services for both individuals and families. There are no emergency shelters or
transitional housing providers located in Dublin. Service agencies located in the nearby City of
Livermore, including Shepherd’s Gate, Tri-Valley Haven and Livermore Homeless Refuge,
provide emergency shelter and transitional housing services for homeless in need.
Approximately 26 supportive housing facilities serving both individuals and families are available
throughout the County. Supportive housing services are not available in Dublin. The Tri-City
Health Center provides Shelter Plus Care supportive housing services to its clients and has a
location in nearby Livermore.9
Homelessness is a regional issue that requires the coordination among regional agencies.
“EveryOne Home” is Alameda County’s road map for ending homelessness. It represents an
opportunity to participate in a model of long-term solutions and innovative countywide
strategies. Emphasizing a coordinated, efficient regional response to a regional problem will
make the best use of the county’s resources while building capacity to attract funding from
federal, state and philanthropic sources. EveryOne Home envisions the creation of a housing-
and-services system that partners with consumers, families and advocates; provides
appropriate services in a timely fashion to all in need; and ensures that individuals and families
are safely, supportively and permanently housed. The City adopted EveryOne Home in August
2008.
The City will continue to support the Alameda County HCCC and agencies and organizations
that address the problem of homelessness throughout the region. Dublin provided funding to
the Alameda Countywide HCCC for development of a Homeless Management Information
System (HMIS). The HMIS is intended to collect and report information about the homeless
population and its patterns of service utilization. In addition, the City of Dublin continues to
support the Tri-Valley Haven's Domestic Violence Shelter and Homeless Shelter through
Community Development Block Grant funds.

The City will continue to analyze and address impediments to the provision of housing for the
homeless and near homeless by facilitating and encouraging the development of affordable
housing and facilities for the homeless, including emergency shelters, transitional housing,
single room occupancy units, and permanent supportive housing. In April 2011, the Dublin
Zoning Ordinance was amended to include provisions for emergency shelters, transitional
housing, supportive housing, single room occupancy housing.
E. Housing Stock Characteristics
The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth, type, age and condition, tenure,
vacancy rates, costs, and affordability are important in determining the housing needs for the
community. This section details Dublin’s housing stock characteristics in an attempt to identify
how well the current housing stock meets the needs of current and future residents of the City.
Housing Unit Growth and Type
Dublin has experienced relatively strong housing growth since 1990. The City’s housing stock
grew from 6,992 units in 1990 to an estimated 15,782 units in 2010, an increase of
approximately 126 percent (Table C-12). Dublin’s growth since 1990 has far outpaced the
growth observed in all other nearby communities and the County.

Dublin maintains a diverse housing stock. In 2013, single-family homes comprised 66 percent
of the housing stock, while multi-family units comprised 33 percent. Less than one percent of
the City’s housing was comprised of mobile homes (Table C-13). Compared to the County,
Dublin’s housing stock has a larger proportion of single-family housing and a smaller proportion
of multi-family structures.

Housing Age and Condition
Housing that is 30 years or older is assumed to require some rehabilitation. Electrical capacity,
kitchen features, and roofs usually need updating if no prior replacement work has occurred.
Dublin’s housing stock is younger than the County’s overall, with just 29 percent of the City’s
housing constructed prior to 1980. By contrast, about 74 percent of the County’s housing stock
is more than 30 years old (constructed prior to 1980) (Figure C-6 ).

Based on the age of the structure alone, it is estimated that approximately one in four housing
units in the City may require maintenance or rehabilitation within the Housing Element planning
period. However, the actual proportion of Dublin housing units in need of rehabilitation or
replacement is likely much lower as high property values in Dublin, even for older homes,
                                                 Appendix C-21

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
creates a market incentive for most property owners to diligently maintain their dwelling units.
From 2007-2013, 838 residential re-roof permits were issued by the Building Division, which
reflects a high rate of on-going maintenance and repair by homeowners. For these reasons, the
City estimates that less than two percent of the housing stock (<400 units) is in need of
rehabilitation and less than one percent is in need of replacement (<150 units). Even this
estimate may be high as substandard housing or paint issues led to only 21 code violations of
the 3,104 residential code enforcement cases opened since 2008.
The Alameda County Community Development Agency administers the Minor and Major Home
Improvement Programs for the City of Dublin. Low-interest loans up to $1,500 are available to
lower income households through the Minor Home Improvement Program. While the Major
Home Improvement Program provides loans up to $60,000 at a three percent annual
percentage rate for qualified lower income households. Since 2007, on behalf of the City,
Alameda County administered Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds and
provided 12 minor home repairs, eight paint grants, 11 rehabilitation grants, and five
accessibility grants in Dublin. The City will continue to support the Alameda County Community
Development Agency to implement the Minor and Major Home Improvement Program.
Housing Tenure
The tenure distribution of a community's housing
stock (owner-occupied versus renter-occupied)               Table C-14: Housing Tenure

market. Residential stability is influenced by tenure,                         % Owner-   % Renter-

rate of homeownership is the lowest among neighboring       communities, but still noticeably higher
than the County’s homeownership rate.
On average, owner-households were larger than renter-households in 2010 (Table C-15).
Among those who owned their homes, 52 percent were households with more than three
persons, while just 38 percent of renter-households were comprised of three or more persons.

The City values its rental housing stock and recognizes its importance for meeting the diverse
housing needs of the community. In 2005, the City Council passed a Condominium Conversion
Ordinance to preserve the existing rental housing stock. The Ordinance establishes an annual
maximum number of rental apartment units that can be converted to seven percent of the total
number of multi-family units in developments of 21 or more rental units. The Ordinance also
establishes tenant notification and relocation assistance requirements, limits rent increases
once a notice of intent to convert has been filed, and gives tenants the right to purchase units.
New condominium conversions are also subject to the City’s Inclusionary Zoning Regulations.
The City continues to monitor conversion activities annually. There have been no condominium
conversions in the City since 2007.
Housing Vacancy
A certain number of vacant units are needed to moderate the cost of housing, allow sufficient
choice for residents, and provide an incentive for unit upkeep and repair. Specifically, vacancy
rates of approximately two percent for ownership housing and five to six percent for rental
housing are generally considered optimal by housing professionals to balance demand and
supply for housing.
According to the Census, the overall vacancy rate in Dublin was 5.5 percent in 2010.
Specifically, the vacancy rate for ownership housing was 2.5 percent in 2010, while the rental
vacancy rate was five percent. Both the ownership and rental vacancy rates for the City were
well within the optimal ranges, indicating that the City’s housing stock is adequately meeting
overall demand. However, affordable housing options in the City may still be in short supply.
Housing Costs and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems in a community. If
housing costs are relatively high in comparison to household income, there will be a
correspondingly higher prevalence of housing overpayment and overcrowding. This section
summarizes the cost and affordability of the housing stock to Dublin residents.
Homeownership Market
According to DataQuick, a company that collects real estate data nationwide, median home
prices in Dublin and nearby communities were well above the countywide median price of
$485,000 (Figure C-7). Dublin’s median sales price during 2013 was $678,000, approximately
28 percent higher than the County’s. Home prices in the City have continued to rise steadily in
                                            Appendix C-23

recent years. Median sales prices have increased over 20 percent annually since 2011 (Table
C-16). Most neighboring jurisdictions experienced similar increases in home prices, including
Livermore, San Ramon, and Pleasanton. Castro Valley experienced the largest change in
median sales price (28 percent) of neighboring jurisdictions between 2012 and 2013, but all
were outpaced by the increase that occurred in the County as a whole (33 percent).
Asking prices for single-family homes and condominiums in Dublin were also collected from the
Zillow online real estate database in an effort to understand Dublin’s recent real estate market.
The Zillow database listed 31 single-family detached homes and 21 attached homes for sale in
February 2014 (Table C-17). The median asking price for a unit was $569,000, with an overall
range of $245,000 to $1,737,736. Detached units were priced higher ($709,450 median) than
attached units ($419,000 median).

Housing Affordability by Household Income
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home in the
City with the maximum affordable housing costs for households at different income levels.
Taken together, this information can generally show who can afford what size and type of
housing and indicate the type of households most likely to experience overcrowding and
overpayment.
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual household
income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for federal housing assistance.
Based on this survey, the California Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD) developed income limits that can be used to determine the maximum price that could be
affordable to households in the upper range of their respective income category. Households in
the lower end of each category can afford less by comparison than those at the upper end. The
maximum affordable home and rental prices for residents of Alameda County are shown in
Table C-19. The market-affordability of Dublin’s housing stock for each income group is
discussed below.
Extremely Low and Very Low Income Households
Extremely low income households earn 30 percent or less of the Area Median Income (AMI).
Generally, the maximum affordable rental payment ranges from $373 per month for a one-
person household to $522 per month for a family of five (Table C-19). The maximum affordable
home purchase price for extremely low income households ranges from $63,071 for a one-
person household to $78,664 for a five-person household.
Very low-income households are classified as those earning 50 percent or less of the AMI. The
maximum affordable rental payment ranges from $701 per month for a one-person household to
$1,027 per month for a family of five (Table C-19). The maximum affordable home purchase
price for very low income households ranges from $124,048 for a one-person household to
$172,689 for a five person household.
Based on the rental data presented in Table C-18, extremely low and very low income
households of all sizes would be unlikely to secure adequately sized and affordable rental
housing in Dublin. In addition, according to the Zillow real estate database, no houses of
adequate size were listed for sale at prices affordable to these households in February 2014
(Table C-17).
Low Income Households
Low income households earn 51 to 80 percent of the County AMI. The maximum home price a
low income household can afford ranges from $192,006 for a one-person household to
$277,653 for a five-person family. Affordable rental rates for low-income households would
range from $1,066 for a one-person household to $1,590 for a five-person household.
Based upon a review of homes listed for sale in February 2014, low-income households would
have great difficulty purchasing an adequately sized home at an affordable price (Table C-17).
However, these households do stand a better chance of securing an adequately sized
affordable rental unit (Table C-18). Because the City has a limited number of apartment
complexes offering three-bedroom units, though, larger low income households will still likely
find it hard to find affordable housing options that can comfortably accommodate them.

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
Moderate Income Households
Moderate income households earn up to 120 percent of the County AMI. The maximum
affordable home price for moderate income households ranges from $398,170 for a one-person
household to $595,801 for a family of five. A moderate income household can afford rental
rates of $1,846 to $2,794 per month depending on household size.
Based on these figures and the real estate data presented in Table C-18, moderate income
households could afford many of the attached homes and a limited number of the detached
homes listed for sale in February 2014. These households would also be able to afford a wide
range of the available rental units in Dublin.

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
This Housing Element includes a variety of programs designed to improve the adequacy and
affordability of housing in Dublin and to assist renters and homeowners who cannot afford
housing (see Housing Programs).
As of February 2014, a total of 365 Dublin households were receiving rental assistance through
the Housing Choice Voucher Program. A total of 26 Dublin households were on the waiting list
for rental assistance. The Housing Authority of the County of Alameda administers the program
in Dublin. Given the continued need for rental assistance, the City supports and encourages the
provision of subsidies through the Housing Choice Voucher Program.
The City has also promoted the development of affordable housing units as part of various
mixed-use and housing projects and initiatives. In August 2008, a mixed-use project consisting
of 305 high density residential units and approximately 15,000 square feet of ground floor
commercial completed construction at the Dublin Transit Center. The project, Avalon at Dublin
Station (now known as Eclipse at Dublin Station), is an apartment community with 10 percent of
the units set aside for moderate income households. In March 2011, Avalon Bay Communities
was approved to construct an additional 505 high density residential apartment units at the
Dublin Transit Center. 10 percent of the units will be set aside for moderate income households.
The project is currently under construction.
In addition, the City worked with Eden Housing, KB Homes and the Dublin Housing Authority on
the development of the Emerald Vista mixed-income development project. The City provided
application/technical assistance as needed by the developer in order to securing financing and
other sources of funding to support the development of the project. The project was approved
by the Dublin City Council in September 2009 and includes the demolition of 150 existing
affordable housing units and the construction of 378 new housing units (both attached and
detached) including market rate, affordable senior housing, affordable family housing, a child
care center and community building. The project includes 194 (180 rental units and 14 for-sale
units) affordable units in various income categories. The project was completed in May 2013
and all 180 of the affordable rental units have been leased. The City of Dublin continues to
encourage developers to provide affordable housing by awarding qualifying developments with
additional market rate units.
In 2006, the City initiated a First Time Homebuyer Loan Program (FTHLP) to assist lower and
moderate income households with financing towards the purchase of a home. The City
provides information on this program on the City website. The website is routinely updated to
provide current information on various housing opportunities in Dublin and the region. Since
2007, the City has assisted a total of 54 households with first-time homebuyer loans.
The City adopted an Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance in 2002 to assure that housing development
contributes to the attainment of the City’s housing goals by increasing the production of
residential units affordable by households of very low, low, and moderate income. In December
2008, the City Council approved an amendment to the Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance to
eliminate the requirement to construct owner-occupied very low income units. This modification
was in response to feedback the City was receiving from the development community on the
feasibility of constructing owner- occupied very low income units. Since 2007, the City has
issued 332 permits for the construction of affordable housing units. Furthermore, the City
currently has a balance of $7,013,816 in its Inclusionary Zoning In-Lieu Fee fund. The City will
continue to enforce the provisions of its Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance to further Housing

F. Affordable Housing Inventory
Ten assisted rental housing developments in Dublin provide 982 affordable rental units (Table
C-20). This inventory of assisted units includes a review of all multi-family rental units under
federal, state, and/or local programs, including HUD programs, state and local bond programs,
redevelopment programs, and local in-lieu fees (inclusionary, density bonus, or direct
assistance programs).
All of these projects are recent developments with the most recent being Emerald Vista.
Emerald Vista, formally known as Arroyo Vista, has historically been supported by the Housing
Choice Voucher Program. Emerald Vista was redeveloped in 2013 to include 378 units, of which
194 are reserved as affordable units (180 rental units and 14 for-sale units). The City worked
with Eden Housing, KB Homes and the Dublin Housing Authority on the development of this
project, which includes market rate units, affordable senior housing, affordable family housing, a
child care center and a community building. The project was completed in May 2013; all 180 of
the affordable rental units have been leased and all 14 affordable for-sale units have been sold.
Generally, deed restrictions ensure the long-term affordability of below market rate units. No
project is at risk of converting to market rate within the planning period (July 1, 2015 to June 30,
2025) due to expiration of deed restrictions or subsidy contracts.

G. Estimates of Housing Needs
The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by the Census for HUD
provides detailed information on housing needs by income level for different types of
households in Dublin. Detailed CHAS data based on the 2006-2010 American Community
Survey is displayed in Table C-21. Based on CHAS, housing problems in Dublin include:
      Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
      Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
      Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross income; or
      Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross income.
The types of problems vary according to household income, type, and tenure. Some highlights
include:
      In general, owner-households were more likely to experience housing problems (48
       percent) than renter-households (35 percent).
      Large family renter-households, though, had the highest level of housing problems
       regardless of income level (71 percent). All very low and low income large family renter
       households experienced a housing problem between 2006 and 2010.
      Very low income households were the most likely to be affected by a housing problem
       (84 percent). Extremely low (78 percent) and low income (82 percent) households were
       also significantly affected by these issues.
      Of the 754 extremely low income Dublin households identified by the 2006-2010 ACS,
       approximately 77 percent spent more than 30 percent of their monthly income on
       housing and 65 percent spent more than 50 percent.

 Notes: Data presented in this table are based on special tabulations from sample Census data. The number of households in
 each category usually deviates slightly from the 100 percent count due to the need to extrapolate sample data out to total
 households. Interpretations of these data should focus on the proportion of households in need of assistance rather than on
 precise numbers.

2. Housing Constraints
Although the City of Dublin strives to ensure the provision of adequate and affordable housing to
meet the needs of the community, many factors can constrain the development, maintenance,
and improvement of housing. These include market mechanisms, government regulations, and
physical as well as environmental constraints. This section addresses these potential
constraints that affect the supply and cost of housing in Dublin.
A. Market Constraints
Several local and regional constraints hinder the ability to accommodate Dublin’s demand for
affordable housing. The high cost of land, rising development costs, and neighborhood
opposition can make it expensive for developers to build affordable housing. These constraints
may result in housing that is not affordable to lower and moderate income households, or may
render some potential residential projects economically infeasible for developers.
Land and Construction Costs
High development costs in the region stifle potential affordable housing developments. An
indicator of construction costs is Building Valuation Data compiled by the International Code
Council (ICC). The unit costs compiled by the ICC include structural, electrical, plumbing, and
mechanical work, in addition to interior finish and normal site preparation. The data is national
and does not take into account regional differences, and does not include the price of the land
upon which the building is built. The national average for development costs per square foot for
apartments and single-family homes in August 2013 are as follows:
        Type I or II, Multi-Family: $131.94 to $150.25 per sq. ft.
        Type V Wood Frame, Multi-Family: $100.18 to $104.74 per sq. ft.
        Type V Wood Frame, One and Two Family Dwelling: $110.29 to $117.71 per sq. ft.
Because of higher land values in the Bay Area, however, overall development costs per square
foot in Dublin may be higher. Furthermore, neighborhood resistance to projects can draw out
the entitlement process and drive up costs. The difficulty of developing awkward infill sites can
also add to the cost of housing.
Reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials (above a minimum acceptability for
health, safety, and adequate performance) could lower costs and associated sales prices or
rents. In addition, prefabricated factory-built housing may provide for lower priced housing by
reducing construction and labor costs. Another factor related to construction costs is the
number of units built at one time. As the number of units increases, overall costs generally
decrease due to economies of scale.
The price of raw land and any necessary improvements is a key component of the total cost of
housing. The diminishing supply of land available for residential construction combined with a
fairly steady demand for housing has served to keep the cost of land high. High and rapidly
increasing land costs have resulted in home builders developing increasingly expensive homes
in order to capture profits. In general, high density residential land in the City costs
approximately $1.7 million per acre, according to a Keyser Marston 2014 analysis. Residential
land for townhomes is estimated at approximately $2.1 million per acre.

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
A density bonus up to 35 percent over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density
under the applicable zoning district is available to developers who provide affordable housing as
part of their projects. Developers of affordable housing are also entitled to at least one
concession or incentive as established in the Zoning Ordinance. Density bonuses, together with
the incentives and/or concessions, result in a lower average cost of land per dwelling unit,
thereby making the provision of affordable housing more feasible. The City regularly updates its
Density Bonus Ordinance to reflect changes in State law.
Availability of Mortgage and Rehabilitation Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. Interest
rates are determined by national policies and economic conditions, and there is little that local
government can do to affect these rates. Jurisdictions can, however, offer interest rate write-
downs to extend home purchasing opportunities to a broader economic segment of the
population. In addition, government-insured loan programs may be available to reduce
mortgage down payment requirements.
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to disclose
information on the disposition of loan applications and the income, gender, and race of loan
applicants.
As shown in Table C-22, a total of 1,726 households applied for loans, either conventional or
government-backed, to purchase homes in Dublin in 2012. Approval rates were higher for
conventional home purchase loans with an approval rate of 78 percent, in comparison to 74
percent of government loan applications being approved. The approval rate for home
improvement loans was 65 percent. Given the high rates of approval for home purchase and
improvement loans, financing was generally available to Dublin residents. Overall, the majority
of loan applications submitted in Dublin during 2012 were for home refinancing (4,142
applications), 76 percent of which were approved.

Foreclosures
Foreclosure may occur when households fall behind on one or more scheduled mortgage
payments. The foreclosure process can be halted if the homeowner is able to bring mortgage
payments current. If payments cannot be resumed or the debt cannot be resolved, the lender
can legally use the foreclosure process to repossess (take over) the home. If the home is worth
                                                 Appendix C-36

                                                                                         City of Dublin
                                                                        Housing Element (2015-2023)
less than the total amount owed on the mortgage loan, a deficiency judgment could, under
some circumstances, be pursued. The homeowner would lose their home and might also owe
the home lender an additional amount.
Homes can be in various stages of foreclosure. Typically, the foreclosure process begins with
the issuance of a Notice of Default (NOD). An NOD serves as an official notification to a
borrower that he or she is behind in their mortgage payments, and if the payments are not paid
up, the lender may take title to the home. In California, lenders will not usually file an NOD until
a borrower is at least 90 days behind in making payments. As of December 2013, 23 properties
in Dublin were in this pre-foreclosure stage.
Once an NOD has been filed, borrowers are given a specific time period, typically three months,
in which they can bring their mortgage payments current. If payments are not made current at
the end of this specified time period, a Notice of Trustee Sale (NTS) will be prepared and
published in a newspaper. An NTS is a formal notification of the sale of a foreclosure property.
In California, the NTS is filed 90 days following an NOD when a property owner has failed to
make a property loan current. Once an NTS has been filed, a property can then be sold at
public auction. According to foreclosure records, 20 properties in Dublin were in the auction
stage of the foreclosure process as of December 2013.
Construction Financing
Prior to the recession of the early 1990s, and significant changes in lending practices following
the savings and loan scandal of the late 1980s, developers could receive loans for 100 percent
or more of a project’s estimated future value. Now, construction and permanent loans are rarely
available for over 75 percent of the future project value for multifamily developments. This
means that developers must usually supply at least 25 percent of the project value.
The financing of a residential project, particularly affordable housing is quite complex. No firm
threshold determines an acceptable ‘return’ on investment, nor the maximum equity contribution
at which an otherwise feasible project becomes infeasible. Upfront cash commitment may not
be problematic for some developers as long as the project can generate an acceptable net cash
flow to meet the acceptable returns. Although financing costs impact project feasibility, these
problems are generally equal across jurisdictions and thus are not a unique constraint to
housing production in Dublin.
B. Governmental Constraints
City ordinances, policies, and other regulations can impact the price and availability of housing
in Dublin. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, building codes, fees, and other
local programs to improve the overall quality of housing may serve as constraints to housing
development. The following public policies can affect overall housing availability, adequacy,
and affordability.
Land Use Controls
The General Plan includes policies for all three of the City’s Planning Areas: the Primary
Planning Area, Eastern Extended Planning Area, and Western Extended Planning Area. The
Primary Planning Area consists of the original 1982 City boundaries and those annexations
occurring to the west between 1985 and 1991. This area encompasses roughly 3,100 acres.

Primary Planning Area
The General Plan Land Use Element and Downtown Dublin Specific Plan establish land use
controls within the Primary Planning Area.
General Plan Land Use Element: The majority of the Primary Planning Area has been
developed since the 1960s; therefore, the Land Use Element of the General Plan focuses on
the remaining uncommitted sites and on the potential for more intensive use of existing sites.

Downtown Dublin Specific Plan: This new Specific Plan was adopted in 2010 and combines the
areas of the previous Downtown Core Specific Plan, Dublin Downtown Specific Plan, San
Ramon Road Specific Plan, Village Parkway Specific Plan, and West Dublin BART Specific
Plan into one comprehensive plan. Downtown Dublin is largely built out, which means that new
development projects will primarily replace (or expand upon) existing developments and land
uses. This Specific Plan allows for the future construction of approximately 1,300 residential
dwelling units as follows:
                          Table C-24: Downtown Dublin Specific Plan
                                District          Density      Dwelling Units

By April 2014, only 291 units were not entitled and developer interest in constructing additional
residential units Downtown exceeded the number of units remaining to be built. As a result, the
City amended the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan on July 15, 2014 to increase residential
development opportunities in the three districts (see also discussions under the Housing
Resources section of this Technical Background Report.)
Eastern Extended Planning Area
The Eastern Extended Planning Area is located east of Dublin’s older urbanized area and
consists of 3,454 acres, of which 1,657 acres is designated for residential uses. Residential
designations for this planning area are outlined in the Eastern Dublin Specific Plan. The Specific

Plan includes seven land use classifications that allow for residential development: High Density
(HDR), Medium‐High Density (MHDR), Medium Density (MDR), Single Family (SF), Estate
Residential (ER), Rural Residential/Agricultural (RRA). Taken together, the Specific Plan
projects a total of 14,619 housing units upon buildout at the following densities:

Western Extended Planning Area
Located along the north side of I-580, west of the City’s older urbanized area, the Western
Extended Planning Area covers approximately 3,255 acres. The Single-Family designation of
the Primary Planning Area and the Rural Residential/Agriculture designation of the Eastern
Extended Planning Area are applicable in the Western Extended Planning Area. An additional
residential designation unique to this planning area is the Estate designation. The Estate
designation is intended for typical ranchettes and estate homes at 0.01 to 0.8 units per gross
acre.
An Urban Limit Line was adopted by initiative on November 7, 2000 for the Western Extended
Planning Area. The Urban Limit Line is located along the City limit line as of the initiative’s
effective date. Pursuant to the initiative, lands west of the Urban Limit Line are designated as
Rural Residential/Agriculture on the General Plan Land Use Map and are within the City’s
Sphere of Influence. Approximately 2,647 acres lies west of the Urban Limit Line and has been
designated Rural Residential/Agriculture. The Initiative is effective for a period of 30 years from
the effective date of City Council Resolution 209-00 (November 7, 2000), and the Line’s location
may be changed only with voter approval during the effective period, and only following review
and approval of a General Plan Amendment by the City Council. Any request to change the
Urban Limit Line must be accompanied by a request to amend the land use designation to an
urban designation. The Urban Limit Line is established to discourage urban sprawl. The City
has adequate capacity within the Urban Limit Line to meet its housing needs and therefore, this
Line does not present an actual constraint to housing development.
Approximately 485 acres lie east of the Urban Limit Line, of which 365 acres are Open Space.
The remainder of the Western Extended Planning Area is comprised of the Schaefer Ranch
residential development which has been approved for up to 406 residential units. The following
table sets forth the development potential of the Western Extended Planning Area.

Livermore Airport Influence Area (AIA)
The Livermore Municipal Airport is owned and operated by the City of Livermore. The Airport is
a General Aviation Airport which serves private, business, and corporate tenants and
customers. The airport is situated on 643 acres of land within the City of Livermore and is
located adjacent to the Las Positas Golf Course and the Water Reclamation Plant.
Parts of eastern Dublin fall within the Livermore Airport Influence Area and projects that propose
to amend the General Plan and/or Eastern Dublin Specific Plan or propose to rezone property
within this area are subject to review by the Alameda County Airport Land Use Commission for
consistency with the Alameda County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP). The
Airport Land Use Commission has 60 days to review and issue a determination on a project.
However, the City Council has the authority to override the Commission’s determination with a
two-thirds vote.
Within the Livermore Airport Influence Area (AIA) is a more restrictive Airport Protection Area
(APA). The APA prohibits the establishment of new residential uses or the intensification of
existing residential uses. The City currently does not have any residential uses within the APA.
The APA could be considered a constraint on housing development in Dublin as it prohibits
residential uses along Dublin Boulevard where the City has historically planned higher density
residential. However, in balancing the housing needs of the community with safety and
exposure to excessive aircraft noise, the prohibition of residential uses within the APA is
reasonable.
Conclusion
The City’s residential land use designations facilitate and encourage the provision of a wide
range of housing types including single-family dwellings, mobile homes, townhomes,
condominiums, second dwelling units, and multi-family units at various densities. Therefore,
Dublin’s land use regulations are not a constraint to residential development.
Residential Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily
through the Zoning Ordinance. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the
health, safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the General
Plan. The following zoning districts allow residential uses:
        Agricultural (A): The A zoning district is intended, in part, to preserve and protect
         agricultural lands that are being used for the commercial production of agricultural
         commodities consistent with the General Plan and applicable Specific Plans and
         appropriate standards of public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics. Agricultural

        housing, mobile homes and single-family homes on large rural lots are permitted in the A
        district.
       Single-Family Residential (R-1): The R-1 district is intended to provide for and protect
        neighborhoods comprised of detached, single-family homes and residential use types
        compatible with a quiet, family-living environment. The district is consistent with the
        Low-Density Single-Family Residential, Single Family-Residential, and Medium Density
        Residential designations of the General Plan depending on the lot square footage per
        dwelling unit of an area. The lot square footage per dwelling unit of an area in the R-1
        district is expressed as a suffix to the R-1 Zoning Map symbol (e.g., R-1-5,000, R-1-
        10,000, etc.).
       Two-Family Residential (R-2): The R-2 district is intended to provide for two-family
        dwellings that have characteristics similar to single-family neighborhoods, duplexes, and
        residential use types compatible with a quiet living environment. The R-2 district is
        consistent with the Medium Density Residential, and Medium-High Density Residential
        designations of the General Plan depending on the lot square footage per dwelling unit
        of an area. The lot square footage per dwelling unit of an area in the R-2 district is
        expressed as a suffix to the R-2 Zoning Map symbol.
       Multi-Family Residential (R-M): The R-M district is intended to provide for and protect
        neighborhoods comprised of single family residences, two family residences, and multi-
        family residences that are clustered to provide generous open space areas for common
        use, and that are generally close to transit, shopping, and public facilities. The R-M
        district is consistent with the Medium Density Residential, Medium-High Density
        Residential, and High-Density Residential designations of the General Plan depending
        on the lot square footage per dwelling unit of an area. The lot square footage per
        dwelling unit of an area in the R-M district is expressed as a suffix to the R-M Zoning
        Map symbol.
Dublin’s Zoning Ordinance establishes residential development standards for each zone to
ensure quality of development in the community (Table C-27). Characteristic standards
applicable to residential development in the City include standards for lot area, lot width and
frontage, lot coverage, setbacks, height limits, and parking. Developers of certain affordable
and senior housing may request a variety of incentives, including concessions, modifications, or
waivers of otherwise applicable development standards set forth in Chapter 8.36 of the Zoning
Ordinance. Reduced setbacks, reduced parking, concentration of affordable units, and reduced
bedroom sizes were granted in 2003 to facilitate the development of 596 affordable housing
units at the Oak Groves and Pine Groves/Cedar Groves projects within The Groves at Dublin
Ranch (formerly known as Fairway Ranch). In 2009, the City approved the Emerald Vista
project (formerly Arroyo Vista) and granted reduced parking requirements for the affordable
units. Additionally, in 2013 the City approved an affordable housing project geared towards
veterans and granted reduced parking requirements as well as relaxed design standards.
For properties within Specific Plan areas, development standards are provided within the
respective Specific Plan. In the Eastern Dublin Specific Plan area, development standards are
further tailored to individual projects through the Planned Development Zoning and site plan
review process. This provides developers with a basic set of development standards and
guidelines as well as flexibility to enhance project feasibility and deviate from traditional

The City’s height limits are set with respect to neighborhood character and allowable densities.
Building height limits in the R-M zone are permitted up to 75-feet for projects with five or more
dwelling units and therefore have not constrained residential development. Additionally,
residential development in Planned Development Zoning Districts around the Dublin/Pleasanton
BART Station is allowed to be constructed with up to five stories of residential uses over
parking, recognizing the advantages of compact transit-oriented development in providing
affordable housing opportunities. Similarly, residential development in the Downtown Dublin
Specific Plan area around the West Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station is allowed to be
constructed with up to eight stories and a maximum building height of 90 feet.
Parking requirements for different types of residential uses in Dublin are summarized in Table
C-28. Dublin’s parking requirements for a prototypical 100-unit multi-family residential
development are comparable to requirements of nearby cities (Table C-29). Additionally, the
City has approved reduced parking standards through the Planned Development Zoning
process for multi-family residential and mixed use developments adjacent to the
Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station; residential uses adjacent to the West Dublin/Pleasanton
BART Station also benefit from reduced parking standards contained in the Downtown Dublin
Specific Plan.

Although the provision of off-street parking can increase the cost of housing, Dublin’s standards
are reasonable as requirements for multi-family developments are less than requirements for
single-family detached dwellings and comparable to or lower than parking requirements of
nearby jurisdictions. Guest space requirements for multi-family developments are also
reasonable because these types of developments do not have private driveways for each unit to
accommodate parking for guests as is required for new single-family homes on lots larger than
4,000 square feet. Nevertheless, because the increased cost of off-street parking can impact
the financing of housing affordability, reduced parking and other incentives, concessions, or
waivers and modifications of development standards are available for affordable projects that
are eligible for a density bonus pursuant to Chapter 8.52 of the Zoning Ordinance. Additionally,
as mentioned previously, the City has granted reduced parking standards for numerous
affordable housing projects including Wicklow Square, The Groves at Dublin Ranch, Emerald
Vista and the veterans housing project in the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan area. Reduced
parking standards are also available for transit-oriented development projects that are proposed
adjacent to both BART stations in the City.
Provision for a Variety of Housing
State Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions identify adequate sites to be made
available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
development of various types of housing for all economic segments of the population. This
includes single-family housing, multi-family housing, mobile homes, agricultural housing,
emergency shelters, and transitional housing, among others. Table C-30 summarizes the
various housing types permitted and conditionally permitted under the Zoning Ordinance.

*”Residential Use Secondary to Commercial Use” is defined as a residence located above the ground floor commercial uses and
is referred to herein as “Mixed Use.”
       Single-Family Residence
       The term “Single-Family Residence” is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as a building designed
       for and/or occupied exclusively by one family. The definition also includes factory-built housing,
       modular housing, manufactured housing, mobile homes, and the rental of bedrooms within a
       single-family dwelling to no more than four borders. Single-family residences are permitted in all
       residential zoning districts.
       Agricultural Housing
       Agricultural housing is defined as dwellings and/or living quarters for farm laborers, or other
       types of dwellings determined to be substantially similar to the above by the Director of
       Community Development. Agricultural Housing shall not be in addition to a Caretaker
       Residence or a Farm Mobile Home. The 2007-2011 found that only 47 Dublin residents (less
       than one percent of the City’s residents) were employed the in agriculture, forestry, fishing and
       hunting, and mining industry. Despite the limited number of agricultural workers in the City,
       Agricultural Housing is permitted in the A district with approval of a Conditional Use Permit
       (CUP) by the Zoning Administrator. Conditions would be similar to those for other similar uses
       in the same zones and would not serve to constrain the development of such facilities. The
       Zoning Administrator must make the following findings established in Section 8.100.060 of the
       Zoning Ordinance prior to approval of a CUP for agricultural housing:
                                                      Appendix C-46

                                                                                       City of Dublin
                                                                         Housing Element (2015-2023)
       The proposed use and related structures is compatible with other land uses,
        transportation and service facilities in the vicinity.
       It will not adversely affect the health or safety of persons residing or working in the
        vicinity, or be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare.
       It will not be injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood.
       There are adequate provisions for public access, water, sanitation, and public utilities
        and services to ensure that the proposed use and related structures would not be
        detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare.
       The subject site is physically suitable for the type, density and intensity of the use and
        related structures being proposed.
       It will not be contrary to the specific intent clauses, development regulations, or
        performance standards established for the zoning district in which it is located.
       It is consistent with the Dublin General Plan and with any applicable Specific Plans.
However, pursuant to the State Employee Housing Act (Section 17000 of the Health and Safety
Code), employee housing for agricultural workers consisting of no more than 36 beds in a group
quarters or 12 units or spaces designed for use by a single family or household is permitted by
right in an agricultural land use designation. Therefore, for properties that permit agricultural
uses by right, a local jurisdiction may not treat employee housing that meets the above criteria
any differently than an agricultural use. Furthermore, any employee housing providing
accommodations for six or fewer employees shall be deemed a single-family structure with a
residential land use designation, according to the Employee Housing Act. Employee housing
for six or fewer persons is permitted where a single-family residence is permitted. No
conditional or special use permit or variance is required. The City requires a CUP for all
agricultural uses. Similarly, employee housing on agriculturally designated land requires the
approval of a CUP.
Second Units
A Second Unit is a residential unit with separate kitchen, sleeping, and bathroom facilities that is
a part of, an extension to, or detached from, a detached single-family residence, and is
subordinate to the principal residence. Second units may be an alternative source of affordable
housing for lower income households and seniors.
California law requires local jurisdictions to adopt ordinances that establish the conditions under
which second dwelling units are permitted (Government Code, Section 65852.2). A jurisdiction
cannot adopt an ordinance that precludes the development of second units unless findings are
made acknowledging that allowing second units may limit the housing opportunities of the
region and result in adverse impacts on public health, safety, and welfare. An amendment to
the State’s second unit law in September 2002 requires local governments to use a ministerial,
rather than discretionary process for approving second units (i.e. second units otherwise
compliant with local zoning standards can be approved without conditions or a public hearing).
                                              Appendix C-47

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
The City adopted a Second Unit Ordinance in 2003 to allow second dwelling units in the R-1
zoning district with a ministerial permit. The Community Development Department will issue a
building permit for a second unit if all building permit submittal requirements are met, and if it
conforms to the specific standards contained in Section 8.80.040 of the Zoning Ordinance,
including but not limited to:
        The lot is occupied by a legal existing, detached single-family unit.
        The total floor area is not less than 275 square feet or more than 1,000 square feet. In
         no case shall a second unit exceed 35 percent of the total floor area of the existing
         single-family residence.
        The second unit shall conform to the development standards of the R-1 district.
        One off-street parking space is required but may be uncovered and in tandem with the
         parking of the principal unit.
        The principal residence and the second unit combined shall not cover more than 60
         percent of the lot.
These development standards are typical and consistent with State law. Since adoption of the
Ordinance in 2003, 89 second units have been constructed. Nearly all of these second units (88
units) were constructed during the last Housing Element planning period. An additional 44
second units are expected to be constructed during the current Housing Element planning
period.
Multi-Family Housing
Multi-Family housing includes duplexes, apartments, condominiums, or townhomes. As of
2013, multi-family housing units constituted approximately 33 percent of Dublin’s housing stock.
The Zoning Ordinance provides for multi-family developments by-right in the R-2 and R-M
zoning districts. The R-2 zoning district is consistent with the Medium Density and Medium-
High Density Residential land use designations of the General Plan which allow for 6.1 – 25.0
dwelling units per acre. The R-M zoning district is consistent with the Medium, Medium-High
and High Density Residential land use designations of the General Plan which allow for 6.1 –
25.0+ dwelling units per acre. The General Plan does not place an upper limit on High Density
Residential land uses. Furthermore, the Eastern Dublin Specific Plan allows for the
development of High Density Residential at 25 units per acre or greater, while the Downtown
Dublin Specific Plan allows for Transit Oriented Development at a density of 85 units per acre.
Mobile Homes and Mobile Home Parks
Mobile homes offer an affordable housing option to many lower and moderate income
households. The City permits mobile homes constructed after September 15, 1971 and issued
an insignia of approval by the California Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD) and permanently located on a permanent foundation system by right in the A, R-1, and
R-2 districts. Mobile Home Parks require approval of a CUP by the Planning Commission within
the R-1 and R-2 zoning districts. Conditions would be similar to those for other similar uses in the
same zones and would not serve to constrain the development of such facilities. The required
findings for approval of a CUP are stated in Section 8.100.060 of the Zoning Ordinance and are
the same as described above for agricultural housing.
Community Care Facilities
Community care facilities are defined as residential facilities that provide 24-hour care for
individuals, including the elderly, persons in an alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment
facility, persons in a facility for mentally disordered, handicapped persons or dependent and
                                             Appendix C-48

                                                                                                City of Dublin
                                                                               Housing Element (2015-2023)
neglected children, persons in an intermediate care facility/developmentally disabled-
habilitative, intermediate care facility/ developmentally disabled-nursing, and congregate living
health facilities. A community care facility may be located in any type of residence.
Consistent with the State Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, small community
care facilities serving six or fewer persons are permitted within all residential zones. Large
community care facilities serving seven or more persons require approval of a Conditional Use
Permit (CUP) by the Planning Commission within the R-1, R-2, R-M, C-1, C-2, M-P, and M-1
zoning districts. Potential conditions for approval may include hours of operation, security,
loading requirements, and management. Conditions would be similar to those for other similar
uses in the same zones and would not serve to constrain the development of such facilities.
The required findings for approval of a CUP are stated in Section 8.100.060 of the Zoning
Ordinance and are the same as described above for agricultural housing. As of January 2013,
a number of community care facilities are operating in the City of Dublin:16
         Six adult residential facilities with a total capacity of 34 beds;
         Two group homes for children with a total capacity of 12 beds; and
         Nine residential care facilities for the elderly with a total capacity of 54 beds.
Transitional Housing
Transitional Housing units or facilities provide a residence for homeless individuals or families
for an extended period of time, usually six months or longer, which also offers other social
services and counseling to assist residents in achieving self-sufficiency. Transitional Housing
may be accessory to a public or civic type use.
The City amended the Zoning Ordinance in 2004, and in 2011, to facilitate and encourage the
provision of transitional housing. Transitional housing that operates as group housing is subject
to the same permitting requirements as community care facilities consistent with the Lanterman
Developmental Disabilities Services Act. Transitional housing that is regular housing is
permitted where similar housing is otherwise permitted. The City will review and revise, as
necessary, the Zoning Ordinance to clarify transitional housing as a residential use and subject
only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
Emergency Shelters
The term “Emergency Shelter” means a housing facility that provides temporary, short-term
housing, with minimal supportive services, for homeless individuals or families, provided that no
facility shall be used as temporary, short-term housing by any individual or family for more than
30 consecutive days. The City amended the Municipal Code to permit emergency shelters in
the M-1 (Light Industrial) Zoning District and similar PD (Planned Development) Zoning Districts,
if the project site has an Industrial Park or Business Park/Industrial General Plan land use
designation. Approximately 67 parcels in the City meet these requirements with a combined
acreage of 180 acres. Many of these properties are located near public transit with access to
various supportive services and are currently developed with aging, distressed, and/or vacant
structures ripe for redevelopment.
Applicable development and performance standards are set forth in Section 8.45 of the
Municipal Code and are as follows:

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
        Off Street Parking: 1 parking space for every 20 beds plus 1 parking space for each
         employee on the largest shift plus 1 parking space for each company vehicle.
        On-Site Management and Security: On-site management and on-site security shall be
         provided during the hours when the Emergency Shelter is in operation.
        External Lighting: The Emergency Shelter shall provide external lighting in accordance
         with building security requirements contained in Chapter 7.32 to maintain a safe and
         secure environment.
        Emergency Shelter Management Plan: The operator of an Emergency Shelter shall
         prepare and submit a management plan to the Community Development Director.
        Length of Stay: No individual or family shall reside in an Emergency Shelter for more
         than 30 consecutive days.
        Proximity to Public Transit and Services: An Emergency Shelter shall be located near
         public transportation, supportive services and/or commercial services to meet the daily
         needs of shelter residents. If necessary, an Emergency Shelter shall ensure a means of
         transportation for shelter residents to travel to and from related supportive services
         provided off-site.
        Noise/Nuisances: All activities associated with an Emergency Shelter shall be
         conducted entirely within the building. Noise shall be limited so as not to create an
         adverse impact on surrounding uses. No loudspeakers or amplified sound shall be
         placed or project outside of the shelter.
        City, County and State Requirements: An Emergency Shelter shall obtain and
         maintain in good standing all required licenses, permits, and approvals from City, County
         and State agencies or departments. An Emergency Shelter shall comply with all County
         and State health and safety requirements for food, medical and other supportive
         services provided on-site.
The City’s off street parking requirement for emergency shelters is less restrictive than the
parking requirements for other uses in the same districts. For example, a 10,000 square foot
light industrial building that has 2,000 square feet of office space and 8,000 square feet of
warehouse, distribution or production space would require 16 parking spaces. A 100-bed
emergency shelter in the same building would require 5 parking spaces plus 1 parking space for
each employee and company vehicle, if applicable.
State law (SB 2 – Housing for the Homeless) specifies standards that can be regulated by the
local ordinance. The City’s zoning provisions for emergency shelters include proximity to public
transit or noise provisions, which are not specified in SB 2. The only distance requirement
permissible under SB 2 is the 300-foot distance from another emergency shelter. SB 2 allows
the regulating of other standards only if other uses in the same zone are subject to the same
standards. The City will review and revise as necessary the proximity to public transit and noise
provisions of the Emergency Shelters Ordinance to comply with State law.
Mixed Use
Residential uses located above the ground floor of a commercial use are conditionally permitted
in the R-1 and C-1 zoning districts and require approval of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) by
the Planning Commission. The City has had much success in promoting and attracting new
mixed use development throughout the City, particularly in recent years. These mixed-use
projects include:

                                                                                         City of Dublin
                                                                        Housing Element (2015-2023)
       AMB/Prologis: 308 multi-family apartment units and 150,000 square feet of office space
        adjacent to the West Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station
       Tralee Village: 233 multi-family units include 130 apartment units over 33,500 square
        feet of ground floor commercial and 103 townhouse units
       Eclipse at Dublin Station: formerly Avalon at Dublin Station, 305 multi-family apartment
        units over 15,000 square feet of ground floor commercial
       Essex/Connolly Station: 309 multi-family apartment units adjacent to the West
        Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station; future phases include 150-room hotel and 7,500
        square feet of commercial
       Crown Chevy Redevelopment Site: 314 multi-family apartment units over 17,000 square
        feet of ground floor commercial and 72 affordable rental units for veterans
Single Room Occupancy Units (SROs)
SRO units are one-room units intended for occupancy by a single individual. It is distinct from a
studio or efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-room unit that must contain a kitchen and
bathroom. Although SRO units are not required to have a kitchen or bathroom, many SROs
have one or the other. In April 2011, the Dublin Municipal Code was amended to conditionally
permit SROs in the C-2 district, or comparable PD Zoning District, as long as the following
development standards and regulations are met:
       All required findings in Chapter 8.100 (Conditional Use Permit) can be made.
       Common bathroom facilities are provided on-site if individual units do not contain a
        bathroom.
       Common kitchen facilities are provided on-site if individual units do not contain a kitchen.
       Individual Single Room Occupancy Units may contain either kitchen or bathroom
        facilities, but shall not contain both.
       Off-street parking is provided in accordance with Chapter 8.76 (Off-Street Parking and
        Loading Regulations).
       All new construction or conversion of existing structures complies with Chapter 8.104
        (Site Development Review).
       All other applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance are met.
Supportive Housing
California Government Code Section 65582 (f) defines “supportive housing” as housing with no
limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population, and that is linked to an onsite or
offsite service that assists the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving
his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the
community. Government Code Section 65582 (g) further defines “target population” as persons
with low incomes who have one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS,
substance abuse, or other chronic health condition, or individuals eligible for services provided
pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing
with Section 4500) of the Welfare and Institutions Code) and may include, among other
populations, adults, emancipated minors, families with children, elderly persons, young adults
aging out of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans, and
homeless people.
The City amended the Zoning Ordinance in 2011 to facilitate and encourage the provision of
supportive housing. Supportive housing that operates as group housing is subject to the same
permitting requirements as community care facilities consistent with the Lanterman
Developmental Disabilities Services Act. Supportive housing that is regular housing is permitted
                                              Appendix C-51

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
where similar housing is otherwise permitted. The City will review and revise, as necessary, the
Zoning Ordinance to clarify supportive housing as a residential use and subject only to those
restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
Site Improvements, Exactions, and Development Fees
Site Improvements
For large subdivisions, the City requires the construction of reasonable on- and off-site
improvements pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act. The minimum improvements required of
the developer include:
        Grading and improvement of public and private streets including surfacing, curbs,
         gutters, cross gutters, sidewalks, ornamental street lighting, street name signs and
         necessary barricades and safety devices;
        Storm drainage and flood control facilities within and outside of when necessary the
         subdivision sufficient to carry storm runoff both tributary to and originating within the
         subdivision;
        Debris basins and erosion and siltation control measures to control erosion and siltation;
        A sewage system that meets public sewer system standards;
        A water distribution system providing an adequate supply of potable water to each lot
         and fire hydrant within the subdivision;
        Fire hydrants and connections shall be of the type and at locations specified by the fire
         marshal; and
        Public utility distribution facilities including gas, electric, telephone and cable television
         necessary to serve each lot in the subdivision.
The City also requires dedication of land intended for public use. Dedicated streets, easements,
rights-of-way, etc., must be designed, developed, and improved according to City of Dublin
Public Works standards. Street design criteria are summarized in Table C-31.

                                                                       Housing Element (2015-2023)
Residential development projects with more than 20 residential units must comply with the City’s
Public Art Program pursuant to Chapter 8.58 of the Zoning Ordinance. Under the Program,
developers are required to acquire and install a public art project on or in the vicinity of the
development site, or make a monetary contribution in-lieu. The value of the public art project or in-
lieu monetary contribution shall equal or exceed 0.5 percent of the development project’s building
valuation (excluding land). The purpose of the City’s Public Art Program is, in part, to promote the
public interest and general welfare through the acquisition and installation of public art works.
Participation in the program by residential projects with more than 20 units is not an undue
constraint on housing development in the City because: 1) the requirement applies to single-family
homes, townhomes, condominiums, and apartments alike; and 2) housing projects that set-aside
100 percent of units for lower income households are exempt from the public art requirement.
The City often requires dedication of bicycle paths for the use and safety of residents of large
residential subdivisions. Schools, fire stations, libraries, or other public facilities may also be
required. Park dedication or fee in-lieu of dedication required according to the standard of five
acres per one thousand persons, consistent with the Quimby Act. This ratio amounts to 740.5
square feet per single-family unit, 675.2 square feet per multi-family unit, and 370.3 square feet
per mobile home unit proposed. Specific standards for design and improvements of
subdivisions must be in accordance with the applicable sections of the Zoning Ordinance, the
General Plan, the Subdivision Ordinance, any specific plans adopted by the City, and
requirements established by the City Engineer. Improvement and dedication requirements are
important to maintaining the quality of life in Dublin and to ensuring public health and safety.
These standards are typical in the region.
Development Fees and Exactions
In addition to improvements and dedication of public land, land developers are subject to a variety of
fees and exactions to cover the cost of processing permits and providing necessary services and
facilities. In general, these fees can be a constraint on housing development and compromise
project feasibility because the additional cost borne by developers contributes to overall increased
housing unit cost. However, the fees are necessary to maintain adequate planning services and
other public services and facilities in the City. The City’s Planning Division fee schedule is
summarized in Table C-32 and current development impact fees are provided in Table C-33.
Reduced, waived, or reimbursed fees are possible incentives that can be requested under the
City’s Density Bonus Ordinance. The City has demonstrated a commitment to providing
concessions that facilitate the construction of affordable housing by waiving future commercial
linkage fees on commercially-zoned property within the Dublin Ranch community as an
incentive for a developer to provide additional affordable units as part of the Oak Groves and
Pine Groves/Cedar Groves apartment communities. A total of 626 rental units have been
constructed within the Oak Groves and Pine Groves/Cedar Groves communities of which 535
units are affordable to very low, low and moderate income households, for both families and
seniors.

Total fees average about $68,418 per single-family unit and about $41,398 per multi-family unit.
Based on the median asking prices of homes summarized in Table C-17, total fees comprise
approximately ten percent of sales costs for single-family and multi-family units. These figures
include school, water, and sewer fees that are imposed by outside agencies over which the City
has no control. The City’s Public Facilities fee includes park land and improvement fees (which
make up the bulk of the total Public Facilities Fee), as well as additional fees for community
buildings, libraries and the Civic Center. To provide flexibility in meeting these parks and
recreation requirements, the City allows developers to dedicate or reserve lands, pay fees in
lieu thereof, or a combination of both, for neighborhood and community park or recreational
purposes. The City complies with the Quimby Act with regard to parks and open space fees.

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
Other significant impact fees (such as water and sewer connection fees and regional
transportation improvement fees) are set by regional agencies/service providers.
Furthermore, land in the City is fairly expensive. According to a Keyser Marston 2014 analysis,
the cost of high density residential land in Dublin is estimated at approximately $1.7 million per
acre. Residential land for townhomes is estimated to be over $2 million per acre. Given the high
land cost and construction costs, planning and development fees for residential development in
Dublin constitute less than ten percent of the overall development costs. Fees are not
considered a constraint to housing development in Dublin.
Nevertheless, the City recognizes the impact of fees on affordable housing development.
Therefore, the City offers deferment or amortization of fees for senior housing and housing for
lower income households. In addition to deferment or amortization of fees, and as noted above,
the City has demonstrated a commitment to providing concessions that facilitate the
construction of affordable housing by waiving commercial linkage fees on commercially-zoned
property within the Dublin Ranch community in order to facilitate the development of affordable
housing within the Oak Groves and Pine Groves/Cedar Groves apartment communities
Inclusionary Housing
The City adopted an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance in 2002. Under the Regulations, all new
residential development projects of 20 units or more designed and intended for permanent
occupancy must construct 12.5 percent of the total number of dwelling units within the
development as affordable units. Of the affordable rental units, 30 percent must be set aside for
very low income households, 20 percent for low income households, and 50 percent for
moderate income households; of the owner occupied affordable units, 40 percent must be set
aside for low income households and 60 percent for moderate income households. (The City
amended the Ordinance in December 2008 to remove the requirement of very low income units
for for-sale housing to recognize that requirement’s cost impact on feasibility.) The City will
continue to work with stakeholders to review and consider modifications to the Inclusionary
Zoning Regulations to enhance their feasibility.
The Ordinance provides for five exceptions to the 12.5 percent affordability requirement
(Section 8.68.040):
        Payment of in-lieu fees;
        Off-site projects;
        Land dedication;
        Credit transfers; and
        Waiver of requirements.
Pursuant to the Ordinance, developers can pay as an in-lieu fee up to five percent of the
inclusionary housing requirement, with the remaining 7.5 percent of the requirement as must-
build units. Any request for payment of in-lieu fee above the five percent requires City Council
approval. The amount of in-lieu fee is adjusted annually based on real estate indicators.
Therefore, the fee is sensitive to the fluctuation in market conditions. Currently, the in-lieu fee is
set at $96,000 per affordable unit required. The fee has remained fairly level during the last two
years.

The last exception, waiver of requirements, gives the City Council flexibility to make exceptions
to the Ordinance. Also, Section 8.68.070 provides incentives to make the construction of
affordable units more feasible, including:
       Fee Deferral – processing and impact fees
       Design Modifications –
        - Reduced lot size
        - Reduced setback requirements
        - Reduced open space requirements
        - Reduced landscaping requirements
        - Reduced interior or exterior amenities
        - Reduction in parking requirements
        - Height restriction waivers
For example, the Positano project is a single-family detached residential product that is subject
to the Inclusionary Ordinance. In order to assist the developer in making the provision of
affordable housing more feasible, the City Council granted the developer’s request that a portion
of the affordable units be provided off-site or through the payment of in-lieu fees. The City has
also granted the developer’s request to provide affordable housing in the form of second
dwelling units.
Since adoption of the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance in 2002, the City has approved more than
8,000 housing units by private developers. Given the flexibility and incentives offered by the
City’s Inclusionary Housing program, and as demonstrated by the significant housing
development entitled after the adoption of the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, the City’s
affordable housing requirements are not constraining residential development. Furthermore, the
City’s High Density Residential zone offers a density of over 25 units per acre. Since there is no
established maximum density and the City offers flexibility through its PD process, a project can
be tailored to ensure feasibility.
Development Permit Procedures
Development review and permit procedures are necessary steps to ensure that residential
construction proceeds in an orderly manner. The following discussion outlines the level of
review required for various permits and timelines associated with those reviews. The timelines
provided are estimates; actual processing time may vary due to the volume of applications and
the size and complexity of the projects.
Single-Family
All new single family dwellings are subject to Site Development Review approval by either the
Director of Community Development or the Planning Commission. The Building and Safety
Division of the Community Development Department also reviews building permit applications
for conformity to adopted building codes. Approval of a building permit for a single-family
dwelling is ministerial and processing time is highly dependent on the quality of the initial
submittal.
Multi-Family Housing
All multi-family housing projects are subject to Site Development Review by the Planning
Commission. If the multi-family housing is proposed as a condominium, the approval process
also includes a subdivision map. The tentative subdivision map and Site Development Review
                                           Appendix C-57

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
are processed concurrently. The application procedure is established in Chapter 8.104 of the
Zoning Ordinance. The purpose of the review is to:
    A. To preserve the architectural character and scale of neighborhoods and the community.
    B. To ensure that development is well designed in relation to surrounding properties,
         including that the design, character, height, façade length, roof forms, colors, materials,
         roof mounted equipment and architectural details of a proposed structure or remodeled
         structure are compatible with the design, character, height, façade length, roof form,
         colors, materials and architectural details of structures in the vicinity.
    C. To ensure that projects enhance their sites and are harmonious with high standards of
         improvements in the surrounding area.
    D. To enhance the residential and business property values within the City.
    E. To ensure compliance with development regulations and the requirements of zoning
         districts, including but not limited to, setbacks, height, parking, landscaping, public art,
         fences, accessory structures and signage.
    F. To ensure that each project is designed to comply with the intent and purpose of the
         zoning district in which it is located and with the General Plan and applicable Specific
         Plan.
    G. To promote the health, safety and general welfare.
    H. To ensure that projects provide adequate circulation for automobiles as well as
         pedestrians and bicyclists to create a pedestrian friendly environment.
The following findings must be made prior to the approval of a Site Development Review
application:
    A. The proposal is consistent with the purposes of this Chapter, with the General Plan and
         with any applicable Specific Plans and design guidelines.
    B. The proposal is consistent with the provisions of Title 8, Zoning Ordinance.
    C. The design of the project is appropriate to the City, the vicinity, surrounding properties
         and the lot in which the project is proposed.
    D. The subject site is physically suitable for the type and intensity of the approved
         development.
    E. Impacts to existing slopes and topographic features are addressed.
    F. Architectural considerations including the character, scale and quality of the design, site
         layout, the architectural relationship with the site and other buildings, screening of
         unsightly uses, lighting, building materials and colors and similar elements result in a
         project that is harmonious with its surroundings and compatible with other development
         in the vicinity.
                                             Appendix C-58

                                                                                      City of Dublin
                                                                        Housing Element (2015-2023)
    G. Landscape considerations, including the location, type, size, color, texture and coverage
        of plant materials, and similar elements have been incorporated into the project to
        ensure visual relief, adequate screening and an attractive environment for the public.
    H. The site has been adequately designed to ensure proper circulation for bicyclists,
        pedestrians and automobiles.
As the Site Development Review is required for residential and non-residential uses alike and
the findings are the same for all uses subject to the requirement, the Site Development Review
process is not a constraint on the provision of multi-family housing in Dublin.
Processing Timeframes
Processing time frames for single-family and multi-family subdivisions vary depending on a
number of factors, including size, location, environmental constraints, and developer
responsiveness. Much of the newer residential development (single-family and multi-family) is
located within the Eastern Dublin Specific Plan Area and is governed by the Eastern Dublin
Specific Plan and associated Environmental Impact Report. The Specific Plan establishes land
use designations for all property within the Specific Plan area and contains development
standards such as dwelling units per acre and floor area ratio. The Specific Plan also includes
design guidelines and resource management. These standards and guidelines coupled with the
Planned Development Zoning process provide the developer with a framework for development
as well as flexibility to design a project without being limited by traditional setbacks and lot
coverage restrictions. Planned Development Zoning is processed concurrently with site plan
review and therefore does not increase the processing timeline. Additionally, the certification of
an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Specific Plan area reduces the processing
timelines for development projects that are consistent with the Specific Plan. For example, all of
the high-density residential projects at the Dublin Transit Center as well as the Dublin Ranch
communities of Oak Groves and Pine Groves/Cedar Groves were deemed categorically exempt
from further environmental review because they were consistent with the Specific Plan. The
one factor that contributes to increased processing timelines is the lack of responsiveness by
developers to public agency comments. This lack of response often results in additional review
time that increases the processing timeline and costs associated with the project. However,
since adoption of the Eastern Dublin Specific Plan and Planned Development Zoning in 1994
the City has been able to work successfully with the development community resulting in the
approval of over 13,000 residential units.
Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Dublin currently uses the following Codes: 2012 Edition of the International Building
Code (2013 CA Building Code); 2012 Edition of the International Fire Code (2013 CA Fire
Code); 2012 Edition of the Uniform Mechanical Code (2013 CA Mechanical Code); 2012 Edition
of the Uniform Plumbing Code (2013 CA Plumbing Code); 2012 Edition of the National Electrical
Code (2013 CA Electrical Code); and 1997 Uniform Housing Code.
The Planning and Building Divisions of the Community Development Department carry out code
enforcement and inspection activities as a means to preserve and maintain the livability and
quality of neighborhoods. City staff investigates violations of property maintenance standards
as defined in the Municipal Code as well as other complaints. When violations are identified or
cited, staff encourages property owners to seek assistance through available housing
rehabilitation programs. Although current building codes may be a barrier to the rehabilitation of
                                           Appendix C-59
City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
older properties that are required to be brought up to current code standards, the intent of the
codes is to provide structurally sound, safe, and energy-efficient housing.
The City of Dublin proactively enforces property maintenance, graffiti and substandard housing
ordinances throughout the City. Between 2007 and 2012, Code Enforcement officials
documented 3,104 residential code violations. When code violations are unable to be resolved
through voluntary compliance or through the nuisance abatement procedure, the City refers
such cases to the City Attorney for prosecution. The City Attorney's office may seek injunctions,
receivership and civil lawsuits to achieve compliance with City codes. Since 2007, no
residential building-related cases were referred to the City Attorney's office. The City will
continue to enforce property maintenance standards and abate substandard structures through
Code Enforcement.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Both the federal Fair Housing Amendment Act (FHAA) and the California Fair Employment and
Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e. modifications
or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such accommodations
may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
The City assessed its zoning ordinance, permitting procedures, development standards, and
building codes to identify potential constraints for housing for persons with disabilities. The
City’s policies and regulations regarding housing for persons with disabilities are described
below.
Zoning and Land Use
Under State Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (aka Lanterman Act), small
community care facilities for six or fewer persons must be treated as regular residential uses
and be permitted by right in all residential districts; Dublin is compliant with the Lanterman Act.
Large community care facilities for more than six persons are conditionally permitted within the
R-1, R-2, R-M, C-1, C-2, M-P, and M-1 zoning districts. Potential conditions for approval may
include hours of operation, security, loading requirements, and management. Conditions would be
similar to those for other similar uses in the same zones and would not serve to unduly constrain
the development of residential care facilities for more than six persons. The City has not adopted a
spacing requirement for community care facilities.
The Land Use Element and Zoning Ordinance provide for the development of multi-family
housing in the R-2 and R-M zoning districts. Regular multi-family housing for persons with
special needs, such as apartments for seniors and the disabled are considered regular
residential uses permitted by right in these zones. The Zoning Ordinance has a provision to
allow exceptions to development standards for accessory structures (Section 8.40.020.F.2.a).
Similarly, the Development Regulations section of the Zoning Ordinance has provisions that
allow for encroachments into required setbacks (Section 8.36.050.B.2 & 3).                    These
exceptions/encroachments are allowed citywide and could accommodate a wide range of needs
for persons with disabilities.
However, circumstances may arise when it would be reasonable to accommodate requests from
persons with disabilities to waive a setback requirement or another standard of the Zoning
Ordinance to ensure that homes are accessible for the mobility impaired. Whether a particular
modification is reasonable depends on the circumstances, and must be decided on a case-by-
case basis. In April 2011, the City adopted a formal ministerial process for persons with
                                             Appendix C-60

                                                                                          City of Dublin
                                                                            Housing Element (2015-2023)
disabilities to seek relief from the strict or literal application of development standards to enable
them to enjoy their dwellings like other residents in Dublin.
The City has not established any special distance requirements for the housing for persons with
disabilities. Therefore, the State distance standard of 300 feet applies. In order to facilitate
housing for persons with disabilities, the City offers fee deferment or amortization for senior
housing (which often includes accessible units and is occupied by many seniors with
disabilities.)
Building Codes
The City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations that regulates the access and
adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities. In 2007, the City adopted a
Universal Design Ordinance that requires new single-family home developers to install base
Universal Design features in all single-family developments of 20 or more homes. The
Universal Design Ordinance is substantially the same as the Model Universal Design Local
Ordinance adopted by the California Department of Housing and Community Development. The
City developed a brochure on the Universal Design Ordinance after its adoption in December
2007 and has updated it periodically to ensure that current information regarding the Ordinance
is distributed. The brochure and other related information regarding the Ordinance has been
posted to the City’s website and is also available at the public counter. In 2010, there was an
update to the Ordinance to meet the current building code and which took effect January 1,
2011. The City will continue to enforce the provisions of this ordinance.
Government Code Section 12955.1 requires that 10 percent of the total dwelling units in multi-
family buildings without elevators consisting of three or more rental units or four or more
condominium units be subject to the following building standards for persons with disabilities:
        The primary entry to the dwelling unit shall be on an accessible route unless exempted
         by site impracticality tests.
        At least one powder room or bathroom shall be located on the primary entry level served
         by an accessible route.
        All rooms or spaces located on the primary entry level shall be served by an accessible
         route. Rooms and spaces located on the primary entry level and subject to this chapter
         may include but are not limited to kitchens, powder rooms, bathrooms, living rooms,
         bedrooms, or hallways.
        Common use areas shall be accessible.
        If common tenant parking is provided, accessible parking spaces is required.
No unique Building Code restrictions are in place that would constrain the development of
housing for persons with disabilities. Compliance with provisions of the City’s Municipal Code,
California Code of Regulations, California Building Standards Code, and federal Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) is assessed and enforced by the Building and Safety Division of the
Community Development Department as a part of the building permit submittal.
Definition of Family
Local governments may restrict access to housing for households failing to qualify as a “family”
by the definition specified in the Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, a restrictive definition of
“family” that limits the number of and differentiates between related and unrelated individuals
                                              Appendix C-61

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
living together may impermissibly limit the development and siting of group homes for persons
with disabilities but not for housing families that are similarly sized or situated.18
In April 2011, the City of Dublin amended its definition of “family.” The Zoning Ordinance now
defines a “family” as one or more persons occupying a dwelling and living as a single, non-profit
housekeeping unit, including any servants. This is distinguished from a group occupying a
boarding house, community care facility, supportive or transitional housing when configured as
group housing, hotel or motel, club, fraternity or sorority house.
Conclusion
After the extensive Zoning Ordinance revisions completed in 2011, there are no longer any City
policies or regulations that serve to constrain housing for persons with disabilities. However, the
City will continue to monitor the Zoning Ordinance for potential constraints and make
amendments as needed.
C. Public Policy Constraints
State and Federal requirements may act as a barrier to the development or rehabilitation of
housing, and affordable housing in particular.                        These include State prevailing wage
requirements, Article 34 of the State Constitution and environmental review requirements.
State Prevailing Wage Requirements
The State Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) expanded the kinds of projects that require
the payment of prevailing wages. Labor Code Section 1720, which applies prevailing wage
rates to public works of over $1,000, now defines public works to mean construction, alteration,
installation, demolition, or repair work done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of
public funds. For example, public transfer of an asset for less than fair market value, such as a
land write-down, would now be construed to be paid for, in part, out of public funds and trigger
prevailing wage requirements.
While the cost differential in prevailing and standard wages varies based on the skill level of the
occupation, prevailing wages tend to add to the overall cost of development. In the case of
affordable housing projects, prevailing wage requirements could effectively reduce the number
of affordable units that can be achieved with public subsidies. The following types of projects
are exempt from the prevailing wage requirement:
         Residential projects financed through issuance of bonds that receive an allocation
          through the State; or
         Single-family projects financed through issuance of qualified mortgage revenue bonds or
          mortgage credit certificates.
18
     California court cases (City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson, 1980 and City of Chula Vista v. Pagard, 1981, etc.)
     have ruled an ordinance as invalid if it defines a “family” as (a) an individual; (b) two or more persons related by
     blood, marriage, or adoption; or (c) a group of not more than a specific number of unrelated persons as a single
     housekeeping unit. These cases have explained that defining a family in a manner that distinguishes between
     blood-related and non-blood related individuals does not serve any legitimate or useful objective or purpose
     recognized under the zoning and land use planning powers of a municipality, and therefore violates rights of
     privacy under the California Constitution.
                                                     Appendix C-62

                                                                                        City of Dublin
                                                                        Housing Element (2015-2023)
Article 34 of the California Constitution
Article 34 of the State Constitution requires a majority vote of the electorate to approve the
development, construction, or acquisition by a public body of any “low rent housing project”
within that jurisdiction. In other words, for any projects to be built and/or operated by a public
agency where at least 50 percent of the occupants are low income and rents are restricted to
affordable levels, the jurisdiction must seek voter approval known as “Article 34 authority” to
authorize that number of units.
Dublin has not sought voter approval to grant “Article 34 authority.” In the past, Article 34 may
have prevented certain projects from being built. In practice, most public agencies have learned
how to structure projects to avoid triggering Article 34, such as limiting public assistance to 49
percent of the units in the project. Furthermore, the State legislature has enacted Sections
37001, 37001.3, and 37001.5 of the Health and Safety Code to clarify ambiguities relating to the
scope of the applicability of Article 34. Although Dublin does not have Article 34 authority, the
City does not view this as a significant constraint to the development of affordable housing since
the City does not typically function as a developer.
Environmental Protection
State and federal regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary projects
(e.g., subdivision maps, development review permits, etc.).             Costs resulting from the
environmental review process are also added to the cost of housing and are passed on to the
consumer to the extent that the market can bear. These costs include fees charged by local
government and private consultants needed to complete the environmental analysis, and from
delays caused by the mandated public review periods. However, the presence of these
regulations helps preserve the environment and ensure environmental safety to Dublin
residents.
D. Utility and Public Service Constraints
The provision of utilities such as water and sewer as well as public services including police,
fire, and schools is costly to local governments and special districts providing municipal
services. New development must pay for much of these costs thereby increasing the overall
cost of housing. This section provides an overview of potential utility and public service
constraints in Dublin.
Water Supply and Distribution
Dublin's water is distributed by Dublin San Ramon Services District (DSRSD), which purchases
water from Zone 7 of the Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District,
which, in turn, imports it from three sources: State water project, local runoff from the Arroyo Del
Valle watershed (stored in Lake Del Valle) and from natural recharge of the groundwater basin.
A recent United States District Court decision mandated a 35 percent reduction in pumping from
the Sacramento Delta to protect the endangered Delta Smelt. As a result of this mandated
reduction, alternative measures to conserve existing and secure additional water supply will be
necessary. The largest categorical consumer of water is residential users, and more specifically,
single-family residential users. Although the total water demand over the past 10 years has
increased for the single-family residential category, the total number of single-family households
                                           Appendix C-63

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
has increased at a greater rate than the total water demand rate. Therefore, the average annual
consumption of a single family household has decreased from 140,700 gallons per year in 2002
to 117,200 gallons per year in 2012, according to the DSRSD. This 16-percent decrease in the
average household consumption is due to many factors, including a greater use of water
efficient features, installation of more water-efficient landscapes, and greater public education
regarding the importance of water conservation.
DSRSD has a comprehensive Water Conservation Program in place that includes both supply-
and demand-side measures, including audits, incentives, optimal management practices,
enforcing wastewater and landscape regulations, education programs, support activities,
metering, and pipe replacement. The City of Dublin also currently utilizes several means to
promote water conservation and efficiency in new development:
        Implementation of Chapter 8.88 of the Municipal Code (Water Efficient Landscape
         Regulations) which requires that development projects of a certain size and scope be
         designed with landscape materials and maintenance that is sensitive to reducing water
         use. Chapter 8.88 conforms to the state mandate to either have a local Water Efficient
         Landscape Ordinance or require that new projects conform to the statewide Water
         Efficient Landscape requirements.
        Implementation of Chapter 7.94 of the Municipal Code (Dublin Green Building Code),
         with the purpose of enhancing the design and construction of buildings and encouraging
         sustainable construction practices in several categories including water efficiency and
         conservation.
        Participation and collaboration with outside organizations and agencies on programs to
         educate the public and provide hands-on assistance to increase water conservation
         efforts.
Senate Bill 1087 (enacted 2006) requires that water providers develop written policies that grant
priority to proposed development that includes housing affordable to lower-income households.
The legislation also prohibits water providers from denying or conditioning the approval of
development that includes housing affordable to lower income households, unless specific
written findings are made. The City will provide a copy of the adopted 2015-2023 Housing
Element to DSRSD within 30 days of adoption. The City will also continue to coordinate with
the DSRSD to ensure affordable housing developments receive priority water service provision.
Sewage Collection and Treatment
The Dublin San Ramon Services District (DSRSD) is the purveyor of wastewater collection and
treatment services in the City of Dublin. The wastewater collection system includes over 170
miles of sanitary sewers ranging from six to forty-two inches in diameter that are from five to
over forty years old. Disposal of treated wastewater is under the jurisdiction of the Livermore-
Amador Valley Water Management Authority (LAVWMA). Wastewater collected from the
DSRSD service area travels by gravity to the DSRSD wastewater treatment plant which is
located in the City of Pleasanton. The plant has a rated dry-weather capacity of 17.0 million
gallons per day (mgd). Disposal of treated effluent from the treatment plant in Pleasanton is
provided by the Livermore-Amador Valley Water Management Agency (LAVWMA) who exports
secondary treated wastewater to the East Bay Dischargers Authority interceptor pipeline for
ultimate discharge to the San Francisco Bay via a deep-water outfall. LAVWMA facilities are
designed to export a maximum flow of 41.2 mgd during wet weather events.

                                                                                        City of Dublin
                                                                        Housing Element (2015-2023)
Senate Bill 1087 described above also mandates priority sewage collection and treatment
service to housing developments providing units affordable to lower income households. The
City will continue to coordinate with DSRSD to ensure priority service provision to affordable
housing developments.
Fire Protection
The Alameda County Fire Department (ACFD) serves as the fire department for the City of
Dublin and provides all fire prevention, fire protection and First Responder Emergency Medical
Services, including advanced life support (paramedics), within the City. The ACFD has
identified the need to modernize its fleet and make staffing adjustments to adequately serve
future development while maintaining current service levels to existing development.
Schools
The Dublin Unified School District (DUSD) provides public education in the City of Dublin.
DUSD currently operates elementary, middle and high schools in the Primary and Eastern
Extended Planning Areas. At build-out of the General Plan, which is expected to occur in 2035,
DUSD estimates a student enrollment of 9,755 students.
E. Environmental Constraints
A community’s environmental setting affects the feasibility and cost of developing housing.
Environmental issues range from the conservation of biological resources to the suitability of
land for development due to potential exposure to seismic, flooding, wildfire and other hazards.
This section summarizes these potential constraints in Dublin. (Refer to the Conservation
Element, Seismic Safety and Safety Element, and the Schools, Public Lands, and Utilities
Element of the General Plan for more detailed analyses and mitigating policies that address
environmental issues or hazards within the Dublin planning area.)
Biological Resources
Dublin’s Primary and Eastern Extended Planning Areas are located within Livermore Drainage
Unit which is one of two major drainage basins in the Alameda Creek Watershed. Of the many
streams in the Livermore Drainage Unit, two flow through Dublin’s Primary and Eastern
Extended Planning Areas – Alamo Creek and Tassajara Creek, respectively. Portions of these
creeks have been channelized and remaining sections are being improved as a result of
subdivision developments. The Western Extended Planning Area lies within the San Lorenzo
Creek Watershed and includes the Palomares Creek and Dublin Creek sub-watersheds.
Several significant streams traverse the Western Extended Planning Area including Hollis
Canyon and Martin Canyon Creeks in the western hills. Extensive areas of riparian vegetation
are located along stream courses in the Western Extended Planning Area. This riparian
woodland has importance to wildlife in the area. Considerable damage to riparian areas has
resulted from intensive grazing.
Oak woodland is another sensitive habitat community located in Dublin. Most of the oak
woodland that can be found in Dublin is concentrated in the Western Extended Planning Area.
In addition to California live oaks, other species such as bay, laurel and California buckeye are a
vital part of this plant community. The City emphasizes preservation of oak woodland in the
Western Extended Planning Area. Development should be clustered in grassland areas
                                            Appendix C-65

City of Dublin
Housing Element (2015-2023)
wherever possible to protect existing trees. However, as part of comprehensive planning for
development in this area, some oak woodland may need to be removed. Removal of oaks is
allowed only after all feasible site planning efforts have been made to preserve trees.
Heritage Tree Preservation
Heritage trees, defined as any oak, bay, cypress, maple, redwood, buckeye, and sycamore tree
having a trunk or main stem of 24 inches or more in diameter or any other tree required to be
preserved as part of a discretionary entitlement, are protected by City ordinance. Removal of
heritage trees requires a permit upon finding that the tree presents a public safety risk, removal
is necessary for reasonable development of property, does not increase erosion or stream water
flow potential, or would not otherwise affect neighborhood aesthetics.
Seismic Hazards
The Calaveras Fault is the major active fault in the planning area with rupture potential and runs
parallel to and just west of San Ramon Road. The Pleasanton Fault, located near the west edge
of Camp Parks, is difficult to locate precisely. The State has established Alquist-Priolo Special
Studies Zones along both faults, requiring detailed studies of rupture hazards prior to
construction. Few potential building sites within the City of Dublin or the extended planning area
are without geologic impact or hazard. The hazard may be actual, such as an active landslide
or proximity to an active fault, or potential, such as a proposed cut that might activate a
landslide. Mitigation of hazards may increase construction cost, but will reduce long-term costs
to both property owners and the City.
Fire Hazards
Steep, inaccessible slopes and brush create a high fire hazard in the western hills. Additionally,
areas within the Extended Planning Areas that are adjacent to open space are susceptible to
fire hazards. For projects that are constructed outside a fire station service area (greater than
1.5 miles from the nearest fire station) and/or interface with open space, certain built-in fire
protection measures will be necessary. For example, sprinklers are required for all habitable
structures beyond five minutes response time from a station. A fire protection buffer zone may
also be required around the perimeter of residential development situated adjacent to
undeveloped open space land. Furthermore, the City enforces its Fire Safe Roof and Spark
Arrestor ordinances for development proposed near high fire hazard areas. These measures
may increase the cost of new housing in vulnerable areas; however, the added protection is
necessary to ensure public health, safety, and welfare.
Flooding
Both 100 and 500 year flood zones have been identified in portions of the Primary and Eastern
Extended Planning Areas; no 100 year or 500 year flood zones have been identified in the
Western Extended Planning Area. Most of the areas in the 100 year flood plain have been built
upon. Any new construction in flood prone areas must comply with Chapter 7.24 (Flood Control)
of Title 7 of the Dublin Municipal Code including constructing the first floor above the floodplain
level. A number of channel improvements have been implemented since the early 1990’s as a
result of local developments partnering with Zone 7 and/or the City of Dublin, and Caltrans
transportation projects.
                                            Appendix C-66

                                                                                       City of Dublin
                                                                       Housing Element (2015-2023)
Channel improvements have been made along Tassajara Creek (Line K), Alamo Creek (Line F),
and Big Canyon Creek (Line J-1). In addition to the major creeks in Dublin, several tributaries
have undergone improvements as well, including the undergrounding of Line G-3 and the
channel wall-raising of Line G-5.
While no major flood improvement projects have clearly been identified in the City of Dublin for
the future, Zone 7 is presently working on an update to their Stream Management Master Plan
(SMMP), which will consider new, innovative approaches to providing regional flood protection,
including options that may include the use of enhanced floodplains and vegetated stormwater
channels. Areas along Chabot Canal located in Camp Parks and upland areas along Tassajara
Creek will likely present partnering opportunities for Zone 7 and the City of Dublin.
Portions of the Downtown Specific Plan area fall within the flood plains of 100-year, 500-year,
and Zone X. The EIR for the Downtown Specific Plan Amendment determines no significant
impact will result as projects would be required to comply with floodplain regulations. While
compliance with such regulations would add to the cost of development, it has not constrained
housing development in the Downtown as evidenced by the projects already entitled in the area.
Specifically, the Crown Chevy Redevelopment Site has recently been approved for 314 multi-
family apartment units over 17,000 square feet of ground floor commercial and 72 affordable
rental units for veterans. The City also continues to receive interest in residential development
Downtown. The Downtown Specific Plan amendment approved on July 15, 2014 is designed to
accommodate this interest.

3. Housing Resources
This section evaluates the resources available in Dublin for the development and preservation
of housing.
A. Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA)
State law (California Government Code Section 65584) provides for councils of governments to
prepare regional housing allocation plans that assign a share of a region’s housing construction
need to each city and county. In the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, the Association of
Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is the council of governments authorized under State law to
identify existing and future housing needs for the region. ABAG adopted a new regional
housing allocation plan on July 18, 2013. This “Regional Housing Needs Assessment” (RHNA)
covers the planning period from January 1, 2014 through October 31, 2022. Existing need is
evaluated based on overpayment (30 percent or more of income), overcrowding by lower
income households, and the need to raise vacancy rates in the jurisdiction to a level at which
the market would operate freely. The housing assessment also includes an impaction
correction to reduce the further concentration of lower income households in jurisdictions that
already have more than the regional average of such households.
ABAG’s methodology is based on the regional growth estimates developed by the State
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). These are “planning goals” and
are not meant to match, and often exceed, anticipated housing production. The planning goals
developed by HCD are provided to ABAG in the form of regional housing goals, divided into
income categories. ABAG is responsible for allocating the RHNA goals to cities and counties in
the Bay Area.
The RHNA is a minimum needs number — jurisdictions are free to plan for, and accommodate,
a larger number of dwelling units than the allocation. The jurisdiction must, however, identify
adequate sites at appropriate zoning and development standards to accommodate its RHNA.
While the jurisdiction must also show how it will facilitate and encourage the development of
these units, it is not obligated to build any of the units itself or finance their construction.
According to the RHNA, the City of Dublin has a total housing construction need of 2,285 units.
Table C-34 shows Dublin’s 2014–2022 planning period allocation. The City must accommodate
these units either through production of units or provision of adequate sites that can
accommodate these units. Specifically, for facilitating the development of lower income units,
the State has established a default density of 30 units per acre.

  Note 1: AB 2634 amending the Housing Element law requires local jurisdictions project its future housing needs
  for extremely low income households (0-30 percent AMI). Specifically, State law provides two methodologies for
  estimating the extremely low income needs – either by splitting the very low income category evenly between
  extremely low (0-30 percent AMI) and very low (31-50 percent AMI) incomes; or to apportion the very low income
  category based on Census data. The 796 very low income RHNA units can be split into 398 extremely low (50
  percent) and 398 very low (50 percent) income units.
B. Credits against the RHNA
Approved Projects
As the RHNA is for the planning period of January 1, 2014 through October 31, 2022, housing
units approved but not yet constructed as of January 1, 2014 can be credited toward the RHNA.
As of February 2014, seven projects have been approved in the City but not yet constructed.
These recent development activities in the City have been primarily lower and medium density
developments, and most opted to pay a fee in-lieu of including affordable units on site.
One project – the Crown Chevy redevelopment site (formerly known as the Kingsmill project) -
fulfills its affordable housing requirement by providing a 1.37-acre parcel to Eden Housing to
develop up to 76- apartments for low income households. At least 38 units will be reserved for
returning veterans who have been severely injured. The remaining 38 units will be set aside for
low income families with a preference for families of veterans.

Remaining RHNA
Based on units approved, the City has already met a portion of its RHNA obligations.
Specifically, the City has met its requirement for the above moderate income RHNA, with a
remaining RHNA of 1,591 lower and moderate income units (see Table C-35).

C. Future Development Potential
Vacant Sites
Vacant residential properties in the City can accommodate a maximum of 1,620 units based on
maximum permitted densities (Table C-36).            However, based on the recent trend of
development proposals averaging closer toward the mid-point densities, the more realistic
estimate of development potential is 965 units.

Downtown Dublin Specific Plan
The Downtown Dublin Specific Plan combined the area of the former Downtown Core
Specific Plan, Dublin Downtown Specific Plan, San Ramon Road Specific Plan, Village
Parkway Specific Plan, and West Dublin BART Specific Plan into one comprehensive plan
(Figure C-9). This plan was approved by the Dublin City Council on February 1, 2011.
Existing uses in the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan area are characterized by commercial
and office uses with large surface parking spaces. Existing vacancies and underutilization
of land are evident throughout the Specific Plan area.
The City amended the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan on July 15, 2014 to increase
residential development opportunities in the area and distribute this potential development
across three districts:
       Retail District: Comprised of mostly regional serving large-format retailers bounded
        by Amador Valley Boulevard, I-680, Dublin Boulevard and San Ramon Road. After
        the 2014 amendment, the Specific Plan now allows for up to 400 residential units in
        the Retail District.
       Transit-Oriented District: Comprised of land south of Dublin Boulevard and within
        walking distance to the West Dublin BART Station. After the 2014 amendment, the
        Specific Plan now allows for up to 1,900 residential units in the Transit-Oriented
        District; to date, 1,009 units have been entitled, leaving a remaining residential
        development potential of 891 units.
       Village Parkway District: Comprised of retail and service-oriented businesses along
        both sides of Village Parkway. After the 2014 amendment, the Specific Plan now
        allows for up to 200 residential units in the Village Parkway District.

Figure C-9: Downtown Dublin Specific Plan
The City amended the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan on July 15, 2014 to increase
residential development opportunities in the area and distribute potential development
across three districts. The amended Specific Plan allows for 300 additional units in the
Retail District (400 units total), 800 additional units in the Transit-Oriented District (1,900
units total), and 100 additional units in the Village Parkway District (200 units total). With the
amendment, a total of 2,500 residential units can be permitted in the Specific Plan area.
About 1,009 of the 1,900 units in the Transit-Oriented district have already been entitled.
Connelly Station completed construction in March 2014 and includes 309 apartment units. In
March 2013, the City approved the redevelopment of the Crown Chevy site for 314
residential units—with 17,000 square feet of ground floor retail. An additional 76-unit
affordable housing development for military veterans was also approved as part of the
project. A third project, now referred to as Prologis, was approved in 2004; but, due to
delays as a result of the economic downturn, is only now being actively marketed. The
project includes 310 high density units and 150,000 square feet of office space. As
amended, the Transit Oriented District now has a remaining capacity of 891 units. The
Transit-Oriented district sites in the residential sites inventory were selected based on their
existing conditions (high vacancy and turnover rates), low Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of existing
buildings on site compared to allowable FAR, and developer interests. These sites are very
similar in characteristics to sites that have recently been redeveloped or entitled in this
district, indicating their suitability for redevelopment.

The EIR certified Downtown Dublin Specific Plan Amendment has adequately analyzed the
potential impacts of future development within the Specific Plan area. No additional
environmental review is required for development projects that are consistent with the
Specific Plan. Development applications would be subject to site plan and design review.

As part of the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan amendment and this Housing Element
update, City staff conducted a parcel-specific vacant and underutilized sites analysis to
identify properties with near-term development potential within the three districts. Factors
considered included:
        Developer interest
        Existing vacancies and availability of space for lease
        Properties available for sale
        Age of existing structures
        Deferred maintenance
        Existing Floor Area Ratio (FAR) compared to allowable FAR
        Size of property and lot consolidation potential
If these properties were to be redeveloped according to the proposed allowable densities,
up to 408 units may be achieved in the Retail District, 1,679 units in the TOD District, and
488 units in the Village Parkway District, for a total capacity of 2,679 units. However, given
the residential development potential established in each district, only about half of the
capacity is used to fulfill the RHNA. (A detailed sites inventory is included in Appendix D.)
Density and Affordability
State Housing Element law establishes a default density of 30 units per acre for
communities in Alameda County with a population over 25,000 as being adequate to
facilitate and encourage the development of lower income housing. However, this default
density is not a mandate and local jurisdictions can use alternative density thresholds to
measure feasibility for lower income housing based on a demonstrated history. City staff
researched recent affordable housing projects in the Greater Tri-Valley region and
concluded that affordable housing for lower income households can be achieved at a
density between 20 and 25 units per acre (Table C-38). The City had also previously
contacted EAH, developer of Camellia Place at the Dublin Transit Center.                     The
representative of EAH commented that affordable housing can be achieved in Dublin at a
density of around 22 units per acre. At this density, it is feasible to develop two-three story
walkup apartments at a reasonable level of subsidies.

        City of Dublin
        Housing Element (2015-2023)
        Based on the affordable housing projects in the Greater Tri-Valley area, this Housing
        Element uses 22 units per acre as a density threshold for measuring feasibility for lower
        income housing. Specifically because the Retail District of the Downtown Dublin Specific
        Plan requires a minimum density of 22 units per acre, 75 percent of the development
        potential in this district is credited toward the lower income RHNA. Development potential in
        the TOD District, with a minimum density of 30 units per acre, defaults to the lower income
        level of affordability.

        For projects to be developed in the Medium Density (6.1-14.0 units per acre) and Medium-
        High Density (14.1-25.0 units per acre) categories, the City evaluated the affordability level
        on a site-by-site basis. For sites that are most likely to be developed as single-family homes,
        these sites are credited toward meeting the City’s above moderate income RHNA. For sites
        that are most likely to be developed as attached multi-family development (such as
        condominiums and townhomes), these sites are used to fulfill the City’s moderate income
        RHNA.
        Adequacy of Sites Inventory
        The City’s remaining residential sites and sites in the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan area,
        along with approved projects, have the potential to accommodate up to 3,671 units. Overall,
        the available sites/approved units total 1,367 lower income units, 448 moderate income
        units, and 1,856 above moderate income units (see Table C-39), adequate to meet the
        City’s RHNA for the planning period.

and Camp Parks area. The District’s service area will encompass approximately 27 square
miles and is projected to include build out of the existing service areas plus the Western
Dublin and Dougherty Valley planning areas. Build out is estimated at 78,260 residents by
2020. Due to the recent economic recession and depressed housing market, buildout of the
service area has delayed. For example, current (2012 American Community Survey)
population in Dublin is estimated at 45,800, well below the projected 2015 population of
50,320, or 10,320 residents below the projected population by 2020. The City has a RHNA
of 2,285 units through 2023. Prorating this RHNA for the planning period of the master plan
yields an additional 1,430 units. At an average household size of 2.7 persons per
household, the additional units would yield 3,860 additional residents in Dublin, well below
the projected buildout provided for in the water plan. Therefore, projected water services
capacity is adequate to accommodate the City’s RHNA.
The Dublin San Ramon Service District also provides wastewater collection and treatment
services to the City of Dublin in Alameda County and portions of the City of San Ramon in
Contra Costa County. The District’s wastewater service area is smaller than the water
service area (wastewater service to the northern portion of San Ramon and to the
Dougherty Valley is provided by the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District). The DSRSD
wastewater collection system includes over 107 miles of sanitary sewers from 6 to 42 inches
in diameter. The ages of the sewers range from less than 5 to over 40 years old. The
DSRSD Wastewater Collection System Master Plan Update (February 2000) states that
there are eight improvement projects recommend providing the required capacity in the
District’s wastewater collection system. All necessary capital improvements were completed
by 2003 to serve future growth.

D. Financial Resources
Inclusionary Zoning In-Lieu Fee
As a small city, the City of Dublin has very limited access to financial resources for
affordable housing. The significant resource for the City is the Inclusionary Zoning In-Lieu
Fee. The City adopted an Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance in 2002 to assure that housing
development contributes to the attainment of the City’s housing goals by increasing the
production of residential units affordable by households of very low, low, and moderate
incomes. Upon request, the City Council can allow the applicant to pay a fee in-lieu of
constructing the affordable units that the developer would otherwise be required to
construct. In-lieu fees are placed into an Inclusionary Zoning In-Lieu Fee Fund. The In-Lieu
Fee is primarily used to support the construction of affordable housing units.
The City also approved a Commercial Linkage Fee on May 3, 2005. Fees are charged to
non-residential developments, based on the square footage and type of commercial building
space and placed into an Inclusionary Zoning In-Lieu Fee Fund.
As of April 2014, the City’s Inclusionary Zoning In-Lieu Fee Fund has a balance of
$7,013,816. The funds are to be used for the following activities:
        Affordable housing construction loans;
        First Time Homebuyer Loan Program;
        Homeownership training and foreclosure prevention services;
        Rental assistance programs;
        Housing Division’s administrative costs; and
        Alameda County Homeless Management Information System.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
CDBG is the largest federal housing-related program for affordable housing. It is a "pass-
through" program that allows local governments to use federal funds to alleviate poverty and
blight. Cities with populations of over 50,000 receive CDBG funds directly from HUD, while
smaller cities usually use county-administered CDBG funds. HUD makes allocations based
on a formula that takes population, poverty, and housing distress into account. CDBG funds
are used for a variety of housing efforts including activities aimed at reducing costs for
private development (helping fund site acquisition, improvement, and other soft costs);
housing acquisition and rehabilitation through short and long-term loans, grants or loan
guarantees; direct payment of rent or mortgage and housing counseling services; and fair
housing activities. CDBG funds are best used in combination with other subsidy sources or
to provide pre-development funding to initiate housing development.
As a small city, the City of Dublin does not qualify to receive CDBG funds directly from HUD.
However, it participates in the County of Alameda CDBG program. The County offers the
Home Improvement Program for Dublin residents using CDBG funds.

E. Administrative Resources
The Bay Area is fortunate to have a large number of successful non-profit and for-profit
housing developers who have produced thousands of high-quality, well-managed affordable
housing projects for lower and moderate income households. Collectively, they have
produced multi-family developments, single-family developments, rental and ownership
opportunities, sweat-equity developments, mixed income projects, mixed use developments,
and housing that is specifically designed to meet the needs of seniors, disabled persons,
farm workers, female-headed households, people with substance abuse problems, and/or
homeless persons.
Active affordable housing developers in the region include Resources for Community
Development, Satellite Housing, East Bay Habitat for Humanity, Eden Housing, East Bay
Housing Organizations, ECHO Housing, and BRIDGE Housing Corporation, among others.
The City of Dublin also achieves affordable housing through its Inclusionary Zoning
Ordinance.

COMMUNITY DESIGN AND
SUSTAINABILITY ELEMENT

10.1 	        OVERVIEW	
The Community Design and Sustainability Element guides public and private development to create a
city that is diverse, functional, and aesthetically appealing. The Community Design and Sustainability
Element contains goals and policies that provide a framework for community development and
guidelines for new construction and improvements while protecting the City’s positive characteristics.
These goals and policies apply to three-dimensional aspects of the built environment in Dublin:
buildings, streets, sidewalks, neighborhoods, plazas, etc.
Community design combines aspects of architecture, landscape architecture, public works, public
art, and transportation systems. Implementation of these community design policies will create an
inviting and attractive city that will help to unify the City visually and create a distinct sense of place
in special areas of the City.
10.1.1	       CITYWIDE DESIGN VISION	
The following design vision provides the basis for the goals and policies contained in this Community
Design and Sustainability Element:
         Dublin is a vibrant, well-designed city with a positive regional identity. Regional corridors
         promote this positive regional identity through attractive development, unique landscaping,
         and preservation of views to rolling hillsides and other prominent features. Gateways welcome
         residents and visitors alike through signage, distinctive landscaping, and buildings oriented
         toward gateway intersections.
         Dublin is a city of villages that enhance its suburban character with attractive and integrated
         residential neighborhoods, retail centers, and office and industrial areas. Regional transit
         hubs are developed with compact development that incorporates a mixture of commercial,
         office, and residential uses. Pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists are provided with a variety
         of connections that link various activity centers of the City. Dublin is a leader in sustainable
         design and continues to thrive as an attractive and livable city for generations to come.
10.2	         RELEVANT PLANS AND POLICES	
                          Dublin has adopted a number of plans and policies to guide development.
                          Some of these pertain to the entire City, while others have a specific area of
                          focus. As part of the City of Dublin General Plan, this Community Design and
                          Sustainability Element provides goals, policies, and implementation measures
                          that address the entire City. Where goals, policies, and implementation
                          measures of other policy documents and plans conflict those in the Community
                          Design and Sustainability Element shall supersede. The following includes the
existing plans and policies that guide development in Dublin.
A.	 City of Dublin General Plan
The General Plan is the highest-level policy document for the entire City, and acts like an “umbrella”
   City of Dublin General Plan | Community Design & Sustainability Element                            10–1

over other documents. State law requires general plans to include the following elements: land use,
circulation, open space, conservation, safety, noise, and housing. These elements may be combined
and additional (optional) elements may be included. All elements of a General Plan are considered
equal and all other plans and policies are required by state law to be consistent with the General Plan.
The Community Design and Sustainability Element is an optional element of the Dublin General Plan.
B.	 Downtown Dublin Specific Plan
The Downtown Dublin Specific Plan (DDSP) provides policies and regulations for downtown Dublin.
Topics addressed include permitted, conditionally permitted, and temporarily permitted land use,
development standards and design guidelines.
C.	 Eastern Dublin Specific Plan
The Eastern Dublin Specific Plan provides policy guidance for existing and future development
generally east of the Iron Horse Trail and the Parks Reserve Forces Training Area (Parks RFTA or Camp
Parks). New development in this area requires adoption of Planned Development (PD) zoning, which
includes development regulations, architectural standards, and preliminary landscape plans.
D.	 Dublin Village Historic Area Specific Plan
The Dublin Village Historic Area Specific Plan applies to future development and redevelopment in
the Dublin Village Historic Area. This plan includes design guidelines, historic resource preservation
measures, and implementation actions.
E. 	 Dublin Crossing Specific Plan
The Dublin Crossing Specific Plan (DCSP) provides policies and regulations for development in this 189
acre area north of Dublin Boulevard between Scarlett Drive and Arnold Road. The Specific Plan includes
regulations on permitted, conditionally permitted, and prohibited land uses, development standards,
and design guidelines, and provides the framework for the development of future public facilities.
F.	 Scarlett Court Design Guidelines
The Scarlett Court Design Guidelines apply to the industrial area in and around Scarlett Court. Design
guidelines address site planning, architecture, signage, landscaping, and lighting.
G	 Eastern Dublin Scenic Corridor Policies and Standards
The Eastern Dublin Scenic Corridor Policies and Standards establishes a set of scenic corridor polices
for designated corridors including Interstate 580, Tassajara Road, and Fallon Road, and defines a
review process within these scenic corridors.
H.	 Streetscape Master Plan
The Streetscape Master Plan addresses landscape planting and street furnishings throughout Dublin.
This document identifies tree species and planting requirements, as well as streetscape amenities
such as streetlights, trash receptacles, benches, bus shelters, monuments, and signage.
I.	 Bikeways Master Plan
Dublin Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan. The Dublin Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan provides
10–2                      City of Dublin General Plan | Community Design & Sustainability Element

policies, network plans, prioritized project lists, support programs and best practice design guidelines
for bicycling and walking in Dublin.
J.	 Public Art Master Plan
The Public Art Master Plan provides guidelines, policies, and implementation measures for public art
in City projects and private developments.
K.	 Zoning Ordinance
The Zoning Ordinance provides policies and regulations for the entire City. Topics addressed include
permitted, conditionally permitted, and temporarily permitted uses, development standards, parking
and landscaping regulations, permit procedures, and sign regulations.
L.	 Heritage Tree Ordinance
The Heritage Tree Ordinance provides regulations controlling the removal of and the preservation of
heritage trees within the City. In establishing these regulations, it is the City’s intent to preserve as
many heritage trees as possible.
M.	Parks and Recreation Master Plan
The Parks and Recreation Master Plan establishes goals, long-term policies, and standards to guide
the City in the acquisition, development, and management of Dublin’s Park and Recreation facilities
for the next 20 years.
N.	 Commercial Corridor Design Guidelines
The Commercial Corridor Design Guidelines apply to commercial and light industrial properties within
Sierra Court/Sierra Lane and select locations along major roadways in Dublin (i.e. Dublin Boulevard,
San Ramon Road, etc.). Design guidelines address site planning, architecture, signage, lighting, and
landscaping and design standards for specific types of uses.
10.3	         UNIFYING PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY DESIGN	
Because of the varied scales at which a community functions, city planners and designers often
utilize a variety of analytical techniques and methodologies to describe and communicate various
community design principles.
10.3.1	       THE IMAGE OF THE CITY 	
A commonly used model of urban design comes from theorist and author Kevin Lynch (The Image of
the City, 1960). His overriding idea was for cities to create a more memorable identity by enhancing
the image of their major elements. He divided the city into the following functional areas, each of
which contributes distinct design potential:
Paths – Paths connect activity areas and can have an important identity of their own.
Landmarks – Visually prominent buildings, important cultural centers, or special natural features
serve to give a city a distinct image and are important amenities.
   City of Dublin General Plan | Community Design & Sustainability Element                          10–3

Edges – Boundaries signal one’s arrival at a new land use, area, or feature. If edges are clearly
marked, such as in the use of entry signs or monuments, a city’s identity is strengthened.
Nodes – Focal points, intersections, and gathering places create activity centers that draw people
into them and stimulate adjacent development.
Districts – Special areas of the city have their own visual and functional identity and help differentiate
the visual monotony seen in many cities today.
Lynch’s five functional areas have been refined into the following five goals for Dublin.
    1.	 Promote a Positive Regional Identity of the City.
    2.	 Create a Sense of Arrival at gateways to the City.
    3.	 Ensure quality and compatible Design of the Built Form.

10.5.1	INTENT	
To those traveling through the City, these regional corridors create their overall image of Dublin. Due
to the high number of people who pass through the City each day and because of their importance,
these regional corridors should be emphasized to create a positive identity and image for Dublin.
10.5.2	GOAL	
Promote a Positive Regional Identity of the City.
10.5.3	POLICIES	
    A.	 Incorporate distinctive design features along regional
         corridors that reinforce a positive image of Dublin.
         Both within the right-of-way and on adjacent private
         development, utilize features such as gateway
         elements, street trees, median planting, special
         lighting, separated and ample sidewalks, crosswalks,
         seating, special signs, street names, landscape,
         decorative paving patterns, and public art. Consider
         undergrounding utilities along these roadways
         (reference: Streetscape Master Plan).
    B.	 Maintain views through development to distant
         vistas (i.e. foothills) and view corridors along regional
         corridors, wherever feasible (reference: East Dublin
         Scenic Corridor Policies and Standards).                  Landscaped median and distant hill views

       to soften the visual appearance of existing              Parking and loading areas screened from public roadways
       and new walls and fences that are adjacent
       to regional corridors, wherever feasible (reference: Streetscape Master Plan).
   E.	 Encourage attractive and high-quality landscaping along the edge of the freeways and
                                                             development surrounding on- and off-ramps
                                                             to provide softer and more attractive views
                                                             both to and from the freeways. Landscaping
                                                             on private property should complement the
                                                             buildings and overall site design.

10.6	         SENSE OF ARRIVAL	
Dublin has several entrances into the City along regional corridors at or near the City limit. These
entrances have been classified as gateways. Gateways may include special signage and landscaping
to highlight transitions into the City, and in some instances are envisioned to function as nodes at
major intersections with special architectural features on adjacent buildings and/or with public spaces
incorporated into the design.
As shown in Figure 10-2, the Community Design and Sustainability Element identifies the following
14 Dublin gateways:
    1.	 Schaefer Ranch Road at Dublin Boulevard
    2.	 San Ramon Road at Dublin Boulevard
    3.	 West Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station
     4.	 I-680 Southbound off ramp
     5.	 San Ramon Road at northern entry to City
     6.	 Village Parkway at northern entry to City
    7.	 Dougherty Road at northern entry to City
     8.	 Dougherty Road at Dublin Boulevard
     9.	 East Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station
    10.	 Hacienda Drive at Dublin Boulevard
    11.	 Tassajara Road at Dublin Boulevard
    12.	 Tassajara Road at northern entry to City
    13.	 Fallon Road at Dublin Boulevard
    14.	 Dublin Boulevard at eastern entry to City
Just as regional corridors have an impact on creating a positive regional identity for Dublin, gateways
and entries have an impact on creating inviting entrances and a sense of arrival into the City.
10.6.1	INTENT	
The City wants to create inviting entrances at gateways that reflect the character of Dublin and
welcome residents and visitors. These gateways help define the edge of Dublin and will further create
nodes near the City’s edge.
10.6.2	GOAL	
Create a Sense of Arrival at gateways to the City.

10.7	         DESIGN OF THE BUILT FORM	
Dublin is made up of a variety of villages, residential neighborhoods, and other commercial and
industrial areas, each with their own unique features and development patterns. Each area functions
differently from other areas – largely based on location (i.e. proximity to freeways or hillsides) and
use (i.e. residential or commercial) – but all have common elements that make them distinct to the
City. The design of the built form has a variety of categories (including Site and Building Design,
Landscaping and Natural Features, Gathering and Open Space Areas, Signage, Lighting, and Art,
Parking and Circulation, and Villages) which apply to the following land uses:
Residential
Dublin has a variety of single and multi-family residential neighborhoods with unique design features
and building types. These neighborhoods are generally developed around a central feature such as
a school or park. Residential neighborhoods in the Primary and Western Extended Planning Areas
consist predominately of established neighborhoods with single-family homes. The residential
neighborhoods in the Eastern Extended Planning Area generally contain higher density development
near Dublin Boulevard and lower density (single-family) development along the hillsides to the north
and east.
Commercial
Commercial developments (i.e. General Commercial, Neighborhood Commercial, Retail/Office Mixed-
Use, etc.) range from a single building with a single tenant to multiple buildings often with multiple
tenants (shopping centers) and also consider mixed use developments. Commercial development
in the City generally occurs along arterial roadways and adjacent to office developments. Shopping
centers generally consist of multiple buildings that share common architecture, landscaping, and/or
other design features. Shopping centers generally are developed with a central parking lot providing
shared parking.
Office
Office developments (i.e. Office, Campus Office, etc.) range from a single building with a single tenant
to multiple buildings often with multiple tenants. Office development in the City generally occurs along
arterial roadways and adjacent to commercial developments. Campus Office developments consist of
multiple buildings that share common architecture, landscaping, and/or other design features.
Industrial
Industrial uses (i.e. Industrial Park, Business Park/Industrial, etc.) provide vital resources and services
and are an integral part of the City. Industrial uses are often buffered from more sensitive uses, such as
residential, schools, and parks, to minimize their impacts associated with traffic, noise, and aesthetics.
The following policies apply to the land uses described above:
   City of Dublin General Plan | Community Design & Sustainability Element                           10–13

10.7.1 	 INTENT	
The City wants to design high-quality and compatible areas that reflect the overall character of Dublin.
These areas should also be distinct from one another to avoid monotonous development patterns.
10.7.2 	 GOAL	
Ensure quality and compatible Design of the Built Form.
10.7.3 	 POLICIES	
10.7.3.1	 SITE AND BUILDING DESIGN	
    A.	 Encourage diverse, high quality, attractive, and architecturally appealing buildings that create
         distinctive visual reference points, enrich the appearance of functional gathering spaces, and
         convey an excellence in architecture, workmanship, quality, and durability in building materials.

    B.	 Encourage buildings with varied
         massing, heights, articulation
         techniques, and architectural
         and signage treatments to create
         visual interest and ensure
         compatibility with adjacent uses,
         in commercial, office, industrial,
         and mixed use areas.
    C.	 Ensure that building height, scale
         and design are compatible with
                                                             Buildings with articulated facades and varying roof lines

 D.	 Encourage a variety of site and
      building designs that are compatible
      and consistent with surrounding
      development, especially where larger
      scale development is adjacent to
      smaller scale and/or more sensitive
      land uses (i.e. residential, schools,
      and churches) to the greatest extent
      feasible.
 E.	 Avoid the use of long, continuous, Building height, scale, and design is compatible with adjacent uses
      straight (building) walls along
      roadways by designing appropriate articulation, massing, and architectural features.
 F.	 Create distinctive neighborhoods that exemplify high-quality and varied design while
      reinforcing Dublin as one integrated community, in residential areas.

   G.	 Encourage the diversity of garage orientation and setbacks, architectural styles, building
       materials, color and rooflines, and other design features, on all sides of all buildings, in
       residential areas.
        Residential architectural variation and garage orientation
   H.	 Orient         buildings           toward         major
       thoroughfares, sidewalks, pedestrian
       pathways, and gathering spaces, and
       incorporate clear and identifiable entries
       where feasible, in campus office areas.
   I.	 Cluster and connect buildings through a
       series of pedestrian pathways designed
       to work with each other to form a
       unified design character and create larger
       functional spaces, in campus office and
       commercial areas.
   J.	 Design inviting and attractive office                           Clustered buildings and parking lots that are connected by
       buildings that incorporate modern and pedestrian pathways
       contemporary architectural elements and design features that enrich the appearance of the
       gathering places, encourage people to use them, and have attractive appearances from the
       public right-of-way, in office areas.

    K.	 Minimize the visual impacts of service/loading areas, storage areas, trash enclosures, and
        ground mounted mechanical equipment. When feasible, these elements should be located
        behind or to the sides of buildings and screened from views through a combination of walls/
        fencing, and/or landscaping.
    L.	 Minimize the visual impacts of roof mounted mechanical equipment. When feasible, such
        elements should be consolidated and housed in architecturally articulated enclosures.
10.7.3.2	 LANDSCAPING AND NATURAL FEATURES	
   A.	 Utilize more formal landscaping treatments
        in more densely developed (urban) areas
        and utilize more natural landscaping
        treatments in less dense (suburban) areas,
        as appropriate.
    B.	Achieve neighborhood identities by
        applying streetscape and landscape
        design, entry treatments, signage, and
        architectural detailing standards, in
        residential areas (reference: Streetscape
        Master Plan).
    C.	Incorporate setbacks and landscaped                      Neighborhood entry with attractive use of landscaping,
        buffers for development along collector                 hardscape, and lighting
        and arterial roadways to minimize the
        impacts from roadway noise, where
        appropriate.

        Downward lighting designed to minimize effect on
        adjacent uses and reduce night sky lighting
10.7.3.5 	 PARKING AND CIRCULATION	
   A.	 Provide convenient but not visually dominating
        parking that incorporates extensive
        landscaping to provide shade, promote
        wayfinding, visually soften views from the
        street and surrounding properties, and reduce
        the heat island effect (generally characterized
        with large expanses of paved and under-
        landscaped surfaces).
    B.	 Buffer and screen large expanses of parking
        areas from the street, where practical.
                                                                   Appropriate parking lot design with extensive

     C.	 Encourage the use of integrated circulation and parking facilities that are shared among
          surrounding properties.
     D.	 Provide attractive and convenient bicycle parking (reference: Dublin Bicycle and Pedestrian
          Master Plan).
10.7.3.6 	 VILLAGES	
Villages are unique areas in Dublin that have distinct identities, include a mix of land uses, encourage
pedestrian activity and can serve as major transit hubs. Figure 10-5 identifies the locations of each
Village.
The following policies apply to Villages.
     A.	Encourage compact development that
          integrates a variety of housing types and
          densities, commercial and industrial uses,
          community facilities, civic, and educational
          uses with an emphasis on pedestrian-
          friendly design.
     B.	 Design Village locations to be compatible
          with the local environment including
          surrounding land uses and topography.
          Village designs should respect constraints,          Easily accessible village node
          such as roadways, and environmental
          considerations.
     C.	 Provide a mixture of housing types, densities, and affordability in Villages that support a
          range of age and income groups.
                                                      D.	Construct easily accessible activity nodes
                                                          (commercial areas, community facilities, gathering
                                                          areas, and public/private facilities).
                                                      E.	 Incorporate trails, pedestrian pathways, and street
                                                          linkages to better unify the parts and elements of
                                                          each Village.
                                                      F.	 Design streets and pedestrian pathways that are
                                                          linked to transportation routes including buses and
                                                          regional transit services.
                                                      G.	Design Villages with strong edges to define
                                                          their boundaries, such as major streets, signage,
                                                          architecture, or landscaping.
                                                      H.	Encourage Village size and development that
                                                          promotes pedestrian mobility, permits a sufficient
          Representative urban character of a village     mixture of residential and public/private uses, and
                                                          convenient commercial areas.
     I.	 Foster a specific identity for each Village by applying special signage, unique design elements,
          public spaces, etc.

10.7.4 	 IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES	
Design of the built form includes all of the following subcategories as discussed above (Site and
Building Design, Landscaping and Natural Features, Gathering and Open Space Areas, Signage,
Lighting, and Art, Parking and Circulation, and Villages). The following implementation measures
apply to these subcategories:
    A.	 Update the City’s Sign Ordinance.
    B.	 Institute a Design Awards Program to recognize new and remodeled projects of special
         quality.
    C.	 Work with development applicants to create projects that more closely relate to and reinforce
        the unique character of Dublin consistent with the intent of this Community Design and
        Sustainability Element.
    D.	 Work with PG&E or other appropriate organizations to underground new and existing utility
         cabinets, overhead wiring, and other related equipment, whenever feasible.
    E.	 Develop design guidelines for light industrial areas that are not within a Specific Plan or
        Planned Development Zoning District and that do not have existing design guidelines.
    F.	 Periodically update the Streetscape Master Plan.
    G.	 Schedule the maintenance and replacement of public improvements, such as pavement and
        streetlights, commensurate in quality and appearance to those in more recently constructed
         neighborhoods, when redevelopment occurs and where feasible.

10.8	         ENCOURAGING SUSTAINABLE NEIGHBORHOOD DESIGN 	
	             AND CREATING CONNECTIONS AND LINKAGES	
Connections and linkages are what unify the villages, residential neighborhoods, commercial and
industrial areas, and various developments within each neighborhood. Dublin includes a variety of
connections and linkages for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists. These provide connections within
and between properties and the public right-of-way including streets, sidewalks, trails, etc. Some
connections and linkages have design and landscaping patterns unique to that corridor, while others
have a design and landscaping pattern unique to the type of connection (i.e. sidewalk or freeway).
How a village, district, or neighborhood is laid out can have a big impact on whether the area is
comfortable for pedestrians and cyclists, and it can be a determinant of how much time people spend
outdoors and how they choose to circulate around the area. New development in Dublin:
    •	 Includes neighborhoods with a robust network of internal streets and good connections to
         surrounding neighborhoods where pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers can move efficiently
         and safely.
    •	 Promotes walking and cycling by providing safe, appealing, and comfortable street
         environments that support public health by reducing pedestrian injuries and encouraging
         daily physical activity.
    •	 Aides in the improvement of resident’s physical and mental health and social capital by
         providing a variety of open spaces (public and private) close to work and home to facilitate
         neighborhood connectivity, social networking, civic engagement, physical activity, and time
         spent outdoors.
Compliance with Section 10.8 (Encouraging Sustainable Neighborhood Design and Creating
Connections and Linkages) is required only for the following types of projects:
    •	 New General Plan and Specific Plan Amendments, new Specific Plans;
    •	 Annexations;
    •	 New Stage 1 and/or Stage 2 Planned Development Rezones;
    •	 Rezoning applications; and
   City of Dublin General Plan | Community Design & Sustainability Element                       10–25

    •	 Any subdivision of property or other new development that creates new streets (without
         changing the applicable land use designation) would need to comply only with those goals,
         policies, and implementation measures contained in Sections 10.8.1 to 10.8.4 (Street
         Patterns and Design).
10.8.1 	 INTENT: STREET PATTERNS AND DESIGN	
Create connections and linkages throughout the various areas of Dublin and within and between
properties and the public right-of-way. These connections and linkages should be provided for a
variety of users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, and motorists and should ensure safe
and easy travel between key destinations, including residential, civic/public, and commercial spaces.
10.8.2 	 GOAL: STREET PATTERNS AND DESIGN	
Establish Connections and Linkages throughout the City by promoting transportation efficiency,
reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT), enabling easier non-vehicular circulation, and promoting
walking and cycling.

         pedestrian and bicycle connections between
         destinations within a project area by providing
         wide multi-use paths, generous sidewalks, and
         dedicated bicycle lanes on Class I and II Collector
         and Arterial streets.
    B.	 Provide clear, identifiable, and ample pedestrian
         and bicycle pathways that connect sidewalks,
         parking areas, building entrances, trails and other
         site features by using wayfinding techniques such
         as signage, landscaping, hardscape, and prominent       Pedestrian pathway inter-connecting with adjacent
         building entrances, where feasible (reference:          land use

                                                connections to the exterior of the project area and
                                                thereby create safe routes of travel to transit facilities,
                                                public gathering spaces, trails, parks, community centers,
                                                schools, City villages, gateways and entries (reference:

    E.	 Ensure that sidewalks, pedestrian and bicycle pathways, and trails are furnished with
          appropriate pedestrian amenities such as lighting, signage, trash receptacles, etc., where
          appropriate (reference: Streetscape Master Plan, Dublin Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan.
    F.	 Provide increased connectivity to the nearest BART station for pedestrians and cyclists from
          development projects within one-half mile of the station.

          conformance with the following street
          standards (unless alternative design
          methods are proposed that will achieve
          the above “Street Patterns and Design”
          goals and policies):
          1.	No closed cul-de-sacs. New
                residential cul-de-sacs should have
                a cut-through at the end that is
                accessible to pedestrians and cyclists.
                The cul-de-sac can open to another
                cul-de-sac, another street, or a
                park, trail, or open space area. All
   City of Dublin General Plan | Community Design & Sustainability Element                         10–27

            cut-throughs should ensure compliance with “Crime Prevention Through Environmental
            Design (CPTED)” principles and accessibility for public safety vehicles.
       2.	 New residential collector streets should have a minimum 5’ wide sidewalk or multi-use
            path, 4’ parkway strip with street trees at intervals averaging no more than 40 feet, and
            a bike lane that is separate from on-street parking and travel lanes.
       3.	 New non-residential Class I and Class II collector streets should have a minimum 8’ wide
            sidewalk or multi-use path, 4’ parkway strip with street trees at intervals averaging no
            more than 40 feet, a bike lane that is separate from on-street parking and travel lanes,
            and a raised median.
       4.	 New arterial streets should have a minimum 10’ wide sidewalk or multi-use path,
            generous parkway strip with street trees at intervals averaging no more than 40 feet, a
            bike lane that is separate from on-street parking and travel lanes, and a raised median.
       5.	 All streets at the perimeter of a school site should have a minimum 10’ wide sidewalk or
            multi-use path, 4’ parkway strip with street trees at intervals averaging no more than 40
            feet, and a bike lane that is separate from on-street parking and travel lanes, regardless
            of the street type.
       6.	 In areas of residential development, intersections should occur every 600’ on average
            and at 800’ maximum. Non-vehicular intersections (e.g. separated pedestrian/ bicycle
            paths or trails) may count towards fulfilling these average and maximum requirements.
   D.	 A pedestrian and bicycle accessibility plan shall be provided for new neighborhoods. The plan
       should illustrate the continuous pedestrian and bicycle connections throughout the project
       site, highlighting the connections to school sites, public spaces, and civic/semi-public uses in
       particular.

             it is accessible to the general public.
         2.	 Design neighborhoods so that a park, civic, semi-public, or publicly-accessible recreational
             facility at least one acre in size with either indoor or outdoor recreational amenities, lies
             within a ½-mile walk distance of 75% of planned and existing residences and commercial
             businesses. Recreational facilities must include some physical improvements and may
             include “tot lots,” swimming pools, sports fields, community buildings or recreation
             centers, or can be any public park. The recreational facility can be either a public park
             (if it is in compliance with the Parks and Recreation Master Plan) or privately-owned, as
             long as it is accessible to the general public. It can be a facility that charges a fee for use.
    B.	 For all residential uses within ¼ mile of a BART station, 25 units per net acre is the minimum
         density goal, and for all residential uses within ½ mile of a BART station, 10 units per net
         acre is the minimum density goal. Higher densities within ½ mile of a regional transit station
         are encouraged.
   City of Dublin General Plan | Community Design & Sustainability Element                            10–29

    C.	 Identify a “Transit Hub” in any new neighborhood that has 500+ residential units and is
        located more than one mile from a regional transit station. A Transit Hub would be a central
        location in the project where pedestrian trails, bike lanes, and streets converge at a central
        transit stop. If bus service is to be provided to the project area, the Transit Hub would be the
        location to put the bus stop, bicycle parking, and bus shelter. There is no minimum size for a
        Transit Hub and its ideal location is adjacent to an open space, park, or public/civic facility.
10.8.9 	 INTENT: ACCESS TO SCHOOLS	
Create neighborhoods that benefit from well-located and easily-accessible school sites by locating
schools on safe, yet connected thoroughfares and by minimizing the distance from school sites for
the maximum number of likely students (e.g. adjacent to attached and detached single family homes)
10.8.10 	 GOAL: ACCESS TO SCHOOLS	
Integrate schools safely and effectively into the neighborhood street and land use pattern.
10.8.11 	 POLICIES: ACCESS TO SCHOOLS	
    A.	 New school sites shall be chosen for maximum safety and accessibility for students.
10.8.12 	 IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES: ACCESS TO SCHOOLS	
    A.	 School sites shall be located and designed for accessibility to the maximum number of likely
        students. Although frontage on two streets is needed, school sites are ideally not located at
        the intersection of two Class I collector streets, and the site must be designed and located so
        that pedestrians and cyclists can easily reach the site via safe bike lanes, multi-use paths, and
        sidewalks.
    B.	 Design a neighborhood such that at least 50% of any attached and detached single-family
        residential units are within a ½ mile walking distance of any new elementary or middle
        school site on the project site.
    C.	 For projects that do not involve the creation of a new school site, locate attached and
        detached single-family residential units in areas within the project that facilitates the most
        direct walking route to existing school site(s). Streets within and/or bordering the project
        area that lead from new dwelling units to an existing school site (or dedicated future school
        site) should be designed to have a complete network of multi-use paths or sidewalks on at
        least one side and either bicycle lanes or traffic control and/or calming measures.

               City of Dublin
            General Plan
                  Chapter 11
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
              ELEMENT

11.1	        INTRODUCTION 	
The Economic Development Element guides the City of Dublin’s efforts to foster business expansion
and job growth, providing a framework for economic development programs and activities. While the
Economic Development Element does not explicitly seek to generate fiscal benefits accruing to the
City of Dublin, increased net tax revenue is a likely byproduct of the policies. The overarching objective
of the Economic Development Element is to enhance the competitiveness of the City of Dublin and to
promote a strong, diverse, and evolving economic base.
11.2 	       ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES	
The City of Dublin desires to undertake economic development activities to improve its competitive
position relative to other California cities. Competitiveness spans a multitude of subjective measures,
including (1) attractiveness to companies, (2) attractiveness to individuals, (3) reputation/brand, and
(4) innovation environment (i.e., potential for home-grown economic development). Maintaining a
competitive position is critical to retaining local businesses and attracting new businesses, thereby
sustaining and growing the local job base with high-value employment opportunities for current and
future residents.
In addition to traditional economic development tools that focus primarily on cost-based incentives
for business, the City of Dublin desires to take a more holistic view of economic competitiveness that
emphasizes the importance of “quality of place” and “quality of life” factors in attracting companies
and individuals. Potentially through physical improvements and other enhancements to community
character, the City seeks to promote and foster a built environment that inspires and supports new
economic opportunities.
Land use is central to the City of Dublin’s capacity to compete for jobs and economic growth.
The community’s ability to develop real estate and public spaces at new and reused sites, locate
interrelated companies near each other, encourage growth at key business nodes, and build vibrant,
engaging, and contemporary places is vital to its competitiveness. Promoting real estate investment
and achieving desirable land use outcomes is critical to positioning Dublin for economic growth
and long-term economic sustainability. In addition, public development of new and reimagined civic
spaces can enhance the City’s attractiveness, reputation, and innovation environment.
11.3 	       RELEVANT PLANS AND POLICES	
Dublin has adopted a number of plans and policies to guide development. Some of these pertain
to the entire City, while others have a specific area of focus. As part of the City of Dublin General
Plan, this Economic Development Element provides goals, policies, and implementation measures that
address the entire City, though some specific goals and policies are geographically targeted. The City’s
General Plan and the Eastern Dublin and Downtown Dublin Specific Plans are most relevant to the
Economic Development Element.
   City of Dublin General Plan | Economic Development Element                                        11–1

A. City of Dublin General Plan
The City’s General Plan is the policy framework for development decisions. It is the highest-level
policy document for the City. State law requires that the general plans include land use, circulation,
open space, conservation, safety, noise, and housing elements. Additional, optional, elements may
be included. All elements of a General Plan are considered equal and all other plans and policies are
required by state law to be consistent with the General Plan. The Economic Development Element is
an optional element of the Dublin General Plan.
The City of Dublin General Plan acknowledges that on the local level, development will be required to
respond to community needs for housing, employment, and leisure opportunities and to the natural
constraints of the area. In particular, regarding employment-supporting uses, the General Plan states
that commercial and employment-generating uses will be located near the freeway and transit lines
to facilitate efficient transportation. Accordingly, the Economic Development Element offers guidance
for economic development activities in these areas, with particular focus on two important locations:
(1) the Eastern Dublin Transit Center and (2) Downtown Dublin. Dublin has developed Specific Plans
that cover both of these workplace locations.
B. Eastern Dublin Specific Plan
The Eastern Dublin Specific Plan (EDSP) provides policy guidance for existing and future development
generally east of the Iron Horse Trail and the Parks Reserve Forces Training Area (Parks RFTA or
Camp Parks). New development in this area requires adoption of Planned Development (PD) zoning,
which includes development regulations, architectural standards, and preliminary landscape plans.
The EDSP provides for employment-generating land uses located on the west side of the planning
area, in close proximity to the BART station and near I-580 and Dublin Boulevard where freeway
access is convenient. In addition to at the Transit Center, the EDSP provides for office space and other
employment-generating uses in additional locations within the Specific Plan area.
C. Downtown Dublin Specific Plan
The Downtown Dublin Specific Plan (DDSP) provides policy guidance, development standards, and
design guidelines for downtown Dublin. The DDSP replaced the Dublin Downtown Specific Plan,
Downtown Core Specific Plan, San Ramon Road Specific Plan, Village Parkway Specific Plan, and West
Dublin BART Specific Plan. The DDSP includes a Retail District, Transit-Oriented District, and Village
Parkway District, each of which allow for office space and other employment-generating land uses,
which contribute to economic development in Dublin.
11.4 	        ORGANIZATION OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT	
This Economic Development Element is organized according to the following structure:
     Goals
Goals are general and serve as a guiding principal for economic development activities.
     Policies
Policies divide the goals into more specific economic development guidelines.

   City of Dublin General Plan | Economic Development Element                                      11–5

11.7.1 	 PARTNER WITH THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SURPLUS PROPERTY
	AUTHORITY	
   A.	Policy
   1.	 The Alameda County Surplus Property Authority (ACSPA) controls land with land use and
        zoning in place for over two million square feet of office development at the Eastern Dublin
        Transit Center, development potential that could support significant future job growth in
        the City. The City shall seek to strengthen its ongoing working relationship and partner with
        ACSPA to position County-owned Eastern Dublin sites as a jobs center for the region.
   B.	 Implementation Measures

        engineering) that could shorten the development project delivery timeline for end users.
   3.	 Explore Potential for Increased Site Marketing: In coordination with ACSPA, explore and
        implement enhanced marketing of development opportunities, as appropriate.
11.7.2 	        SUPPORT DOWNTOWN BUSINESS ATTRACTION AND
	               DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS	
   A.	Policy
   1.	 With the adoption of the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan (DDSP), the City created a vision for
        a vibrant mixed-use center, with opportunities for development of employment-supporting
        uses such as office and retail space. The DDSP strives to create a walkable urban environment
        that when fully realized could have a dramatic positive effect on quality of place and the City’s
        regional competitiveness. To achieve this vision and foster economic development, the City
        shall pursue landowner/business coordination and partnerships to promote the continued
        evolution of the downtown area.

active in downtown development, and in other strategic projects within the City.
11.8.1 	 EXPLORE POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES AND FINANCING 	
	             TOOLS TO ADVANCE REAL ESTATE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
     A.	Policy
     1.	 A primary challenge associated with positioning opportunity areas for new development
         is obtaining reliable financial resources for place-making investments, potentially including
         creation of public spaces (e.g., parks, plazas, and public art), streetscape and gateway
         improvements, infrastructure, public parking, or other strategic investments (e.g., subsidies
         for catalytic projects). The City should seek sources of funds and consider available financing
         mechanisms for strategic projects.

 RESOURCES MANAGEMENT:
WATER RESOURCES ELEMENT

12.1 	        INTRODUCTION	
An adequate and high quality water supply is considered a basic need, and the use and quality
of water has long been regulated by government. Since water moves easily across jurisdictional
boundaries, much of the regulation is at the regional, state and federal levels. However, since cities
and counties have legal authority over development and land use, they must consider the adequacy
of water supplies and how development affects the quantity and quality of water available for other
beneficial uses.
The long term adequacy of groundwater and surface water resources has become a major public
concern in California. Water related issues include lowered groundwater levels and salt loading,
increased stormwater runoff, sediment and pollutants in runoff, water diversions into and out of the
watershed of the greater San Francisco Bay Area, summer rationing in dry years, the water needs
of fish and wildlife, the rates of water usage, conservation methods, water storage limitations, the
growing re-use of water and continuing changes in state and federal regulations.
The City of Dublin does not control the supply or the delivery of water to customers, nor does the City
control cost and pricing mechanisms related to water supply. The City does not manage regional flood
control facilities either. However, the City works in collaboration with other agencies that provide
these services, and therefore the scope of the Water Resources Element reflects this reality. The scope
of City influence extends mainly to promoting and encouraging water conservation among business
and residential users, implementing Low Impact Development measures to help treat stormwater, as
well as managing the stormwater runoff and pipelines that lead to flood control facilities. The Water
Resources Element is intended to guide these efforts.
12.1.1 	 PURPOSE 	
The primary purpose of this element and the reason for including this optional Element in the
Dublin General Plan is to ensure that the City’s water resources are sustained and protected, and to
consolidate information and polices related to the conservation and management of water resources,
riparian corridors, and watershed lands. The Water Resources Element also defines the stormwater
facilities needed to serve Dublin at buildout of the General Plan.
12.1.2 	 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS 	
California Government Code Section 65302 requires a Land Use Element that includes the location
and extent of various land uses, and a Conservation Element that includes water and its hydraulic
force, rivers and other waters. Section 65302 also states that the Conservation Element may cover
control of streams and other waters, protection of watersheds, and flood control. Note, however, that
Government Code Section 65301(a) allows a legislative body to adopt a General Plan in any format
deemed appropriate or convenient.
Some other water-related topics are addressed in other Elements. Water availability as a factor in future
development is addressed in the Land Use Element. The Conservation Element addresses riparian
corridors and erosion/siltation control. The Schools, Public Lands, and Utilities Element addresses
   City of Dublin General Plan | Water Resources Element                                            12–1

water supply and connections to public water systems. The Public Safety Element addresses flood
hazards, fire suppression, and hazardous materials.
The Water Resources Element has been developed to be consistent with and complementary to other
Elements. References to policies in other Elements are provided where they support or implement the
objectives of the Water Resources Element.
1.3 Scope and Organization
The Water Resources Element is organized as follows:
Section 2 reviews the Legislation and the Regulatory Environment, Water Sources, Water Demand and
Use, Conservation and Efficiency, and how to ensure Water Quality and Manage Urban Runoff.
Section 3 includes the City’s policies to manage water resources, use water efficiently, and ensure
water quality, flood protection, and manage stormwater.
12.2 	        BACKGROUND	
12.2.1 	 KEY LEGISLATION AND THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT	
The regulatory environment for water resources can generally be divided into three categories: water
supply, water use and conservation, and water quality management. Recent legislation is described
briefly below, which explains what is required by mandate and offers insight into why Dublin has
some of the ordinances and requirements that it does.
Water Supply Legislation
In 2001, two water supply planning bills were enacted that require greater coordination and more
data to be shared between water suppliers and local land use agencies for large development projects.
Senate Bill 610 requires a Water Supply Assessment (WSA) for any development project of more than
500 housing units (or the commercial/mixed-use equivalent). The WSA needs to be part of any CEQA
document prepared for the project. If there is not adequate water to reliably supply the project in
normal, dry, and multiple dry years, new water sources need to be identified.
Senate Bill 221 prohibits any land use agency from approving a subdivision map of more than 500
housing units (or 10% increase in the total number of existing water connections) unless there is
written verification from a water provider that a sufficient and reliable water supply is available.
Water Use and Conservation Legislation
Senate Bill X7-7 was enacted in November 2009, requiring all water suppliers to increase water use
efficiency. The legislation sets a statewide goal of reducing per capita urban water use by 20% by
December 31, 2020. Collectively, the State of California shall make incremental progress towards this
goal by reducing per capita water use by at least 10% by December 31, 2015.
Assembly Bill 1881, the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act of 2006, requires that local jurisdictions
12–2                                          City of Dublin General Plan | Water Resources Element

prepare and adopt a Water Efficient Landscaping Ordinance (WELO). The intent of requiring a WELO
for each California jurisdiction is to ensure the installation of water efficient landscapes in new
development and to reduce water waste in existing landscapes.
Water Quality Legislation
The federal Clean Water Act (CWA) was amended in 1987 to address urban stormwater runoff pollution
of the nation’s waters. In 1990, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated rules
establishing Phase 1 of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) stormwater
program.
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board issued the Alameda Countywide NPDES Municipal
Stormwater Permit in 2003 to the Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program, of which Dublin is a
member. In October 2009, the California Regional Water Quality Contro Board issued the Municipal
Regional Stormwater NPDES Permit to the Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program, as well as
to permittees in Contra Costa County, Santa Clara County, San Mateo County, Fairfield-Suisun, and
Vallejo. Provision C.3 of the permit requires all jurisdictions to use their planning authorities to include
appropriate source control, site design, and stormwater treatment measures in development projects
to address both soluble and insoluble stormwater runoff pollutant discharges and prevent increases
in runoff flows from new development and redevelopment projects. This goal is to be accomplished
primarily through the implementation of low impact development (LID) techniques.
12.2.2 	 WATER SUPPLY 	
Potable Water
The Dublin San Ramon Services District (DSRSD) is
the water retailer for residents in the City of Dublin
and the Dougherty Valley portion of the City of San
Ramon. DSRSD buys wholesale potable water from
Zone 7 of the Alameda County Flood Control and
Water Conservation District (also referred to as the
Zone 7 Water Agency, or Zone 7). Zone 7 obtains
water most of its water supply from the State Water
Project (SWP), with additional supplies derived from
the local watershed and the Byron Bethany Irrigation District. Zone 7 uses the main groundwater
aquifers in the Tri Valley area to store imported water. Approximately eighty percent of the valley’s water
                                                  comes from the SWP, traveling from the Sierra Nevada
                                                  mountains through Lake Oroville and the Sacramento/
                                                  San Joaquin Delta. The water is then pumped into the
                                                  South Bay Aqueduct near Tracy, where it enters the Tri-
                                                  Valley. Zone 7 also pumps DSRSD’s groundwater quota
                                                  for delivery to DSRSD customers.

Recycled Water
To improve the reliability of the Tri-Valley’s water supply, particularly in dry years, DSRSD and East Bay
Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) created the San Ramon Valley Recycled Water Program (SRVRWP) in
1995. The partnership has built a water recycling plant adjacent to the DSRSD wastewater treatment
facility and a backbone transmission system that connects to DSRSD and EBMUD recycled pipelines.
DSRSD personnel operate these facilities on behalf of the partnership. Recycled water is used in the Tri
Valley area primarily by large irrigation customers: golf courses, parks, greenbelts, roadway medians,
schools, office complexes, and common areas in homeowner associations. A joint powers authority,
the DSRSD-EBMUD Recycled Water Authority (DERWA), governs the partnership. Two directors from
each agency serve on the DERWA Board of Directors.
Wastewater Collection and Treatment
DSRSD owns and operates sewers in the cities of Dublin and San Ramon and a wastewater treatment
plant in the City of Pleasanton. Under contract, DSRSD also treats wastewater collected by the City of
Pleasanton. DSRSD’s service area is shown in Figure 12-1.

Two wastewater treatment plants serve Tri-Valley residents, businesses, and institutions. DSRSD
operates the plant located in the City of Pleasanton, which has a capacity of 17 million gallons per
day (MGD). The City of Livermore operates the other plant, which has a capacity of 8 MGD. Regional
wastewater disposal matters are the business of the Livermore Amador Valley Water Management
Agency (LAVWMA), a joint powers authority formed in June 1974 between DSRSD and the cities of
Pleasanton and Livermore. LAVWMA is responsible for maintaining the pipeline that transports treated
wastewater from the two treatment plants to San Lorenzo. It is discharged into San Francisco Bay by
the East Bay Dischargers Authority, another joint powers authority formed by cities and agencies in
the East Bay, which operates and maintains a large outfall system to the Bay.
12.2.3 	 WATER DEMAND AND USE	
Potable and Recycled water use in Dublin has generally risen from 2002-2012, as illustrated in the
table below. Much of this increased water usage is the result of planned growth.

The largest categorical consumer of water is residential users, and more specifically, single-family
residential users. Although the total water demand over the past 10 years has increased for the
single-family residential category, the total number of single-family households has increased at a
greater rate than the total water demand rate. Therefore, the average annual consumption of a single-
family household has decreased from 140,700 gallons per year in 2002 to 117,200 gallons per year
in 2012 (Source: DSRSD, 2013). This 16.4% decrease in the average household consumption is due
to many factors, including a greater use of water efficient features, installation of more water-efficient
landscapes, and greater public education regarding the importance of water conservation.
12.2.4 	 WATER CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY	
DSRSD has a comprehensive Water Conservation Program in place that includes both supply- and
    City of Dublin General Plan | Water Resources Element                                            12–5

demand-side measures, including audits, incentives, optimal management practices, enforcing
wastewater and landscape regulations, education programs, support activities, metering, and pipe
replacement. DSRSD also recommends that local cities require water conservation measures as a
standard feature in the design and construction of proposed development projects.
The City of Dublin currently utilizes several means to promote water conservation and efficiency in
new development:
     •	 Implementation of Chapter 8.88
          of the Municipal Code (Water
          Efficient Landscape Regulations)
          which requires that development
          projects of a certain size and
          scope be designed with landscape
          materials and maintenance that
          is sensitive to reducing water
          use. Chapter 8.88 conforms to
          the state mandate to either have
          a local Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance or require that new projects conform to the
          statewide Water Efficient Landscape requirements.
     •	 Implementation of Chapter 7.94 of the Municipal Code (Dublin Green Building Code), with the
          purpose of enhancing the design and construction of buildings and encouraging sustainable
          construction practices in several categories including water efficiency and conservation.
     •	 Participation and collaboration with outside organizations and agencies on programs to
          educate the public and provide hands-on assistance to increase water conservation efforts.
The City is also committed to conserving water to the greatest degree
possible in public facilities such as community buildings and parks. The
City follows the requirements of the Water Efficient Landscape Regulations
at all civic sites and implements the recommendations of the Bay Friendly
Landscape Guidelines for water-efficient landscapes. In addition, the City
has been aggressive in utilizing water efficient appliances and features
in the construction of new civic buildings and when remodeling existing
facilities. For example, the Shannon Community Center was designed and
constructed to LEED Silver certification standards, and included several
water conservation elements that contributed to that effort.
12.2.5 	 WATER QUALITY, FLOOD PROTECTION, AND STORMWATER	
	MANAGEMENT	
Historically, the Tri-Valley has experienced relatively frequent, but substantial, flooding because many
streams which drain large areas of impermeable soils converge in the area. During periods of intense
rainfall, runoff rapidly causes some stream flows to exceed floodway capacities and inundate adjacent
areas.

                                                                            with many other areas of
                                                                            California.
                                                                            Responsibility for flood
                                                                            protection in Dublin lies with
                                                                            Zone 7, which maintains
improved flood-control channels and installs new drainage channels. Under Zone 7 permits,
development projects have improved many of the existing channels and have created new flood
protection facilities. Zone 7 continues to work with local jurisdictions and the development community
to identify means and methods to provide greater flood protection in its service area. In 2006, Zone
7 adopted the Stream Management Master Plan (SMMP), which incorporates multi-benefit projects
to address flood protection.
The local storm drainage system consists of underground pipes, local channels and watercourses,
and vegetated swales throughout newer neighborhoods. These facilities carry water runoff within the
drainage basin to the flood-control channels and further to regional stormwater facilities. Developers of
new projects must install adequately-sized storm drains to connect to the City’s existing underground
storm drain network.
To accommodate future buildout in accordance with the General Plan, the City will continue to require
that new developments install appropriately-sized storm drains. The City also schedules improvements
to older portions of the storm drain network through the City’s Capital Improvement Program.
Dublin currently utilizes several means and methods to ensure that the City’s stormwater is properly
managed and treated by the time it enters regional flood control facilities in compliance with NPDES
and other required permits:
     •	 Implementation of Chapter 7.20 of the Municipal Code (Watercourse Protection), which is
         enacted to safeguard and preserve watercourses, protect lives and property, prevent damage
         due to flooding, protect drainage facilities, control erosion and sedimentation, restrict
         discharge of polluted materials, and enhance recreational and beneficial uses of watercourses.
     •	 Implementation of Chapter 7.74 of the Municipal Code (Stormwater Management and
         Discharge Control Ordinance), which is designed to ensure the future health, safety and
         general welfare of Dublin citizens by eliminating non-stormwater discharges to the municipal
         storm drain system and reducing pollutants in stormwater discharges to the maximum extent
         practicable;
   City of Dublin General Plan | Water Resources Element                                              12–7

   •	 Implementation of the Dublin Clean Water Program, which is a federally-mandated program
       under the federal Clean Water Act. The purpose of the Clean Water Program is to eliminate
       pollutants, such as oil, dirt, pesticides, litter, and other similar contaminants, from entering
       the storm drain system so only clean water enters our waterways and ultimately the San
       Francisco Bay. The City conducts public education and outreach efforts as well as responds to
       reports of clean water violations; and
   •	 Monitoring construction sites to ensure adequate Best Management Practices (BMPs) are
       implemented to reduce water pollution during construction in compliance with the State
       General Construction Permit issued by the California State Water Resources Control Board.

   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 Retrofit existing parks with new irrigation controllers that link to a centralized irrigation
        system that downloads daily weather reports from a local weather station and adjusts the
        amount of irrigated water applied to each park each day.
   2.	 At the completion of each public construction and/or capital improvement project, conduct
        an irrigation audit to ensure proper water utilization.
   3.	 Ensure that future publicly-owned facilities (e.g. street medians, park sites) have a healthy
        growing environment by receiving soil that is appropriate to support plant growth. The soil is
        typically provided by the developer dedicating the median and/or park site, so the soil to be
        provided shall meet City standards.
   4.	 Continue to demonstrate low water-use techniques at public parks and other City-owned
        facilities.
   5.	 During construction or reconstruction of public facilities, institute water conservation measures
        such as hot-on-demand water faucets, low-flush toilets, and low water-using appliances to
        the greatest degree possible.
   6.	 In the design and construction of all public facilities, utilize Bay Friendly Landscape Guidelines
        for water-wise landscaping.
   7.	 When recycled water lines are extended to established areas in Dublin, examine retrofitting
        public facilities and connecting existing public landscape irrigation systems to the recycled
        water distribution system.

12.3.5 	 WATER QUALITY, FLOOD PROTECTION, AND STORMWATER 	
	MANAGEMENT	
   A.	 Guiding Policies
   1.	 Protect the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater resources that serve the
       community.
   2.	 Protect water quality by minimizing stormwater runoff and providing adequate stormwater
       facilities.
   3.	 To minimize flooding in existing and future development, design stormwater facilities to
       handle design-year flows based on buildout of the General Plan.
   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 Support Zone 7’s efforts to complete planned regional storm drainage improvements.
   2.	 With the goal of minimizing impervious surface area, encourage design and construction
       of new streets to have the minimum vehicular travel lane width possible while still meeting
       circulation, flow, and safety requirements for all modes of transportation.
   3.	 Discourage additional parking over and above the required minimum parking standards for
       any land use unless the developer can demonstrate a need for additional parking.
   4.	 Conserve the City’s urban forest, including trees in parks as well as street trees, so as to
       continue and enhance surface water filtration and community character.
   5.	 Review design guidelines and standard details to ensure that developers can incorporate
       clean water runoff requirements into their projects.
   6.	 Maximize the runoff directed to permeable areas or to stormwater storage by appropriate site
       design and grading, using appropriate detention and/or retention structures, and orienting
       runoff toward permeable surfaces designed to manage water flow.
   7.	 Review development plans to minimize impervious surfaces and generally maximize
       infiltration of rainwater in soils, where appropriate. Strive to maximize permeable areas to
       allow more percolation of runoff into the ground through such means as bioretention areas,
       green strips, planter strips, decomposed granite, porous pavers, swales, and other water-
       permeable surfaces. Require planter strips between the street and the sidewalk within the
       community, wherever practical and feasible.
   8.	 Continue conducting construction site field inspections to ensure proper erosion control
       and materials/waste management implementation to effectively prohibit non-stormwater
       discharges.
   9.	 Support Zone 7 in updating and implementing its Stream Management Master Plan so as to
       protect and enhance the water quality of streams and groundwater.
   10.	Ensure adequate setbacks from creeks/waterways and development. Retain existing
       vegetation where feasible and, where necessary, plant buffers with native plant species.

             General Plan
                  Chapter 13
        ENVIRONMENTAL
RESOURCES MANAGEMENT:
   ENERGY CONSERVATION
               ELEMENT

13.1	INTRODUCTION	
13.1.1	 THE NEED FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION	
Increasing energy efficiency and the availability of renewable energy has immense potential to both
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and preserve resources. The energy needed to heat, light,
and power buildings within the community is a direct source of GHG emissions. The reduction of GHG
emissions is a cornerstone of the City’s adopted Climate Action Plan and a key goal of the City in the
coming years. Reductions in energy use can be achieved in a variety of ways, which include optimizing
energy efficiency in new construction; retrofitting existing buildings to reduce energy consumption;
promoting energy and water conservation and efficiency; and advancing the use of renewable energy.
Other methods to increase community energy efficiency include subsidizing energy management
services such as energy audits for residents and businesses and ensuring that developers and building
contractors are trained on energy conservation and efficiency.
There are many agencies – both regulatory and service agencies – that play a role in increasing
energy efficiency and decreasing energy consumption at the local level. These agencies include
governmental organizations such as the California Energy Commission (CEC), the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC), and the energy provider in the City of Dublin: Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E).
The CPUC’s 2011 California Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan envisions that, by 2020, California’s
local governments will be leaders in using energy efficiency to reduce energy use and global
warming emissions both in their own facilities and throughout their communities. The CPUC sees
local governments taking a very active role in enabling the market transformation to greater energy
efficiency through efforts to provide both incentives, as well as regulatory requirements to mandate
decreased energy consumption.
The City of Dublin does not control the supply or the delivery of energy to customers, nor does the
City control cost and pricing mechanisms related to energy supply and delivery. However, the City
works in collaboration with the agencies and organizations that provide and support these services,
and therefore the scope of the Energy Conservation Element reflects this reality. The City’s influence
extends mainly to promoting and encouraging sustainable and reliable energy generation, supporting
the education efforts of other agencies, and promoting energy conservation among business and
residential users. The Energy Conservation Element is intended to guide these efforts.
13.1.2	 PURPOSE 	
The primary purpose and reason for including this optional element in the Dublin General Plan is to
ensure that the City is taking an active role in encouraging and promoting energy conservation at
every level, and to consolidate information and polices related to energy supply, current conservation
programs, and opportunities for future improvements.

13.1.3	 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS AND OTHER	
	            CITY DOCUMENTS	
California Government Code Section 65302 requires a General Plan Land Use Element that includes
the location and extent of various land uses and a Conservation Element that addresses certain key
topic areas. Government Code Section 65301(a) allows a legislative body to adopt a General Plan
with any additional elements in any format deemed appropriate or convenient.
The Energy Conservation Element has been developed to be consistent with, and complementary
to, other General Plan Elements. References to policies in other Elements are provided where they
support or implement the objectives of the Energy Conservation Element.
Other relevant City policy documents that address energy conservation include the 2013 Climate
Action Plan Update, Dublin Green Plan (approved in 2011), the Energy Action Plan (completed in
2012), and the City’s Green Building Code.
13.1.4	       SCOPE AND ORGANIZATION 	
The Energy Conservation Element is organized as follows:
Section 2 reviews the Legislation and the Regulatory Environment, Energy Supply, Energy Demand,
and Energy Efficiency and Conservation Efforts (both underway and planned for the future).
Section 3 includes the City’s guiding and implementing policies for Energy Conservation in Existing
Development, New Development, and Public Facilities.
13.2	BACKGROUND	
13.2.1	 KEY LEGISLATION AND THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT	
The regulatory environment for energy use can generally be divided into two categories: energy
supply and energy use/conservation. Salient legislation is described briefly below, which explains
what is required by mandate and offers insight into why Dublin has some of the ordinances and
requirements that it does.
Energy Supply Legislation
Senate Bill 1078, Senate Bill 107, and Executive Order S-14-08—the Renewables
Portfolio Standards. In 2002, the California Senate passed SB 1078 requiring public utilities to
gradually increase the percentage of their energy supply generated from renewable sources, reaching
20% renewable content by 2017. SB 107 accelerated the time frame of SB 1078 for it to take
effect in 2010. In November of 2008, Executive Order S-14-08 was signed, which increased the
amount of renewable power generation to 33% by 2020. Renewable energy could include wind,
solar, geothermal, or any “Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS)-eligible” sources. This means that,
over time, an increasingly larger share of the energy provided to homes and businesses in the City of
Dublin will be generated with clean power.
13–2                                     City of Dublin General Plan | Energy Conservation Element

Assembly Bill 811, the Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) bill. The passage of this bill
authorized all California cities and counties to designate areas within which willing property owners
could enter into contractual assessments to finance the installation of distributed renewable energy
generation, as well as energy efficiency improvements, that are permanently fixed to the property
owner’s residential, commercial, industrial, or other real property. These financing arrangements allow
property owners to finance renewable generation and energy efficiency improvements through low-
interest loans that would be repaid as an item on the property owner’s property tax bill.
Assembly Bill 117, Community Choice Aggregation. Signed into law in 2002, Assembly Bill
117, also known as Community Choice Aggregation (CCA), enables California cities and counties that
form a joint powers authority to provide electricity to customers within their jurisdiction(s). Unlike a
municipal utility, the CCA administrator is responsible for choosing the source of the power supplied
to CCA customers, but does not deliver that power to customers. Instead, the investor-owned utility,
e.g. PG&E, is required to deliver the power to CCA customers over their transmission and distribution
lines, charging CCA customers for this service. Under AB 117, the investor-owned utility is also
required to provide metering, billing and collection services to CCA customers.
Energy Use and Conservation Legislation
Assembly Bill 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. The passage of this
bill in 2006 amplified the need for intensive energy efficiency efforts across California. The California
Air Resources Board‘s (CARB) Draft Scoping Plan for Assembly Bill (AB) 32 implementation states
that while “California has a long history of success in implementing regulations and programs to
encourage energy efficiency . . . [it] will need to greatly expand those efforts to meet our greenhouse
gas emission reduction goals.” The Scoping Plan is currently being revised at the State level.
Title 24. Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations is a statewide standard applied at the local
level by local agencies through building permits. It mandates how each new home and business is
built in California. It includes requirements for the structural, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical
systems of buildings and for fire and life safety, energy conservation, green design, and accessibility
in and around buildings. For purposes of this element, the most applicable parts of Title 24 are Part 6
(the California Energy Code) and Part 11 (the California Green Building Standards Code).
Executive Order S-20-04 – Energy Efficiency in State Buildings. Executive Order S-20-04 was
signed July 27, 2004, and directs the State to commit to aggressive actions to reduce the electricity
use of state buildings by implementing cost-effective energy efficiency and green building strategies.
To this end, the executive order directs all facilities owned, funded, or leased by the State (and
encourages cities, counties, and school districts as well) to take measures to reduce grid-based energy
purchases by 20% by 2015. This is to be done through cost-effective measures to increase energy
efficiency and distributed generation technologies. These measures include designing, constructing,
and operating all new and renovated facilities owned by the State and paid for with State funds as
buildings certified “LEED Silver” or higher; seeking out office space leases in buildings with a EPA
ENERGY STAR rating; and purchasing or operating ENERGY STAR electrical equipment whenever
cost-effective.

13.2.2	 ENERGY SUPPLY	
Electricity
The City’s electric power is supplied by a combination of private suppliers which sell power to PG&E
for resale. It is PG&E’s distribution system that provides electricity directly to the residential and
commercial customers. The electricity is transported via a network of high-voltage transmission lines.
Most electric power is brought to electric substations in the region via transmission lines connected to
the statewide grid system. Electric power capacity is looked at on a subregional (rather than citywide)
basis. Local electrical capacity is a function of (1) transmission network capacity to bring this power
to Dublin and the greater Tri-Valley area, (2) capacity of the local substations to lower the voltages
(or step down the power) to deliverable suitable voltage, and (3) the ability of the local distribution
network to deliver adequate power to customers.
Natural Gas
Natural gas is a fossil fuel made of decomposed plant and animal material and is usually found near
a petroleum reservoir. Natural gas is pumped from the underground reservoir into large transmission
pipelines which transport the gas to local distribution pipelines. Some local distribution systems lead
to underground storage. These natural gas storage areas are utilized during seasonal peaks. PG&E is
the retailer for natural gas, which is delivered via their system directly to residential and commercial
customers.
Alternative Sources
Heat and/or light collected from the sun produces solar energy. Common uses of solar energy are
solar water heating systems, which use the sun to heat water, and photovoltaic facilities, which
convert sunlight into energy. The climate in the East Bay, and more specifically in the Tri-Valley, is quite
suitable for the implementation of solar energy technologies.
In early 2014, PG&E reached an important milestone – the utility delivered 22.5 percent of its power
from eligible renewable resources. The utility is continuing to add more renewable energy to the
power mix under California’s renewable portfolio standard and is expected to reach 33 percent
renewables by the end of 2020. PG&E is investing in a range of clean energy resources such as solar,
wind, geothermal, biomass and small hydroelectric power.
In addition to more alternative sources being used by the utility provider, individual properties
are increasingly generating their own power and drawing less off the grid. Every year, solar water
heating systems are installed in Dublin homes, most often to heat pools. However, there have also
been a number of large-scale solar installations on non-residential buildings, most notably at the
Alameda County Santa Rita Jail, which has a solar energy system of 1.14 Megawatts. The system
covers approximately three acres of the jail’s roof, and, at the time it was installed, was the fourth-
largest solar photovoltaic system in the world. Additionally, Carl Zeiss, the Dublin Ranch Golf Club
Homeowners Association, American Swim Academy, Downtown Safeway, and Big O Tires all have
solar installations that offset – or in some cases, provides all – the power needed to the business.

Wind energy is also a viable option in Dublin, which has conditions that are conducive to energy
derived from this source. There are no wind energy facilities in the City, although the installation of
small wind turbines is currently being considered on a few different commercial project sites.
13.2.3	 ENERGY CONSUMPTION	
In 2013, the City’s Climate Action Plan was updated. The document contained data on the total
energy consumption in Dublin, as shown in Table 13.1, below:
        Table 13.1 | ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN 2010
      SECTOR                  ELECTRICITY CONSUMED                                   NATURAL GAS CONSUMED
  Residential        100,679,670 kWh                                       Not reported
  Commercial/
  Industrial         178,203,608 kWh                                       Not reported

  facilities         2,566,566 kWh                                         50,604 therms
  Public lighting
  (street lights,
  traffic signals)   2,696,580 kWh                                         None
  Source: Climate Action Plan Update (2013)
  Notes: kWh = Kilowatt (power equal to 1,000 watts) hour
           Therm = a unit of heat is equal to 100,000 British thermal units (BTU)
The Climate Action Plan noted that, between 2005 and 2010, residential electricity use increased
by 11%, residential natural gas use increased by 16%, commercial and industrial electricity use
decreased by 2%, and commercial and industrial natural gas use increased by 13%. However, these
increases roughly correlate with the 21% increase in population that Dublin experienced in the same
five-year period.
13.2.4	 ENERGY CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY	
       •	 The City of Dublin currently utilizes several means to promote energy conservation and
             efficiency in new and existing buildings:
       •	 Implementation of Chapter 7.94 of the Municipal Code (Dublin Green Building Code), with the
             purpose of enhancing the design and construction of buildings and encouraging sustainable
             construction practices in several categories including water efficiency and conservation. The
             Green Building Code was adopted in 2009 and requires residential projects over 20 units to
             reach 50 points on the GreenPoint Rated system. Alternatively, LEED for Homes, or another
             equivalent rating system, can be utilized if approved by the Building Official. The majority of
             new residential projects within the City are subject to the Green Building Ordinance. There
             are few to no planned residential projects within the City that are 20 units or less.
       •	 Implementation of the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, also known as the
             “Cal Green” Code, which was adopted by the City and became effective January 1, 2014.
     City of Dublin General Plan | Energy Conservation Element                                            13–5

         This code requires efficiency measures to reduce energy use, water consumption, and will
         encourage alternate means of transportation, which will also provide energy reduction
         benefits.
    •	 Participation and collaboration with outside organizations and agencies on programs to
         educate the public and provide hands-on assistance to increase energy conservation efforts
         such as:
              a.	 Supporting the StopWaste-initiated Energy Upgrade California program, which has
                  been established throughout Alameda County to support retrofitting existing buildings
                  to increase energy efficiency, water and resource conservation, and improve indoor
                  air quality and health. The program provides a standardized countywide approach
                  that identifies specific green retrofits to improve existing buildings. The City supports
                  and continues to promote the program.
              b.	 Promoting solar installation within the community by providing information for
                  businesses and residents with information to help make decisions about investing
                  in a photovoltaic (PV) solar system. Furthermore, the City is a participant in the
                  CaliforniaFIRST program, which provides access to financial assistance for business
                  owners seeking to install PV systems.
              c.	 Partnering with Rising Sun Energy Center to promote energy conservation and
                  sustainable living via a youth employment program, known as California Youth Energy
                  Services (CYES). The CYES program is a youth and young adult summer employment
                  and training program open to those who are 15–22 years old. The CYES program
                  trains and employs local youth to provide resource conservation audits and retrofits
                  to local residences in the form of a Green House Call.
              d.	 Promoting the use of PG&E’s online MyEnergy tool, which allows users to track their
                  personal energy use and adopt behaviors that reduce energy use. By using the tool,
                  residential and commercial customers in Dublin can easily monitor the energy use
                  of their home or office, compare the energy use of their building to that of similar
                  buildings, and set goals for personal energy reduction. MyEnergy also provides users
                  with ways to reduce energy use with little or no cost.
    •	 Implementation of the City’s reduced building permit fee for the installation of photovoltaic
         systems as an incentive for property owners to install solar electricity generating capacity on
         their homes and businesses.
    •	 Implementation of the LED streetlight specification that requires all new development projects
         to install LED streetlights.
    •	 Retrofitting existing parks with new irrigation controllers that link to a centralized irrigation
         system that downloads daily weather reports from a local weather station and adjusts the
         amount of irrigated water applied to each park each day.
The City is also committed to energy conservation to the greatest degree possible in City-owned
public facilities such as community buildings and parks. In May 2011, with the help of Chevron
Energy Solutions (Chevron ES), the City conducted an energy audit of all City facilities. From that
audit, several recommendations were made for projects that would incorporate energy conservation
measures as well as renewable energy options. Specifically, the Chevron ES evaluation examined the
13–6                                        City of Dublin General Plan | Energy Conservation Element

potential for the following types of energy efficiency and alternative energy measures:
     •	 Lighting fixtures and controls
     •	 Building automation and controls
     •	 Air-handling systems
     •	 Equipment modifications
     •	 Heating, cooling and ventilation (HVAC) replacement and/or upgrades
     •	 Street lighting technologies
     •	 Alternative energy production including photovoltaic systems and fuel cells
     •	 Water irrigation systems
As a result of the audit, the City invested in energy efficient upgrades to the following facilities:
Street Lights – Citywide: Over 3,100 fixtures have been retrofitted. The high-pressure sodium
cobra head lamps have been exchanged for energy-efficient LED streetlights. This conversion has
benefited both the City’s public safety responders as well as the public with improved lighting quality
and reduced energy usage;
Dublin Civic Center: Installation of a 400 kW solar photovoltaic parking lot canopy system reduces
site kWh consumption by 52%, HVAC improvements, window film application to reduce heat
absorption, and interior/exterior lighting upgrades;
Dublin Library: Installation of a 200 kW solar photovoltaic parking lot canopy system reduces site
kWh consumption by 52%, HVAC improvements, and lighting control improvements;
Shannon Community Center and Park: Installation of a 100 kW ground-mounted solar
photovoltaic system reduces site kWh consumption by 66%, HVAC improvements, and interior/
exterior lighting upgrades;
Fire Station 16: Installation of a 25 kW roof-mounted solar photovoltaic system reduces site kWh
consumption by 40%, HVAC improvements, and interior/exterior lighting upgrades;
Fire Station 17: Installation of a 17 kW ground mounted solar photovoltaic system reduces site
kWh consumption by 32% and interior/exterior lighting upgrades;
Fire Station 18: Installation of a 14 kW ground mounted solar photovoltaic system reduces site
kWh consumption by 37% and interior/exterior lighting upgrades;
Dublin Aquatic Center: Installation of a 59 kW ground-mounted shade canopy solar photovoltaic
system reduces site kWh consumption by 46%, solar thermal covers for the pool, upgraded pool
pumps, and interior/exterior lighting upgrades; and
Dublin Senior Center: Installation of a 33 kW roof-mounted solar photovoltaic system reduces site
kWh consumption by 26% and interior/exterior lighting upgrades.
In addition to modifications to existing facilities noted above, the City has been aggressive in
utilizing energy-efficient appliances and features in the construction of new civic buildings and when
remodeling existing facilities. For example, the reconstructed Shannon Community Center, completed
in February 2009, was designed and constructed to LEED Silver certification standards, and included
several energy conservation elements that contributed to that effort.

13.3	         GUIDING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES	
In implementing the policies below, City Staff and decision-makers will consider the potential negative
impacts of clean technology when considering the appropriateness of its application.
13.3.1	 ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION IN EXISTING 	
	DEVELOPMENT	
     A.	 Guiding Policy
     1.	 Educate Dublin residents and business owners/managers on the variety of energy programs
         available.
     2.	 Encourage energy efficient improvements be made when residential and commercial
         properties change ownership.
     3.	 Explore additional ways to support solar and wind power generation options.
     B.	 Implementing Policies
     1.	 The City shall continue to play an active role in educating residents and businesses about the
         various programs, tools, and incentives of the various agencies and organizations whose main
         function is to encourage and enable energy conservation. The City can continue to promote
         energy saving behaviors through information on the City website, tabling at public events,
         and by promoting competitions to reduce energy use between neighborhoods, among other
         strategies.
     2.	 Encourage businesses and homeowners to participate in energy audits sponsored by PG&E.
         These efficiency reviews serve to educate the business owner/resident/homeowner and
         energy-efficiency strategies and provide information on energy efficient upgrades that may
         be necessary or desirable. The City could consider highlighting successful case studies on the
         City’s website or in newsletter(s).
     3.	 Encourage property owners and managers of commercial and multi-family residential buildings
         and sites to examine the outdoor lighting needs for their sites to determine if adjustments
         can be made and/or retrofits can be done to reduce lighting intensity (as appropriate) and
         utilize the most efficient fixtures.
     4.	 The City could consider highlighting successful case studies, award programs, and other types
         of support for business owners/residents/homeowners making energy efficient upgrades to
         their buildings.
     5.	 Consider creating energy efficient home/business contests to encourage the involvement and
         participation in energy-efficient upgrades.
     6.	 Create a City-wide solar map to educate businesses and residences about the solar potential
         of their properties.

        businesses or individuals that construct or remodel buildings that save more energy than
        required by Title 24 or by the Cal Green Building Code.
   8.	 Continue to implement parking lot tree planting standards that would substantially cool
        parking areas and help cool the surrounding environment. Encourage landscaping conducive
        to solar panels in areas where appropriate.
13.3.2	       ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION IN NEW DEVELOPMENT	
   A.	 Guiding Policy
   1.	 Encourage the installation of alternative energy technology in new residential and commercial
        development.
   2.	 Encourage designing for solar access.
   3.	 Encourage energy efficient improvements be made on residential and commercial properties.
   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 New development proposals shall be reviewed to ensure lighting levels needed for a safe and
        secure environment are provided—utilizing the most energy-efficient fixtures (in most cases,
        LED lights)—while avoiding over-lighting of sites. Smart lighting technology (e.g. sensors
        and/or timers) shall also be employed in interior and exterior lighting applications where
        appropriate.
   2.	New development projects shall install LED streetlights in compliance with the City’s LED
        light standard.
   3.	 In new commercial and residential parking lots, require the installation of conduit to serve
        electric vehicle parking spaces to enable the easier installation of future charging stations.
   4.	 Encourage the installation of charging stations for commercial projects over a certain size
        and any new residential project that has open parking (i.e. not individual, enclosed garages).
   5.	 Encourage buildings (and more substantially, whole neighborhoods) to be designed along an
        east-west axis to maximize solar exposure. Where feasible, require new development projects
        to take advantage of shade, prevailing winds, landscaping and sun screens to reduce energy
        use; and to use regenerative energy heating and cooling source alternatives to fossil fuels.
   6.	 Continue to implement parking lot tree planting standards that would substantially cool
        parking areas and help cool the surrounding environment. Encourage landscaping conducive
        to solar panels in areas where appropriate.
   7.	 Promote and encourage photovoltaic demonstration projects in association with new
        development.
   8.	 Consider creating a recognition program for commercial or residential projects that install
        large-scale solar or wind energy systems and to publicly commend and acknowledge
        businesses or individuals that construct or remodel buildings that save more energy than
        required by Title 24 or by the Cal Green Building Code.

13.3.3	 ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION IN PUBLIC FACILITIES	
The City has demonstrated its commitment to energy efficiency and conservation through the many
efforts that have already taken place. The City has made a substantial investment in solar energy
installations, updating and upgrading lighting and HVAC systems, and reducing water consumption
(with the associated energy savings). The City will continue to be a model for businesses to follow
and will continue to engage in efforts to further decrease energy use in public facilities throughout
the community through the measures below.
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 Serve as a model for residents, local businesses, and public agencies by continuing to reduce
          the City’s demand on energy resources.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 When new buildings are constructed and when equipment is being replaced at existing
          buildings, continue to use the most energy efficient lighting, air conditioning, heating, and
          irrigation systems in City buildings, parks, and facilities.
    2.	 Encourage the design of new City buildings to enable solar access.
    3.	 Design public facilities to incorporate lighting levels needed for a safe and secure environment
          are provided—utilizing the most energy-efficient fixtures—while avoiding over-lighting of
          sites. Smart lighting technology (e.g. sensors and/or timers) shall also be employed in interior
          and exterior lighting applications where appropriate.

                     Chapter 2
LAND USE AND CIRCULATION:
       LAND USE ELEMENT

2.1	          INTRODUCTION 	
Government Code sec. 65302(a) identifies the required content for land use elements. A land use
element must,1) designate the proposed distribution of specified uses and facilities; 2) identify
population density and building intensity standards for each land use district;3) identify areas subject
to flooding and review those areas annually;4) create a timber production land use category where
appropriate; and, 5) consider the impact of new growth on military readiness activities carried out on
military bases, installations, and operating and training areas.
Each of these required features is included in Dublin’s adopted General Plan, although not all are
present in the Land Use Element. Dublin’s General Plan Map for the Primary and Extended Planning
Areas, Figure 1-1, summarizes the proposed distribution of residential, commercial, industrial, and
open space uses. The map also shows existing schools and other public buildings and grounds. Policies
further defining the location and intensity of residential, commercial, and industrial uses appear in
this Land Use Element. Policies relating to open space and parks appear in the Parks and Open Space
Element (Chapter 3); policies relating to schools, and solid and liquid waste disposal facilities appear
in the Schools, Public Lands and Utilities Element (Chapter 4). Background information supporting
the adopted policies is located in the corresponding Land Use, Open Space, and Schools, Public Lands
and Utilities sections of the Technical Supplement.
Population density and building intensity standards are presented in sec. 1.8.1 Land Use Classifications
of Chapter 1. Areas subject to flooding and appropriate land use policies are presented in the Seismic
Safety and Safety Element (Chapter 8). Dublin’s General Plan contains no timber production land use
category because no timberland as described in Government Code sec. 65302(a)(1) occurs anywhere
in the City’s planning area. Policies related to military readiness activities at the Parks Reserve Forces
Training Area can be found in the Schools, Public Lands and Utilities Element (Chapter 4).
The majority of the Primary Planning Area has been developed since the 1960’s; therefore, the Land
Use Element focuses on the remaining uncommitted sites and on the potential for more intensive use
of existing sites. Land use changes in the Eastern Extended Planning Area have been more dramatic
with the implementation of the Eastern Dublin Specific Plan. With the exception of Schaefer Ranch,
development in the Western Extended Planning Area is restricted pursuant to initiative Resolution
209-00 adopted on November 7, 2000, and the Dublin Open Space Initiative of 2014.
2.2	          PRIMARY PLANNING AREA	
The Primary Planning Area has a net acreage of almost 2,500 acres (see Table 2.1 below), and is
largely built out with approximately 9,055 housing units and an estimated population of 24,448. In
2012, the Primary Planning Area had an estimated 12,163 jobs. Table 2.1 shows the minimum and
maximum development potential of each land use classification within the Primary Planning Area
A number of significant changes have occurred in the Primary Planning Area over the last 15 years.
In July 2004, two under-utilized and dilapidated commercial sites were re-designated as Mixed Use
and subsequently underwent redevelopment adding 56 residential units at San Ramon Village Plaza,
and 233 residential units on the former Pak N Save site now known as Tralee. Both sites also include
a retail commercial component in a pedestrian-friendly environment.

Another significant change in the Primary Planning Area is the redevelopment of Arroyo Vista, a 150-
unit affordable housing community which is being reconstructed as Emerald Vista with up to 255
units of both affordable and market-rate housing.
In 2000, in anticipation of the future West Dublin Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Station, a Transit
Oriented District was established in Downtown Dublin to encourage the development of higher density,
mixed- use projects adjacent to mass transit. On February 19, 2011, the West Dublin BART Station
opened to the public. The first high density residential project broke ground in 2012 and will bring
over 300 new residential units to Downtown Dublin. The Downtown Dublin Specific Plan, adopted in
February 2011, allows for the development of up to 1,300 units in Downtown Dublin and capitalizes on
the areas proximity to the West Dublin BART Station. Intensification in and around Downtown Dublin is
expected to continue while the remainder of the Primary Planning Area is expected to remain relatively
unchanged.

2.3	           EASTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA	
The Eastern Extended Planning Area has a net acreage of just over 3,500 acres (see Table 2.2 below),
and is projected to build out in 2035, providing a total of 13,887 residential units with an estimated
population of 37,495 persons (per the Eastern Dublin Specific Plan). The Eastern Extended Planning
Area has a development potential of up to 11.481 million square feet of commercial uses and over
29,714 jobs (per the Eastern Dublin Specific Plan). Table 2.2 sets forth the development potential for
the Eastern Extended Planning Area.
The Eastern Extended Planning Area has been developing rapidly over the past 15 years. Residential
construction has dominated development within the Planning Area and a limited amount of unentitled
residential land remains to be developed. A wide range of housing types have been constructed
including attached and detached units at varying densities in both the ownership and rental markets.
Some undeveloped land designated for Medium and Medium-High Density residential is located
within the Livermore Municipal Airport’s Airport Influence Area (AIA). Any development within the AIA
must be consistent with the adopted Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP) for the Livermore
Municipal Airport.
Development of Campus Office and General Commercial land uses over the past 15 years has been
slow but steady and has provided employment, services and shopping opportunities to meet the
needs of the community. A broad range of non-residential land remains available for development
including Campus Office, General Commercial and Industrial Park uses which will be a significant
source of jobs for the community.

2.4	            WESTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA 	
The Western Extended Planning Area is over 3,000 acres (see Table 2.3 below), of which approximately
2,647 acres lie west of the Urban Limit Line, and have been designated Rural Residential/Agriculture
from the effective date of City Council Resolution 209-00, adopted by initiative on November 7, 2000.
The intent of the Urban Limit Line is to protect the natural resources of the western hills and guide
development to areas of Dublin that are less constrained and where urban services can be provided in
a more efficient and cost-effective manner. In addition to restricting urban development, the City will
not approve or recommend approval of the permanent use or extension of City services or facilities,
including but not limited to, utilities or roads, to support or facilitate urban development beyond the
Urban Limit Line.
Approximately 485 acres lie east of the Urban Limit Line of which 375 acres are Open Space. The
remainder of the Western Extended Planning Area is comprised of the Schaefer Ranch residential
development which has been approved for up to 418 residential units with an estimated population
of 1,131 persons. Table 2.3 sets forth the development potential of the Western Extended Planning
Area.

2.5	              DUBLIN CROSSING PLANNING AREA	
The Dublin Crossing Planning Area is approximately 189 acres that includes 8.7 acres owned by
Alameda County Surplus Property Authority, an 8.9 acre parcel owned by NASA, and an approximately
172 acre portion of the 2,485-acre Camp Parks Reserve Forces Training Area (Camp Parks) in the center
of Dublin, north of Interstate 580 and Dublin Boulevard. The Dublin Crossing Specific Plan addresses
the future development of the project area, which includes demolition of the existing buildings and
other improvements on the site and construction of a residential mixed-use project. The development
potential of the Dublin Crossing Planning Area is noted in Table 2.4.

   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 Allocate medium and medium-high residential densities to development sites in all sectors of
        the Primary Planning Area. Require some of the units approved east of the Dougherty Hills to
        be single family detached.
   2.	 Require a mixture of dwelling types in large projects.
2.6.3	      RESIDENTIAL COMPATIBILITY	
   A.	 Guiding Policy
   1.	 Avoid abrupt transitions between single-family development and higher density development
        on adjoining sites.
   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 Require all site plans to respect the privacy and scale of residential development nearby.
   2.	 Require a planned development zoning process for all development proposals over 6.0 units
        per gross residential acre, except for properties in the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan area.
2.6.4	      EASTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA	
   A.	 Guiding Policies
   1.	 Encourage the development of a balanced mixed use community in the Eastern Extended
        Planning Area, that is well integrated with both natural and urban systems, and provides a
        safe, comfortable and attractive environment for living and working.
            Any sites under Williamson Act contract are required to be maintained as open space for
            the term of the contract.
   2.	 All proposed land uses within the Livermore Municipal Airport, Airport Influence Area (AIA)
        shall be reviewed for consistency with the compatibility policies of the Livermore Municipal
        Airport, Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP).
   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 The location, extent and density of residential development in the Eastern Extended Planning
        Area is set forth in the General Plan Land Use Map in Figure 1-1. The Eastern Dublin Specific
        Plan sets forth more detailed policy direction, infrastructure requirements, and development
        guidelines for the Extended Planning Area.
   2.	 Approval of residential development in the Eastern Extended Planning Area will require
        determination that:
            a.	 Utilities and public safety services will be provided at urban standards without
                 financial burden to Dublin residents and businesses outside the Eastern Extended
                 Planning Area.
            b.	 Proposed site grading and means of access will not disfigure the ridgelands.
            c.	 Timing of development will not result in premature termination of viable agricultural

                operations on adjoining lands.
            d.	 The fiscal impact of new residential development in the Eastern Extended Planning
                Area supports itself and does not draw upon and dilute the fiscal base of the
                remainder of the city.
            e.	 The proposed project is consistent with all applicable General Plan and Specific Plan
                policies.
   3.	 Adopt an Airport Overlay Zoning District to ensure that all proposed development within
       the Airport Influence Area (AIA) is reviewed for consistency with all applicable Livermore
       Municipal Airport, Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP) policies.
2.6.5	      WESTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA 	
   A.	 Guiding Policy
   1.	 Any development in the Western Extended Planning Area shall be integrated with the natural
       setting. Development shall be clustered in areas with fewer constraints.
            a.	 An Urban Limit Line was adopted by initiative on November 7, 2000 for the majority
                of the Western Extended Planning Area. The Urban Limit Line is located along the
                City limit line as of the effective date of the initiative. Pursuant to the initiative, lands
                west of the Urban Limit Line are designated as Rural Residential/Agriculture on the
                General Plan Land Use Map (Figure 1-1). The location of the Urban Limit Line may
                be changed only by a vote of the people of Dublin, and only following review and
                approval of a General Plan Amendment by the City Council. Any request to change
                the Urban Limit Line must be accompanied by a request to amend the land use
                designation to an urban designation.
            b.	 The Dublin Open Space Initiative was adopted by the Dublin City Council on June 3,
                2014. Pursuant to the initiative, lands west of the Urban Limit Line must adhere to
                the policies, regulations and development standards contained in the Initiative and
                subsequently incorporated into the General Plan (see Section 2.8).
   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 The location, extent and density of residential development will be determined when
       municipal services can be provided and through General Plan refinement studies.
   2.	 Approval of residential development in the Western Extended Planning Area will require
       determination that:
            a.	 Utilities and public safety services will be provided at approved standards without
                financial burden to Dublin residents and businesses outside of the Western Extended
                Planning Area.
            b.	 Proposed site grading and means of access will not disfigure the ridgelands as
                viewed from areas of existing development in Dublin. Any necessary grading and
                construction shall be planned so as to protect visual qualities.
            c.	 Timing of development will not result in premature termination of viable agricultural
2–10                                                   City of Dublin General Plan | Land Use Element

                  operations on adjoining lands.
              d.	 The fiscal impact of new residential development in the Western Extended Planning
                  Area supports itself and does not draw upon and dilute the fiscal base of the
                  remainder of the city.
2.6.6	        DUBLIN CROSSING PLANNING AREA 	
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 Any residential development in the Dublin Crossing Planning Area shall be in compliance
         with the Dublin Crossing Specific Plan.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Locate higher density residential uses along Dublin Boulevard and within one-half mile
         walking or biking distance to transit facilities.
    2.	 Promote development of a wide variety of housing types and housing alternatives for Dublin
         residents.
    3.	 Allow the development of residential units consistent with the Dublin Crossing Medium
         Density Residential (DC MDR) land use district, development standards, and design guidelines
         should DUSD choose to not construct a school facility on the site designated for school uses.
    4.	 Residential development shall be designed to be consistent with the development standards
         and design guidelines of the Dublin Crossing Specific Plan.
2.7	          COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LAND USE	
Dublin’s central location has made it the Tri-Valley commercial center, with numerous retail businesses
and a wide variety of distributors, business service providers, builders and building subcontractors,
manufacturers, and region-serving offices. The City’s ability to provide municipal services depends on
the income generated by business.
2.7.1	        DOWNTOWN DUBLIN	
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 Intensify Downtown Dublin.
         The Downtown Dublin Specific Plan (DDSP) was adopted in 2011. The Plan details how the
         City’s downtown area could be enhanced and intensified to create a more aesthetically-
         pleasing, pedestrian-oriented focal point for the community and provide a strong connection
         between the City’s commercial core and the West Dublin BART Station. The Plan contains
         development standards and design guidelines to direct future development in the Downtown.
    B.	 Implementing Policy
    1.	 Implement the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan.
   City of Dublin General Plan | Land Use Element                                                 2–11

2.7.2	      AUTOMOBILE DEALERSHIPS	
   A.	 Guiding Policy
   1.	 Keep automobile dealers in Dublin.
   B.	 Implementing Policy
   1.	 Allow for the creation of an auto center east of the Camp Parks Reserve Forces Training Area.
       If or when downtown land becomes too costly for car dealers they will have the opportunity
       to relocate in an auto center with freeway frontage.
2.7.3	      NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING CENTERS	
   A.	 Guiding Policy
   1.	 Strengthen existing neighborhood shopping centers.
       Competition from downtown and from north of the County line leaves no trade area within
       the Primary Planning Area for neighborhood shopping centers other than Dublin Square, San
       Ramon Village Plaza, and Village Square.
   B.	 Implementing Policy
   1.	 Require a planned development proposal at the southwest corner of Amador Valley Boulevard
       and Dougherty Road to include medium-high density residential, retail/office, or a mix of these
       uses.
2.7.4	      EASTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA 	
   A.	 Guiding Policy
   1.	 Encourage the development of a full range of commercial and employment-generating uses in
       the Eastern Extended Planning Area that will meet the needs of the City and the surrounding
       Tri-Valley area.
   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 Require developers to remain within the amount and distribution of commercial and
       employment-generating land uses depicted in the General Plan Land Use Map (see Figure
       1-1) in order to maintain a reasonable balance between jobs and housing opportunities.
   2.	 All non-residential development must be consistent with the policies and guidelines set forth
       in applicable Specific Plans.
2.7.5	      APPLICATION TO THE SAME PROPERTY WITHIN THE CITY OF DUBLIN
	           OF BOTH THE RETAIL/OFFICE AND MEDIUM-HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL
	           DESIGNATIONS AS DEFINED IN THE DUBLIN GENERAL PLAN	
   A.	 Guiding Policy
   1.	 The City Council may apply to the same property within the City of Dublin both the Retail/
2–12                                               City of Dublin General Plan | Land Use Element

        Office and Medium-High Density Residential designations as defined in the Dublin General
        Plan.
   B.	 Implementing Policy
   1.	 The location, extent, density and intensity of mixed use Retail/Office and Medium-High
        Density Residential development will be determined when studies indicate that:
             a.	 Services are available for the use.
             b.	 The site is suitable for a mixed-use development.
             c.	 The use supports itself and does not draw upon and dilute the fiscal base of the
                  remainder of the city.
             d.	 Proper roadways and roadway capacity are available.
             e.	 Mixed-use development would be compatible with adjacent land uses.
2.7.6	      SCARLETT COURT AREA	
   A.	 Guiding Policy
   1.	 Strengthen and improve the Scarlett Court Area.
        The Scarlett Court Design Guidelines were adopted by the City Council on May 1, 2007.
        The Design Guidelines are intended to guide future development and improvements in the
        Scarlett Court Area to enhance the character and image of the Area.
        The Scarlett Court Area is visible from Interstate 580, Dougherty Road, the Iron Horse Trail
        and Dublin Boulevard and the view of this Area from these key roadways is of importance to
        the City.
   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 Create and maintain an Overlay Zoning District for the Scarlett Court Area.
   2.	 Encourage improvements to existing businesses and properties in the Scarlett Court Area.
   3.	 Require all redevelopment and improvements related to site planning, architectural design,
        lighting, signage and landscaping to be consistent with the adopted Scarlett Court Design
        Guidelines.
2.7.7	      DUBLIN CROSSING PLANNING AREA	
   A.	 Guiding Policy
   1.	 Any commercial development in the Dublin Crossing Planning Area shall be in compliance
        with the Dublin Crossing Specific Plan.
   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 Concentrate commercial uses near the intersection of Dublin Boulevard and Arnold Road.
  City of Dublin General Plan | Land Use Element                                              2–13

    2.	 Commercial development shall be designed to be consistent with the development standards
         and design guidelines of the Dublin Crossing Specific Plan.
2.8 	        DUBLIN OPEN SPACE INITIATIVE OF 2014	
2.8.1	       AREA COVERED BY THE INITIATIVE	
The areas covered by the Initiative include:
     a.	 The area enclosed by the Dublin Eastern Urban Limit Line (described in Section 2.8.4 below),
         Interstate Highway 580, the Livermore city boundary, the eastern boundary of Collier Canyon,
         and the Alameda County-Contra Costa County boundary, to the extent that all or part of that
         area is annexed to Dublin. This area is referred to as the Doolan-Collier Canyons Area (see
         Figure 2-2); and
     b.	 The Dublin Western Extended Planning Area as defined in the Dublin General Plan, to the
         extent that area is outside the urban limit line and all or part of the area is annexed to Dublin
         (see Figure 2-2).
2.8.2 	      COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; PROTECTION OF LEGAL RIGHTS	
Notwithstanding their literal terms, the provisions of Section 2.8 do not apply to the extent that courts
determine that their application would deprive a person of rights or privileges under the United States
or State constitutions or laws, or otherwise would be contrary to a constitution or law. These explicit
limitations on applicability of the provisions are to make certain that they do not infringe any person’s
legal rights or privileges, or violate the law in any respect, or subject the City to any legal liability.
2.8.3 	      STATE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS	
Nothing in the provisions of Section 2.8 shall be applied to prevent City compliance with City housing
obligations mandated by State law. To the maximum extent practicable the City shall meet State
requirements outside the Doolan-Collier Canyons and Western Extended Planning Areas. If State
required housing is located in those areas, no more land shall be used than is necessary to meet State
requirements. Minimum parcel size, residential dwelling limits, and maximum development envelopes
and floor areas set forth in Section 2.8 shall not apply to the required housing in order to minimize
land used.
2.8.4 	      DUBLIN EASTERN URBAN LIMIT LINE	
The Dublin Eastern Urban Limit Line shall be the Dublin eastern city limits on January 1, 2014, from
the Alameda County-Contra Costa County boundary to Interstate Highway 580.
2–14                                                    City of Dublin General Plan | Land Use Element

2.8.5 	       MINIMUM PARCEL SIZES	
The minimum parcel size shall be at least 100 acres.
2.8.6 	       SUBSIZE PARCELS	
If a parcel smaller than 100 acres (hereafter, a “subsize” parcel) is contiguous to another subsize
parcel, which is legally or de facto in common ownership as of June 3, 2014 or any time thereafter,
the parcels shall be treated as a single parcel for purposes of development. If a subsize parcel is
connected to another subsize parcel or parcels by an intervening subsize parcel or parcels, then all of
the subsize parcels which are in legal or de facto common ownership as of June 3, 2014 or any time
thereafter shall be treated as one parcel for purposes of development. In none of the foregoing cases
are any of the subsize parcels legally merged.
2.8.7 	       CERTIFICATES OF COMPLIANCE	
The City shall not grant unconditional or conditional certificates of compliance except as mandated
by State law. All relevant permissible restrictive conditions shall be imposed on these certificates; the
owner or subsequent transferees shall be held to strict compliance with these conditions. A certificate
of compliance creates no right to develop, nor diminishes in any respect the City’s authority to control
development.
2.8.8 	       PERMISSIBLE USES	
The following uses only, and their normal and appropriate accessory uses and structures, may be
permitted, provided that these uses and structures comply with all of the provisions of Section 2.8
and City ordinances:
     1. 	 One single family dwelling unit on a parcel, secondary units required by State law, and
          housing occupied only by bona fide farm workers employed on the parcel or on a farm or
          ranch which includes the parcel;
     2. 	 Rental of rooms to lodgers, including board, not exceeding four lodgers in a residence;
     3. 	 Home occupations and offices, secondary to residential use and conducted primarily by
          residents of a parcel, that will not have deleterious effects on the environment or visual
          qualities;
     4. 	 Agriculture (including but not limited to grazing, arboriculture, horticulture, and rearing, care
          and use of ruminants, pigs and poultry); provided however, vineyards, feed lots, dairy farms,
          pig farms, poultry ranches, Christmas tree farms and nurseries are permitted only if they
          are small and do not cause substantial environmental harm; (Dwelling units and residential
          accessory buildings are permitted under paragraph (1) above but not under this or any other
          paragraph of this section.);
     5. 	 Processing, packaging or storage of agricultural produce or plants, most of which over a
          calendar year were grown in the Doolan-Collier Canyons Area or Western Extended Planning
    City of Dublin General Plan | Land Use Element                                                    2–15

         Area, but not including canneries or freezing facilities;
     6.	 Small-scale rearing, care, training or use of animals not covered in paragraph (4) above,
         provided that the use does not cause substantial environmental harm;
    7.	 Low-intensity outdoor recreation and pastimes predominately for active participants, not
         spectators, and subordinate auxiliary uses (including campgrounds, picnicking facilities,
         provision of food and drink, and safety and sanitary services). These permissible uses do
         not include, among other uses, amusement or theme parks, golf courses, stadiums or
         arenas (except equestrian riding rings), motor vehicle tracks, courses or off-road facilities,
         or recreational vehicle parking for more than 7 days in a month. Uses permitted under this
         paragraph shall be compatible with a rural environment;
     8.	 Institutional and other non-profit uses that predominantly serve residents and permitted
         uses in the Doolan-Collier Canyons Area or the Western Extended Planning Area, and small
         facilities for convalescence and rehabilitation for not more than six patients each, that will
         not substantially impair the environment;
     9.	 Government and public utility uses that are limited to meeting needs created by permitted
         uses in the Doolan-Collier Canyons Area if located there, and to meeting needs in the Western
         Extended Planning Area if there, except to the extent the City Council finds reasonably
         more extensive need that cannot practicably be met outside those areas. This exception
         shall not apply to wireless communication facilities, waste disposal, processing or treatment,
         and electrical power production or transmission unless primarily for consumption by the
         producer. Publicly provided outdoor recreation and pastimes and ancillary accommodations
         are permitted if like private uses would be allowed;
    10.	 Occasional short-term events related to agriculture, animals or outdoor recreation that do not
         interfere substantially with agriculture or cause substantial environmental harm;
    11.	 An arterial road for the purpose of connecting Dublin Boulevard and North Canyons Parkway.
Ten years after June 3, 2014, the City Council shall study commercial development along the extension
of Dublin Boulevard to North Canyons Parkway up to 1,200 feet north of lnterstate Highway 580.
The Council should consider, among other matters, whether commercial development is needed to
fund the construction or maintenance of the extension, and if water supply and wastewater service is
assured for any development. The Council may put a measure on the ballot to authorize development
in the designated area.
2.8.9 	       AREAS OF SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN	
In addition to the other provisions of Section 2.8, the following restrictions apply:
     a.	 Wetlands: Development or use is not permitted if it would reduce appreciably the quantity
         or biological quality of wetlands. “Wetlands” are areas permanently or periodically covered
         or saturated by water where hydrophytic vegetation is present under normal conditions, or
         have soils that are primarily hydric in nature, or that are designated as wetlands by Federal
         or State law.
     b.	 Stream Corridors: Development or use is not permitted if it would impair appreciably the
2–16                                                   City of Dublin General Plan | Land Use Element

         quantity or quality of water or of native vegetation in a stream corridor, except for otherwise
         permissible flood control, stock ponds, or preservation of special status species. Stream
         corridors are areas within 200 feet from the center of the bed of a permanent or intermittent
         stream.
    c.	 Wildlife: No development or use is permitted that will reduce appreciably the number, or
         prevent the recovery in number, of one or more special status species.
    d.	 Steep Slopes: No building, in whole or in part, may be located on a slope of 20% or more.
         No building may be located on a site that cumulatively has access for more than 50 feet
         over a slope of 20% or more unless there is no other site on a parcel. Cultivated agriculture
         may not be conducted on a slope of 20% or more. No grading may take place on a slope of
         20% or more unless necessary to maintain fire roads. Slope percentages are based on the
         steepness of slopes in their natural, unaltered state, and are calculated by dividing altitude
         increase by 20 over each 20 feet of surface.
2.8.10 	 WATER, WASTEWATER DISPOSAL	
No new habitable dwelling shall be permitted unless it has an assured, adequate, safe, sustainable
water supply for all foreseeable uses, including in times of drought and for fire suppression and other
emergencies, and proper access for emergency vehicles. Sewage and other wastewater disposal must
be demonstrated that foreseeably will be safe, not pollute surface or subsurface water, or otherwise
impair the environment.
2.8.11 	 DEVELOPMENT ENVELOPES	
All buildings on a parcel must be located within a contiguous area, as compact as reasonably
practicable, not to exceed two acres, except for buildings that the Council finds reasonably must be
located outside this area for permitted agricultural use, security needs, the processing, packaging or
storage of agricultural produce or plants, rearing, care, training or use of animals, or government or
public utility use.
2.8.12	       MAXIMUM FLOOR AREAS	
    a.	 The maximum aggregate floor area for all floors (regardless of composition, including soil)
         in all buildings on a parcel, except basement and cellar floors, may not exceed 1% of the
         parcel’s area or 20,000 square feet, whichever is less; however, up to 10,000 square feet may
         be permitted for any parcel.
    b.	 If otherwise appropriate under the provisions of Section 2.8, the City Council may increase
         the maximum floor area by up to 25,000 square feet, in aggregate, if proven necessary for
         buildings for permitted agriculture, care, training or use of horses, processing, packaging
         or storage of agricultural produce or plants, or outdoor recreation or pastimes (including
         permitted ancillary uses).
    c.	 Residential and residential accessory buildings on a parcel may not have a maximum
   City of Dublin General Plan | Land Use Element                                                   2–17

         aggregate floor area of more than 8,000 square feet. Housing solely for farm workers is not
         subject to this limitation.
2.8.13 	 VISUAL SAFEGUARDS	
    a.	 New or reconfigured parcels must be created or drawn to limit, as much as practicable,
         visibility of development from roads and other public places. Unless there is no other possible
         configuration, parcels may not be created that have no building site for each permissible
         building other than a ridgeline or hilltop.
    b.	 Structures may not be located on ridgelines or hilltops, or where they will project into the
         view of a ridgeline or hilltop from public places, unless there is no less obtrusive site on the
         parcel or on a contiguous parcel in legal or de facto common ownership on or subsequent to
         the date this ordinance becomes effective. To the extent practicable and consistent with other
         provisions of this ordinance, structures shall be located, including by setbacks from parcel
         boundaries, on that part of a parcel which minimizes visibility from roads and other public
         places.
    c.	 Development shall be subordinate to and blend harmoniously with the natural and open
         space qualities of the area where located, in order not to impair those qualities and to be
         as unobtrusive as possible. In all cases, appropriate landscaping, preservation of vegetation,
         screening, building materials, design, and limits on surface alterations shall be required by
         the City to reduce as much as practicable the visibility of development. The height of buildings
         shall not exceed 30 feet, except to the extent the Council finds reasonably that a greater
         height is necessary for buildings used for agriculture. Signs may not be more numerous, larger
         or more noticeable than is necessary to provide directions and information about permissible
         uses in the Doolan-Collier Canyons Area or Western Extended Planning Area, and for political
         campaigns.
    d.	 Exterior lighting, including roadway lighting, shall be designed and placed, to the maximum
         extent practicable, to confine direct rays to the parcel or roadway where the lighting is located
         and to protect the darkness of the night sky.
2.8.14 	 TRANSFERABLE DEVELOPMENT CREDITS PROGRAM	
The City shall study and consider a Transferable Development Credits Program as a means of
transferring permissible development from the Doolan-Collier Canyons Area and from the Western
Extended Planning Area to locations elsewhere.
2.8.15 	 APPLICABILITY	
    a.	 Parcels, structures, uses, or surface alterations remain valid to the extent that they existed
         legally at the time the area where they are located is annexed to the City, except if their
         authorized time limit expires, they are eliminated voluntarily or abandoned, or a use would
         violate Section 2.8.9 (a) through (c). Parcels, structures, surface alterations or uses may not
2–18                                                     City of Dublin General Plan | Land Use Element

        be changed or expanded, however, to the extent that it would cause a violation of Section
        2.8 or would increase or augment what would be a violation of Section 2.8 but for this
        subsection.
   b.	 Section 2.8 shall be applied to proposed parcels, structures, surface alterations and uses that
        have not received all required discretionary City authorizations and approvals prior to its
        effective date.
   c.	 Section 2.8 applies to the City of Dublin and to its agencies, officials and properties, as well
        as to all other persons and entities.
2.8.16 	 INCONSISTENT CITY PLANS, ORDINANCES AND ACTIONS	
   a.	 Application of any other provision of this General Plan is barred to the extent that it is in
        conflict with Section 2.8.
   b.	 Any special or other City plan, ordinance, resolution or regulation may not be applied to the
        extent inconsistent with Section 2.8.
   c.	 To the degree inconsistent with Section 2.8, no subdivision or parcel map, development plan
        or agreement, permit, variance or any other action may be approved, permitted or taken
        by the City or its officials (including approval or permission by operation of law because of
        inaction), or is legally valid.
   d.	 Provisions of City plans, ordinances, resolutions and actions are not to be deemed in
        conflict with Section 2.8 to the extent that they impose prohibitions, restrictions, conditions,
        requirements or remedies beyond or in addition to those imposed by Section 2.8. The City
        Council, in adopting this Initiative, has established only minimum prohibitions, restrictions,
        regulations, requirements, and remedies which the City may extend or augment without
        creating any inconsistency, provided it does not permit parcels, development, or use barred
        by Section 2.8.
2.8.17 	 IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT

LAND USE AND CIRCULATION:
          CIRCULATION AND
 SCENIC HIGHWAYS ELEMENT

5.1 	         INTRODUCTION 	
Government Code sec. 65302(b) requires that circulation elements include the general location and
extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, any military
airports and ports, and other local public utilities and facilities. The statute further requires that these
circulation and public services features be correlated with the Land Use Element. That is, the General
Plan must propose circulation and public services adequate to meet the needs of the population
planned for in the Land Use Element. In this General Plan, Figure 5-1 illustrates the Roadway
Classifications for Dublin’s circulation network, which has been designed to support the type and
intensity of land uses that have been planned in the community and detailed in the Land Use Element
(Chapter 2).
Additionally, Dublin envisions a transportation system that promotes transportation options
and independent mobility, increases community safety, encourages healthy, active living, reduces
environmental impacts, minimizes impacts to climate change from vehicle emissions, and supports
greater social interaction and community identity. These goals can be accomplished by providing safe,
comfortable, and convenient travel along and across streets through a comprehensive, integrated
transportation network for all users, including bicyclists, pedestrians, motorists, public transit riders,
movers of commercial goods, and special needs users such as children, persons with disabilities,
seniors, youth, and families.
The Circulation Element is designed to comply with applicable State and regional transportation policies.
It complies with the California Complete Streets Act of 2008 (Assembly Bill 1358), by incorporating by
reference the elements of the City of Dublin’s Complete Streets Policy Resolution No. 199-12 that was
adopted by the City Council on December 4, 2012. The Tri-Valley Transportation Council’s Tri-Valley
Transportation Plan and Action Plan Update (2009) prescribes the long-range transportation vision for
the Tri-Valley area, and identifies specific transportation performance criteria for the member agencies
(Alameda County, Contra Costa County, Danville, Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton and San Ramon). The
City of Dublin uses the Tri-Valley Transportation Plan and Action Plan Update as a guideline in the
development of its transportation system. This Circulation Element also identifies policies and criteria
for streets not included in the Transportation Plan and Action Plan Update.
The City of Dublin is moving towards a truly comprehensive circulation network that supports multiple
modes of transportation including private vehicles, transit, cycling, and walking. Dublin’s existing and
proposed Roadway Classification network is shown in Figure 5-1. Figures 5-2a and 5-2b illustrate
the transit routes and transit facility locations, Figures 5-3a and 5-3b illustrate the bicycle circulation
network and open space trails, and Figures 5-4a and 5-4b illustrate the multi-modal circulation
network with an emphasis on opportunities for pedestrians and bicyclists.
Transportation and roadway policies are presented in this Element. Information supporting these
policies is located in the Technical Supplement. The policies and standards in this Element are
applicable Citywide.
Proposed public utilities and facilities are addressed in the Parks and Open Space Element (Chapter 3),
and in the Schools, Public Lands, and Utilities Element (Chapter 4). Information supporting these
policies is located in the Technical Supplement.
    City of Dublin General Plan | Circulation and Scenic Highways Element                                5–1

The Circulation and Scenic Highways Element is divided into the following main sections:
	 5.2	Roadways
	    5.3	 Alternative Transportation
	    5.4	 Regional Transportation Planning and Complete Streets
	    5.5	 Pedestrian Routes and Bikeways
	    5.6	 Truck Routes
	    5.7	 Scenic Routes and Highways
	    5.8	 Southern Pacific Railroad Corridor
	    5.9	 Financing Circulation System Improvements
5.2	          ROADWAYS 	
The roadway system is designed to accommodate traffic demand and minimize excessive delays and
congested conditions during peak hours. The street design standards specify the width and other
design features necessary to ensure there is sufficient roadway capacity to accommodate future travel
on Dublin streets.
The most prominent features of Dublin’s transportation network are Interstate 580 (which forms the
southern boundary of the City) and Interstate 680 (which bisects the City’s Primary Planning Area).
The interchange between these two freeways was upgraded in the late 1990’s to improve the vehicle
carrying capacity. Additionally, new freeway hook ramps were constructed on I-680 to improve access
to Downtown Dublin and the West Dublin/Pleasanton BART station.
Vehicular traffic volumes on most arterial streets in Dublin are expected to increase steadily over the
life of this General Plan. Projected vehicular growth is attributed primarily to development activity
expected in the Western and Eastern Extended Planning Areas, in and near the two transit centers,
and new construction in the surrounding Tri-Valley area.
The roadways in Table 5.1 have not been constructed at the time of General Plan adoption (2013), but
are expected to be completed at General Plan buildout (2035). The addition of these roadways to the
City’s circulation network is anticipated in the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP).

The arterial streets are designed to distribute localized trips. Intersections with median openings shall
   City of Dublin General Plan | Circulation and Scenic Highways Element                               5–3

be spaced no closer than 750 feet. In special circumstances, such as “T” intersections, intersection
spacing less than 750 feet may be allowed with the approval of the Public Works Director/City
Engineer. Any other intersections without median openings may be approved by the Public Works
Director/City Engineer. A raised median is required to separate the two directions of travel and to
improve the visual appearance of the travel corridor.
Approaches to arterial intersections with Class I collectors as well as other arterials shall be widened
in order to provide additional lanes for left-turn and right-turn movements.
Access to and from arterial streets from abutting commercial properties shall be controlled but not
restricted. No direct vehicular or non-vehicular access from abutting residential homes is allowed.
Parking on these streets shall be prohibited with the exception of emergency parking. Bike lanes
and parkway strips shall be provided. Pedestrian crossings should be carefully selected to direct
pedestrians to designated crossing points at signalized intersections.
A major portion of the roadway capacity of the arterials in the Eastern Extended Planning Area is
required to serve future Contra Costa County residents. Although sufficient right-of-way should be
preserved, construction of the full roadway width for these facilities should be completed only after
the City has secured a fair-share financial agreement with the appropriate agency.
B.	 CLASS 1 COLLECTOR STREETS
     Design ADT	                       27,000 vehicles
     Maximum design speed	             45 mph
Class I collector streets serve primarily to circulate localized traffic and to distribute traffic to and from
arterials. Class I collectors are designed to accommodate four lanes of traffic (plus a center turn lane);
however, they carry lower traffic volumes at slower speeds than arterials, and they have a continuous
left-turn lane separating the two directions of traffic flow. For intersections of Class I collectors with
arterials, additional right-turn lanes shall be provided on the Class I collector at a minimum; additional
left-turn lanes shall be provided as determined by the Public Works Director/City Engineer.
Medians shall be striped if no abutting property access is allowed (minimum of one-quarter mile
or one block); the width of the striped median can be reduced from the City design standard with
approval of the Public Works Director/City Engineer.
C.	 CLASS II COLLECTOR STREETS
     Design ADT 	                      12,000 vehicles
     Maximum design speed 	            30 mph
Class II collector streets serve primarily to circulate localized traffic and distribute traffic to and from
arterials and collector streets, and may include two-way center turn lanes. They are designed to
accommodate two lanes of traffic (plus a center turn lane); however, they carry lower traffic volumes
at slower speeds than Class I collector streets. This type of facility provides access to properties and
circulation to residential neighborhoods.
Access to and from Class II collector streets from abutting properties shall be permitted at locations
approved by the Public Works Director/City Engineer. No direct vehicular or non-vehicular access from
residential homes is allowed. Parking on this facility shall typically be allowed. However, parking at
5–4                            City of Dublin General Plan | Circulation and Scenic Highways Element

critical locations may be denied as deemed appropriate by the Public Works Director/City Engineer for
maintaining safe conditions.

     Design ADT	                      4,000 vehicles
     Maximum design speed	            30 mph
Residential collector streets also circulate localized traffic as well as distribute traffic to and from
arterials and other collectors to access residential areas. Residential collector streets accommodate
low volume levels and the use of this facility as a carrier of through traffic should be discouraged by
its design.
Parking on this facility shall typically be allowed. However, parking at critical locations may be denied
as deemed appropriate by the Public Works Director/City Engineer for maintaining safe conditions.
E.	 INDUSTRIAL ROADS
     Design ADT 	                     4,000
     Maximum design speed 	           30 mph
These roads serve traffic within industrial development. Minimum distance between intersections
shall be 300 feet unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Director/City Engineer. Turnaround
curb radius shall be a minimum of 50 feet.
F.	 RESIDENTIAL STREETS
     Design ADT	                      1,500
     Maximum design speed	            25 mph
Residential streets circulate localized traffic as well as distribute traffic to and from arterials and
collectors to access residential areas. Residential streets accommodate low volume levels and should
not be used to carry through traffic.

     Design ADT	                      N/A
     Maximum design speed	            25 mph	
Cul-de-sacs are typically designed for residential land uses, although there are commercial/industrial
cul-de-sacs as well (Sierra Court, Scarlett Court). Cul-de-sacs shall be open at the end to allow for
non-vehicular circulation including bicycle and pedestrian access.
The following policies apply to Roadway Standards citywide:
5.2.2 	        ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
     A.	 Guiding Policies

           conditions during peak hours of operation at intersections, (3) serve a variety of transportation
    City of Dublin General Plan | Circulation and Scenic Highways Element                               5–5

        modes including vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians and transit, and variety of users including
        people with disabilities, children, and seniors, (4) provide continuity with existing streets, and
        (5) allow convenient access to planned land uses.
    2.	 Design residential collector streets, residential streets and cul-de-sacs to serve vehicular,
        bicycle and pedestrian traffic and to prevent misuse of residential areas by cut-through
        vehicular traffic.
    3.	 The goals, policies, and implementation measures for street design in Section 10.8 of the
        Community Design and Sustainability Element should be consulted when new streets are
        being designed and/or existing streets are being modified.
    4.	 Reserve right-of-way and construct improvements necessary to allow streets to accommodate
        projected vehicular traffic with the least friction.
    5.	 The City shall consider the Tri-Valley Transportation Plan and Action Plan and the City of
        Dublin Complete Streets Policy when adopting or amending the Circulation Element of the
        General Plan, Specific Plans, Zoning Ordinances or the Capital Improvement Program.
    6.	 The City shall strive to phase development and roadway improvements so that the operating
        Level of Service (LOS) for intersections in Dublin does not exceed LOS D. However, intersections
        within the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan area (including the intersections of Dublin
        Boulevard/San Ramon Road and Village Parkway/Interstate 680 on-ramp) are excluded from
        this requirement and may operate at LOS E or worse as long as the safety for pedestrians and
        bicyclists is maintained and impacts to transit travel speeds are minimized.
    7.	 The City will comply with all provisions of the Alameda County Congestion Management
        Program and will review proposed development projects to ensure compliance with this
        Program.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Design streets according to the forecasted demand and maximum design speeds listed above,
        and to the detailed standards set forth in the City of Dublin’s Street Design Standards and
        Standard Plans which are maintained by the Public Works Department, as well as the listed
        Additional Policies.
    2.	 Design and construct all roads in the City’s circulation network as defined in Figure 5-1
        as well as bicycle and pedestrian networks as defined in the City of Dublin Bicycle and
        Pedestrian Master Plan.
    3.	 Development in Contra Costa County contributes a significant amount of traffic to regional
        facilities within the City of Dublin so the full cost should not be borne by Dublin users.
        Funding may be provided in part by the City’s Traffic Impact Fees, Contra Costa County, and/
        or the Tri-Valley Transportation Council.
    4.	 Maintain a funding agreement with Contra Costa County whereby the County collects a
        surcharge traffic impact fee on development in Dougherty Valley that represents the County’s
        pro-rata “fair” share for ultimate improvements, including right-of-way, on regional facilities
        within the City of Dublin. Contra Costa County transmits the proceeds to the City for use on
        designated improvements. Examples of such regional facilities include Tassajara Road, Fallon
        Road and Dougherty Road.

5.2.3 	       EASTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA (EEPA) – ADDITIONAL POLICIES
Substantial urban development is projected for the Eastern Extended Planning Area. The roadway
system has been designed to accommodate traffic at buildout of the area according to the land use
distribution and densities shown in the General Plan Land Use Map (Figure 1-1) and accompanying
text in the Background chapter (Chapter 1). The system is structured around the existing north-south
roads and freeway interchanges (Hacienda Drive, Tassajara Road and Fallon Road) and the extension
of existing east-west roadways such as Dublin Boulevard. The roadway system also includes other
east-west collectors including Gleason Drive and Central Parkway, which extend the length of the
Planning Area and connects the most intensively-developed areas with the Dublin/Pleasanton BART
station.
     A.	 Guiding Policy
     1.	 Provide an integrated multi-modal circulation system that provides efficient vehicular
         circulation while providing a design that allows safe and convenient travel along and across
         streets for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, persons with disabilities, seniors, children,
         youth, and families; and encourages pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and other non-automobile
         transportation alternatives.
     B.	 Implementing Policies
     1.	 Provide continuity with existing streets, include sufficient capacity for projected traffic, and
         allow convenient access to planned land uses.
     2.	 Require the following major circulation improvements in the Eastern Extended Planning Area:
              a.	 Provide for the extension of Dublin Boulevard from Fallon Road to North Canyons
                  Parkway and for the construction of other streets designed in accordance with the
                  City of Dublin’s Designs Standards and Standard Plans and in compliance with Figure
                  5-1.
              b.	 In cooperation with Caltrans and other affected jurisdictions, pursue widening of
                  Interstate 580 to ten total lanes (8 through lanes and 2 auxiliary lanes) between
                  Tassajara Road and Airway Boulevard.
              c.	 Upgrade the Fallon Road interchange to the same standards as the Dougherty Road
                  and Hacienda Drive interchanges (i.e., 3 through lanes in each direction across the
                  overpass and a partial cloverleaf ramp system).
              d.	 Provide local and collector streets for internal access to development areas throughout
                  the Planning Area.
     3.	 Provide potential for additional future roadway connections linking existing Dublin to the
         Eastern Extended Planning Area.
         Street layout in the Eastern Extended Planning Area should facilitate future connection
         through Camp Parks to existing streets in Dublin, if and when the opportunity becomes
         available. Refer to applicable Specific Plans for policies, development standards, and more
         detailed discussion of the circulation system in the Eastern Extended Planning Area.

5.2.4 	       WESTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA – ADDITIONAL POLICIES 	
    A.	 Guiding Policies
    1.	 Provide an efficient circulation system for the Western Extended Planning Area that links
         to the rest of the City, provides alternate transportation modes, is safe for all users, and is
         sensitive to environmental concerns.
    2.	 The primary access for the Schaefer Ranch sector of the Western Extended Planning Area shall
         be via Dublin Boulevard and Schaefer Ranch Road. Other sections of the Western Extended
         Planning Area shall have primary access via the Eden Canyon interchange.
    B.	 Implementing Policy
    1.	 Require the following major circulation improvements in the Western Extended Planning
         Area:
              a.	 Collector streets to provide access to residential neighborhoods and non-residential
                  uses, as identified in specific development plans.
5.2.5 	       DOWNTOWN DUBLIN SPECIFIC PLAN AREA – ADDITIONAL POLICIES
The Downtown Dublin Specific Plan (DDSP) contains policies and guidelines which aim to create a
pedestrian friendly environment in the downtown while also creating an urban area that includes
transit-oriented, mixed use development and increases the economic vitality of the area. These policies
and guidelines limit the extent to which intersections may be improved or widened in the Downtown
Area to maintain or minimize impacts to transit service without sacrificing safe and comfortable
bicycle and pedestrian circulation. In order to achieve these goals, all intersections within the limits of
the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan area (including the intersections of Dublin Boulevard/ San Ramon
Road and Village Parkway/Interstate 680 on-ramp) are exempt from Guiding Policy 5.2.2.A.6 in this
Chapter, which strives to maintain a LOS of D or better for intersections in the City.
The City may consider improvements in the DDSP area to increase the efficiency of the roadway
network especially to minimize transit delays and improve vehicular, bicyclist and pedestrian safety
through striping, signalization timing, etc. as long as the proposed improvements are consistent with
adopted Specific Plan and General Plan policies.
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 The Downtown Dublin Specific Plan area is intended to be a pedestrian, and transit friendly
         environment and traffic improvements shall be consistent with this policy and the guidelines
         in the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 The City shall periodically review the improvements identified in the Downtown Traffic Impact
         Fee (TIF) Program to ensure that the improvements identified are consistent with the adopted
         Downtown Dublin Specific Plan and the Dublin Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan. The City
         may revise the list of improvements included in the TIF to remove any improvements as
         necessary or include additional improvements which are consistent with the General Plan
         policies, the DDSP, and the Dublin Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan and also improve
5–8                          City of Dublin General Plan | Circulation and Scenic Highways Element

          the efficiency of the roadway network, especially for transit service, and enhance vehicular,
          bicyclist and pedestrian safety in the Specific Plan area.
     2.	 Projects within the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan area shall be reviewed to identify project-
          related improvements that can feasibly be implemented to increase vehicular, bicyclist and
          pedestrian safety, transit service efficiency, and the effectiveness of the roadway network as
          long as the identified improvements are consistent with the General Plan, the Downtown
          Dublin Specific Plan and the Dublin Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan.
5.2.6 	        DUBLIN CROSSING PLANNING AREA – ADDITIONAL POLICIES	
The Dublin Crossing Specific Plan contains policies and guidelines which aim to create a multi-modal
circulation system to serve the project area as well as provide safe and convenient connections to
the rest of the City. The policies contained in Chapter 4 of the Dublin Crossing Specific Plan shall be
implemented as development in the Planning Area is carried out.
5.2.7 	        FREEWAY ACCESS	
The Interstate 680 freeway is currently eight lanes north of I-580. The I-580/I-680 interchange
was rebuilt as both freeways and the arterial street system experienced heavy new demands from
development in Dublin as well as adjoining communities.
Additional capacity at existing interchanges on I-580 is needed to serve travel demands in the Eastern
Extended Planning Area. A High Occupancy Vehicle/High Occupancy Toll lane (lane reserved for
vehicles with two or more total passengers or for vehicles paying a toll fare during commute hours)
is being planned for I-580 in both the east and west bound directions.
5.2.7.1 	     PRIMARY AND EXTENDED PLANNING AREAS 	
     A.	 Guiding Policy
     1.	 Improve freeway access.
     B.	 Implementing Policies
     1.	 The interchange on I-680 southbound with access onto St. Patrick Way at Amador Plaza Road
          was an improvement made to provide better freeway access to and from Downtown Dublin.
          Provide an additional exit on I-680 North at or near the Village Parkway freeway entrance to
          provide better access for Downtown in the northbound direction.
     2.	 Improve I-580 interchanges to serve planned growth.
5.3	           ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION	
Figures 5-2a and 5-2b (Transit Map) illustrate existing and future bus transit routes including Wheels,
RAPID transit and the County Connection. The Wheels bus system currently serves Pleasanton, Dublin
and Livermore. There are multiple bus routes offering weekday commute, off-peak and Saturday
    City of Dublin General Plan | Circulation and Scenic Highways Element                           5–9

service. The Contra Costa County Connection Bus Service provides a connection between Dublin and
Contra Costa County and Pleasanton. A bus RAPID transit route began service in 2011 that provides
faster transit service in the Tri-Valley area and connections to the BART stations.
Figure 5-3a and 5-3b (Bicycle Circulation Map) illustrate the Class I bike paths, Class II bike lanes,
Class III bike routes, and Open Space Trails that exist in Dublin and that provide valuable additions to
the City’s circulation network.
Figure 5-4a and 5-4b (Multi-Modal Map) illustrates all transit opportunities in the City including
public transit, bicycling and pedestrian opportunities. Figure 5-4a and 5-4b identifies two Enhanced
Pedestrian Areas in the City. These pedestrian areas are located within the Downtown Dublin Specific
Plan area and the Promenade located within the Eastern Dublin Specific Plan area on Grafton Street.
The Enhanced Pedestrian Areas are located where the City would like to encourage pedestrians to
walk to their destination rather than using their car for all of their stops within the area. The purpose of
the Enhanced Pedestrian Area designation is to ensure that development within the area is designed
to encourage pedestrian trips.
The Dublin/Pleasanton BART station located in the Transit Center within the Eastern Dublin Specific
Plan area opened in 1997. The West Dublin/Pleasanton BART station located off of Golden Gate Drive
in Downtown Dublin began service in 2011. Bus service is provided to and from both BART stations.
Bus service connects residents to both stations and to other points within Dublin and beyond the city
limits. The BART stations serve as transit hubs in that they provide connections for both rail and bus
service and are accessible to pedestrians and bicyclists.
5.3.1 	        ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
     A.	 Guiding Policies
     1.	 Support improved local transit as essential to a quality urban environment, particularly for
          residents who do not drive.
     2.	 Support the development of a community that facilitates and encourages the use of local and
          regional transit systems.
     3.	 Encourage improvements in the Enhanced Pedestrian Areas to improve the walkability of
          these areas.
     4.	 Maintain enhanced signal coordination and limit intersection delays on major and RAPID
          transit routes to minimize delays to transit service.
     B.	 Implementing Policies
     1.	 Urge BART cooperation in maintaining standards for review of public and private
          improvements in the vicinity of BART stations that take into account both future traffic needs
          and development opportunities.
     2.	 Require dedication of land and the construction of improvements to support the use of public
          transit in the community. Improvements could consist of bus turnouts, shelters, benches, real-
          time arrival information, and other facilities that may be appropriate.
     3.	 Encourage higher densities and mixed-use developments near major transit lines and transit
5–10                          City of Dublin General Plan | Circulation and Scenic Highways Element

         transfer points as a means of encouraging the use of public transit. This type of transit-
         oriented development is especially encouraged near the east Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station
         and in the Transit-Oriented District of the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan area.
     4.	 Capitalize on opportunities to connect into and enhance ridership on regional transit systems
         including BART, LAVTA and any future light rail systems.
     5.	 Encourage the use of regional and local trail systems and consider infrastructure enhancements
         that could improve the operation and functionality of the most widely used trail corridors.
     6.	 Require developers in the Enhanced Pedestrian Areas to provide sidewalks, landscaping and
         safe connections from the building to the sidewalk to encourage pedestrian use within the
         area.
5.4	          REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND COMPLETE	
	STREETS	
5.4.1	        REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING FRAMEWORK	
Throughout California, land use and transportation planning are becoming even more closely inter-
connected. State legislation such as Senate Bill 375, California’s greenhouse gas reduction law,
and Assembly Bill 32, California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, enact sweeping changes in land
use, transportation and environmental planning. A mandate of SB 375 is that California must make
significant reductions in its greenhouse gas emissions through changes in land use and transportation
policies. The core provision of SB 375 requires regional transportation agencies to develop a
“Sustainable Communities Strategy” (SCS). The SCS will outline the region’s plan for combining
transportation resources, such as roads and mass transit, with a realistic land use pattern, in order to
meet a state target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
In addition to involvement in the region-wide effort to develop an SCS, Dublin is also engaged in
transportation planning efforts with several regional transportation agencies, including but not
limited to, the following:
Tri-Valley Transportation Council (TVTC). The Tri-Valley Transportation Council oversees the
expenditures of the Tri-Valley Transportation Development Fund.
Alameda County Transportation Commission (Alameda CTC). This agency is a merger of
the former Alameda County Congestion Management Agency (ACCMA) and the Alameda County
Transportation Improvement Authority (ACTIA). The stated mission of the agency is to plan, fund and
deliver transportation programs and projects that expand access and improve mobility to foster a
vibrant and livable Alameda County. The Alameda CTC distributes funds for numerous transportation
projects and programs from local, state and federal funding sources. Some of these funds are awarded
through grant programs, which the City has benefitted from in the past. The Alameda CTC also sets
policy guidance for regional efforts related to transit-oriented development, bicycle and pedestrian
planning, and implementation of Complete Streets policies (discussed in Section 5.4.2).
Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). Created by the state Legislature in 1970,
   City of Dublin General Plan | Circulation and Scenic Highways Element                           5–11

the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) is the transportation planning, coordinating
and financing agency for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. MTC functions as both the
regional transportation planning agency—a state designation—and, for federal purposes, as the
region’s metropolitan planning organization (MPO). As such, it is responsible for regularly updating
the Regional Transportation Plan, a comprehensive blueprint for the development of mass transit,
highway, airport, seaport, railroad, bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The Sustainable Communities
Strategy (SCS) is one component of the Regional Transportation Plan. The Commission also screens
requests from local agencies for state and federal grants for transportation projects to determine their
compatibility with the Plan.
MTC has established the OneBayArea Grant Program, which is a new funding approach that better
integrates the region’s federal transportation program with California’s climate law (Senate Bill 375,
Steinberg, 2008) and the Sustainable Communities Strategy. The OneBayArea Grant Program (OBAG)
establishes program commitments and policies for investing roughly $800 million over the four-
year period of fiscal years 2012-13 through 2015-16, funded through continuations of the current
federal surface transportation legislation currently known as SAFETEA (the Safe, Accountable, Flexible,
Efficient Transportation Equity Act). In order to be eligible for OBAG funding, Dublin needs to have
adopted and be implementing Complete Streets.
5.4.2	        COMPLETE STREETS	
In 2008, the State Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 1358, the California Complete Streets Act.
Implementation of the Act requires cities and counties to integrate multi-modal transportation
network policies into the Circulation Elements of their General Plans. The transportation network
should consist of “Complete Streets,” which are transportation facilities that are planned, designed,
operated, and maintained to provide safe mobility for all users, including bicyclists, pedestrians, transit
riders, and motorists.
Designed to encourage and increase the use of alternative modes of transportation, Complete Streets
serve to enable active travel as part of daily activities, reduce pollution, and meet the needs of all
users of the streets. All users include bicyclists, pedestrians, motorists, public transit riders, movers of
commercial goods, and special needs users such as children, persons with disabilities, seniors, youth,
and families. Complete Streets continue to maintain a safe and effective transportation system that
integrates the needs of users beyond the vehicle.
In an effort to meet the requirements of the State, MTC and ACTC, Dublin has adopted a comprehensive
Complete Streets Policy (City Council Resolution 199-12). The Complete Streets Policy reflects the
following policies.
5.4.3 	       ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
     A.	 Guiding Policies
     1.	 Plan for all users by creating and maintaining Complete Streets that provide safe, comfortable,
         and convenient travel along and across streets (including streets, roads, highways, bridges,
         and other portions of the transportation system) through a comprehensive, integrated
         transportation network that meets the requirements of currently adopted transportation
         plans and serves all categories of users.
5–12                          City of Dublin General Plan | Circulation and Scenic Highways Element

    2.	 Be context aware by maintaining sensitivity to local conditions and needs in both residential
         and business districts as well as urban, suburban, and rural areas, and will work with residents,
         merchants, and other stakeholders to ensure that a strong sense of place ensues.
    3.	 Make Complete Streets practices a routine part of everyday operations, approach every relevant
         project, program, and practice as an opportunity to improve streets and the transportation
         network for all categories of users in accordance with the City of Dublin’s Complete Streets
         Policy.
    4.	 Complete Streets infrastructure sufficient to enable reasonably safe travel along and across
         the right of way for each category of users adhering to local conditions and needs will be
         incorporated into all planning, funding, design, approval, and implementation processes for
         all projects.
    5.	 Work with other jurisdictions in partnering to create a truly multi-modal transportation
         infrastructure within and across the City.
    6.	 Encourage developers to implement Complete Streets in private transportation infrastructure
         by providing guidance during the development approval process.
    B.	 Implementing Policy
    1.	 Continue implementing the City’s Complete Streets Policy and seek funding for transportation
         and circulation improvements through the OBAG program and its successors.
5.5	          PEDESTRIAN ROUTES AND BIKEWAYS	
The City adopted a Citywide Bikeways Master Plan in 2007. In 2014, the Bikeways Master Plan was
updated and renamed the Dublin Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan. The Dublin Bicycle and Pedestrian
Master Plan combines the update to the Bikeways Master Plan with the City’s first Pedestrian Plan
into a comprehensive document that provides policies, network plans, prioritized project lists, support
programs and best practice design guidelines for bicycling and walking in Dublin. The updated Master
Plan contains goals and policies for development and implementing a bicycle and pedestrian network
that provides a viable transportation alternative to the automobile, improves safety for bicyclists and
pedestrians, and provides residents with access and good connections to parks, open space, trails
and other recreational opportunities. The Master Plan identifies existing and proposed bicycle and
pedestrian routes and support facilities throughout the Planning area. Readers should refer to the
Dublin Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan for additional information regarding existing and proposed
bicycle and pedestrian routes and support facilities.
The greatest opportunities for successful pedestrian travel is to provide safe and comfortable
connections between residential neighborhoods and key destinations including schools, parks,
shopping districts, and transit. In the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan area this also includes connections
to Downtown Dublin businesses and the West Dublin BART Station. The Downtown Dublin Specific
Plan contains policies related to increasing pedestrian amenities in Downtown, and the City’s Climate
Action Plan also highlights the City’s commitment to the continued development of successful bicycle
and pedestrian trail corridors, improved access to parks and open space areas, improved bicycle lanes
and/or routes on several key cross-city corridors, bikeways on key freeway crossings, the development
of education and enforcement programs, and improvements to the City’s Bicycle Parking Ordinance.

     2.	 Take advantage of opportunities to provide long-term truck parking facilities.
5.7	          SCENIC ROUTES AND HIGHWAYS 	
I-580, I-680, San Ramon Road, and Dougherty Road were designated scenic routes by Alameda
County in 1966. These are the places from which people traveling through Dublin gain their impression
of the City; therefore, it is important that the quality of views be protected.
In the Eastern Extended Planning Area, Tassajara Road is designated a scenic route by Alameda
5–14                           City of Dublin General Plan | Circulation and Scenic Highways Element

County. It is the City’s intention that Fallon Road will also be designated as a scenic route once it is
extended north to connect with Tassajara Road.
5.7.1 	       ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
     A.	 Guiding Policy
     1.	 Incorporate County-designated scenic routes, and the Fallon Road extension, in the General
          Plan as adopted City-designated scenic routes, and work to enhance a positive image of
          Dublin as seen by through travelers.
     B.	 Implementing Policies
     1.	 Exercise design review of all projects visible from a designated scenic route.
     2.	 Implement the Eastern Dublin Scenic Corridors Policies and Standards for projects within the

5.8	          SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR
Track has been removed from the San Ramon Branch line between Pleasanton and Pleasant Hill.
Previous studies proposed future use for light rail transit or a busway, but communities along the
corridor later dismissed the idea. Several sections of the corridor have since been developed with
residential and/or light industrial uses, and potential open space or recreational uses should be
considered for remaining corridor areas.
5.9	          FINANCING CIRCULATION SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS	
The City has a five year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) that includes a section on the circulation
network. The current CIP lists approved circulation improvement projects along with estimated costs
and financing schedules. The funds for these projects come from several sources including the City’s
operating budget, state/federal funds, development fees, grants and loans. (A copy of the current
Dublin CIP is available from the City Manager’s Office.)
Construction of necessary roads for new development will be funded by the developers, primarily
through Traffic Impact Fee (TIF) requirements The City currently has the Eastern Dublin TIF for properties
in the Eastern Extended Planning Area and the Downtown TIF for most others. A regional TIF has been
established by the Tri-Valley Transportation Council (TVTC). Details about these fee programs are
available from the Public Works Department.
5.9.1 	       ALL PLANNING AREAS	
     A.	 Guiding Policy
     1.	 Continue the city’s program of requiring developers to contribute fees and/or improvements
          to help fund off-site improvements related to their projects.

RESOURCES MANAGEMENT:
  CONSERVATION ELEMENT

7.1	           INTRODUCTION 	
Government Code sec. 65302 (d) requires that conservation elements plan for the conservation,
development and utilization of natural resources. The statute lists the following resources that must
be included in the Element: water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and other waters, harbors,
fisheries, wildlife, minerals and other natural resources. The statute also suggests other resources that
may be included such as, reclamation of land and waters, prevention and control of pollution of
streams and other waters, regulation of the use of land in stream channels, erosion of soils, beaches
and shores, protection of watersheds, and the location, quantity and quality of rock, sand and gravel
resources. Finally, the statute specifically requires those portions of the Element that include waters
be developed in coordination with the countywide water agency and all district and city agencies that
have developed, served, controlled, managed, or conserved water of any type for any purpose within
Dublin. Coordination shall include a discussion and evaluation of water supply and demand.
Dublin’s Conservation Element addresses the following statutorily required elements: water resources,
agriculture and other soils, rivers and streams, and wildlife habitats. Other important resources
discussed in this Element are air quality and archaeological and historical resources. Many conservation
related resources are also addressed in the context of other Elements. For example, agricultural and
other open space uses are discussed in the Parks and Open Space Element (Chapter 3); wastewater
disposal and water supply is discussed in the Schools, Public Lands and Utilities Element (Chapter 4);
and, soil conditions related to earthquakes and flood hazard from local streams are discussed in the
Seismic Safety and Safety Element (Chapter 8). The Technical Supplement may also be consulted for
information and background on resource related planning policies for each of these Elements.
Those statutorily required resources that do not occur in the Primary or Extended Planning Areas
of Dublin are not discussed. Specifically, Dublin is an inland city which contains no forests, harbors,
fisheries or mineral extraction areas.
Air quality and wastewater disposal have been the Tri-Valley’s most difficult conservation issues
affecting urban growth, even with construction of the Livermore Amador Valley Wastewater
Management Association (LAVWMA) pipeline, and significantly improved air quality. The extent of
development in eastern Dublin has drawn greater attention to other conservation issues -- conversion
of agricultural land to urban uses; loss of open space; hazards posed by development in steep and
landslide prone areas; increased runoff; and, erosion and stream siltation. Additionally, the prospect
of renewed or intensified air quality and sewage disposal problems accompanies plans approved or
under consideration that would result in up to 200,000 jobs in the Tri-Valley.
The planning area includes three zones that are distinct in terms of topography, vegetation, and soils
(valley floor, eastern hills and western hills). The urban area within the City’s Primary Planning Area
that extends eastward along Dublin Boulevard to Tassajara Road forms part of the flat, valley floor.
The land east of the Parks Reserve Forces Training Area and Santa Rita Rehabilitation Center and
just south of the county line consists of grassy rolling hills with occasional steep slopes. Lastly, the
westernmost part of the Planning Area is composed of ridgelands covered primarily by grasslands
with oak woodlands on steep slopes and in winding canyons.
    City of Dublin General Plan | Conservation Element                                                  7–1

7.1.1 	       WESTERN HILLS 	
The western hills that form part of the ridgelands extending from Contra Costa County to Santa
Clara County, were established as an area of regional significance by a 1980 National Parks Service
study. The ridgelands have been the subject of preservation efforts over the years, and also have
been protected by the difficulty of development on the steep slopes and ridges. The ridgelands of the
western hills are characterized by grazing land and good quality woodland and forest habitats with
high natural resource values. Perhaps most important, the western hills form part of a greenbelt that
rings the Bay Plain, preventing continuous urban spread.
An open space corridor, centered on the main ridgeline in the Western Extended Planning Area, is
included in the General Plan. This open space corridor will incorporate visually-prominent ridgelands,
as well as woodland and coastal scrub habitat. A north-south regional trail will provide access to this
area for hiking and nature study.
7.1.2	        EASTERN HILLS 	
The eastern hills are not as valuable as the western hills for habitat resources. Productive agricultural
soils are likewise limited; the Eastern Extended Planning Area does not include prime agricultural land
or farmlands of Statewide importance. At best, the forage produced in the Planning Area is of some
local importance. Throughout the northern, central, and eastern portions of the Eastern Extended
Planning Area, much of the land had been under Williamson Act contracts that prohibit development
for a minimum of ten years while providing tax advantages to landowners. In recent years, a number
of landowners have not renewed their contracts, and the lands are no longer in Williamson Act
contracts.
7.2	          STREAM CORRIDORS AND RIPARIAN VEGETATION	
Dublin’s Primary and Eastern Extended Planning Areas are located within Livermore Drainage Unit
which is one of two major drainage basins in the Alameda Creek Watershed. Of the many streams
in the Livermore Drainage Unit, two flow through Dublin’s Primary and Eastern Extended Planning
Areas – Alamo Creek and Tassajara Creek, respectively. Alamo Creek runs in a north-south direction
just west of Dougherty Road; Tassajara Creek also runs in a north-south direction and is located just
west of Tassajara Road. Portions of these creeks have been channelized and remaining sections are
being improved as a result of subdivision developments.
The Western Extended Planning Area lies within the San Lorenzo Creek Watershed and includes the
Palomares Creek and Dublin Creek sub-watersheds. Several significant streams traverse the Western
Extended Planning Area including Hollis Canyon and Martin Canyon Creeks in the western hills. For
additional information on water courses in Dublin the following documents are available from the
City Planning Division:

    Eastern Dublin Specific Plan, General Plan Amendment, and Environmental Impact Report – 1994
Extensive areas of riparian vegetation are located along stream courses in the Western Extended
Planning Area. This riparian woodland has importance to wildlife in the area. Considerable damage
to riparian areas has resulted from intensive grazing.
7.2.1 	       ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
     A.	 Guiding Policies
     1.	 Protect riparian vegetation as a protective buffer for stream quality and for its value as a
          habitat and aesthetic resource.
     2.	 Promote access to stream corridors for passive recreational use and to allow stream
          maintenance and improvements as necessary, while respecting the privacy of owners of
          property abutting stream corridors.
     B.	 Implementing Policies
     1.	 Enforce Watercourse Ordinance 52-87 for developed areas of the city.
     2.	 Require open stream corridors of adequate width to protect all riparian vegetation, improve
          access, and prevent flooding caused by blockage of streams.
     3.	 Require revegetation of creek banks with species characteristic of local riparian vegetation,
          where construction requires creekbank alteration.
7.2.2 	       WESTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA	
     A. 	 Guiding Policy
     1.	 While alteration of riparian vegetation will be necessary in some situations, special
          consideration shall be given to the protection or enhancement of riparian woodland in the
          Western Extended Planning Area.
7.3	          EROSION AND SILTATION CONTROL	
7.3.1 	       ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
     A.	 Guiding Policies
     1.	 Maintain natural hydrologic systems.
     2.	 Regulate grading and development on steep slopes.
     B.	 Implementing Policies
     1.	 Enforce the requirements of the Municipal Regional Permit for stormwater issued by the
          San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board or any subsequent permit as well
          as Chapter 7 (Public Works) and Chapter 9 (Subdivisions) of the Dublin Municipal Code for
          maintenance of water quality and protection of stream courses.

        approved off-site measures.
    2.	 Regulate grading and development on steep slopes, with special concern for potential
        problems of erosion and siltation.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Require erosion control plans for proposed development. Erosion control plans shall include
        recommendations for preventing erosion and scour of drainageways, consistent with
        biological and visual values.
    2.	 In general, restrict areas of steep slopes (more than 30%) to permanent open space, as part
        of an overall cluster development concept on approved plans. Any development in otherwise
        restricted areas shall require substantial mitigation which has considerable benefit to the
        community, in keeping with the standards of General Plan Policy 3.2.2.A.1.
    3.	 Development projects shall comply with the requirements of the Municipal Regional Permit
        for stormwater issued by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board or any
        subsequent permit as well as Dublin Municipal Code Chapter 7 (Public Works) and Chapter
        9 (Subdivisions).
7.4	         OAK WOODLANDS	
Most of the oak woodland within the Dublin Planning Area is concentrated in the Western Extended
Planning Area. In addition to California Live Oaks, other species such as laurel are a vital part of this
plant community. This woodland has important visual and biological qualities.
7.4.1 	      PRIMARY AND EASTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREAS 	
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 Protect oak woodlands.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Require preservation of oak woodlands. Where woodlands occupy slopes that otherwise
        could be graded and developed, permit allowable density to be transferred to another part
        of the site. Removal of an individual oak tree may be considered through the project review
        process.
    2.	 Enact and enforce the Heritage Tree Ordinance.

7.4.2 	      WESTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA 	
   A.	 Guiding Policies
   1.	 There shall be an emphasis on preservation of oak woodland in the Western Extended
        Planning Area. Development shall be clustered in grassland areas wherever possible, in order
        to protect existing trees. However, as part of comprehensive planning for development in this
        area, some oak woodland may need to be removed. Removal of oaks shall be allowed only
        after all feasible site planning efforts have been made to preserve trees.
   2.	 Any removed trees shall be replaced, and existing trees to remain shall be protected.
   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 Require effective replacement of existing trees which are scheduled for removal.
   2.	 Require detailed protection measures for trees to remain.
7.5	         AIR QUALITY	
7.5.1 	      ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
   A.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 Request that the Bay Area Air Quality Management District establish an air quality monitoring
        station in Dublin.
   2.	 Require an air quality analysis for new development projects that could generate significant
        air emissions on a project and cumulative level. Air quality analyses shall include specific
        feasible measures to reduce anticipated air quality emissions to a less-than-significant
        California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) level.
7.6	         AGRICULTURAL LANDS	
7.6.1 	      ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
   A.	 Guiding Policy
   1.	 Prevent premature urbanization of agricultural lands. (See Open Space policies, Section 7.8)
   B.	 Implementing Policy
   1.	 Approval of urban development shall require findings that the land is suitable for the proposed
        use and will have adequate urban services and that conversion to an urban use will not have
        significant adverse effects on adjoining lands remaining under Williamson Act contract.

7.7	          ARCHAEOLOGIC AND HISTORIC RESOURCES	
7.7.1 	       ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
     A.	 Guiding Policies
     1.	 Preserve Dublin’s historic structures.
         Seven sites in the Primary Planning Area are listed in the California Archaeological Inventory,
         Northwest Information Center, at Sonoma State University including the church and school
         on the grounds of the Dublin Heritage Park and Museums. As many as a dozen potentially
         significant historic and prehistoric sites have been identified in the Eastern Extended Planning
         Area.
     2.	 Follow State regulations as set forth in Public Resources Code Section 21083.2 regarding
         discovery of archaeological sites, and Historical Resources, as defined in Section 5020.1 of
         the Public Resources Code.
     3.	 Preserve the Green Store.
         The Green Store is a recognized historical resource and has been used as a church since
         1989. This use can remain as long as the landowner(s) wish to continue its operation. The
         Parks/ Public Recreation designation on the General Plan Land Use Map illustrates the long-
         term potential for expansion of the Dublin Heritage Park and Museums to include this historic
         structure and the property it is on and is not intended to affect or change the current church
         use or its continued operation as a religious land use under a valid conditional use permit.
7.8	          OPEN SPACE MAINTENANCE / MANAGEMENT	
Acquisition of existing open space areas has been accomplished through Planned Developments and
subdivision approvals. Since the Primary Planning Area is mostly built out, there will be no additional
major areas set aside for open space.
In the Western and Eastern Extended Planning Areas, substantial areas are designated for open space.
The Eastern Dublin Specific Plan includes additional information on designated areas of open space
and mechanisms for maintenance and management.
In addition, the City’s Park and Recreation Master Plan contains information on open space acquisition
and maintenance.
7.8.1 	       ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
     A.	 Guiding Policy
     1.	 Require open space management and maintenance programs for open space areas established
         through subdivisions and Planned Development districts. Programs shall include standards
         to ensure control of potential hazards; appropriate setbacks; and management of the open
         space so that it produces a positive and pleasing visual image.

   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 Require that land designated and offered as open space in conjunction with development
        approval be permanently restricted to open space use by recorded map or deed.
   2.	 Require revegetation of cut and fill slopes.
   3.	 Require use of native trees, shrubs and grasses with low maintenance costs in revegetation
        of cut and fill slopes.
   4.	 Access roads (including emergency access roads), arterial streets and collector streets that
        must pass through open space areas shall be designed to minimize grading to the maximum
        extent possible, so as not to damage the ecological and/or aesthetic value and characteristics
        of the open space area. (See also Implementing Policy 7.8.2.A.1 below.)
   5.	 Prohibit development within designated open space areas except that which is designed to
        enhance public safety and the environmental setting.
   6.	 Promote inclusion of hiking, bicycling, and/or equestrian trails within designated open space
        areas.
7.8.2	       EASTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA 	
   A.	 Implementing Policy
   1.	 Due to difficult terrain, some damage to ecological and aesthetic values may result from
        construction of streets and emergency access roads in the Extended Planning Area. These
        roads shall be designed to incorporate feasible measures which minimize adverse effects on
        visual and biological resources.

RESOURCES MANAGEMENT:
     SEISMIC SAFETY AND
         SAFETY ELEMENT

8.1	INTRODUCTION	
Government Code sec. 65302(g) requires safety elements to address the protection of the community
from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground
shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and
landslides; subsidence, liquefaction and other seismic hazards or geologic hazards; flooding; and,
wildland and urban fires. The statute requires that seismic and geologic hazard areas be mapped. It
also requires the element to address evacuation routes, military installations, peakload water supply,
minimum road widths and clearances around structures for geologic and fire hazards identified in the
element.
Addressing the hazards relevant to Dublin, this Seismic Safety and Safety Element provides an
assessment of the risk of ground shaking, rupture, and failure due to earthquakes. The element
discusses landslide, subsidence and liquefaction hazards. It also discusses flooding, and urban and
wildland fires. Related discussion and analysis of these hazards is located in the Technical Supplement
and the Conservation Element (Chapter 4).
The planning area offers examples of most of the geologic hazards commonly found in California, but
only two—downslope movement (mainly landslides) and surface fault rupture due to earthquakes—
are significant constraints on the location of urban development. Downslope movement includes
landslides, rockfalls, debris flows, and soil creep. Factors affecting downslope movement are
groundwater, rock and soil type, slope angle, propensity to erosion, seismic activity, vegetation, and
grading or other human alterations.
The Calaveras Fault is the major active fault in the planning area with rupture potential and runs
parallel to and just west of San Ramon Road. The Pleasanton Fault, near the west edge of Camp
Parks, is difficult to locate precisely. The State has identified Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones
along both faults, requiring detailed studies of rupture hazards prior to construction.
Few potential building sites within the Primary or Extended Planning Areas are without geologic
impact or hazard. The hazard may be actual, such as an active landslide or proximity to an active
fault, or potential, such as a proposed cut that might activate a landslide. Mitigation of hazards may
increase construction cost, but will reduce long-term costs to both property owners and the City.
8.2 	         SEISMIC SAFETY	
8.2.1 	       ALL PLANNING AREAS	
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 Geologic hazards shall be mitigated or development shall be located away from geologic
          hazards in order to preserve life, protect property, and reasonably limit the financial risks to
          the City of Dublin and other public agencies that would result from damage to poorly located
          public facilities.
   City of Dublin General Plan | Seismic Safety & Safety Element                                      8–1

    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Structural and Grading Requirements	
            a.	 All structures shall be designed to the standards delineated in the Dublin Building
                Code and Dublin’s Grading Ordinance. A “design earthquake” shall be established by
                an engineering geologist for each structure for which ground shaking is a significant
                design factor.
            b.	 Structures intended for human occupancy shall be at least 50 feet from any active
                fault trace; freestanding garages and storage structures may be as close as 25 feet.
                These distances may be reduced based on adequate exploration to accurately locate
                the fault trace.
            c.	 Generally, facilities should not be built astride potential rupture zones, although
                certain low-risk facilities may be considered. Critical facilities that must cross a fault,
                such as oil, gas, and water lines, shall be designed to accommodate the maximum
                expected offset from fault rupture. Site specific evaluations shall determine the
                maximum credible offset.
    2.	 Required Geotechnical Analyses
            d.	 A preliminary geologic hazards report shall be prepared for all subdivisions. Any
                other facility that could create a geologic hazard, such as a road or a building on
                hillside terrain, must also have such a study. Each of the geologic and seismic hazards
                described in the Seismic Safety and Safety Element must be evaluated. This hazard
                analysis shall be prepared by a registered engineering geologist.
            e.	 Detailed geologic studies shall be required at the tentative subdivision map stage for
                all projects located within the Landslide Hazard Area Boundary as identified on the
                Geologic Hazards and Constraints Map (Figure 8-1), and for other proposed projects
                if the preliminary investigation indicates a potential geologic hazard. Proposals for
                mitigation shall be included at this stage. The detailed analysis for projects in the
                Landslide Hazard Area Boundary must consider:
                1.	 Cumulative effect of new development on a partially developed slide;
                2.	 Effects of septic leach systems, garden watering, and altered drainage patterns;
                3.	 Impact of a maximum credible earthquake;
                4.	 Where applicable, passage of the Calaveras Fault through or under landslide
                     deposits;
                5.	 Debris flow and other downslope hazards (especially common in the Eastern
                     Extended Planning Area). Care must be taken not to locate structures in the path
                     of potential debris flows.
                6.	 Where published maps identify or show “ancient” or Quaternary slides on
                     sites of proposed development, their stability must be analyzed, and effects of
                     the proposed development on the area’s stability must be evaluated by a soils
                     engineer.
            f.	 If the preliminary report indicates liquefaction potential, an engineering analysis
                and design, if necessary, to mitigate liquefaction hazards, shall be required for all
8–2                                   City of Dublin General Plan | Seismic Safety & Safety Element

                  structures planned for human occupancy.
              g.	 Evaluation for shrink-swell potential shall be included with all soils reports and
                  design recommendations formulated where the potential is present. These analyses
                  and recommendations shall include public streets and utilities, in order to reduce
                  future public repair costs.
              h.	 A surface fault rupture evaluation, as outlined by the State of California Department
                  of Conservation, California Geological Survey and in accordance with the Alquist-
                  Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act shall be required for all development within the
                  identified Earthquake Fault Zones as shown on the Geologic Hazards and Constraints
                  Map (Figure 8-1). The surface fault rupture evaluation shall be conducted as part of
                  the development review process after building sites are specifically defined.
              i.	 Any changes in grading or building design that would be significantly affected by
                  geologic hazards or soils conditions, or in turn would significantly alter geologic
                  or soils conditions, shall be accompanied by a re-analysis of those conditions. In
                  addition, any conditions discovered during excavation or grading that significantly
                  depart from the previously described geologic and soils setting shall be evaluated.
     3.	 Existing Structures
              j.	 Post-earthquake or damage reconstruction of existing structures shall be permitted
                  only if mitigating factors are incorporated.
     4.	 Data Review and Collection	
              k.	 All required reports and data shall be reviewed by the Alameda County Geologist
                  or a consulting engineering geologist. This individual shall participate in the review
                  process from the earliest proposal stage to completion of the project.
              l.	 A file of all geologic and soils reports and grading plans shall be maintained as
                  reference material for future planning and design on each site as well as on adjacent
                  sites.
              m.	 City and developer shall endeavor to fully disclose hazards to present and future
                  occupants and property owners.
     5.	 Earthquake Response Plan	
              n.	 In 2004 Dublin adopted a Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan to
                  address the City’s responsibilities associated with a natural disaster, human-caused
                  emergencies and technological incidents. The City will periodically review the Plan to
                  prepare for and respond to seismic events.
              o.	 The City shall prepare and periodically review a route plan for evacuation of Dublin
                  in the event of a major seismic event.
8.3	SAFETY	
Policies relating to landslides, a significant geologic hazard, are included in this Seismic Safety and
Safety Element, although not all slides are likely to be induced by earthquakes. Fire, flood, and
   City of Dublin General Plan | Seismic Safety & Safety Element                                     8–3

hazardous materials are the remaining safety concerns addressed in the General Plan.
8.3.1	        EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS GUIDING POLICY	
8.3.1.1 	     ALL PLANNING AREAS	
    A. 	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 In 2010 the City adopted a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan as an annex to the Comprehensive
         Emergency Management Plan to assess hazards and mitigate risks prior to a disaster event.
         The City will periodically review the Plan to prepare for emergencies.
8.3.2	        FIRE HAZARD AND FIRE PROTECTION	
 The Alameda County Fire Department serves as the fire department for the City of Dublin and as such
provides all fire prevention, fire protection and First Responder Emergency Medical Services including
advanced life support (paramedics) within the City.
Dublin San Ramon Services District (DSRSD) supplies water to the City of Dublin for both domestic
use and fire protection purposes through a series of pipelines, pump stations and reservoirs. For fire
protection, Alameda County Fire specifies the required fire flows which the DSRSD system is designed
to provide. Alameda County Fire requires a minimum of 1,500 gallons of water per minute for two
hours. For sprinklered buildings, up to 2,000 gallons of water per minute is needed for four hours.
The DSRSD system has separate fire protection storage with an adequate volume of water for two
simultaneous fires and the storage is kept full at all times.
Steep, inaccessible slopes and brush create a high fire hazard in the western hills. Additionally, areas
within the Extended Planning Areas that are adjacent to open space are susceptible to fire hazards.
For projects that are constructed outside a fire station service area (greater than 1.5 miles from the
nearest fire station) and/or interface with open space, certain built-in fire protection measures will be
necessary.
8.3.2.1 	     ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 Require special precautions against fire as a condition of development approval in the
         western hills and elsewhere in the Extended Planning Areas where proposed development
         would interface with open space.
    B.	 Implementing Policy
    1.	 Continue to enforce the City’s wild land urban interface regulations.
8.3.2.2 	     WESTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA 	
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 It is the City’s intent that a full fire station shall be provided in the Western Extended Planning
         Area before any substantial development proceeds beyond the general vicinity of Schaefer
         Ranch Road.

8.3.3	FLOODING	
Figure 8-2 delineates flood prone areas in the City of Dublin. The areas shown identify the 100 and
500 year flood zones. Figure 8-2 is based on data provided by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA). Both 100 and 500 year floor zones have been identified in portions of the Primary
and Eastern Extended Planning Areas; no100 year or 500 year flood zones have been identified in the
Western Extended Planning Area.
Most of the areas in the 100 year flood plain have been built upon. Any new construction in flood
prone areas must comply with Chapter 7.24 (Flood Control) of Title 7 of the Dublin Municipal Code
including constructing the first floor above the floodplain level.
A number of channel improvements have been implemented since the early 1990’s as a result of local
developments partnering with Zone 7 and/or the City of Dublin, and Caltrans transportation projects. 
Channel improvements have been made along Tassajara Creek (Line K), Alamo Creek (Line F), and Big
Canyon Creek (Line J-1).  In addition to the major creeks in Dublin, several tributaries have undergone
improvements as well, including the undergrounding of Line G-3 and the channel wall raising of Line
G-5.
While no major flood improvement projects have clearly been identified in the City of Dublin for the
future, Zone 7 is presently working on an update to their Stream Management Master Plan (SMMP),
which will consider new, innovative approaches to providing regional flood protection, including
options that may include the use of enhanced floodplains and vegetated stormwater channels.  Areas
along Chabot Canal located in Camp Parks and upland areas along Tassajara Creek will likely present
partnering opportunities for Zone 7 and the City of Dublin.
8.3.3.1 	    ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
     A.	 Guiding Policy
     1.	 Regulate development in hill areas to minimize runoff by preserving woodlands and riparian
         vegetation. Retain creek channels with ample right-of-way for maintenance and for maximum
         anticipated flow.
     B.	 Implementing Policies
     1.	 Require dedication of broad stream corridors as a condition of subdivision or other
         development approval.
     2.	 Protect riparian vegetation and prohibit removal of woodlands wherever possible. Replant
         vegetation according to the standards in the Eastern Dublin Specific Plan or other applicable
         standards (see also General Plan Guiding Policy 3.1.A).
     3.	 Require drainage studies of entire small watersheds and assurance that appropriate mitigation
         measures will be completed as needed prior to approval of development in the extended
         planning areas.
     4.	 Continue to participate in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) flood
         insurance program.
     5.	 Prepare an annual update of flood prone areas and related issues and present to the City
         Council for their information and appropriate action, if any.

    6.	 See additional policies in the Conservation Element (Chapter 7).
8.3.4	       HAZARDOUS MATERIALS	
Hazardous materials are transported on the freeways and some are used by Dublin industries.
The Dublin San Ramon Services District, Alameda County Fire Department and the Dublin Police
Department form the City’s hazardous materials team.
8.3.4.1 	    ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
    A.	 Guiding Policies
    1.	 Maintain and enhance the ability to regulate the use, transport, and storage of hazardous
        materials and to quickly identify substances and take appropriate action during emergencies.
    2.	 Minimize the risk of exposure to hazardous materials from contaminated sites.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Consider formation of a regional hazardous materials team consisting of specially trained
        personnel from all Tri-Valley public safety agencies.
    2.	 As part of the City’s Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan, the City has adopted a
        Hazardous Materials Response Plan. The City will periodically review the Plan to prepare for
        and respond to emergencies related to hazardous materials.
    3.	 Periodically review and enforce the City’s ordinances regulating the handling, transport, and
        storage of hazardous materials and hazardous waste.
    4.	 Require site-specific hazardous materials studies for new development projects where there
        is a potential for the presence of hazardous materials from previous uses on the site. If
        hazardous materials are found, require the clean-up of sites to acceptable regulatory
        standards prior to development.
8.4	         AIRPORT LAND USE COMPATIBILITY	
8.4.1	       EASTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA 	
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 All proposed land uses within the Airport Influence Area (AIA) shall be reviewed for consistency
        with the safety compatibility policies and airspace protection policies of the Airport Land Use
        Compatibility Plan (ALUCP) for the Livermore Municipal Airport.
    B.	 Implementing Policy
    1.	 Adopt an Airport Overlay Zoning District to ensure that all proposed development within
        the Airport Influence Area (AIA) is reviewed for consistency with all applicable Livermore
        Municipal Airport, Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP) policies.

RESOURCES MANAGEMENT:
         NOISE ELEMENT

9.1 	          INTRODUCTION 	
Government Code sec. 65302(f) outlines the statutory requirements for Noise Elements. Recognizing
the State Office of Noise Control (ONC) guidelines, Noise Elements must quantify current and
projected noise levels for local noise sources. Among the noise sources to be evaluated are highways
and freeways, arterials and major streets, railroads and rapid transit systems, airports and heliports,
industrial plants, and other ground stationary sources identified by local agencies as contributing to
the community noise environment.
Traffic noise is the major source of noise in Dublin’s three Planning Areas. Therefore, the focus of
this Noise Element is the effect of traffic noise on locating categories of land use and developing
projects within those categories. Information supporting the adopted noise policies is located in
the corresponding Noise Element section of the Technical Supplement. The City’s Planning Areas
contain no railroads, airports, heliports or industrial plants. However, the Parks Reserve Forces Training
Area (Parks RFTA) does contain a heliport and is located between Dublin’s Primary and Eastern
Extended Planning Areas. Noise impacts from the Parks RFTA were addressed in the Army’s 2005
Environmental Noise Management Plan (ENMP). Additionally, the southern portions of the Eastern
Extended Planning Area east of Tassajara Road fall within the Livermore Municipal Airports Airport
Influence Area (AIA). Noise impacts from the Livermore Municipal Airport were addressed in Alameda
County’s 2012 Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP). Development within the AIA must be
consistent with the ALUCP.
Traffic is the primary source of continuous noise in Dublin. Noise exposure contours have been plotted
for 2011 (based on current traffic data) and projected to 2035 based on anticipated traffic volume
increases (see Figures 9-1 and 9-2). The Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) describes 24-hour
average noise levels measured in decibels (dB) taking into account the increased sensitivity of people
to noise during evening and nighttime hours. Sound levels between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. are
penalized 5 dB and those between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. are penalized 10 dB. The dB scale is
logarithmic; a 3 dB difference normally is discernable and a 10 dB increase is subjectively heard as a
doubling in loudness.
The Land Use Compatibility Table (Table 9.1) provides the basis for decisions on the location of land
uses in relation to noise sources, and for determining noise mitigation needs. Noise impacts resulting
from development within the Eastern Extended Planning Area were addressed in the Eastern Dublin
Specific Plan Environmental Impact Report and subsequent environmental analyses for projects within
the Eastern Extended Planning Area.
9.2 	          TRAFFIC NOISE	
9.2.1 	        ALL PLANNING AREAS	
     A.	 Guiding Policy
     1.	 Where feasible, mitigate traffic noise to levels indicated by Table 9.1: Land Use Compatibility
          for Community Noise Environments.
    City of Dublin General Plan | Noise Element                                                        9–1

    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Encourage homeowners west of San Ramon Road who are affected by 1-580 noise to
        construct noise barriers on their properties where these would be effective and require such
        barriers for new development. This policy also applies to sites adjoining the west side of San
        Ramon Road at higher elevations.
        Where the noise source is below the receptors, only barriers near the receptor will be effective.
        About 5 dB noise reduction could be achieved.
    2.	 Support unified action by residential owners on the east side of San Ramon Road and along
        Village Parkway to install, repair, or extend noise barriers.
        Much of this frontage was developed before effective noise barriers were required as a
        condition of subdivision approval. Because construction for a single lot is costly, relatively
        ineffective, and potentially unattractive, the City should assist in the formation of assessment
        districts or otherwise promote group action where there is consensus that a problem exists.
    3.	 Design Dougherty Road improvements and adjoining residential development for compliance
        with noise standards.
        This corridor offers the opportunity to do it right the first time without continuous walls.
        Berms, open space, garages near the road, and noise-conscious site planning can be used.
    4.	 Noise impacts related to all new development shall be analyzed by a certified acoustic
        consultant.
    5.	 Request demonstration of ability to mitigate noise prior to approval of light rail or bus service
        in the Southern Pacific Right-of-Way Transportation Corridor.
        A depressed rail line or noise walls close to the tracks could make light rail a good neighbor.
    6.	 Review all multi-family development proposals within the projected 60 CNEL contour for
        compliance with noise standards (45 CNEL in any habitable room) as required by State law.
        Because the General Plan designates almost all residential sites subject to 60 or greater
        CNEL for multifamily development, this standard will be effective in Dublin. Project designers
        may use one or more of four available categories of mitigation measures: site planning,
        architectural layout (bedrooms away from noise source, for example), noise barriers, or
        construction modifications.
    7.	 Review all non-residential development proposals within the projected CNEL 65 dBA contour
        for compliance with exterior noise transmission standards as required by the California Green
        Building Standards Code.

 *	 Conditionally acceptable exposure requires noise insulation features in building design. Conventional construction,
    but with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning will normally suffice.

LAND USE AND CIRCULATION:
    PARKS AND OPEN SPACE
                 ELEMENT

3.1 	          INTRODUCTION 	
Government Code sec. 65302(a) requires land use elements to designate open space for recreation,
agriculture, visual enjoyment and natural resources. Government Code sec. 65560 defines the
following six categories of open space lands:
     1.	 Open space for the preservation of natural resources.
     2.	 Open space for the managed production of resources.
     3.	 Open space for outdoor recreation.
     4.	 Open space for public health and safety.
     5.	 Open space in support of the mission of military installations.
     6.	 Open space for the protection of Native American historical, cultural and sacred sites.
Government Code sec. 65564 requires local open space plans to include action programs with specific
programs to implement open space policies. Public Resources Code sec. 5076 requires that demand
for trail oriented recreational uses be considered when developing the open space programs. It further
requires that the open space plan consider integrating local trails with the state trails system.
Policies and programs to provide open space both within and apart from development projects are
included in this Parks and Open Space Element. Related provisions to protect particular natural
resources through open space planning are included in the Conservation Element (Chapter 7).
Background information upon which open space and conservation policies are based is located in the
corresponding Open Space and Conservation sections of the Technical Supplement.
The Government Code requires discussion of several resources which do not occur in the Dublin
planning area such as open space for the protection of Native American historical, cultural and
sacred sites and therefore, have not been analyzed. Additionally, the open space plan for preservation
of natural resources does not address ecological or scientific study areas, bays, estuaries, coastal
beaches or lakeshores. Similarly, the open space plan for managed production of resources does not
address bays, estuaries, marshes, commercial fisheries, or mineral deposits. Flooding is addressed in
the Seismic Safety and Safety Element (Chapter 8).
3.2	           OPEN SPACE FOR PRESERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES
	              AND FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY	
Open space areas should be preserved for the preservation of natural resources and for public health
and safety. Methods of preserving open space should be explored, including fee purchase, conservation
and scenic easements, transfer of development rights, and special district financing.
3.2.1	         PRIMARY PLANNING AREA AND EASTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA
     A. 	 Guiding Policies
     1.	 Preservation of oak woodlands, riparian vegetation, and natural creeks as open space for their
    City of Dublin General Plan | Open Space Element                                               3–1

        natural resource value is of the highest importance. Limited modifications may be permitted
        on a case-by-case basis with adequate mitigation to replace disturbed resources.
    2.	 Generally, maintain slopes over thirty percent as permanent open space for public health
        and safety. Consider development in areas with slopes over 30 percent only if the area to be
        developed is: 1) less than three acres in size; 2) less than 20 percent of a large developable
        area; and, 3) surrounded by slopes less than 30 percent.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Continue requiring preservation of steep slopes and ridges as open space as a condition of
        subdivision map approval.
    2.	 Encourage an efficient and higher intensity use of the flat and gently sloping portions of
        the planning area as a means of minimizing grading requirements and potential impacts to
        environmental and aesthetic resources.
3.2.2	      WESTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA 	
    A.	 Guiding Policies
    1.	 East of the Urban Limit Line development generally shall be confined to areas where slopes
        are under thirty percent, as part of an overall cluster development concept on approved
        development plans. Within projects proposing clustered development and ancillary facilities
        east of the Urban Limit Line in the Western Extended Planning Area, land alteration on slopes
        over thirty percent may be considered where the following conditions are present:
            a.	 Public health and safety risks can be reduced to an acceptable level.
            b.	 Proposed land alteration would be necessary to achieve a basic public need, such as
                 housing, recreation, street access, or public facilities.
            c.	 Long-term visual qualities can be maintained for residents of Dublin and nearby
                 communities.
    2.	 Existing large stands of woodland and coastal scrub in the Western Extended Planning Area
        shall be protected wherever possible. Grassland sites shall be considered for development in
        preference to native shrub and woodland areas.
    B.	 Implementing Policy
    1.	 As conditions of development project approval, require detailed tree surveys, protection
        measures for existing trees to remain, and replanting of native vegetation.
3.2.3	      DUBLIN CROSSING PLANNING AREA 	
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 The creation of any new parks or open space areas for the preservation of natural resources
        or for public health and safety in the Dublin Crossing Planning Area shall be in compliance
        with the Dublin Crossing Specific Plan.

     B.	 Implementing Policies
     1.	 Provide pedestrian and bicycle facilities to meet the goals and objectives of the Specific
         Plan and to promote alternatives to automobile use and reduce parking demand. Pedestrian
         sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and multi-use trails shall safely connect residential, commercial, and
         recreational uses to each other and to transit facilities.
     2.	 Community and Neighborhood Park land shall be owned by the City of Dublin and shall
         be used in accordance with the Specific Plan. Land designated as open space, creeks and
         waterways, and water treatment/detention/bioretention facilities required to serve the
         Specific Plan area will not be owned or maintained by the City of Dublin.
     3.	 Underground water detention facilities shall be allowed within the envelope of Central
         Park and shall be designed to enable the development of or programming of above-ground
         facilities.
     4.	 The alignment of Chabot Creek shall be allowed within the boundaries of Central Park and
         shall be counted within the 30 net-acre calculation of usable park land in accordance with
         the Project Development Agreement. While it is within the park boundaries, Chabot Creek
         shall be owned and maintained by a separate entity that is acceptable to the City.

3.3.1	        EXTENDED PLANNING AREAS	
All properties within the Eastern Extended Planning Area previously under Williamson Act Agreement
contracts (Government Code Section 51200, et. seq.) have expired. Portions of the Western Extended
Planning Area remain under Williamson Act Agreement contracts. Under the Williamson Act, property
taxes are based on the agricultural value of land rather than its market value. The contract automatically
renews each year for the new 10-year period unless the property owner or the County gives notice
of non-renewal.
     A.	 Guiding Policy
     1.	 Lands currently in the Williamson Act agricultural preserve can remain as rangeland as long
         as the landowner(s) wish to pursue agricultural activities. The City does not support the
         cancellation of Williamson Act contracts unless some compelling public interest would be
         served.
         The urban land use designations in the General Plan Land Use Map (Figure 1-1) illustrate
         ultimate (i.e. long-term) urban development potential, and do not represent a call for the
         cessation of agricultural activities. To pursue development of their property, any development
         proposal must be consistent with the General Plan and applicable Specific Plan policies for
         the site. A development application cannot be approved until a property owner has notified
         the applicable agency of the intent to cancel, or not renew, any prevailing Williamson Act
         contract on the subject property.

    B.	 Implementing Policy
    1.	 Approval to develop agricultural land not under contract shall require findings that the land
         is suitable for the intended use and will have adequate urban services, and that conversion
         to urban use will not have significant adverse effects on adjoining lands remaining under
         contract.
3.4	          OPEN SPACE FOR OUTDOOR RECREATION 	
Dublin has a variety of outdoor recreational sites including neighborhood parks, community parks,
community facilities, open space areas and a series of trail networks. Refer to Figure 3-1 for the
location of parks, community facilities, open space areas and trails. Additionally the City has adopted
a Parks and Recreation Master Plan that encompasses both the Primary and Extended Planning Areas.
This Plan qualifies and quantifies the City’s need for recreation facilities.
3.4.1 	       PRIMARY AND EXTENDED PLANNING AREAS 	
    A.	 Guiding Policies
    1.	 Expand park area throughout the Primary and Extended Planning Areas to serve new
         development.
    2.	 Maintain and improve existing outdoor facilities in conformance with the recommendations
         of the City’s Parks and Recreation Master Plan.
    3.	 Restrict structures on the hillsides that appear to project above major ridgelines.
         The present undisturbed natural ridgelines as seen from the Primary Planning Area and key
         travel corridors are an essential component of Dublin’s appearance as a freestanding city
         ringed by open hills.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Acquire and improve parklands in conformance with the standards and policies in the City’s
         Parks and Recreation Master Plan.
    2.	 Continue to maintain and periodically update the Citywide Parks and Recreation Master Plan.
         The Master Plan shall provide specific standards for acquiring parkland to support growth
         planned in the Land Use Element.
    3.	 The policies set forth below, as implemented through the Parks and Recreation Master Plan
         and development approvals, constitute the action program for preserving and providing open
         space for outdoor recreation.
    4.	 Use subdivision design and site design review process to preserve or enhance the ridgelines
         that form the skyline as viewed from freeways (I-580 or I-680) or major arterial streets
         (Dublin Boulevard, Amador Valley Boulevard, San Ramon Road, Village Parkway, Dougherty
         Road, Tassajara Road, and Fallon Road).

3.4.2 	      EASTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA 	
   A.	 Guiding Policies
   1.	 Provide active parks and facilities which are adequate to meet citywide needs for open space,
        cultural, and sports facilities, as well as the local needs of the Eastern Extended Planning
        Area.
   2.	 Establish a trail system with connections to planned regional and sub-regional systems,
        including north-south corridors such as East Bay Regional Park District’s trail along Tassajara
        Creek north to Mt. Diablo State Park.
   3.	 Using the natural stream corridors and major ridgelines, establish a comprehensive, integrated
        trail network within the Planning Area that permits safe and convenient pedestrian and
        bicycle access within urban areas and between urban areas and open space areas. Per the
        2005 Fallon Village amendment, in order to preserve biological resources, trails in Fallon
        Village will not be placed along ridgelines and in stream corridors.
   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 Require land dedication and improvements for the parks designated in the General Plan
        for the Eastern Extended Planning Area and based on a standard of 5 net acres per 1,000
        residents. Collect in-lieu park fees as required by City policies.
   2.	 Require land dedication and improvements for trails along designated stream corridors.
        Per the 2005 Fallon Village amendment, in order to preserve biological resources, no land
        dedication for trails along designated stream corridors outside the open space corridor, shall
        be required for projects in Fallon Village.
   3.	 Require land dedication and/or public easement for ridgeline trail. Per the 2005 Fallon Village
        amendment, in order to preserve biological resources, no land dedication for ridgeline trails
        shall be required for projects in Fallon Village.
   4.	 Confer with East Bay Regional Park District regarding the potential for the District assuming
        responsibility for the design, construction, and maintenance of the Tassajara Creek trail
        corridor and parkway.
   5.	 Confer with East Bay Regional Park District regarding the District’s standards for design and
        construction of the Tassajara Creek trail corridor and parkway, and regarding the potential for
        the District to assume responsibility for the maintenance of the Tassajara Creek trail corridor
        and parkway.
3.4.3 	      WESTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA 	
   A.	 Guiding Policies
   1.	 Provide a north-south trail link across the Planning Area, as part of a regional trail network.
   2.	 Create a local trail network which links large areas of permanent open space, while providing
        convenient access from nearby residential areas. Maximize visual exposure to open space,
        and provide multiple local physical access points to increase public enjoyment of open space.

    3.	 Provide active recreation facilities to serve neighborhood residents.
    B.	 Implementing Policy
    1.	 In conjunction with development approvals, promote land dedication or reservation, and
        improvements for a ridgeline regional trail and other trail links.
3.4.4	      DUBLIN CROSSING PLANNING AREA	
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 The creation of any new parks or open space areas for outdoor recreation in the Dublin
        Crossing Planning Area shall be in compliance with the Dublin Crossing Specific Plan.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Locate the Community Park near the intersection of Dublin Boulevard, Scarlett Drive and the
        Iron Horse Regional Trail to provide physical and visual access to the Dublin Community and
        to enable a strong connection between the parks in the Specific Plan area and the Iron Horse
        Regional Trail.
    2.	 The park and open space system shall be designed to reinforce a sense of community identity
        and character for the Specific Plan area and the City of Dublin.
    3.	 Create a park system in which each park satisfies the recreation needs of a variety of user
        groups and a range of active and passive activities.
    4.	 Create public open spaces that are active, safe, and inviting, and allow for playful elements,
        such as interactive sculptures and furniture.

                  City of Dublin
                General Plan
                      Chapter 4
LAND USE AND CIRCULATION:
   SCHOOLS, PUBLIC LANDS,
    AND UTILITIES ELEMENT

4.1 	          INTRODUCTION 	
Government Code sec. 65302(a) and (b) require that schools, public lands and public utilities be
addressed in the Land Use and Circulation Elements. Dublin has included these three uses of land in a
separate Element because they generally are operated by independent units of government, whereas
most of the other development related uses of land addressed in the statutes involve city regulation.
Information supporting the schools, public lands and public utilities policies is located in the Technical
Supplement.
4.2	           PUBLIC SCHOOLS	
The Dublin Unified School District (DUSD) provides public education in the City of Dublin. The School
District currently operates elementary, middle and high schools in the Primary and Eastern Extended
Planning Areas. At build-out of the General Plan, DUSD estimates a student enrollment of 9,755
students. Refer to Figure 4-1 for the location of existing and future public school sites.
4.2.1 	        ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
    A.	 Guiding Policies
    1.	 Cooperate with the Dublin Unified School District to ensure preservation of surplus sites
          compatible with surrounding land uses and Housing Element objectives.
    2.	 Cooperate with the Dublin Unified School District to ensure provision of school facilities in
          the Extended Planning Areas.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Initiate preparation of site plans or specific plans jointly with the Dublin Unified School District
          prior to sale of surplus sites.
    2.	 As a condition of project approval in the Extended Planning Area, it is required that logical and
          buildable school sites be offered for dedication according to the State’s Board of Education
          guidelines and acceptable to the Dublin Unified School District.
          This type of cooperation will achieve harmonious relationships between new development
          and existing residential areas and new park sites (See Open Space Element).
4.2.2 	        EASTERN EXTENDED PLANNING AREA 	
    A.	 Guiding Policies
    1.	 Provide new elementary, middle, and high schools as needed to serve the future population
          of the Extended Planning Area.
    2.	 Schools located within the City should be operated by the Dublin Unified School District.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Require provision of school sites through dedication and/or developer fees. Establish
   City of Dublin General Plan | Schools, Public Lands, and Utilities Element                          4–1

         appropriate mechanism for funding development of school facilities.
     2.	 Work with the Livermore Joint Unified School District to revise jurisdictional boundaries to
         best serve the needs of Dublin students.
4.3	          PUBLIC LANDS	
Federal and County governments have large holdings in eastern Dublin that are vital to Dublin’s
image and its eastward expansion. Refer to Figure 4-1 for the location of public lands.
4.3.1 	       ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
     A.	 Guiding Policies
     1.	 Maintain communication with military administrators and congressional representatives to
         urge that the Parks Reserve Forces Training Area (Parks RFTA or Camp Parks) be developed
         and operated as a good neighbor to Dublin.
     2.	 Require strict adherence to the land use provisions of the City-County Annexation Agreement
         for the Santa Rita Property owned by Alameda County Surplus Property Authority.
     B.	 Implementing Policies
     1.	 Negotiate participation by the Parks Reserve Forces Training Area (Parks RFTA or Camp Parks)
         in the design of the Dougherty Road improvements and the establishment of a landscaped
         buffer strip.
     2.	 Negotiate reservation of an alignment for Dublin Boulevard extension across the Parks
         Reserve Forces Training Area (Parks RFTA or Camp Parks) and Santa Rita land. Consult
         with the Federal and County governments concerning appropriate uses and development
         standards between Dublin Boulevard extension and 1-580.
     3.	 Notify military representatives at the Parks Reserve Forces Training Area (Parks RFTA or Camp
         Parks) of General Plan amendments and development applications for all projects within
         1,000 feet of Parks RFTA.
4.4	          SOLID WASTE	
The legislature passed the California Integrated Waste Management Act (AB 939) in 1989 to require
each jurisdiction to prepare a Source Reduction and Recycling Element and a Household Hazardous
Waste Element. While these Elements are not required to be part of a City’s General Plan, planning
policy nevertheless should be guided by the Elements since solid waste disposal is a necessary service
for new development.
The City of Dublin enters into a Franchise Agreement with a private solid waste collection company for
residential and commercial garbage collection. The City also has a comprehensive recycling program
that collects both recycling and organics. All single family residences and commercial businesses are
provided with recycling containers and all multi-family residences have access to recycling services.
4–2                        City of Dublin General Plan | Schools, Public Lands, and Utilities Element

Solid waste generated within the City is deposited at the Altamont Landfill which has a total estimated
permitted capacity of 62 million cubic yards. The Altamont Landfill is approximately 26% full and is
estimated to reach capacity in January 2029.
4.4.1 	      ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 Ensure that adequate solid waste disposal capacity is available, to avoid constraining
         development, consistent with the Dublin General Plan.
    B.	 Implementing Policies
    1.	 Continue to enforce the City Source Reduction and Recycling / Household Hazardous Waste
         Elements.
    2.	 Cooperate with Alameda County, as necessary, for adoption and implementation of the
         County Integrated Waste Management Plan.
    3.	 Prior to project approval, the applicant shall demonstrate that capacity will exist in solid
         waste disposal facilities for their project prior to the issuance of building permits.
    4.	 Large scale projects should be required to submit a plan that demonstrates how they will
         contribute toward the City’s State mandated diversion requirement.
4.5	         SEWAGE TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL	
The Dublin San Ramon Services District (DSRSD) is the purveyor of wastewater collection and
treatment services in the City of Dublin. The wastewater collection system includes over 170 miles of
sanitary sewers ranging from six to forty-two inches in diameter that are from five to over forty years
old. Disposal of treated wastewater is under the jurisdiction of the Livermore-Amador Valley Water
Management Authority (LAVWMA). Wastewater collected from the DSRSD service area travels by
gravity to the DSRSD wastewater treatment plant which is located in the City of Pleasanton. The plant
has a rated dry-weather capacity of 17.0 million gallons per day (mgd). Disposal of treated effluent
from the treatment plant in Pleasanton is the responsibility of LAVWMA who exports secondary
treated wastewater to the East Bay Dischargers Authority interceptor pipeline for ultimate discharge to
the San Francisco Bay via a deepwater outfall. LAVWMA facilities are designed to export a maximum
flow of 41.2 mgd during wet weather events.
4.5.1 	      ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
    A.	 Guiding Policy
    1.	 Expand sewage treatment and disposal capacity to avoid constraining development consistent
         with the Dublin General Plan.
    B.	 Implementing Policy
    1.	 Prior to project approval, developers shall demonstrate that adequate capacity will exist in
   City of Dublin General Plan | Schools, Public Lands, and Utilities Element                       4–3

         sewage treatment and disposal facilities for their projects prior to the issuance of building
         permits
4.6	         WATER SUPPLY	
The Dublin San Ramon Services District (DSRSD) is the purveyor of potable water in the City of
Dublin. In addition to potable water, DSRSD provides recycled (reclaimed) water for irrigation and
other non-potable uses. DSRSD is responsible for planning to supply sufficient water to meet the
anticipated growth in demand through a combination of potable and recycled water supplies as well
as conservation of water resources. The wholesale supplier of water to DSRSD is the Alameda County
Flood Control and Water Conservation District, otherwise known as Zone 7. DSRSD has a contract
with Zone 7 which establishes the obligations between the parties to meet the demand in the DSRSD
service area. Zone 7 relies on a combination of supplies to meet treated and untreated demands
including imported surface water and local runoff. If Zone 7 is unable to deliver sufficient water to
satisfy DSRSD’s needs then DSRSD is permitted to acquire water from other sources. Zone 7 conducts
an annual review of its water supply reliability and projects that between 2015 and 2020 demand
could exceed the available supply.
4.6.1	       ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
     A.	 Guiding Policy
     1.	 Base General Plan proposals on the assumption that water supplies will be sufficient and that
         local wells could be used to supplement imported water if necessary.
     B.	 Implementing Policy
     1.	 Consider obtaining water service from the East Bay Municipal Utility District and other
         sources.
4.7	         ALAMEDA COUNTY HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT
	PLAN	
The management of hazardous waste generated by our highly technological society has become one
of the leading concerns of the City of Dublin. AB 2948 (Tanner, 1986) was signed into law requiring
that each county adopt a County Hazardous Waste Management Plan and requiring that each city
incorporate the county plan into their general plans within a specified time period. The Alameda
County Hazardous Waste Management Plan addresses the requirements of AB 2948 by conducting
a planning process to develop a hazardous waste management program meeting Alameda County’s
projected needs and complying with state law; establishing goals and policies pertaining to the
hierarchy of hazardous waste management strategies; and, creating a set of criteria for the siting of
expanded or new offsite hazardous waste facilities.

4.7.1 	      ALL PLANNING AREAS 	
   A.	 Guiding Policies
   1.	 The City of Dublin shall encourage the reduction or elimination of hazardous waste at the
        source site as the highest priority in the management of hazardous waste.
   2.	 The City of Dublin shall make provisions for the location of offsite hazardous waste facilities
        in its community which meet the fair share needs of the City of Dublin and of Alameda
        County.
   B.	 Implementing Policies
   1.	 The goals, policies, facility siting criteria and other provisions of the Alameda County
        Hazardous Waste Management Plan are incorporated herein by reference subject to the
        following provisions to the locational criteria of the Plan:
             a.	 Facilities for the land disposal of hazardous waste or treatment residues are prohibited
                 in the City of Dublin.
             b.	 SmallScale Transfer and Storage facilities shall include household hazardous waste
                 collection facilities.
             c.	 To assure that future and existing residential populations are adequately considered,
                 the criteria for distances from facilities permitted by the Plan shall be from the
                 facilities to residential designated property.
             d.	 To assure that facilities are appropriately located with regard to major transportation
                 routes, all sites for off-site hazardous waste facilities shall be directly served by streets
                 meeting the City’s industrial road standards and shall be accessible via Arterial streets
                 as defined by the General Plan.
             e.	 To provide an adequate level of public service and to assure an adequate margin of
                 public safety, all facilities shall be adequately served by necessary public services as
                 specified by the Plan and shall be within a three (3) minute response time from the
                 nearest fire station.
             f.	 To assure proper land use compatibility and adequate proximity to the waste
                 generation stream, all off-site hazardous waste facilities shall be located in areas
                 designated Business Park/Industrial: Outdoor Storage, Business Park/Industrial: Low
                 Coverage, or Industrial Park on the General Plan Land Use Map (Figure 1-1).
   2.	 A violation of Zoning Ordinance Chapter 8.60, HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES LOCATION
        PROCEDURE, pertaining to the Alameda County Hazardous Waste Management Plan is
        deemed to be a violation of the Dublin General Plan. The General Plan determines that the
        implementation of the Alameda County Hazardous Waste Management Plan through the
        guiding and implementing policies of the General Plan and by means of Chapter 8.60 of the
        Zoning Ordinance is necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
