region by income category. The objective of the
redistribution is to "avoid further impaction of
localities with relatively high proportions of
lower-income households" (Gov. Code Sec.
65584). To generate the figures, ABAG
averaged existing city percentages in each
income category with the existing county and
regional percentages. The housing need in each
income category is obtained from an average of
existing percentages of each category in Orinda,
Contra Costa County and the nine-county bay
area. For example, the percentage of very low-
income households at each geographical scale
(city-county-region) is averaged to identify the
percentage need for very low-income housing
units out of the total need identified.
Because the State of California has declared
that local governments have a responsibility to
facilitate the improvement and development of
housing for all economic segments of the
community, the analysis of existing and
projected housing needs is defined in four
categories: very low income (0 to 50 percent of
median income); low income (50 to 80 percent);
moderate income (80 to 120 percent); and above
moderate income (above 120 percent).
In Orinda, those income categories translate
into the following incomes for a family of four,
based on incomes in Contra Costa County, 1990,
as defined by the U.S. Dept. of Housing and
Urban Development and based on a median
income of $44,100:
Very Low Income         less than $22,500
Lower Income            $22,501 to $35,300

3 . 3 . 8 Status of Existing Assisted Housing
State housing statutes adopted in 1989
(Chapter 1451) requires all housing elements to
address by January 1, 1991 the potential
conversion      of   existing   assisted-housing
development to non-low-income housing use. As
discussed in Section 3.2.4 of the Updated
Housing Element, Orinda has one assisted-
housing development, known as Senior Village,
which currently has a 20-year fixed subsidy, as
well as fixed bylaws requiring that it continue
to provide low and very-low income housing for
seniors and disabled persons. These conditions
are sufficient safeguards that these existing
assisted-housing units will not be converted to
market-rate dwellings within the time period
defined by the General Plan.
3 . 3 . 9 Consistency with General Plan and
Appropriateness of the Goals, Objectives
and Policies
The 1990 Updated Housing Element does not
represent a change from the goals of the
General Plan, nor a change from goals defined
in the 1987 Housing Element. Changes to
housing policies and objectives contained in this
document are considered to be minor relative to
the 1987 Housing Element. Such changes are
furthermore considered to be consistent with
the provisions of all other elements of the
current Orinda General Plan, and plans for
congestion management, the Zoning Ordinance,
and capital improvement programs. As stated
ORINDA GENERAL PLAN 5/20/87                                                                     38

4 . 3 . 1 Noise Element: Guiding Policies
A. Where practical, mitigate traffic noise to
       acceptable levels.
B. Prevent unnecessary noise from all sources.
4 . 3 . 2 Noise Element: Implementing
Policies
A. Require an acoustical study and any
       necessary noise level mitigation where new
       residential or commercial development is
       proposed along Highway 24 corridor and
       adjacent tomajor arterials where projected
       noise contours are 60 Ldn or more.
B. Review all multi-family development
       proposals within the projected 60 Ldn
       contour for compliance with noise standards
       (45 Ldn in any habitable room) as required
       by State law.
C. Develop ordinance to limit noise created by
       temporary activities such as building
       construction to the shortest duration
       possible, and to daytime hours wherever
       possible. All reasonable noise mitigation
       measures would be used.
D. Incorporate appropriate noise mitigation in
       Gateway Valley road designs w h e r e
       exisiting     or     planned       residential
       development would be affected.
E. Encourage owners of homes subject to traffic
       noise nuisance to install noise installation
       and to make design modifications t h a t
       would improve the noise environment.
       Consider providing technical advice.
F. Adopt a comprehensive noise ordinance.

As indicated in Table 5.1, all signalized Orinda
intersections are designated either "Suburban"
or "Central Business District".
